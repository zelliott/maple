We describe methods based on zzso class analysis for analysis and interpretation of agreement on zzso diagnostic zzso This approach zzso agreement in terms of parameters directly related to diagnostic accuracy and leads to many practical applications, such as zzso of the accuracy of individual ratings and the extent to which accuracy may improve with multiple zzso We describe refinements in the zzso of parameters for varying panel designs, and apply zzso class methods successfully to examples of medical agreement data that include data previously found to be poorly fitted by zzso zzso zzso class techniques provide a powerful and flexible set of tools to zzso diagnostic agreement and one should consider them routinely in the analysis of such zzso
