Nowadays, the increasing use of group elevator control systems zzso to increasing building heights makes the development of zzso zzso necessary in terms of time and energy zzso Although there are many studies in the literature about this topic, they are still not effective enough because they are not able to evaluate all features of zzso In this paper, a new approach of immune zzso optimal estimate is studied for dynamic control of group elevator zzso The method is mainly based on zzso of optimal way by zzso all calls with zzso immune system and DNA computing zzso and it is evaluated with a fuzzy zzso The system has a dynamic feature in terms of the situation of calls and the option of the most appropriate algorithm, and it also zzso works in terms of parameters such as the number of floors and zzso This new approach which provides both time and energy saving was carried out in real zzso The experimental results comparatively demonstrate the effects of zzso With dynamic and zzso control approach in this study carried out, a significant progress on group elevator control systems has been achieved in terms of time and energy efficiency according to traditional zzso
