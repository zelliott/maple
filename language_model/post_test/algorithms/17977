Numerous studies have focused on changes in the activity in the zzso and higher association areas with consolidation and memory zzso Even though zzso areas are engaged in memory recall, little is known about how memory stabilization is reflected in those zzso Using zzso zzso we investigated changes in visual areas with memory zzso zzso were trained on zzso a face to one of eight zzso The first set of associations zzso was learned in three sessions distributed over a zzso The second set zzso was learned in one session just prior to the zzso zzso In the recall session only the face was presented and subjects had to indicate the correct location using a zzso The zzso data revealed robust gamma activity during recall, which started in early visual zzso and zzso to higher visual and zzso brain zzso The zzso gamma power was higher for the zzso than the stabilized condition zzso zzso Also the zzso field strength was higher during recall of zzso than stabilized associations zzso zzso We propose that recall of the spatial associations prior to memory stabilization involves a zzso process relying on reconstructing learned representations in visual zzso This process is reflected in gamma band activity consistent with the notion that zzso synchronization in the gamma band is required for visual zzso More direct synaptic connections are formed with memory stabilization, thus decreasing the dependence on visual zzso
