zzso A study was made of the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the two components of evoked zzso release, namely the fast zzso and the slow zzso zzso from the giant zzso terminal of the chick zzso zzso The zzso zzso currents zzso were recorded under zzso zzso clamp of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso time constant of the slow component was prolonged by replacing zzso with zzso In 5 zzso zzso the fast component decayed with a time constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the slow component decayed with a time constant of 19 zzso 7 zzso zzso When zzso with twin zzso with a short zzso zzso the fast component of the second zzso was often depressed whereas the slow component was usually zzso Both components were positively dependent on zzso in a zzso manner, but the fast component approached its maximum at a lower zzso than the slow zzso zzso zzso zzso both the fast and slow components to a similar extent and with a similar time zzso For each zzso the effect of zzso was less potent at high zzso than at low zzso For either the fast or the slow component the zzso zzso was accompanied by a reduction in the zzso ratio zzso zzso Despite the different zzso constant for zzso zzso the fluorescent ratio for zzso zzso zzso decayed to the baseline after the zzso zzso with a time course similar to that for zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso less efficiently than zzso zzso did not increase the zzso zzso produced by stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that protein zzso C zzso zzso both the fast and slow components through common molecular mechanisms that zzso the zzso sensitivity of the zzso fusion zzso
