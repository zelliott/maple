The nuclear magnetic resonance zzso chemical shift exquisitely describes the chemical environment of the atoms in a zzso Here we describe methods that zzso this information as an experimental probe to match zzso zzso zzso single quantum zzso zzso zzso of zzso unknown compounds to a database of known zzso We implemented and compared two different approaches for similarity searching of zzso zzso According to our findings, our new discrete zzso differential evolution method performs better than the previously published shifted grid, multiple resolution zzso The new method is provided in detail and comparisons have been performed for a set of zzso zzso The similarity comparison involves a zzso matching of different zzso followed by a selection criterion and ranking to establish a level of zzso
