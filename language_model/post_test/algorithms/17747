Biological networks are a topic of great current interest, particularly with the publication of a number of large zzso interaction zzso They are globally characterized by a variety of zzso statistics, such as the degree distribution, zzso zzso characteristic path length and zzso Moreover, real protein networks are quite complex and can often be divided into many zzso through systematic selection of different zzso and zzso For instance, proteins can be zzso by expression level, zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary structure and zzso A challenging research question is to compare the zzso of zzso networks, looking for global differences associated with different types of zzso zzso is an automated web tool designed to address this question, calculating and comparing zzso characteristics for different zzso derived from any given protein zzso It provides reasonable solutions to the calculation of network statistics for zzso embedded within a larger network and gives simplified views of a zzso of interest, allowing one to navigate through zzso After constructing zzso we applied it to the interaction networks and protein classes currently available for zzso We were able to find a number of potential biological zzso In particular, we found that soluble proteins had more interactions than membrane zzso Moreover, amongst soluble zzso those that were highly zzso had many polar zzso zzso and had many alpha zzso tended to have the most interaction zzso Interestingly, zzso also turned up some systematic biases in the current zzso interaction zzso on average, proteins with a known functional zzso had many more interaction partners than those zzso This phenomenon may reflect the incompleteness of the zzso determined zzso interaction zzso
