The aim of this study was to investigate the independent effect of zzso on the approximate zzso zzso in zzso zzso The authors investigated which montages were relevant to assess the zzso effect on the zzso zzso edge frequency and the zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers were zzso With recording of the electroencephalogram at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was infused at the rate of zzso mug zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The relation between zzso concentration and the zzso parameters were tested by zzso zzso zzso ratio, artifact zzso zzso of variation of the median baseline and zzso zzso effects, and ratio of average zzso zzso effect to zzso baseline zzso were zzso The performance of zzso as an index of zzso effect site zzso was tested by prediction zzso 

Approximate zzso showed significant correlation (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso zzso It provided comparable zzso ratio, artifact zzso and ratio of average zzso zzso effect to zzso baseline zzso to zzso spectral edge zzso The zzso of variation of the median baseline and zzso zzso graphic effects were smallest in zzso zzso montages showed higher ratios of average zzso zzso effect to zzso baseline zzso for all zzso parameters and lower zzso of variation of the baseline values for zzso and zzso spectral edge frequency than frontal zzso The prediction probability of zzso was zzso 

Approximate zzso derived from a zzso montage is appropriate for the assessment of the zzso effect on the zzso
