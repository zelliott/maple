A zzso registration method is proposed for registering a normal brain zzso with images of brain tumor zzso The registration is facilitated by first simulating the tumor mass effect in the normal zzso in order to create an zzso image that is as similar as possible to the patient's zzso An zzso framework is used to zzso the location of tumor seed as well as other parameters of the tumor growth model, based on the pattern of deformation around the tumor zzso In particular, the zzso is implemented in a zzso and zzso zzso and it is accelerated by using a principal component analysis zzso model of tumor growth and mass effect, trained on a zzso more expensive zzso zzso zzso on simulated and real images shows that the proposed registration zzso referred to as zzso zzso of tumor parameters and registration of brain images with zzso zzso other available registration methods particularly for the regions close to the zzso and it has the potential to assist in constructing statistical zzso from zzso brain zzso
