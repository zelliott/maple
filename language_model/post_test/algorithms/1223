Thirty horses were filmed with a panning camera operating at 50 zzso as they jumped over a zzso zzso zzso m zzso The markers of 9 zzso on the horse and 7 zzso on the rider were tracked in zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso of gravity and moment of inertia of each segment were calculated using a geometric zzso and a zzso model, zzso The kinetic moment of each part of the horse was calculated after zzso and zzso of zzso This method showed the relative contribution of each body segment to the body overall rotation during the zzso jump and landing zzso It was found that the zzso zzso and zzso had the greatest zzso The coordination between the motion of the body segments allowed the horse to control its angular speed of rotation over the zzso This remained nearly constant during the airborne phase zzso zzso 5 zzso During the airborne phase, the kinetic moment was constant because its value was equal to the moment of the external forces zzso zzso 125 zzso zzso zzso
