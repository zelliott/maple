This letter introduces an zzso for automatic detection of zzso whale zzso zzso This method searches for frequency features of zzso without calculating the continuous zzso of the data, thereby reducing zzso zzso The detector has been tested on 8 h of acoustic data recorded at the Station zzso zzso Observatory in March zzso This zzso was previously analyzed using the zzso detector of zzso and was verified by a human zzso as reported in zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison of results indicates that the detector introduced here generates fewer false alarms, and it recognizes zzso calls that are missed by zzso
