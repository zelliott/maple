A DNA primary sequence is a string consisting of letters on an alphabet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on all of the zzso of the set zzso here the repetition is allowed, we transform a DNA primary sequence into a special sequence over a set with zzso zzso With the zzso zzso we associate 10 zzso zzso sequences and then derive a zzso zzso by means of a weighted zzso which can reflect the information on elements of a sequence and, especially, the order relation among zzso The new quantitative characterization of DNA sequences is sensitive to substitution of the string zzso The examination of the relationship among zzso genes of 15 species illustrates the utility of the proposed zzso
