A zzso zzso method in the inverse problem of electrical zzso zzso zzso often results in a smooth distribution zzso with which we can barely make a clear separation between the inclusions and zzso The recently popular total variation zzso method including the lagged zzso zzso method can sharpen the edges, and is robust to noise in a small convergence zzso zzso in this paper, we propose a novel zzso method combining the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we clarify the zzso details of the zzso zzso and combined methods in two-dimensional open zzso by performing the current injection and zzso measurement on one boundary of the imaging zzso Next, we introduce a weighted zzso to the zzso zzso method aiming to explore the effect of the weighted zzso on the resolution and quality of reconstruction images with the inclusion at different zzso Then, we analyze the performance of these zzso with noisy zzso Finally, we evaluate the effect of the current injection pattern on reconstruction quality and propose a modified current injection zzso results indicate that the combined zzso zzso with stable convergence is able to improve the reconstruction quality with sharp contrast and more robust to noise in comparison to the zzso and zzso zzso methods zzso In addition, the results show that the current injection pattern with a bigger driver angle leads to a better reconstruction zzso
