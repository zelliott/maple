Dedicated breast CT zzso is an emerging technology with the potential to improve the detection of breast cancer in screening and diagnostic zzso Typically, the zzso volume reconstructed from the scanner is displayed as zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of section thickness on the zzso of simulated masses using a zzso matched filter zzso as a model zzso 

A breast CT scanner has been designed and zzso in the zzso laboratory with more than 200 women zzso in zzso phase I and phase II trials to zzso Of these, 151 bilateral data sets were selected on the basis of low artifact content, sufficient breast coverage, and excluding cases with breast zzso zzso breast density ratings were available for 144 of these zzso zzso mass zzso of diameter 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, and 15 zzso were zzso generated and embedded at random locations within the zzso region of each zzso zzso zzso were not simulated in this zzso For each viewing plane zzso zzso and zzso and section thickness zzso from zzso to 44 zzso section images of the breast zzso containing the zzso were generated from the reconstructed zzso data sets by averaging zzso over the length of the zzso Using signal known exactly zzso model observer methodology, receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis was performed on each generated projected image using a zzso based model zzso zzso zzso were generated for each breast data set, and the area under the zzso curve zzso was evaluated as well as the sensitivity at zzso zzso 

For all zzso sizes, performance rises modestly to a peak before falling off substantially as section thickness increases over the range of the zzso We find that the optimal section thickness tracks the size of the zzso to be detected zzso with a small positive offset and slopes ranging from zzso to zzso No significant differences were observed between left and right zzso Performance measures are zzso correlated with measures of breast density, with an average correlation zzso of zzso for the zzso breast density score and zzso for the proportion of zzso tissue in the breast zzso 

This study shows zzso how zzso detection performance of a known zzso size is influenced by section thickness in dedicated breast zzso While the optimal section thickness is tuned to the size of the zzso being zzso overall performance is more robust for thin section images compared to thicker zzso
