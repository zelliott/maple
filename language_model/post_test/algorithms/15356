zzso zzso of adults and adolescents suffer from irritable zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction which may reflect in altered zzso Currently, the diagnosis of zzso is made through expensive invasive zzso and zzso zzso However these are inconvenient and zzso for community zzso zzso sounds zzso can be easily recorded with zzso and low-cost zzso Recently, several researchers have pointed out changes in features obtained from zzso according to the pathological condition of zzso zzso However a widely accepted, simple automatic zzso detection zzso still has to be found, and the appropriate recording period needs to be investigated for further evaluation of zzso zzso In this study we propose a novel simple automatic method to detect the zzso based on the zzso bandwidth of the frequency zzso in the zzso moving average zzso We use the measure, zzso zzso zzso obtained by the proposed method, to capture zzso zzso In this paper, we show that the proposed method for automatic detection could achieve a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and area under the curve of zzso when working on 16 healthy volunteers during zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the measured zzso averaged over a period of zzso can clearly capture zzso zzso Our findings should have the potential to contribute toward developing automated zzso diagnosis of zzso
