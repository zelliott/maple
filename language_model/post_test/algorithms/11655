zzso is a new method for zzso folding of zzso zzso The program takes into account local zzso stem energy, and zzso to produce the common zzso It can handle all zzso types, and has also been adapted to align a new zzso sequence along a reference structured zzso 

Using different data sets, we show that zzso provides a good partial prediction for a wide range of sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with only two zzso In presence of a whole family of zzso we also show that zzso can be used to detect whether the sequences actually share the same zzso 

zzso is available at the zzso
