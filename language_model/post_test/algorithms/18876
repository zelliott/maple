zzso of zzso zzso of molecular weight zzso Da from a size exclusion zzso column packed with zzso zzso zzso of three different nominal sizes zzso zzso has been zzso The pore sizes of the three types of zzso were evaluated based on the mean zzso times of the zzso zzso that decreased directly zzso to the increased zzso of the molecular mass of a standard zzso and increased as zzso size zzso The corresponding exclusion limits for types zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A one-dimensional zzso model described the effective zzso zzso of the zzso through the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso and zzso transit times through the zzso interior were evaluated by a dual zzso zzso For small molecules of molecular mass zzso zzso zzso zzso dominated transport mechanisms at fast moving zzso For comparatively larger zzso diffusion barrier existed to limit zzso supply to the zzso The size exclusion test provided zzso zzso transport characteristics using detailed analysis on the zzso zzso
