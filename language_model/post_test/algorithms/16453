A systematic review of the scientific literature on relationships between management practices used on dairy farms and zzso zzso cell count zzso was undertaken to distinguish those management practices that have been consistently shown to be associated with zzso SCC from those lacking evidence of zzso zzso literature was identified using a combination of database searches zzso zzso zzso zzso and Web of zzso and zzso screening of zzso To be included in the review, a manuscript had to be published after 1979 in French, English, or zzso study design had to be other than case report or case series; zzso studied had to be composed of zzso 40 milking cows producing on average zzso zzso of milk in zzso zzso interventions studied had to be management practices applied at the zzso level and used as zzso health control zzso and SCC had to be measured using electronic cell counting zzso The 36 manuscripts selected were mainly zzso zzso zzso 8 manuscripts dealt exclusively with automatic milking systems and 4 with management of calves and zzso and its effect on SCC in early zzso zzso Most practices having consistent associations with SCC were related to milking zzso wearing gloves during zzso using automatic zzso using zzso zzso zzso milking problem cows last, yearly inspection of the milking system, and use of a technique to keep cows standing following zzso all were consistently associated with lower zzso zzso Other practices associated with lower SCC were the use of a zzso system, sand zzso cleaning the calving pen after each zzso surveillance of zzso zzso for zzso use of blanket zzso therapy, zzso zzso zzso zzso hair management, and frequent use of the California zzso zzso Regarding SCC of zzso most of the consistent associations reported were related to interventions made during the zzso zzso Studies on automatic milking systems have frequently reported zzso of the zzso SCC following transition to the new zzso These zzso seemed to be zzso both by the lack of monitoring of chronically infected cows and by an elevated zzso of zzso zzso By assembling the results reported in many different studies, this review generates a more comprehensive understanding of the management practices influencing SCC and highlights areas of SCC control knowledge that lack evidence of zzso
