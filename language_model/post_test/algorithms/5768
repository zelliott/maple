Although artificial neural networks have taken their inspiration from natural neurological systems, they have largely ignored the genetic basis of neural zzso Indeed, evolutionary approaches have mainly assumed that neural learning is associated with the adjustment of synaptic zzso The goal of this paper is to use evolutionary approaches to find suitable zzso functions that are analogous to natural zzso of biological zzso and demonstrate that intelligent behavior can be produced as a result of this additional biological zzso Our model allows zzso zzso and zzso branches to grow or die so that synaptic zzso can change and affect information processing while solving a zzso zzso The zzso model of a zzso consists of a collection of seven zzso zzso distinct zzso functions inside the zzso Since the equivalent zzso functions of neural components are very complex and in some cases unknown, we have used a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian genetic programming zzso to obtain these zzso We start with a small random network of zzso zzso and zzso that develops during problem solving by repeatedly executing the seven zzso programs that have been found by zzso We have evaluated the learning potential of this system in the context of a well-known single agent learning problem, known as zzso zzso We also examined the harder problem of learning in a competitive environment for two zzso agents, in which both agents are controlled by independent zzso zzso networks zzso Our results show that the agents exhibit interesting learning zzso
