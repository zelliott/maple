The lack of trustworthy sensors makes development of Advanced Driver Assistance System zzso applications a tough zzso It is necessary to develop intelligent systems by combining reliable sensors and real-time zzso to send the proper, accurate messages to the zzso In this article, an application to detect and predict the movement of zzso in order to prevent an imminent collision has been developed and tested under real zzso The proposed application, first, accurately measures the position of obstacles using a zzso hybrid fusion approach: a stereo camera vision system and a laser zzso Second, it correctly identifies zzso using intelligent zzso based on zzso and pattern recognition related to leg positions zzso zzso and dense disparity maps and zzso disparity zzso zzso Third, it uses statistical validation gates and confidence regions to track the pedestrian within the detection zones of the sensors and predict their position in the upcoming zzso The intelligent sensor application has been zzso tested with success while tracking zzso that cross and move in zzso fashion in front of a zzso
