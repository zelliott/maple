We assessed the specificity of wide zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso left bundle branch block zzso and heart zzso 

Three hundred zzso patients with zzso devices were zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso rhythm were used as a surrogate for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso lead II zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso ratio in zzso zzso zzso zzso Griffith, and zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso had a lower specificity zzso in patients with zzso than in general zzso zzso The zzso lead II criterion and zzso zzso had higher specificity than other zzso zzso zzso zzso Several of the single criteria zzso of an zzso complex in zzso through zzso initial R wave in zzso zzso zzso 1 in zzso had zzso of zzso to zzso 

In patients with heart failure and zzso an zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso should be based on selected, specific criteria rather than on zzso zzso
