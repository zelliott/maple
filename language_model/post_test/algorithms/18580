A novel method is presented for the quantitative flexible zzso of high-resolution structure into zzso maps of zzso complexes from electron zzso This method uses a linear combination of zzso normal modes from elastic network description of the molecular framework in an zzso manner to zzso the structure zzso to conform to the zzso electron density zzso The methodology zzso zzso following techniques in collective normal modes to locally zzso the overall correlation zzso between zzso and measured electron zzso To evaluate the performance of our approach, several zzso which undergo large zzso changes, have been zzso We demonstrate that refinement based on normal mode analysis provides an accurate and fast alternative for the flexible fitting of high-resolution structure into a zzso density zzso Additionally, we show that lower resolution zzso structural models can be used for the normal mode searching in lieu of fully atomic models with little loss of overall zzso
