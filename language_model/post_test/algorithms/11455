zzso in body composition may lead to zzso in estimates of zzso zzso rate zzso derived from serum zzso Our aims were to examine the relationship between zzso and zzso and body composition measures and zzso zzso 

We analyzed data from a zzso study zzso zzso randomly selected zzso zzso The zzso of Diet in Renal Disease zzso and zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso equations were used to calculate zzso from zzso serum zzso Body mass index and body surface area were calculated from measured height and zzso Body composition was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso strength measured by a hand-held zzso zzso analysis was used to examine the association between zzso and other zzso 

In women, zzso determined by the zzso equation was zzso associated with height zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso lean mass percentage zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso strength zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso calculated using the zzso equation was zzso associated with zzso strength zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In men, there was an inverse association between zzso by the zzso equation and lean mass percentage zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso strength zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and between zzso by the zzso equation and lean mass percentage zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso for these variables was zzso 

The inverse relationship between zzso and measures of lean mass percentage and zzso strength suggests that incorporation of these variables might improve zzso prediction from serum zzso in the general zzso This effect appears to be small however and needs to be examined in studies that include measured zzso
