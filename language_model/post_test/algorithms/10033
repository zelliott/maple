zzso is a dynamic zzso technique that has been widely used in clinical trials for achieving a balance of zzso factors across treatment groups, but most often it has been used in the setting of equal treatment zzso Although unequal treatment allocation is frequently encountered in clinical trials, an appropriate zzso procedure for such trials has not been zzso The purpose of this paper is to present novel strategies for applying zzso methodology to such clinical zzso Two zzso techniques are proposed and compared by probability calculation and simulation zzso In the first method, called zzso zzso probability assignment is based on a simple modification of the original zzso algorithm, which does not account for unequal allocation zzso In the second method, called zzso zzso zzso probability assignment is based on allocation ratios and zzso to achieve an zzso target allocation zzso The performance of the two methods is investigated in various trial settings including different number of treatments, zzso factors and sample zzso The relative merits of the different distance metrics are also zzso On the basis of the results, we conclude that zzso is the preferable method for zzso in clinical trials involving unequal treatment zzso The choice of different distance metrics slightly affects the performance of the zzso and may be zzso according to the specific feature of zzso
