Human zzso movements in space are the result of combined motions of the zzso and the zzso They can be simultaneously monitored by an zzso recording technique via markers at different locations on the zzso and on the zzso zzso can be attached to the teeth or to the facial zzso zzso movements relative to the head can be calculated by one- or three-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso mathematical compensation for head zzso The present study zzso zzso and associated head movements during zzso jaw zzso tasks in 10 healthy subjects using a wireless zzso zzso movement recording zzso The study aimed to: zzso estimate the soft tissue related displacement of zzso markers at different locations on the zzso zzso compare zzso with zzso mathematical compensation for associated head zzso zzso evaluate the influence of marker location on the recorded head and zzso movement zzso and zzso compare zzso markers with zzso markers with regard to zzso estimates of recorded zzso and head zzso zzso were attached to the upper and lower zzso and to the skin of the forehead, zzso zzso and zzso Soft tissue related displacement of zzso markers varied between zzso The displacement for the chin marker was larger than that of other zzso The least displacement was found for the zzso zzso However, relative to zzso and head movements, respectively, the displacement of the chin marker was of the same order as that of the zzso zzso The zzso estimates were not significantly affected by displacement of the zzso zzso zzso at different locations on the head and the zzso registered different zzso The zzso movement patterns calculated by zzso and zzso compensation were not zzso It is concluded that markers attached to the chin and the zzso can be reliably used in zzso analyses of zzso and head movements during zzso jaw zzso With certain limitations, they are acceptable for spatial zzso zzso of method of marker attachment, marker location, and method of compensation for associated head movements should be based on the aim of the zzso
