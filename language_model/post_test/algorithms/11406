We propose a new method of zzso reconstructing zzso data formed by zzso with an zzso size several tens of zzso smaller than the zzso limit, implemented with an interference microscope and a zzso image pattern matching zzso We examine the size dependency of the data reconstruction capacity using a light propagation simulation based on the zzso zzso zzso method and the zzso spatial frequency filtering zzso We demonstrated that the zzso size of the zzso zzso depends on the magnitude of zzso
