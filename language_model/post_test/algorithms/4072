zzso zzso is associated with a high zzso complexity, which limits its use as a real-time method in many zzso In this paper, we present an zzso of the zzso zzso that exhibits zzso performance when applied in a typical cardiac ultrasound imaging zzso To achieve this performance, we make use of the parallel processing power found in modern graphics processing units zzso combined with zzso processing to reduce the zzso complexity as the number of array elements zzso For a three-dimensional zzso we show that processing rates supporting real-time cardiac ultrasound imaging are possible, meaning that images can be processed faster than the image acquisition rate for a wide range of zzso Image quality is investigated in an in zzso cardiac data zzso These results show that zzso zzso is feasible for cardiac ultrasound imaging, providing images with improved lateral resolution both in zzso and zzso
