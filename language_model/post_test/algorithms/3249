zzso kidney disease zzso is increasingly being recognized as an emerging public health problem in zzso However, community based estimates of low zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso are zzso zzso of traditional serum zzso based zzso zzso equations in South Asian subjects is also zzso We intended to estimate and compare the prevalence of low zzso zzso and associated risk factors in North India using zzso zzso and zzso of Diet In Renal Disease zzso zzso 

A community based, zzso study involving zzso random cluster sampling was done in Delhi and its surrounding zzso Adults zzso or zzso 20 years were zzso zzso and zzso equations were used to estimate zzso zzso Low zzso was defined as zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was assessed using visually read zzso zzso ratios, crude and zzso were calculated to ascertain associations between zzso zzso zzso and risk zzso 

The study population had zzso males and zzso zzso The mean age for low zzso subjects was 54 zzso The zzso prevalence of low zzso was zzso by zzso equation and zzso by zzso zzso The prevalence estimates of zzso equation were lower across gender and age groups when compared with zzso equation zzso There was a strong correlation but poor agreement between zzso estimates of two zzso The survey population had a zzso prevalence of zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso age above 60 years, female zzso low educational status, increased waist zzso hypertension and diabetes were associated with low zzso Similar factors were also associated with zzso Only zzso of subjects with zzso impairment were aware of their zzso 

The prevalence of low zzso in North India is probably higher than previous zzso There is a significant difference between zzso estimates derived from zzso and zzso zzso These equations may not be useful in zzso zzso zzso zzso equations validated for South Asian populations are needed before reliable estimates of zzso prevalence can be zzso zzso then, primary prevention and management targeted at zzso risk factors must play a critical role in controlling rising zzso zzso zzso analysis of targeted screening programs is zzso
