A detailed analysis of the relationship between the duration of the chirped probe pulse and the bipolar zzso zzso pulse length in the spectral zzso technique is carried zzso We prove that there is an optimal chirped probe pulse length (or an optimal zzso rate of the chirped probe zzso matched to the input zzso pulse length and derive a rigorous relationship between zzso We find that only under this restricted condition the zzso signal can be correctly zzso
