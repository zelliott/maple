The secondary structure of human zzso from normal donors and from bovine and zzso plasma was studied by zzso transform zzso zzso and a quantitative analysis of its secondary structure was zzso For this purpose, a previously experimented spectrum zzso procedure based on the use of the zzso zzso zzso Algorithm with the addition of suitable constraints was applied to the analysis of zzso zzso zzso This procedure was applied to zzso I and III analysis of bovine and zzso zzso obtained zzso and to zzso III analysis of human zzso zzso The analysis of both zzso I and III in the first case was useful in order to test the reliability of the zzso We found zzso zzso and human zzso to contain about zzso zzso zzso I and III components at zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso respectively), zzso zzso zzso I and III components at zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso turns zzso I and III components at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The precision of the quantitative determination depends on the amount of these structures in the zzso zzso the zzso of variation is zzso zzso for percentage values of zzso I and III components zzso 15 and zzso zzso The good agreement of our quantitative data, obtained separately by zzso I and zzso III analysis, and consistent with a previous zzso (from commercial zzso study that reports only information about zzso zzso content obtained by factor analysis, leads us to believe that the amounts of secondary structures found zzso zzso and zzso are zzso
