This report investigates the power issue in applying the zzso linkage analysis of affected zzso zzso zzso and Lander, zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso to zzso genes that contribute to human longevity using zzso zzso Data were simulated by introducing a recently developed statistical model for measuring zzso associations zzso et zzso zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso enabling direct power comparison between linkage and association zzso The zzso linkage zzso scores estimated in the region harboring the zzso zzso are evaluated to assess the statistical power for different genetic zzso frequency and zzso and zzso parameters under various sampling schemes zzso and sample zzso Based on the zzso survival function, we derived a zzso calculation as an overall measurement for the effect of zzso genes with different zzso settings so that the power can be compared for different modes zzso zzso of zzso Our results show that the zzso approach is a powerful tool in mapping very strong effect zzso both dominant and zzso To map a rare dominant genetic variation that reduces hazard of death by half, a large sample (above 600 zzso with at least one extremely zzso (over age zzso zzso in each pair is zzso Again, with large sample size and high age zzso the method is able to zzso zzso genes with relatively small effects, but the power is very limited in case of a dominant zzso Although the power issue may depend heavily on the true genetic nature in maintaining survival, our study suggests that results from small-scale zzso investigations should be referred with caution, given the complexity of human zzso
