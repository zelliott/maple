zzso zzso is frequently used to study zzso interactions and spatial relationships between zzso and zzso or zzso in zzso Based on zzso images, quantitative zzso analysis can provide valuable information about cellular zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and location of zzso However, such analyses should be performed carefully, because quantitative zzso parameters have different interpretations and can be highly affected by image zzso We use quantitative three-dimensional zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso images to study the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and their zzso with early zzso Two zzso that form zzso with highly different zzso zzso are zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso and the intensity correlation zzso are estimated to determine the zzso zzso of zzso free zzso and free zzso zzso are observed in the amount of zzso and in the zzso pathways and rates of zzso for the two zzso The results support previous findings that zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso are more favorable for cellular zzso and zzso trafficking to the nucleus compared with zzso formed by linear zzso
