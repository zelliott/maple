A new fault detection and diagnosis zzso problem via the output probability density functions zzso for zzso zzso distribution systems zzso is zzso The zzso can be zzso by zzso basis functions zzso neural zzso Different from conventional zzso problems, the measured information for zzso is the output zzso zzso and the zzso variables involved are not confined to zzso zzso A zzso neural network technique is proposed so that the output zzso can be formulated in terms of the dynamic zzso of the zzso neural zzso In this work, a zzso zzso zzso fault detection and diagnosis zzso is presented by introducing the tuning zzso so that the residual is as sensitive as possible to the zzso zzso and zzso analysis is performed in fault detection and fault diagnosis analysis for the error dynamic zzso At last, an illustrated example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and satisfactory results have been zzso
