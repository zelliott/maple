zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks and zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks were used as zzso material for zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso by a double emulsion method was found to depend on the swelling behavior of the zzso in water and decreased from zzso for zzso with a degree of swelling of less than zzso to zzso for zzso zzso with a degree of swelling of zzso The particle size could be controlled by varying the concentration of the zzso solution used in the zzso zzso An increase in the zzso concentration resulted in a zzso increase in the particle zzso The in zzso release profiles of the zzso model protein zzso could be precisely tailored by variation of the zzso composition and the size of the zzso Both a slow continuous release of zzso and a fast release which was completed within a few days could be zzso The release behavior, attributed to a combination of diffusion and zzso degradation, could be described by a previously developed zzso
