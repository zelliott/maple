To develop a formula to predict a patient's need for laser in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Northwestern zzso Vision Center, Department of zzso Northwestern University, zzso School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, zzso 

In this retrospective study, charts of patients who received zzso with the zzso Star zzso laser for zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso enhancement was performed in 130 of zzso zzso zzso such as age, zzso zzso power, power and axis of zzso and surgeon factor were compared in patients who required zzso and those who did zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to determine a formula for the probability of enhancement zzso 

Age zzso zzso zzso sphere zzso and surgeon zzso were the statistically significant factors for predicting zzso The zzso formula derived from these factors had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and positive and negative zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso 

Older age, higher zzso zzso sphere, and surgeon significantly influenced a patient's likelihood for zzso zzso A formula based on these zzso factors helps to more accurately predict the need for zzso
