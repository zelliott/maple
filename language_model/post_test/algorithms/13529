The purpose of this prospective zzso study was to investigate the course of serum calcium zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso to establish a reliable and cost-effective strategic zzso to detect patients at risk for zzso zzso 

This zzso study included 136 zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were preoperatively and zzso recorded 6, 12, 20, and 48 h zzso after skin zzso zzso for zzso were zzso zzso levels zzso zzso at any time point and/or patients experiencing symptoms of zzso zzso zzso supplementation was never given before zzso zzso zzso levels and their differences between time points were zzso 

zzso percent of patients experienced zzso At zzso and zzso the rates of patients with zzso levels zzso zzso were similar and larger than at zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso difference had the best area under the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a difference zzso was significantly more frequent in case of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the difference zzso were consequently selected to design a new zzso for zzso zzso Adding zzso zzso in some specific cases zzso % of all included zzso enabled 100 % zzso zzso zzso were not zzso in detecting zzso 

This new zzso zzso with 100 % sensitivity and zzso % zzso early detection of severe zzso after zzso zzso It may become a useful and cost-effective tool for safe and early patient zzso especially if zzso zzso cannot be routinely used because of their availability or zzso
