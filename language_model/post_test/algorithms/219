zzso sitting is one of the first zzso motor milestones achieved by zzso and sitting zzso sway provides a window into the developing motor control zzso A variety of posture sway measures can be used, but the optimal measures for infant development have not been zzso 

We have collected sitting zzso sway data from two groups of zzso one with typical development zzso and one with delayed development and either diagnosed with or at risk for cerebral zzso zzso when the infants had developed to the point where they could just maintain sitting for about zzso zzso sway data was collected while infants were sitting on a force platform, and the center of pressure was analyzed using both linear and zzso zzso 

Our results showed that a zzso measure, the largest zzso zzso was the only zzso of zzso sway that revealed significant differences between infants with typical versus delayed zzso The largest zzso zzso was found to be higher for typically developing zzso indicating less repeated patterning in their movement zzso 

A zzso measure such as largest zzso zzso may be useful as an zzso of pathology and as a zzso for the success of therapeutic zzso
