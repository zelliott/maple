zzso cardiac zzso manifest themselves as abnormal movements of left zzso zzso zzso zzso An objective zzso is usually accomplished by computer analysis of zzso sequences of zzso zzso as obtained by zzso or zzso However the choice of the reference system for measuring motion is still open to zzso zzso geometric models cannot deal with the zzso zzso zzso structure, which gives rise to zzso movements, zzso even in normal zzso zzso a new method, zzso zzso was developed for improving motion zzso Since zzso zzso shape and position change smoothly throughout the cardiac cycle, the points of zzso extremes are tracked zzso and selected by exploiting zzso zzso then, the points lying among these landmarks are mapped onto sequential zzso according to local zzso and zzso zzso In this way zzso are allowed to be zzso and different in zzso and zzso CM gave no significant differences in zzso the known motion of computer-generated contours zzso unlike other methods commonly adopted zzso Moreover, for the evaluation of regional wall motion of a zzso set of zzso zzso CM showed a greater specificity zzso and accuracy zzso with respect to the zzso method zzso zzso and zzso Finally, a fuzzy logic zzso system is proposed for translating significant motion patterns from the quantitative form, as provided by the analysis method, into the linguistic terms used by zzso in their clinical zzso This makes the interpretation of quantitative analysis easier and allows medical users to interact with the system for searching particular properties in a single clinical report as well as in a large zzso
