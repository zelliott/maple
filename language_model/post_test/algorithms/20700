The population zzso method has been developed to combine the simultaneous zzso activities of a population of motor cortical zzso to predict the trajectory of the arm zzso In this article, we consider a zzso model of a neural representation of the arm trajectory based on zzso discharge zzso As zzso feature map zzso is used to select the optimal set of weights in the model to determine the contribution of an individual zzso to an overall movement zzso The correspondence between movement directions and discharge patterns of the motor cortical zzso is established in the output zzso The zzso property of the zzso is used to analyze the recorded data of a behaving zzso The data used in this analysis were taken while the monkey was tracing spirals and doing zzso zzso The arm trajectory could be well predicted using such a statistical model based on the motor zzso zzso firing zzso The zzso method is compared with the population zzso method, which extracts information related to trajectory by assuming that each cell has a fixed preferred direction during the zzso This implies that these cells are acting along lines labeled only for zzso However, zzso information is carried in these cell zzso The zzso has the capability of zzso not only zzso information but also other parameters that are consistently represented in the activity of the recorded population of zzso
