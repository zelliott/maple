Our purpose in this study was to investigate the usefulness of follow-up zzso zzso zzso both current and previous zzso zzso in a zzso diagnosis zzso scheme for identifying the zzso zzso of clustered zzso 

Our database consisted of current and previous zzso zzso obtained from 93 patients before and after zzso zzso 11 invasive zzso 19 zzso zzso of the zzso type, 25 zzso zzso of the zzso type, 23 zzso and 15 zzso In our zzso zzso we extracted five objective features of clustered zzso from each of the current and previous zzso zzso by taking into account image features that experienced zzso commonly use to identify zzso zzso These features were then merged by a modified zzso zzso function for distinguishing among five zzso zzso For the input of the modified zzso zzso function, we used five objective features obtained from the previous zzso mammogram zzso zzso five objective features obtained from the current zzso mammogram zzso zzso and the set of the five previous features and the five current zzso 

The zzso zzso with the five current features were higher than those with the five previous zzso These zzso zzso were improved substantially by using the set of the five previous features and the five current zzso For the set of the five previous features and the five current features, the zzso zzso of our zzso scheme were zzso (9 of zzso for invasive zzso zzso (16 of zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso type, zzso (19 of 25) for zzso zzso of the zzso type, zzso (17 of zzso for zzso and zzso (13 of zzso for zzso 

Our zzso scheme with use of follow-up zzso zzso improved zzso performance for zzso clustered zzso
