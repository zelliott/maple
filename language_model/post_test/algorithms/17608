To improve the efficiency of zzso drug targeting systems, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of zzso zzso by the cell and to follow the zzso fate of zzso zzso and their zzso 

We applied zzso zzso imaging zzso using a combination of five fluorescent zzso with a significant spectral zzso zzso zzso were labeled with the zzso dye zzso zzso zzso or the zzso membrane marker zzso zzso and incubated with zzso zzso Further, the cells were stained with specific zzso the cell membrane was zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso were stained with zzso Red, and zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso the zzso 

All five zzso were used simultaneously and were zzso distinguished by the zzso zzso zzso showed a distribution pattern different from zzso composed zzso labeled with zzso the highly zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso dye zzso Red, whereas zzso zzso was not accompanied by zzso Red in all zzso 

zzso zzso zzso imaging is a powerful method for studying the zzso fate of zzso zzso zzso We assume that the zzso membrane marker zzso influences the zzso of particles due to its zzso zzso We propose that this zzso zzso acts as a zzso for cellular receptors and triggers zzso zzso zzso
