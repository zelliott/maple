In this paper, we present a novel zzso method for zzso the whole zzso vessel tree zzso Our method exploits a new zzso cylinder flux zzso based connectivity zzso which is formulated based on random zzso To avoid the shrinking problem of zzso structure, all existing zzso energy zzso methods for vessel zzso rely on skeleton or zzso zzso As a result, the performance of these vessel zzso methods then depends heavily on the skeleton extraction zzso In this paper, with the help of zzso based connectivity zzso a global optimal zzso result can be obtained without zzso skeleton or zzso The classical issues of the zzso methods, such as shrinking bias and sensitivity to seed point location, can be solved effectively with the proposed method thanks to the connectivity zzso
