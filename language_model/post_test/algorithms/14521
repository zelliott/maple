We study a series of zzso implicit lottery models in which two competing plant species, with and without defensive traits, are grazed by a zzso in a homogeneous zzso One species zzso has no defensive traits, while the other zzso has defensive traits but suffers reduced reproduction as the result of an assumed zzso Not surprisingly, coexistence of these plants cannot occur when the zzso density is very low (the palatable plant always zzso or very high (the defended plant zzso At intermediate zzso however, zzso can mediate plant coexistence, even in a homogeneous zzso If the zzso eats several plants per zzso and its zzso depends on the average zzso of the plants it eats, then palatable species in the immediate zzso of defended plants may be more likely to persist zzso zzso even at higher grazing zzso If the zzso shows a positive zzso response to the average zzso of the habitat as a whole, then both plant populations are stabilized and coexistence is zzso because both species obtain a minority advantage through the negative feedback caused by zzso If the zzso exhibits both of these traits, the system may have at most two zzso zzso one of which is stable and the other zzso This means that coexistence in such a system is vulnerable to large fluctuations in zzso density and identity, and this has implications for conservation in systems where large zzso are managed to promote plant zzso
