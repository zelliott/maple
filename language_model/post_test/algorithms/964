The linear zzso mode of zzso is the most widely employed mode of operation in zzso zzso zzso However, in recent years, the displacement mode has received considerable attention because of its promise of high zzso and high zzso To enable a comparison of these two modes of zzso it is essential to identify the optimum operating conditions for zzso We employed an zzso zzso to carry out the necessary zzso The zzso Mass Action model of zzso zzso is used in concert with the zzso zzso force model to describe the zzso behavior of the zzso in these zzso The performances of displacement and zzso modes of zzso are compared for different types of separation zzso It turns out that for zzso zzso both the modes are equally zzso However, for challenging zzso the displacement mode is superior to the zzso zzso Our results shed significant light on the performance of zzso and displacement modes in protein zzso zzso
