The predictability and constancy over time of the zzso flow in zzso is an important consideration in zzso zzso A common cause for zzso of the flow is the zzso of zzso to channel walls, for example, during zzso zzso of zzso It is shown that certain experimental data, published by Towns and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992, 64, zzso on the anomalous zzso times for proteins in zzso zzso can be explained using a simple model for zzso zzso that uses a result first reported by Anderson and Idol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso zzso zzso 1985, 38, zzso on the zzso flux in zzso with zzso variations in zzso It is suggested that it might be possible to use such a model to zzso correct for altered zzso times in zzso zzso zzso
