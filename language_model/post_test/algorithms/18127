In zzso zzso zzso patients there is an increased risk of premature death, which can occur with little or no zzso Furthermore, zzso for sudden cardiac death on patients with zzso is very zzso The aim of our study was to improve the zzso value of heart rate zzso zzso in zzso patients, giving insight into changes of the zzso nervous zzso In this way, the suitability of linear and zzso measures was studied to assess the zzso These measures were based on zzso representation zzso and on Shannon and zzso zzso and compared with traditional zzso zzso zzso recordings of 64 patients with zzso and 55 healthy subjects were zzso The zzso patients consisted of two groups: 13 high risk patients, after aborted sudden cardiac death zzso 51 low risk patients, without zzso zzso zzso signals, corresponding to the sleep period of the subjects, were considered for the analysis as a comparable standard zzso These zzso signals were filtered in the three frequency zzso very low frequency band zzso zzso zzso low frequency band zzso zzso zzso and high frequency band zzso zzso zzso zzso variables based on instantaneous frequency and energy functions were able to zzso zzso patients and healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso revealed that measures obtained from zzso analysis of the zzso better classified the groups of subjects than traditional zzso zzso However, results showed that zzso measures improved group zzso It was observed that zzso calculated in the zzso band showed the highest statistically significant levels comparing the zzso group and the control group, zzso zzso zzso The values of zzso measures calculated in the zzso group presented lower values, indicating a decreasing of complexity, than those calculated from the control zzso Moreover, similar behavior was observed comparing high and low risk of premature death, the values of the zzso being lower in high risk patients, zzso zzso zzso indicating an increase of zzso Furthermore, measures from information zzso but not from zzso seem to be useful for enhanced risk zzso in zzso patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac zzso
