The paper presents sparse component analysis zzso blind decomposition of the zzso of mass zzso into pure zzso wherein the number of zzso is less than number of pure zzso Standard solutions of the related blind source separation zzso problem that are published in the open literature require the number of zzso to be greater than or equal to the unknown number of pure zzso Specifically, we have demonstrated zzso the capability of the zzso to blindly extract five pure components mass zzso from two zzso zzso Two approaches to zzso are zzso the first one based on zzso norm zzso implemented through linear programming and the second one implemented through zzso zzso alternating least square zzso zzso zzso with zzso constraints imposed on pure components zzso In contrast to many existing blind decomposition methods no a zzso information about the number of pure components is zzso It is estimated from the zzso using robust data zzso zzso together with pure components concentration zzso zzso methodology can be implemented as a part of software packages used for the analysis of mass zzso and identification of chemical zzso
