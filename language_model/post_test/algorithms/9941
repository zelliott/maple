zzso has been shown to be beneficial in the majority of patients with zzso class zzso symptoms, prolonged zzso zzso and an zzso zzso or zzso The use of imaging zzso to zzso zzso may help identify patients who may benefit from zzso but do not meet current selection zzso We zzso that patients with zzso zzso dysfunction have significant degrees of mechanical zzso 

We compared phase analysis measures of mechanical zzso from gated zzso imaging in patients with zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with patients with severe zzso dysfunction zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with normal controls zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we evaluated the relationships between zzso duration and zzso and determined the prevalence of zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso dysfunction have more zzso than normal controls zzso zzso zzso degrees vs zzso degrees , P zzso zzso and bandwidth zzso degrees vs zzso degrees , P zzso zzso but less zzso than patients with severe zzso dysfunction zzso zzso zzso degrees vs zzso degrees , P zzso zzso and bandwidth zzso degrees vs zzso degrees , P zzso zzso In the cohort of patients with zzso zzso zzso there were only weak correlations between zzso duration and zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and zzso r zzso zzso There were 73 patients with zzso zzso and zzso duration zzso milliseconds of which 21 zzso had mechanical zzso Overall, 37% of patients with zzso zzso dysfunction had significant degrees of mechanical zzso 

This is the largest reported study evaluating mechanical zzso in patients with zzso zzso dysfunction using phase analysis of gated zzso zzso In this study, approximately one-third of patients with zzso zzso dysfunction had significant zzso mechanical zzso With further study, phase analysis of gated zzso imaging may help improve patient selection for zzso
