The study compares the diagnostic accuracy zzso identification of zzso of a new zzso diagnosis zzso system zzso with two other commercial systems zzso and zzso 

zzso was tested on a set of 120 zzso on which the two compared commercial systems had been previously zzso The set consisted of zzso reported as negative, preceding 31 zzso zzso reviewed as screening error or minimal sign, and of 89 verified negative controls randomly selected from the same screening zzso 

zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso and was higher for zzso zzso reviewed as screening error zzso zzso zzso compared with those reviewed as minimal sign zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy was zzso zzso zzso The positive zzso value of a case with zzso marks zzso of interest zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Average zzso number per view among negative controls was zzso zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive for masses compared with isolated zzso zzso vs 62 zzso zzso vs zzso zzso vs zzso 

Compared with two other commercial systems, zzso was more sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso and less specific zzso zzso zzso zzso
