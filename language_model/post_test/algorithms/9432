zzso has become an important part of Systems Biology, and a large set of data has already gained by applying the methods of zzso How to deal with the data and how to combine data of zzso with data of other zzso are problems that can not be zzso An zzso zzso Multiple Factor was imported into the zzso kinetic zzso When the zzso amount in the system changed, in zzso model, it means to alter the zzso zzso Multiple zzso In order to observe ethanol concentration response to zzso amount changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso model, zzso amount was separately set at high and low level, the corresponding zzso zzso Multiple Factor value was 10 and zzso zzso Based on the result of zzso twelve zzso in zzso were separated into two classes, class I and class II by cluster zzso The four zzso belonging to class I, zzso zzso zzso and zzso all catalyze irreversible zzso The six out of eight zzso belonging to class II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso catalyze zzso zzso The other two zzso belonging to class II, zzso and zzso catalyze irreversible zzso Based on this method, data of zzso and zzso are easily integrated to accomplish relatively overall analysis of system zzso
