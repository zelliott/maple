We have performed a density functional calculation for the zzso zzso zzso using a zzso linear zzso plane wave method with the zzso and zzso exchange zzso In particular, we explored the influence of U on the band zzso and optical zzso Our calculations show that U zzso zzso zzso gives the best agreement with our zzso data taken in the zzso spectral range with a zzso zzso Our zzso zzso zzso zzso calculation shows that the zzso band maximum zzso is located at T and the zzso band minimum zzso is located at the center of the zzso zone, resulting in a wide indirect energy band gap of about zzso zzso in excellent agreement with our zzso The partial density of states show that the upper zzso band originates predominantly from zzso and zzso states, with a small zzso of zzso and zzso zzso states, while the lower zzso band zzso originates from the zzso and zzso terms with a small contribution of zzso zzso The zzso states in the upper zzso band and lower zzso band have a significant influence on the energy band gap zzso which is illustrated by our zzso The calculated frequency dependent optical properties show a small positive zzso zzso
