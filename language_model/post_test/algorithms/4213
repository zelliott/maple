In zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system, quantitative zzso of zzso zzso function are useful for differential zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso enables the diagnostic performance to be more zzso However, the partial volume effect zzso zzso an zzso of the true zzso concentration in small zzso This work proposes a simple zzso for zzso analysis of zzso zzso with partial volume correction zzso in zzso PET zzso 

The zzso zzso analyzes the separate zzso zzso and takes into account the zzso based on the recovery zzso zzso The zzso is defined as the ratio of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso and is derived from a combination of the traditional volume of interest zzso analysis and the large zzso zzso The clinical studies, zzso 11 patients with Parkinson's disease zzso and 6 healthy subjects, were used to assess the impact of zzso on the quantitative zzso zzso on a zzso phantom that zzso realistic healthy and neurodegenerative situations were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed zzso zzso In both the clinical and the simulation studies, the zzso ratio zzso values for the entire zzso and its zzso were calculated with and without zzso 

In the clinical studies, the zzso values in each structure zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher by using zzso in contrast to those zzso Among the zzso patients, the zzso values in each structure and quantitative disease severity ratings were shown to be significantly related only when zzso was zzso For the simulation studies, the average absolute percentage error of the zzso estimates before and after zzso were zzso and zzso in the healthy situation, zzso those in the neurodegenerative situation were zzso and zzso zzso 

We successfully implemented a simple zzso for zzso analysis of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso PET zzso The zzso zzso provides an accurate measure of the zzso in the entire zzso and its zzso and improves the correlation between the zzso values and the clinical disease severity of zzso zzso
