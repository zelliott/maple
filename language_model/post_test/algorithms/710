A method zzso was developed to evaluate the register of a sequence on a structure based on the matching of structural patterns against a library derived from the protein structure zzso The scores obtained were zzso against random background zzso derived from sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures were also used to evaluate the effectiveness of the zzso These were generated by a simple zzso and a more sophisticated structure prediction method that produced zzso zzso For comparison with other methods, the performance of the method was assessed using collections of models including zzso and models from the zzso zzso The performance of zzso on the decoy models was equivalent to (and sometimes better zzso those obtained with more complex zzso An exception was the two smallest zzso for which zzso did not perform well due to a lack of zzso Using the best zzso combination from trials on decoy models, the zzso models of intermediate difficulty were evaluated by zzso and the quality of the top scoring model was evaluated by its zzso zzso Of the 14 targets in this class, half lie in the top zzso (out of around 140 models for each zzso The two worst rankings resulted from the selection by our method of a zzso model that was based on the wrong zzso Of the other poor rankings, one was the smallest protein and the others were the four largest (all over 250 zzso
