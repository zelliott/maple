During breathing, zzso of respiratory muscles is coordinated by integrated input from the brain, zzso and spinal zzso When this coordination is disrupted by spinal zzso injury zzso control of respiratory muscles zzso below the injury level is compromised leading to respiratory muscle dysfunction and pulmonary zzso These conditions are among the leading causes of death in patients with zzso Standard pulmonary function tests that assess respiratory motor function include zzso and maximum airway pressure zzso zzso Vital zzso zzso zzso zzso Volume in one second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These values provide indirect zzso of respiratory muscle zzso In clinical practice and research, a surface zzso zzso recorded from respiratory muscles can be used to assess respiratory motor function and help to diagnose zzso zzso However, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso efforts to develop objective and direct measures of respiratory motor zzso Based on a zzso zzso approach to characterize motor control of limb muscles, known as the voluntary response index zzso we developed an zzso tool to characterize respiratory motor control directly from zzso data recorded from multiple respiratory muscles during the voluntary respiratory zzso We have termed this the Respiratory Motor Control Assessment zzso This zzso analysis method zzso the amount and distribution of activity across muscles and presents it in the form of an index that relates the degree to which zzso output within a zzso resembles that from a group of healthy zzso zzso The resulting index value has been shown to have high face zzso sensitivity and zzso We showed previously that the zzso outcomes significantly correlate with levels of zzso and pulmonary function zzso We are presenting here the method to zzso compare zzso zzso injury respiratory zzso zzso patterns to those of healthy zzso
