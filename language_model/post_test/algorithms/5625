The zzso of visual motion has long been studied as a zzso neural computation, and multiple models have been advanced to explain behavioral and neural responses to motion zzso A broad class of models, originating with the Reichardt zzso model, proposes that animals estimate motion by computing a zzso zzso of light zzso from two neighboring points in visual zzso These models provide a good description of experimental data in specific contexts but cannot explain motion zzso in stimuli lacking zzso zzso Here, we develop a theoretical zzso that can accommodate diverse stimuli and behavioral zzso To achieve this, we treat motion zzso as a problem of zzso zzso zzso models emerge as one component of the generalized strategy for motion zzso However, correlation functions beyond second order enable more accurate motion zzso Prior expectations that are zzso with respect to bright and dark contrast use correlations of both even and odd orders, and we show that zzso experiments using visual stimuli with zzso probability zzso for contrast cannot reveal whether the subject uses zzso zzso for motion zzso This result highlights a gap in previous experiments, which have largely relied on zzso contrast zzso Our theoretical treatment provides a natural interpretation of many visual motion zzso indicates that motion zzso should be revisited using a broader class of zzso demonstrates how zzso motion zzso is related to stimulus statistics, and provides multiple zzso testable zzso
