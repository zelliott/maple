In this paper we propose a calculation of zzso zzso not affected by zzso by using zzso quantities directly measured in total zzso We also propose an zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso B, total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol of zzso were measured in a group of 38 zzso and 120 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso and 40 zzso classified according to zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was applied to obtain the best zzso with the lowest number of quantities directly measured from total serum zzso zzso and zzso B), and multiple zzso analysis was performed to find an equation to calculate zzso from these zzso zzso B seems to be a useful zzso between zzso and zzso zzso patients, by using a zzso value of zzso zzso obtained by zzso curve zzso The proposed algorithm, based on zzso quantities measured by easily automated methods, is shown to be a good alternative for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso calculated from zzso zzso and zzso B proved a better estimate of true zzso than the estimate obtained with zzso zzso
