The presence of a rib cage is a significant hindrance to the potential applications of focused ultrasound as a zzso zzso surgery zzso for various internal zzso Here the influence of ribs on the propagation of strongly focused high-intensity zzso ultrasound beam inside the body is zzso Based on the zzso beam zzso a three-dimensional zzso zzso is developed to solve the zzso acoustic field generated by a focused zzso zzso with a large zzso zzso zzso ribs, of zzso cross zzso with high zzso and zzso and various dimensions, are used to simulate human anatomical zzso The changes in the spatial distribution of acoustic intensity and the reduction of the acoustic pressure zzso and heat deposition rate due to the presence of zzso are zzso It is somewhat surprising that in some cases, the zzso peak positions shift less than zzso and more than zzso of the sound energy can zzso through the space of the rib cage in the strongly focused sound zzso This study also includes quantitative analyses of the effects of different rib zzso and zzso of various zzso The results can be used as reference information for further study and clinical zzso
