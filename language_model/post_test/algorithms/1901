zzso overlay images rendered from zzso zzso data can provide additional anatomical details to guide physicians during zzso zzso procedures for treatment of zzso zzso zzso As these overlay images are often compromised by cardiac and respiratory motion, motion compensation methods are needed to keep the overlay images in sync with the zzso zzso So far, these approaches have either required simultaneous zzso imaging for 3-D motion compensation, or in case of zzso X-ray imaging, provided only a limited zzso zzso To overcome the zzso of the previously suggested methods, we propose an approach that zzso a full 3-D motion compensation even if only zzso X-ray images are zzso To this end, we use a training phase that employs a zzso sequence to establish a patient specific motion zzso zzso a constrained zzso zzso registration method is used to track a zzso mapping zzso This device is commonly used for zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the experiments on real patient data, we found that our constrained zzso zzso registration outperformed the zzso counterpart and yielded an average zzso tracking error of zzso zzso and an average 3-D tracking error of zzso zzso The zzso zzso registration technique yielded a similar zzso performance, but the 3-D tracking error increased to zzso zzso mostly due to wrongly estimated 3-D motion components in X-ray view zzso Compared to the conventional zzso zzso method, the proposed method provides a more seamless zzso by removing the need for zzso model zzso otherwise required when the zzso view orientation zzso In addition, the proposed method can be zzso combined with the previously introduced zzso motion compensation technique to obtain a good zzso between accuracy and radiation dose zzso
