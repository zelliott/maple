A reliable measure is one we can trust in the long zzso Thus, the reliability of zzso is as important as their zzso Here we investigated the reliability of brain electrical visual evoked responses to faces and noise zzso For the first time, we provide reliability measures for the full time course of zzso zzso zzso Our analyses were also performed on a zzso metric that reflects results from zzso zzso therefore providing the first reliability analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso and zzso are highly reliable zzso zzso lag zzso zzso correlation zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso within subjects, who differ reliably from each other and the grand average across zzso zzso grand averages, although highly reliable, can be misleading because they might not reflect the actual brain dynamic of any zzso
