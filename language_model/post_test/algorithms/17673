Researchers studying neural coding have speculated that populations of zzso would more effectively represent the stimulus if the zzso zzso by interacting through lateral connections, the zzso would process and represent information better than if they functioned zzso We apply our new theory of information processing to determine the zzso limits of simple population structures to zzso stimulus zzso We focus on zzso zzso which have no lateral zzso We show that they always exhibit positively correlated responses and that as population size increases, they perfectly represent the information conveyed by their zzso regardless of the individual zzso coding zzso Cooperative zzso which do have lateral connections, can, depending on the nature of the connections, perform better or worse than their zzso zzso We further show that common notions of zzso fail to capture the level of cooperation and to reflect the information processing properties of zzso
