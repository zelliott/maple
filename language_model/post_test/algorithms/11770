Comparative analysis of zzso zzso sequences can be used to identify functional sites such as zzso and regulatory zzso Here, the first step is to align two or several evolutionary related sequences and, in recent years, a number of computer programs have been developed for alignment of large zzso zzso Some of these programs are extremely fast but often zzso is achieved at the expense of zzso One way of combining speed and sensitivity is to use an zzso zzso In a first step, a fast zzso identifies a chain of strong sequence similarities that serve as anchor zzso In a second step, regions between these anchor points are aligned using a slower but more sensitive zzso We present zzso a novel zzso for rapid identification of chains of local sequence similarities among large zzso zzso zzso identified by zzso are used as anchor points to improve the running time of the zzso alignment zzso zzso test runs show that this method can reduce the running time of zzso by more than zzso while affecting the quality of the resulting alignments by only zzso The source code for zzso is available at zzso An integrated program package containing zzso and zzso is available at zzso
