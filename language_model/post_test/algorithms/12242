zzso methods, especially linear zzso analysis zzso have been very successful in facial feature zzso but the recognition performance of zzso is often zzso by the so-called zzso sample zzso zzso zzso One popular solution to the zzso problem is principal component analysis zzso + zzso zzso but the zzso in other zzso zzso may be more zzso In this correspondence, we proposed a novel fast feature extraction technique, zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso which performs an zzso in the zzso zzso Two face databases, the zzso and the zzso zzso Technology zzso databases, are used to evaluate zzso + zzso Experimental results show that zzso + zzso needs less zzso and memory requirements and has a higher recognition accuracy than zzso + zzso
