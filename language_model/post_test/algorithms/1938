This paper presents a mass preserving image registration zzso for lung CT zzso To account for the local change in lung tissue intensity during the breathing cycle, a tissue appearance model based on the principle of preservation of total lung mass is zzso This model is incorporated into a standard image registration framework with a composition of a global zzso and several zzso zzso transformations with increasing grid zzso The proposed mass preserving registration method is compared to registration using the sum of squared intensity differences as a similarity function on four groups of zzso 44 pairs of zzso zzso chest CT scans with small difference in lung zzso 44 pairs of zzso zzso chest CT scans with large difference in lung zzso 16 pairs of zzso and zzso CT zzso and 5 pairs of images extracted at end exhale and end inhale zzso of zzso zzso Registration zzso measured as the average distance between vessel tree zzso in the matched images, are significantly lower for the proposed mass preserving image registration method in the second, third and fourth group, while there is no statistically significant difference between the two methods in the first zzso Target registration error, assessed via a set of manually zzso landmarks in the last group, was significantly smaller for the proposed registration zzso
