zzso models are constructed to take advantage of the particular features of the patient case of interest compared to commonly used zzso models that are constructed to perform well on average on all zzso We introduce two zzso zzso that are based on the decision tree zzso These zzso construct a decision path specific for each patient of interest compared to a single zzso decision tree with many paths that is zzso to all patients of interest that are constructed by standard zzso We applied the zzso zzso to predict five different outcomes in clinical zzso Compared to the zzso zzso decision tree the zzso decision path models had superior performance on area under the zzso curve zzso and had comparable performance on balanced zzso Our results provide support for zzso zzso being a promising approach for predicting clinical zzso
