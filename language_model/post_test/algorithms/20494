The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were determined by using a variety of high level theoretical methods to establish which of these would give the best results with accessible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso procedures, hybrid zzso zzso and zzso corrected zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso density zzso were used for the zzso A maximum zzso of approximately 13 and 18 zzso from experimental data was observed for the zzso delta zzso and delta zzso values, zzso The best result was obtained at zzso level, but comparable reliability was reached when the considerably less time consuming zzso zzso and zzso density functional approaches were zzso
