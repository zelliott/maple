One of the main interests in the molecular zzso is in understanding zzso relations and X-ray zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso can be used as a comprehensive and efficient phasing procedure for the determination of protein structures when atomic resolution data are zzso An initial model can automatically be built by zzso followed by zzso for zzso The alpha zzso and beta sheets occurring in many protein structures can be taken as starting fragments for structure solution in zzso zzso along with zzso followed by zzso can be an zzso zzso method for solving protein structure for which data are better than zzso A zzso zzso Attempts are here made in extending its applications to real data at zzso A resolution and also to truncated data at zzso A zzso Two previously known structures, zzso II and alkaline zzso zzso were resolved using the above zzso Automatic structure solution, phasing and refinement for real data at still lower resolutions for proteins of various complexities are being carried zzso Data mining of the secondary structural features using zzso is being carried out for this new approach for zzso to zzso
