zzso motion is ubiquitous in zzso cells and contributes to important processes such as immune response and tumor zzso To zzso a cell must adhere to the zzso while protruding at the front and retracting at the zzso In most crawling cells zzso is driven by highly regulated zzso of the zzso zzso and much of the zzso network for this process is zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso composed of Major zzso zzso zzso which is considered to form a zzso yet similar, crawling zzso zzso Key components involved in the zzso of MSP have been zzso however, little is known about the chemical zzso for this zzso Here we develop a model for MSP zzso that takes into account the effects of several of the zzso identified zzso and zzso zzso To account for some of the data, the model requires zzso zzso as is predicted by zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso model with our zzso kinetic model for MSP zzso we find good agreement with experimental data on zzso zzso In addition, our model predicts the zzso relation that is expected for in zzso zzso zzso
