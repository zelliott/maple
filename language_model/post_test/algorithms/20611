We extended the model describing the low molecular weight electron dense zzso wake in the zzso zzso and surrounding tissue to describe the zzso transport of intermediate size zzso of zzso zzso radius by zzso and diffusion in an zzso zzso containing a fiber zzso This model provides a quantitative basis on which to zzso electron microscopic studies of the distribution of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso molecular weight zzso zzso zzso radius zzso zzso zzso along the zzso cell zzso from the zzso to the zzso For example, we show that, in contrast to our results with low molecular weight zzso the wake of large molecular weight zzso on the zzso side of the zzso strand is not likely to be zzso because the concentration of the zzso is predicted to be very low in most zzso Thus the lack of a zzso such as zzso on the zzso side of the zzso strand and in the tissue is not as strong evidence against the presence of a zzso zzso as suggested zzso The model does provide the basis for the design of experiments to locate both the principal molecular sieve and breaks in the zzso strand from the standing zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso An important experimental variable is the pressure in the vessel zzso which can be varied between 0 and 30 zzso zzso to change the contributions of zzso and zzso transport to zzso exchange through he zzso zzso This approach will also allow the testing of models for zzso pathways for large molecules by measuring the distribution of fluorescent traces across the zzso wall and in the tissue surrounding the zzso using zzso zzso
