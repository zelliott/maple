A comprehensive zzso study was performed on 27 distinct zzso zzso For 13 test systems, zzso was performed with the zzso X-ray structures of both the zzso and the zzso For the remaining systems, the zzso X-ray structure of only zzso was zzso therefore the bound structure for the other zzso was zzso Our method zzso zzso shape zzso and zzso using a Fast zzso zzso zzso A global search in the zzso and zzso space without any knowledge of the binding sites was performed for all proteins except nine zzso recognizing zzso For these zzso we zzso their zzso binding zzso zzso region defined without information of the zzso the entire surface of the zzso For 24 systems, we were able to find zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso root mean square zzso less than zzso A from the crystal zzso among the top 2,000 zzso For three systems, our zzso could identify the correct complex structure zzso For 13 other complexes, we either ranked a zzso structure in the top 20 or obtained 20 or more zzso structures in the top 2,000 or zzso The key feature of our zzso is the use of target functions that are highly tolerant to zzso changes upon zzso If combined with a zzso method, our zzso may provide a general solution to the zzso zzso zzso Our program, called zzso is freely available to academic users zzso
