The aim is to review the evidence on the diagnostic value of zzso zzso pulmonary zzso zzso as a single test to rule out acute pulmonary embolism by zzso on the most recent literature and potential alternative and additional imaging zzso or diagnostic zzso 

Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using zzso with sequential diagnostic tests, pulmonary embolism can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating pulmonary embolism to be unlikely and a normal zzso test zzso This zzso the need for additional zzso imaging tests in around one-third of zzso zzso has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pulmonary zzso Several emerging tests with potential diagnostic or other advantages over zzso need further validation before they can be implemented in routine clinical zzso 

zzso is the imaging test of first zzso The presence or absence of pulmonary embolism can be determined with sufficient certainty without the need for additional imaging tests after a negative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is reserved for patients with zzso symptomatic deep vein zzso or a stringent zzso for zzso zzso Currently, magnetic resonance pulmonary zzso is not a suitable alternative for zzso
