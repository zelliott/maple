The global zzso zzso zzso method has been used to locate the global zzso zzso of zzso zzso clusters using a zzso zzso Some of the zzso were particularly difficult to find, requiring more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found that both the binding energy per zzso unit and the effective volume of the zzso zzso increase almost zzso with zzso and that cluster symmetry decreases with cluster zzso The data derived from the zzso runs reveal a growing density of local zzso just above the zzso as zzso zzso Despite this, the attraction basin around each zzso is relatively large, since after all their atomic coordinates are randomly displaced by values as high as zzso zzso the zzso structures, upon zzso relax back to the zzso in more than 50% of the cases (except for zzso and zzso The relative zzso derived from energy second differences suggest that zzso and 20 are probably the magic numbers for these zzso Mass spectrum experiments would be very useful to clarify this zzso
