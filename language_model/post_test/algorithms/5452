The diagnosis of zzso lateral sclerosis zzso relies on stringent clinical criteria, resulting in diagnostic delay and inevitably the institution of appropriate zzso zzso zzso as assessed by the novel threshold tracking zzso magnetic stimulation zzso technique, appears as an early feature of zzso zzso the present study assessed the diagnostic utility of threshold tracking zzso and developed zzso to aid the diagnosis of zzso 

Prospective studies were undertaken on a cohort of 156 consecutive patients with zzso symptoms (104 ALS and 52 lower motor zzso syndrome, zzso syndrome, zzso and 62 healthy zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in ALS patients zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased, while the cortical silent period duration was reduced in zzso all indicative of cortical zzso Analysis of receiver operating characteristic zzso suggested that threshold tracking zzso distinguished ALS from zzso with averaged zzso under curve zzso P zzso zzso and peak zzso 3 zzso zzso under curve zzso zzso being the most robust diagnostic zzso 

The presence of cortical zzso zzso ALS from mimic zzso 

The threshold tracking zzso techniques may prove useful as a diagnostic investigation for zzso
