This paper introduces a real-time data zzso and transmission zzso between zzso terminals for a periodic zzso The proposed zzso consists of five zzso procedures and four reconstruction zzso In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the zzso was applied to all 48 recordings of zzso zzso database, and the compress ratio zzso percent root mean square difference zzso percent root mean square difference zzso zzso zzso zzso and quality score zzso values were zzso The result showed that the zzso was zzso and the zzso was zzso on average for all 48 data instances with a zzso window zzso In addition, the performance of the zzso was compared to those of similar zzso introduced recently by zzso It was found that the proposed zzso showed clearly superior performance in all 48 data instances at a zzso ratio lower than zzso whereas it showed similar or slightly inferior zzso performance for a data zzso ratio higher than zzso In light of the fact that the similarity with the original data becomes meaningless when the zzso is higher than 2, the proposed zzso shows significantly better performance compared to the performance levels of other zzso Moreover, because the zzso can compress and transmit data in real time, it can be served as an optimal zzso data transmission method for limited bandwidth communication between zzso zzso
