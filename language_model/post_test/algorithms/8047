zzso is becoming increasingly important in everyday zzso One of the most widespread methods of zzso is based on the structure of the zzso Iris photography has several advantages as an identification method: it is relatively simple and zzso it is zzso and it is comparatively zzso However, some medical conditions may change the appearance of the zzso This paper discusses the effects of zzso pigmentation changes in iris zzso 

The study is based on four extreme cases of zzso pigmentation zzso Iris photographs in these patients during treatment are compared with zzso zzso The comparison is carried out with iris recognition software developed by our research group based on the principles of zzso well-known zzso The system was evaluated with zzso iris zzso 

Iris photographs showing zzso pigmentation changes were correctly matched with zzso photographs of the same zzso with an error probability similar to that for matching equivalent pairs of photographs in intact zzso 

Our results indicate that the pigmentation changes studied do not seem to have a significant effect on the standard identification zzso
