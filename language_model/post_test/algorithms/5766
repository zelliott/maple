zzso wheel zzso zzso is a relatively new zzso that has been shown to be effective for many real-world zzso At each iteration zzso does a complete construction of a solution starting from the empty zzso Although the construction uses information from previous zzso the complete rebuilding does mean that zzso is generally effective at diversification but can suffer from a relatively weak zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recent extension to zzso that is designed to improve the zzso by keeping the good components of solutions and only using zzso to reconstruct other poorer components of the zzso In such zzso a standard challenge is to understand how the various parameters affect the search zzso In order to support the future study of such issues, we propose a formal framework for the analysis of zzso The framework is based on zzso zzso and the main novelty arises because zzso moves through the space of partial zzso This makes it significantly different from the analyses used in local search (such as simulated zzso which only move through complete zzso Generally, the exact details of zzso will depend on various zzso so we focus our approach on a case of zzso that we call zzso and that has zzso as opposed to zzso selection and construction zzso For zzso we study a simple problem instance and explicitly zzso the stationary distribution probability over the states of the search zzso We find interesting properties of the zzso In particular, we find that the probabilities of states generally, but not always, increase with their zzso This zzso is quite different from the zzso expected in zzso such as simulated zzso
