zzso learning techniques for computer vision applications like object recognition, scene zzso zzso require a large number of training samples for satisfactory zzso Especially when zzso is to be performed over many categories, providing enough training samples for each category is zzso This paper describes new ideas in zzso active learning to deal with the training zzso making it easier to train large zzso image zzso zzso First, we propose a new interaction zzso for training which requires only zzso type zzso feedback instead of a precise category zzso The zzso is especially powerful in the presence of hundreds of zzso For the proposed zzso we develop a zzso zzso zzso that chooses zzso queries while also considering user zzso zzso Second, we propose an active selection measure that works with many categories and is extremely fast to zzso This measure is employed to perform a fast seed search before computing zzso resulting in an zzso that scales zzso with zzso zzso Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives zzso time zzso allowing application to very large zzso The approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude zzso with little loss in zzso zzso empirical evaluation of zzso zzso noise sensitivity, zzso data, and zzso performance on a diverse set of image zzso demonstrates the strengths of the proposed zzso
