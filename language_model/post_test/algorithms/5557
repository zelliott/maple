It is known that the depth of focus zzso of the human eye can be affected by the higher order zzso We estimated the optimal combinations of primary and secondary zzso zzso aberration to expand the zzso and evaluated their efficiency in real eyes using an zzso zzso zzso The ratio between increased zzso and loss of visual acuity was used as the performance zzso The results indicate that primary or secondary zzso aberration alone shows similar effectiveness in extending the zzso However, combinations of primary and secondary zzso aberration with different signs provide better efficiency for expanding the zzso This finding suggests that the optimal combinations of primary and secondary zzso aberration may be useful in the design of optical zzso zzso
