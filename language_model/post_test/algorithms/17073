An zzso maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso zzso has been developed for scatter compensation in chest zzso 

The zzso technique produces a zzso image which zzso the probability of observing the measured zzso We examined the scatter content and the zzso zzso ratio zzso in digital zzso of anatomical zzso before and after zzso 

zzso zzso to an accurate zzso zzso residual scatter zzso estimate within 12 zzso Both contrast and noise were increased in the processed images as iteration zzso In the zzso contrast was increased zzso and zzso was improved by zzso In the zzso region, contrast was increased zzso while zzso decreased by zzso 

This is the first report of a zzso scatter compensation technique which can increase zzso These results suggest that statistical zzso techniques can enhance image quality and quantitative accuracy for digital chest zzso
