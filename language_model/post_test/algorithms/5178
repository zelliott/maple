To develop prediction models of the relative need for care to differentiate between urgent and not urgent individuals presenting for emergency dental zzso 

Data were collected from zzso adults presenting to public dental clinics across South Australia zzso and New South Wales zzso for emergency dental zzso zzso of the urgency of emergency dental care was based on the assessment of two zzso zzso zzso models - Model 1: urgency of zzso hours zzso zzso days, Model zzso urgency of zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso equations for urgency of emergency dental care were developed using zzso zzso zzso zzso The models incorporated zzso oral health indicators zzso experience of pain or other oral zzso and measures of zzso impact of oral disorders zzso difficulty sleeping and being worried about the zzso of one's teeth or zzso 

The zzso point for the prediction of urgency was defined as a probability value zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso for Model 1 and Model 2 zzso These zzso values were chosen as they produced test results that were consistent with the proportions of patients falling into various urgency categories derived from zzso assessment of zzso Model zzso sensitivity was zzso specificity zzso and positive zzso value zzso zzso Model zzso sensitivity was zzso specificity zzso and zzso zzso 

These models of relative need may be useful tools for the screening of urgent dental care and for allocating priority among patients presenting for emergency dental zzso
