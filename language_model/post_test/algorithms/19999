Many scientists in the field of zzso imaging rely on the simulation of zzso zzso As the phantom models become more and more zzso their projection requires high zzso zzso Since zzso images are based on transmission, many standard graphics acceleration zzso cannot be applied to this zzso However, if adapted properly, the simulation speed can be increased dramatically using state-of-the-art graphics zzso A custom graphics pipeline that simulates transmission projections for zzso reconstruction was implemented based on moving zzso surface zzso All steps from zzso of the zzso projection onto the detector and drawing are implemented in zzso We introduced a special append buffer for increased performance in order to store the zzso with the scene for every zzso zzso are then sorted and resolved to zzso Lastly, an zzso model is evaluated to yield an zzso value for each projection zzso zzso of a moving zzso structure is fast and zzso zzso of size 640 zzso zzso can be generated within 254 zzso zzso using the projections show errors below 1 zzso with a sharp reconstruction zzso Traditional zzso acceleration schemes are not suitable for our reconstruction zzso Even in the absence of noise, they result in errors up to 9 zzso on average, although projection images appear to be correct under visual zzso zzso generated with our new method are suitable for the validation of novel CT reconstruction zzso For complex simulations, such as the evaluation of zzso reconstruction zzso this kind of zzso simulation will reduce the zzso time zzso
