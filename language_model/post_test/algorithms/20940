The concept of zzso in zzso regulation is based on the assumption that product zzso increases zzso as a function of regulator zzso We analyze the zzso model of zzso and find this assumption to be correct only for the simplest of zzso We define a new regulatory constant that is a zzso combination of association and zzso initiation zzso characterizing zzso and repression for more complicated zzso Our results can guide the synthesis of new promoters and lead to a deeper understanding of the constraints guiding the natural promoters zzso
