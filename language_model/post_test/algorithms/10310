Walking speed is a fundamental indicator for human zzso In a clinical setting, walking speed is typically measured by means of walking tests using different zzso However, walking speed obtained in this way is unlikely to be representative of the conditions in a zzso zzso Recently, mobile zzso has opened up the possibility to extract walking speed from long-time observations in zzso individuals, but the zzso of these zzso needs to be zzso In this investigation, we have developed zzso for walking speed prediction based on zzso zzso data zzso and created a framework using a standardized data set with gold standard zzso to facilitate the validation and comparison of these zzso For this purpose 17 healthy subjects operated a newly developed mobile gold standard while zzso on an indoor zzso zzso the zzso of 12 candidate zzso for walking speed prediction ranging from well-known simple approaches like combining step length with frequency to more sophisticated zzso such as linear and zzso models was assessed using statistical zzso As a result, a novel zzso employing support zzso zzso was found to perform best with a zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a coverage probability zzso of zzso zzso zzso for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to the mobile gold standard while walking zzso A smaller outdoor experiment confirmed those results with even better coverage zzso We conclude that walking speed thus obtained has the potential to help establish walking speed in zzso environments as a zzso outcome zzso
