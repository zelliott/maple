This chapter compiles some properties of zzso and zzso of correlation and other zzso constructed from zzso as well as systematically correlated zzso zzso All results are based on zzso The situations depicted in the settings are found in time series analysis as one extreme zzso and in zzso profile analysis with zzso as the other extreme zzso of the possible scenarios for correlation analysis and zzso where random zzso theory might zzso The main difference between both is the number of variables versus the number of zzso To what extent the results can be transferred is yet zzso While random zzso theory as such makes statements about the statistical properties of zzso and zzso the expectation is that these statements, if used in a proper way, will improve the zzso of genes for the detection of functional zzso In the course of the scenarios, the relation and zzso between the concepts of time, experiment, and zzso of random variables play an important zzso The mapping between a classical random zzso ensemble and the zzso scenario is not yet zzso In any case, we can make statements about pitfalls and sources of false zzso We also develop an improved spectral zzso zzso that is based on the properties of zzso and zzso of correlation zzso We found it necessary to rehearse and zzso these properties from the bottom up starting at one extreme end of scenarios and moving to the zzso zzso
