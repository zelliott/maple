This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the addition of a real-time zzso machine learning zzso by emergency medical system personnel could shorten the time needed to identify an unstable patient during a zzso profile as compared with vital sign information zzso 

Fifty emergency medical zzso from a large, urban fire department participated as zzso zzso viewed a monitor screen on two occasions as zzso zzso display of standard vital signs alone and zzso with the addition of an index zzso Reserve zzso associated with estimated central blood volume zzso The subjects were asked to push a computer key at any point in the sequence they believed the patient had become unstable based on information provided by the monitor zzso The average difference in time to identify zzso instability between experimental and control groups was assessed by zzso zzso zzso test and reported with zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso 

The mean zzso amount of time required to identify an unstable patient was zzso zzso minutes zzso zzso zzso minutes) without the zzso and zzso zzso minutes zzso zzso zzso minutes) with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a simulated patient encounter involving uncontrolled zzso the use of a monitor that estimates central blood volume loss was associated with early identification of impending zzso zzso zzso monitors capable of early identification and zzso of the zzso capacity to compensate for blood loss during zzso may enable optimal guidance for zzso zzso They may also help identify casualties zzso from forward administration of zzso zzso and zzso in a remote zzso resuscitation zzso
