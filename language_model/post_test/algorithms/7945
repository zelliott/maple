The video stream captured by an zzso holographic microscope can be analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis to track individual zzso zzso three-dimensional motions with zzso resolution, and simultaneously to measure their sizes and zzso zzso Through a combination of hardware acceleration and software zzso this analysis can be carried out in near real time with zzso zzso An efficient particle identification zzso zzso initial position zzso with sufficient accuracy to enable unattended holographic tracking and zzso This zzso resolution for particle size is fine enough to detect zzso zzso on the surfaces of zzso zzso without requiring zzso or fluorescent zzso We demonstrate this approach to zzso holographic flow zzso by detecting the binding of zzso to zzso polystyrene zzso
