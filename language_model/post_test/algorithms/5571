zzso the binding zzso of a drug zzso to a target zzso is pivotal in zzso rational drug zzso In contrast to most approaches to solve this problem, the idea in this paper is to analyze the search problem from a zzso zzso By building on top of an existing zzso zzso new methods are proposed and relevant zzso results are zzso These methods and results are zzso for other zzso zzso as zzso A fast approximation scheme for the zzso of rigid fragments is described that guarantees certain geometric approximation zzso It is also demonstrated that this can be translated into an energy approximation for simple scoring zzso A zzso time zzso is developed for the matching phase of the zzso rigid zzso It is demonstrated that the generic matching problem is zzso At the same time, the zzso of the proposed zzso is proven under certain scoring function zzso The matching results are also zzso for some of the zzso de zzso design zzso On the practical side, the proposed method is tested on zzso complexes from the zzso The results show that the closest predicted pose to the native structure has the average zzso zzso of zzso zzso
