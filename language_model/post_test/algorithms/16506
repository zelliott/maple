Recently, we have developed a zzso soft matter model for stem cells or primitive cells in general, aiming at improving the understanding of zzso mechanism of cells that is responsible for information exchange between cells and their zzso zzso In this paper, we report the preliminary results of our research on zzso modeling and simulation of soft contact and zzso of zzso The proposed zzso soft matter cell model may be used to model soft contact and zzso between cells and their zzso zzso This model is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or an extension of zzso liquid crystal membrane zzso zzso To the best of the zzso knowledge, this may be the first time that a soft matter model is developed for cell contact and zzso zzso we have developed and implemented a zzso type zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for the proposed cell zzso zzso study with experimental data has been conducted to validate the parameters of the zzso By using the soft matter cell model, we have simulated the soft adhesive contact process between cells and their zzso zzso The simulation shows that the cell can sense zzso elasticity by responding in different manners from cell spreading motion to cell contact zzso
