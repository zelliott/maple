Acute zzso zzso zzso causes a decrease in systemic vascular zzso Similar to zzso drugs, zzso might modify zzso zzso Left zzso zzso zzso effective zzso zzso zzso stroke work zzso and pressure volume area zzso were used as indicators to examine the effects of zzso on this zzso 

After institutional approval eight dogs were zzso with zzso and subjected to zzso including zzso pressure, left zzso zzso pressure, and zzso zzso Left zzso volume was measured with a zzso zzso zzso was determined as the slope of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined as the ratio of zzso zzso pressure to stroke zzso zzso zzso was evaluated as the ratio of zzso to zzso Mechanical efficiency, another criterion for zzso zzso was calculated as the ratio of SW to zzso Data are expressed as zzso and zzso was considered zzso 

zzso exchange of 50 zzso zzso of blood for zzso zzso starch zzso reduced zzso concentration from zzso g zzso to zzso g zzso Acute zzso zzso 50 did not change zzso significantly although it significantly decreased zzso Left zzso zzso did not change after zzso zzso at baseline and zzso at zzso Acute zzso zzso 50 significantly increased SW and zzso preventing zzso from changing significantly after zzso zzso at baseline and zzso at zzso 

Before zzso zzso zzso was so matched as to maximize SW at the expense of the work zzso This relation was preserved at zzso
