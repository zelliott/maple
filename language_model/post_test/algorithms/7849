In zzso models of infectious diseases the basic reproduction number zzso is used as a threshold zzso to determine the threshold between disease extinction and zzso A zzso form of zzso elimination using zzso reduction is derived and an zzso given for calculating the basic reproduction number in continuous time zzso zzso Examples illustrate how this method can be applied to zzso models of infectious diseases zzso by a system of ordinary differential zzso We also show with these examples how lower bounds for zzso can be obtained from the zzso in the reduction zzso
