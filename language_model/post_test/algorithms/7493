While many approaches exist for the automated zzso of retinal vessels in zzso photographs, limited work has focused on the problem of separating the zzso from the zzso zzso The few existing approaches that do exist for separating arteries from veins are local and/or greedy in nature, making them susceptible to errors or limiting their zzso to only the very largest zzso In this work, we propose a new, more zzso zzso framework for separating two overlapping trees within medical images and apply this approach for the separation of zzso trees in zzso color zzso zzso In particular, our approach has two zzso The first stage is to generate a vessel potential connectivity map zzso consisting of vessel segments and the potential connectivity between zzso The second stage is to separate the zzso into multiple anatomical trees using a zzso zzso zzso Based on a graph model, the zzso first uses local knowledge and global constraints of the zzso to generate zzso candidate solutions, and then zzso the final solution based on global zzso We test the zzso on 48 zzso zzso images and the promising results suggest its zzso and zzso
