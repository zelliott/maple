Muscle artifacts are typically associated with sleep zzso and zzso in normal and pathological sleep, zzso zzso recordings and zzso quantitative zzso zzso Most zzso correction techniques focus on zzso artifacts but little research has been done on removing muscle activity from sleep zzso zzso The present study was aimed at assessing the performance of four independent component analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to separate zzso activity from zzso during sleep, in order to determine the optimal zzso zzso zzso and zzso performed significantly better than zzso at eliminating muscle artifacts over zzso regions, but zzso was independent of the zzso ratio over zzso regions and markedly faster than the remaining zzso zzso was further successful at separating muscle artifacts from spontaneous zzso zzso when applied on a real case during different sleep zzso The low zzso cost of zzso and its excellent performance with zzso zzso from different sleep stages supports this zzso zzso as a valid choice to minimize the influence of muscle artifacts on human sleep zzso zzso
