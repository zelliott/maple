Tree structures are useful for describing and analyzing biological objects and zzso zzso there is a need to design metrics and zzso to compare zzso A natural comparison metric is the zzso zzso zzso the number of simple edit zzso operations needed to transform one tree into the zzso zzso trees, where the order between the siblings is zzso can be compared in zzso zzso zzso trees are used to describe processes or objects where the zzso rather than the order or the identity of each zzso is zzso For example, in zzso zzso trees describe the process of zzso zzso gene diversification in the zzso center over zzso Comparing such trees has been proven to be a difficult zzso problem that belongs to the set of zzso zzso Comparing two trees can be viewed as a search problem in zzso zzso is a search zzso that explores the search space in an efficient zzso Using a good lower bound zzso of the degree of difference between the two trees, zzso can reduce search time zzso We have designed and implemented a zzso of the zzso search zzso suitable for calculating tree edit zzso We show here that zzso is able to perform an edit distance measurement in reasonable time for trees with dozens of zzso
