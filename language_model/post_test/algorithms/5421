We present an zzso to identify individual neural spikes observed on zzso zzso zzso zzso Our method can distinguish large numbers of distinct neural units, even when spikes zzso and accounts for intrinsic zzso of spikes from each zzso As zzso grow larger, it is important to find zzso methods that are zzso that is, the zzso cost of spike fitting should scale well with the number of units zzso Our zzso accomplishes this goal, and is fast, because it exploits the spatial locality of each unit and the basic zzso of zzso signal zzso Human interaction plays a key role in our zzso but effort is minimized and streamlined via a zzso zzso We illustrate our method on data from guinea pig retinal zzso cells and document its performance on simulated data consisting of spikes added to zzso measured background zzso We present several tests demonstrating that the zzso is highly zzso it exhibits low error rates on fits to synthetic data, low zzso violation rates, good receptive field coverage, and consistency across zzso
