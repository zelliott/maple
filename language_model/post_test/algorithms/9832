zzso polarized light zzso zzso is a popular tool for the investigation of zzso zzso in biological zzso zzso the most abundant protein in zzso is such a zzso zzso zzso of results of zzso in terms of collagen network architecture and zzso is challenging, because different collagen networks may yield equal zzso zzso We created a model and used the linear optical behavior of collagen to construct a Jones or Mueller zzso for a zzso cartilage section in an optical zzso zzso zzso sections of zzso were used to validate the basic assumption of the zzso zzso show that information on collagen zzso is needed for the interpretation of zzso results in terms of collagen zzso A zzso that is independent of the optical system and that measures collagen fiber zzso is introduced, and its physical interpretation is zzso With our results, we can zzso which part of different zzso results is due to differences in collagen zzso and which part is due to changes in the collagen zzso Because collagen fiber orientation and zzso are important for tissue function, these results can improve the biological and medical relevance of zzso zzso
