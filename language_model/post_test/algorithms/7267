In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso based zzso cup zzso for glaucoma zzso In the proposed method, each zzso disc image is first zzso into zzso Then mean zzso center surround statistics and the location features are extracted from each zzso to zzso it as cup or zzso The proposed method has been evaluated in one database of 650 images with manual zzso cup boundaries marked by trained professionals and one database of zzso images with diagnostic zzso Experimental results show average overlapping error around zzso compared with manual cup region and area under curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve in glaucoma detection at zzso and zzso in the two databases, much better than other zzso The method could be used for glaucoma zzso
