zzso of aromatic organic zzso zzso acid zzso salicylic acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso onto high area activated carbon cloth from solutions in zzso M zzso in water at natural zzso in zzso M zzso and also from solutions having pH zzso were studied by in zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate law was found to be zzso for the kinetic data of zzso The rates and zzso of zzso of the organic acids were the highest from water or zzso M zzso solutions and the lowest from zzso M zzso zzso The order of rates and zzso of zzso of the four organic acids in each of the four solutions zzso M zzso water, solution of pH zzso and zzso M zzso was determined as zzso approximately zzso These observed orders were explained in terms of zzso zzso and hydrogen bonding interactions between the surface and the zzso species, taking the charge of the carbon surface and the zzso in each solution into zzso zzso of BA in molecular form or in zzso form was analyzed by treating the solution as a mixture of two components and applying zzso law to zzso zzso The zzso zzso data of the systems studied were derived at 30 degrees C and fitted to zzso and zzso zzso
