zzso optimal control protocols for zzso the effects of relaxation and/or zzso zzso on broadband pulse performance are extended to the more difficult problem of designing zzso zzso frequency selective zzso zzso For the demanding case of zzso and zzso equal to the pulse zzso anticipated signal losses can be significantly reduced while achieving nearly ideal frequency zzso zzso in performance are the result of allowing residual zzso zzso after applying zzso selective zzso by zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate simple pulse sequence elements for eliminating this unwanted residual zzso
