zzso are key regulators of zzso gene expression whose fundamental role has already been identified in many cell zzso The correct identification of zzso targets is still a major challenge in zzso and has motivated the development of several zzso methods to overcome inherent limitations of experimental zzso Indeed, the best results reported so far in terms of specificity and sensitivity are associated to machine zzso methods for zzso zzso Following this trend, in the current paper we discuss and explore a zzso prediction method based on a random forest zzso namely zzso Despite its well-known zzso regarding general zzso tasks, to the best of our knowledge, random forest have not been deeply explored for the specific context of predicting zzso zzso Our framework first analyzes alignments between candidate zzso pairs and extracts a set of zzso zzso zzso seed and zzso features, upon which zzso is zzso zzso have shown that zzso zzso several well-known zzso with statistical significance, and that its performance is not impaired by the class imbalance problem or features zzso Moreover, comparing it against other zzso for zzso target prediction using independent test data sets from zzso and zzso we observe a very promising performance, with higher sensitivity in relation to other zzso Finally, tests performed with zzso show the benefits of feature selection even for a zzso with embedded feature importance analysis, and the consistency between relevant features identified and important biological properties for effective zzso gene zzso
