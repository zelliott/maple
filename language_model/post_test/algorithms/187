For real-time zzso of the mouse heart (6 to 13 beats per zzso a back-end processing system involving high-speed signal processing functions to form and display images has been zzso This back-end system was designed with new signal processing zzso to achieve a frame rate of more than 400 images per zzso These zzso were implemented in a simple and cost-effective manner with a single zzso gate array zzso and software programs written in zzso The operating speed of the back-end system was investigated by recording the time required for transferring an image to a personal zzso Experimental results showed that the back-end system is capable of producing 433 images per zzso To evaluate the imaging performance of the back-end system, a complete imaging system was zzso This imaging system, which consisted of a recently reported high-speed mechanical sector scanner assembled with the back-end system, was tested by imaging a wire zzso a pig eye (in zzso and a mouse heart (in zzso It was shown that this system is capable of providing high spatial resolution images with fast zzso zzso
