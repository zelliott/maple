We study the effects of chaotic dynamics on atomic zzso between two zzso coupled zzso zzso driven by a zzso periodic zzso Under the zzso chaos zzso we divide the zzso space into three parts of different types, regular region, zzso region, and zzso region, and give the accurate boundaries between the different zzso It is found that the atomic zzso can be enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso regions, the zzso inversion of the population imbalance is observed zzso
