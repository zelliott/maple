zzso zzso of natural variations in the stable zzso composition of mercury show great promise as a new zzso of mercury sources and chemical transformations in the zzso We strongly suggest that all laboratories adopt a common means of data zzso zzso and nomenclature in order to ensure that data from various laboratories can be easily evaluated and zzso We make suggestions for mass bias zzso reporting of zzso and zzso isotope variations, and a standard protocol for reporting zzso zzso We also present our measured values for isotope ratios in several mercury standard zzso
