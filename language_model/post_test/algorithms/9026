The diagnosis of transient regional zzso zzso zzso in patients presenting with stable chest pain is a zzso Exercise zzso Test zzso is no longer recommended in most cases due to its zzso Alternative tests are more expensive and less readily zzso The zzso Delta map is an intuitive color display of digitally zzso zzso shift derived from two zzso zzso recordings at baseline and at peak stress, and has shown promise as a tool for detection of zzso 

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of zzso Delta map as a tool to detect zzso using zzso stress zzso gated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso as a zzso 

Forty consecutive patients were recruited who were referred for zzso with a history of zzso zzso The zzso Delta map was derived from two zzso body surface mapping system recordings carried out simultaneously with zzso at zzso baseline and zzso peak zzso zzso Standard zzso zzso were also recorded at the same time zzso 

The mean patient age was zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Using zzso as the reference the sensitivity of zzso Delta map was zzso zzso and specificity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso negative likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitive of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and specificity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso negative likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Delta map is more sensitive and specific zzso zzso test zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso for zzso Delta map were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

This pilot study confirms the feasibility of using Delta map in this context and suggests that it has promising diagnostic accuracy and is superior to the zzso zzso It could potentially represent a clinically suitable screening tool for zzso in patients presenting with stable chest pain, since it is near patient and requires little specialist training for acquisition and zzso A larger clinical study is now zzso
