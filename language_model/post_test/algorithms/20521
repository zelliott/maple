This paper describes zzso a genetic zzso zzso that generates and evaluates plans in the complex domain of military maneuver zzso zzso contributions are to demonstrate an effective application of zzso technology to a complex real world planning problem, and to provide an understanding of the properties needed in a zzso solution to meet the challenges of decision support in complex zzso Previous obstacles to applying zzso technology to maneuver planning include the lack of efficient zzso for determining the fitness of zzso zzso simulations would zzso be used to evaluate these plans, but most such simulations typically require several hours to assess a single zzso Since a zzso needs to quickly generate and evaluate thousands of plans, these methods are too zzso To solve this problem we developed an efficient zzso zzso that uses zzso representations of this problem domain to allow appropriate yet intelligent zzso between zzso efficiency and zzso An additional challenge was that users needed a diverse set of significantly different plan options from which to zzso Typical zzso tend to develop a group of zzso solutions that may be very similar (or zzso to each zzso This may not provide users with sufficient zzso We addressed this problem by adding a zzso strategy to the selection mechanism to insure diversity in the solution set, providing users with a more satisfactory range of zzso zzso impact will be in providing decision support to time constrained and cognitively overloaded zzso to help them rapidly explore options, create plans, and better cope with the information demands of modern zzso
