Fluorescence diffuse optical zzso is an emerging technology for molecular imaging with recent technological advances in zzso and zzso The introduction of zzso imaging methods enables very large-scale data acquisition that is orders of magnitude larger than that from earlier zzso In this study, the effects of sampling strategy on image quality were investigated using an imaging phantom mimicking small animals and further analyzed using singular value analysis zzso The sampling strategy was represented in terms of a number of key acquisition zzso namely the numbers of sources, zzso and imaging zzso A number of metrics were defined to zzso evaluate image zzso The effects of acquisition parameters on image quality were subsequently studied by varying each of the parameters within a reasonable range while maintaining the other parameters constant, a method analogue to partial zzso in mathematical zzso It was found that image quality improves at a much slower rate if the acquisition parameters are above certain critical values zzso 5 sources, approximately 15 zzso and approximately 20 angles for our zzso These critical values remain virtually the same even if other acquisition parameters are zzso It was also found that increasing different acquisition parameters improves image quality with different efficiencies in terms of the number of zzso for a system characterized by a smaller threshold in zzso (less than zzso in our zzso the number of sources is the most efficient, followed by the number of detectors and subsequently the number of imaging zzso However, for systems characterized by a larger zzso the numbers of sources and angles are equally more efficient than the number of zzso
