The judgment of the imaging quality of an optical system can be carried out by examining its zzso intensity zzso It has been shown in a previous paper that a zzso analysis of the imaging process according to the extended zzso theory allows the retrieval of the complex zzso function of the imaging system, including aberrations as well as transmission zzso However, the zzso of the zzso analysis is limited to systems with a zzso zzso zzso value of the order of zzso or less; beyond these values polarization effects become zzso In this zzso retrieval method, the complex zzso function is represented by means of the zzso of its expansion in a series involving the zzso zzso This representation is highly efficient, in terms of number and magnitude of the required zzso and lends itself quite well to matching procedures in the focal zzso This zzso the method from the retrieval schemes in the literature, which are normally not based on zzso expansions, and rather rely on point-by-point matching zzso In a previous paper zzso zzso zzso zzso A 20, zzso zzso we have incorporated the extended zzso approach into the zzso zzso for the zzso treatment of optical systems with high zzso In the present paper we further develop this approach by defining an appropriate set of functions that describe the energy density distribution in the focal zzso Using this more refined analysis, we establish the set of equations that allow the retrieval of aberrations and zzso from the intensity zzso function in the focal volume for zzso zzso It is shown that one needs four analyses of the intensity distribution in the image volume with different states of polarization in the entrance zzso Only in this way will it be possible to retrieve the zzso zzso function that includes the effects of zzso induced by the imaging zzso A first zzso test example is presented that illustrates the importance of using the zzso approach and the correct zzso value in the aberration retrieval zzso
