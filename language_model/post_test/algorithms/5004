In determining differential expression in zzso zzso experiments, the expression level of an individual gene is usually assumed to be independent of the expression levels of other zzso but many recent studies have shown that a zzso expression level tends to be similar to that of its neighbors on a zzso and zzso expressed zzso genes are likely to form clusters of similar zzso activity along the zzso When modeled as a one-dimensional spatial series, the expression level of genes on the same zzso frequently exhibit significant spatial zzso reflecting spatial patterns in zzso By modeling these spatial zzso we can obtain improved estimates of transcript zzso Here, we demonstrate the existence of spatial correlations in zzso activity in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso across more than 50 experimental zzso Based on this finding, we propose a zzso zzso model that borrows information from neighboring genes to improve the zzso of the expression level of a given gene and hence the detection of DE zzso Furthermore, we extend the model to account for the circular structure of zzso coli zzso and the zzso distance between gene zzso The simulation studies and analysis of real data examples in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso show that the proposed method zzso the commonly used significant analysis of zzso zzso zzso in detecting DE zzso
