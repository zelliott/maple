We demonstrate the efficiency of the zzso using an zzso zzso window to zzso zzso data in zzso for zzso optical zzso zzso zzso We extend our previous experimental demonstration that was performed with a specific zzso zzso The method is now applied to zzso zzso data obtained for various simulated zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso data obtained from both simulations and zzso zzso show that the new zzso method is the most efficient for handling all the different types of zzso in the zzso domain that one can encounter in normal zzso The efficiency of the method is evaluated through comparison with common methods using zzso through zzso prior to performing a zzso transform and with the accurate but time-consuming discrete zzso transform for zzso spaced data, which involves zzso zzso
