To validate zzso decomposition zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in zzso zzso zzso patients with dynamic zzso zzso MR zzso 

Thirty-four zzso patients zzso age zzso years; range zzso were examined on a zzso MR zzso For zzso MR imaging, sets of lung images were acquired using an zzso two-dimensional balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso images were obtained after correction of the breathing displacement and zzso analysis of the cardiac frequency from the zzso data zzso zzso data sets were acquired with a three-dimensional zzso echo zzso The zzso and zzso images were visually assessed for zzso defects by two readers independently zzso zzso using a field based scoring system zzso Software was used for zzso impairment evaluation zzso of segmented lung images using an automated zzso Both imaging and evaluation methods were compared for agreement and tested for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso 

Good or acceptable zzso agreement was found between zzso and zzso for visual and automated zzso zzso upper and lower limits of agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A high zzso was found between visual and automated scoring zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging provides equivalent diagnostic information to zzso MR imaging in zzso zzso zzso assessment of regional zzso defects using zzso and zzso MR imaging is comparable to visual scoring but allows for zzso zzso
