This is the final paper in a Comments and zzso series dedicated to zzso identification of interacting networks in the brain using zzso Model selection, causality and zzso We argue that discovering effective connectivity depends critically on zzso models with zzso informed observation and state zzso These models have to be endowed with zzso on unknown parameters and afford checks for model zzso We consider the similarities and differences among Dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso Modeling and other zzso We establish links between past and current statistical zzso zzso in terms of zzso dependency zzso and zzso influence zzso We show that some of the challenges faced in this field have promising solutions and speculate on future zzso
