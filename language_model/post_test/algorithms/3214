We derive the new zzso partial differential equation zzso models based on the zzso methods for filtering in electronic zzso pattern zzso phase fringe zzso In the filtering methods based on the oriented zzso models, filtering along fringe orientation for the entire image is simply realized through solving the zzso zzso without having to zzso establish the small filtering window along the fringe orientation and move this filtering window over each zzso in an zzso We test the proposed models on two zzso zzso phase fringe patterns and an zzso obtained phase fringe pattern, respectively, in which the fringe density is zzso and compare our models with related zzso zzso Further, we zzso evaluate the performance of these zzso models with a comparative zzso named the image zzso We also compare the zzso time of our method with that of a traditional filtering method along the fringe zzso The experimental results demonstrate the performance of our new oriented zzso zzso
