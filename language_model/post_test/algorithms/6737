The zzso connectivity in 39 zzso crystal structures has been zzso and described using graph set zzso The zzso connectivity observed is used to gain information on zzso preferences of specific donor and zzso atoms of related zzso zzso The zzso zzso show a greater preference for hydrogen bonding to zzso zzso and zzso guests, whereas the zzso zzso show a greater preference for hydrogen bonding to zzso zzso forming the only dominant zzso pattern, a chain with an eight atom repeat zzso zzso hydrogen bonding between the zzso group and the guest zzso group was observed in five zzso structures of zzso zzso displays a zzso and a zzso motif not seen in any other zzso zzso and zzso differing by a zzso group, show no similarity in zzso pattern, whereas zzso and zzso which have zzso similar but chemically different zzso show a striking similarity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also show a large variation in zzso pattern between zzso Studies such as this, by revealing details of zzso patterns in closely related organic crystal structures, can potentially provide zzso capability among the crystal structures of pharmaceutical zzso
