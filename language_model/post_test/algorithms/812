In this paper, we present a method for the automated detection of zzso and zzso border in sequential zzso ultrasound zzso zzso The method is based on the use of zzso zzso The energy function is appropriately modified and minimized using a zzso neural zzso Proper modifications in the definition of the bias of the zzso have been introduced to incorporate image zzso A simulated zzso scheme is included to ensure convergence at a global zzso The method overcomes zzso in the expected image pattern, due to the presence of zzso employing a specialized structure of the neural network and boundary correction zzso which are based on a zzso knowledge about the vessel zzso The proposed method is evaluated using sequences of zzso frames from 18 zzso zzso some of them indicating zzso zzso The obtained results demonstrate that our method is statistically accurate, zzso and capable to identify the regions of interest in sequences of zzso zzso
