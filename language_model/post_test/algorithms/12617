The objective of this work was to determine the clinical accuracy of zzso a new zzso continuous zzso monitoring system zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation was performed using continuous zzso grid analysis zzso as recommended by the Performance zzso for Continuous zzso zzso zzso Approved zzso zzso 

Two independent clinical trials were carried out on patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes zzso the zzso levels of whom were monitored in an in-home setting for 100-hour zzso A new zzso zzso was developed and used to compensate in real-time the zzso zzso The time lag between continuous zzso monitoring zzso and reference data was first estimated using the zzso plot zzso The entire set of zzso data pairs was then evaluated following the zzso criteria, which allowed an zzso of the combined point and rate accuracy zzso by zzso zzso 

With an estimated time lag of 11 minutes, the linear zzso analysis of the zzso zzso values yielded r zzso zzso The mean absolute error zzso was zzso zzso The calculated mean absolute rate zzso zzso was zzso zzso The data points falling within the zzso zones of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso 

The zzso system provided reliable, real-time measurement of subcutaneous zzso levels in patients with diabetes for up to 100 zzso The device showed the ability to follow rapid zzso excursions and detect severe zzso events zzso Its accuracy parameters fitted the criteria of the state-of-the-art consensus zzso for zzso with highly consistent results from two independent zzso
