This paper presents a novel system capable of solving the problem of tracking multiple targets in a crowded, complex and dynamic indoor environment, like those typical of mobile robot zzso The proposed solution is based on a stereo vision set in the acquisition step and a zzso zzso in the obstacles position zzso zzso The system zzso zzso position and speed information related to each object in the zzso zzso then it achieves a zzso between building elements zzso walls, columns and so on) and the rest of items in robot zzso All objects in robot surroundings, both dynamic and static, are considered to be obstacles but the structure of the environment zzso A combination of a zzso zzso and a deterministic zzso process is used in order to obtain a zzso representation of speed and position of detected zzso Performance of the final system has been tested against state of the art zzso test results validate the zzso zzso The designed zzso and procedures provide a solution to those applications where similar zzso data structures are zzso
