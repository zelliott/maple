To study the role of zzso carbon monoxide zzso in collagen metabolism during hypoxic pulmonary vascular zzso a total of 18 zzso rats were used in the study and they were randomly divided into three groups: zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso with zinc zzso zzso group zzso zzso 6) and control group zzso zzso zzso The measurement of mean pulmonary artery pressure zzso and zzso zzso formation in lung tissue zzso was zzso A zzso analysis of pulmonary vessels was performed, in which the percentage of zzso arteries zzso partially zzso arteries zzso and zzso arteries zzso in small and median pulmonary vessels, relative zzso thickness zzso and relative zzso area zzso of pulmonary arteries were zzso zzso type I and III and transforming growth zzso zzso expressions were detected by zzso zzso The expressions of zzso type I and III and zzso zzso were detected by in zzso zzso The results showed that zzso significantly increased zzso and markedly decreased zzso formation in lung tissue zzso in rats under zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso rats treated with zzso the percentage of zzso arteries of small and median pulmonary vessels was obviously increased, and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pulmonary arteries were markedly increased compared with hypoxic zzso zzso changes, such as zzso and zzso of zzso cells zzso and smooth muscle cells zzso and the increased number of zzso in synthetic zzso were found in zzso pulmonary zzso arteries of hypoxic rats treated with zzso Meanwhile, zzso promoted the expression of collagen type I and III and zzso protein in pulmonary arteries of rats under zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso elevated obviously the expressions of zzso type I and III zzso and zzso zzso in pulmonary arteries of rats under zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this study suggested that zzso played an important role in promoting collagen synthesis in pulmonary arteries of rats with hypoxic pulmonary structural zzso by increasing the expression of zzso The above findings also suggested a possible role of zzso CO in the zzso of chronic hypoxic pulmonary zzso
