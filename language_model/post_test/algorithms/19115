Most proteins are only marginally stable at zzso zzso Thus a common zzso due to zzso is the loss of protein stability, resulting in loss of their zzso structures and functions at their functioning zzso zzso of protein stability change upon zzso has attracted a large number of experimental and theoretical zzso In this work, we have extended the zzso theory that is originally used for predicting stability changes of charged zzso to predicting stability changes of all zzso To achieve this, we have proposed a free energy model covering both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso model for the zzso state that incorporates both zzso and randomness of the zzso state has been used to calculate the zzso contribution to protein zzso The new model is zzso simple and fast, and performs well for charged and zzso zzso for all four tested zzso Future directions for extending the method into zzso effect and more accurate prediction for polar zzso are zzso
