The analysis of zzso molecular data in the context of zzso pathways is essential to uncover their underlying functional zzso Among different zzso zzso concepts in systems biology, elementary flux modes zzso hold a zzso place, as they naturally capture the complexity and plasticity of cellular metabolism and go beyond zzso zzso zzso However, their use to interpret zzso data has been limited so far, mainly because their zzso in zzso zzso networks has been zzso To face this issue, different zzso techniques have been recently introduced and their application to human metabolism is zzso 

In this article, we exploit and zzso the zzso zzso zzso to determine a subset of zzso in a human zzso zzso zzso This subset of zzso involves a wide number of reported human zzso zzso as well as potential novel routes, and constitutes a valuable database where zzso data can be mapped and zzso from a zzso zzso To illustrate this, we took expression data of 10 healthy human zzso from a previous study and predicted their characteristic zzso based on enrichment zzso We used a zzso zzso test and showed that it leads to more biologically meaningful results than standard zzso Finally, a biological discussion on the characteristic zzso obtained in liver is conducted, finding a high level of agreement when compared with the zzso
