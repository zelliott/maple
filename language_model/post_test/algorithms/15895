Previous findings regarding the relationship between work stress and alcohol consumption are inconsistent and zzso One of the primary reasons for the inconsistency of the findings is that simple models, such as multiple zzso analysis or analysis of zzso zzso have been conventionally adopted in studies examining the relationship between work zzso and alcohol zzso Since higher order interactions of multiple work zzso which lead to heavy alcohol consumption, might not be fully uncovered within the framework of a multiple zzso analysis or zzso another approach to exploring the interactions of work zzso is presented in this zzso 

A signal detection analysis method was used to evaluate higher order interactions of work stress variables and to obtain basic information on 465 Japanese male white-collar zzso 

Of 11 work zzso or work position zzso four significant zzso of heavy alcohol consumption were zzso 

Two procedures were successfully performed in this zzso zzso evaluating several higher order interactions of work zzso associated with heavy alcohol consumption, and zzso obtaining basic information to permit dividing the subjects into zzso for further analysis using models and independent variables unique to each zzso
