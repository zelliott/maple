A new method that extracts phase directly from randomly zzso zzso is zzso In this method, the background intensity and the zzso zzso are determined by a zzso method and used as the system parameters and then the phase is extracted from one single zzso by arc zzso function with range of zzso zzso By zzso the extracted phase distribution into watershed regions and determining the sign of phase in each region, the extracted phase is recovered to its principle phase with range of zzso zzso zzso simulation and experiment are implemented to verify the effectiveness of this zzso The method has applications in both zzso and dynamic phase zzso
