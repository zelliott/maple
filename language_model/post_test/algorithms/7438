We propose to couple the method of fundamental solutions zzso to the force zzso method zzso The resulting method is an efficient, easy to program, zzso method for flows at low Reynolds numbers with zzso zzso In such an approach, the flow domain is extended across the solid particle phase, and the flow is zzso by a zzso of singular zzso positioned outside the flow domain and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso To improve the efficiency of the zzso we propose new MFS zzso for the zzso of the volume zzso required for the zzso These are exact and do not require the expensive evaluation of zzso The proposed method has been developed in the context of investigations of the fluid dynamics of zzso that is, a pathological condition of the semicircular canals of the inner zzso zzso examples are presented to illustrate the zzso of the zzso
