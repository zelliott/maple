A fuzzy approach has been applied to inverse treatment planning zzso in radiation zzso The proposed zzso zzso zzso both the zzso beam zzso and the normal tissue zzso In the zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso method that has the property of fast and zzso convergence to the minimum for a constrained zzso objective zzso In addition, a fuzzy weight function is employed to express the vague knowledge about the importance of matching the calculated dose to the prescribed dose in the normal zzso Then, a zzso function is established to zzso the normal tissue zzso The performance of this new fuzzy prescription zzso has been compared to that based on hard prescription methods for two treatment zzso The zzso method presented here both provides a zzso solution to the zzso of zzso beams, and guarantees fast and zzso convergence to the zzso It has been shown that the fuzzy inverse planning technique is capable of achieving an optimal balance between the objective of matching the calculated dose to the prescribed dose for the target volume and the objective of minimizing the normal tissue zzso
