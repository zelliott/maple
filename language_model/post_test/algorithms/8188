The zzso D syndrome zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disease caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Our objective was to define a clinical criterion able to exclude zzso without the need of genetic zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was applied to derive the clinical criterion in 149 patients with genetic testing in a French laboratory, among whom 35 had zzso The criterion was validated in 93 patients with genetic testing in a Dutch laboratory, among whom 28 had zzso 

The most zzso composite clinical criterion satisfied by all patients with zzso in the derivation group was zzso age zzso 5 years old OR zzso pain during attacks AND length of attacks zzso 14 zzso It had a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the validation zzso If genetic testing had been limited to patients fulfilling this zzso 18 tests zzso would have been avoided in this highly selected validation sample, without missing a single patient with zzso 

Even among patients already selected by expert physicians, this criterion could help prevent unnecessary genetic testing, which is zzso and zzso
