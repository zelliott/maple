To develop a new automated zzso method for vessel zzso in vascular zzso zzso 

zzso marker bands mounted zzso on a small zzso were acquired in zzso at five image zzso zzso sizes in zzso projection zzso The positions of the marker centers were detected by using a zzso transform and were zzso at zzso precision by using either a novel, zzso zzso approach zzso or a symmetry zzso zzso procedures were used to reject zzso marker zzso and to calculate zzso zzso The zzso factor was calculated from the true marker distance and the average of the measured distances in zzso zzso were compared statistically with a grid zzso method, which was taken as the gold zzso A simulation study was performed to assess the influence of image noise on the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso method was zzso and faster than the zzso zzso For four II sizes zzso 20, 25, and 31 zzso the results from the zzso method were not significantly different from the results obtained with grid zzso For the II size of 38 zzso a significant difference zzso of the grid zzso zzso was zzso however, this was caused by the zzso error in the image data and was not clinically zzso In general, the performance of the zzso method improved with increasing zzso zzso 

A practical new zzso method for small zzso sizes was developed and validated for quantitative vascular zzso
