The aim of this work was to study, in zzso and in zzso the behavior of a skin zzso film containing zzso The film characterization included drug transport studies through skin in zzso and in zzso tape stripping with and without zzso We studied the effect of drug loading in order to identify the release zzso Finally, the release rate was compared with a zzso commercial zzso to assess the therapeutic zzso From the data obtained it can be concluded that the zzso film acts as a zzso zzso patch on application to the zzso The zzso zzso across the skin was not zzso but the patch acted as a zzso controlling drug zzso Additionally, the zzso rate increased with drug zzso The in zzso experiments with tape stripping indicated that the presence of water during film application is essential to achieve not only the proper zzso but also an effective zzso The application of electric current to the patch can further increase the amount of drug accumulated in the stratum zzso
