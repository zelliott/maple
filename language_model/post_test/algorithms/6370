The Hutchinson metric is a natural measure of the zzso between two images for use in zzso image zzso An efficient solution to the problem of computing the Hutchinson metric between two arbitrary digitized images is zzso The technique proposed here, based on the shape of the objects as projected on the digitized screen, can be used as an effective way to establish the error between the original and the, possibly zzso zzso zzso To test the performance of our method, we apply it to compare pairs of zzso objects, as well as to compare real-world images with the corresponding reconstructed zzso
