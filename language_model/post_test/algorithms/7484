zzso of zzso and indicators of zzso status in the zzso brain could be zzso of later neurological zzso zzso imaging of zzso could thus serve to develop zzso zzso however, accurate zzso of zzso content is zzso In this work we show that measurement of the zzso water fraction zzso is achievable using widely available pulse sequences and state-of-the-art zzso zzso of the MR zzso We show results of zzso water fraction measurement at both 30 (4 zzso and 40 (2 zzso weeks equivalent zzso age zzso and show that the spatial pattern of zzso is different between these zzso zzso we apply a zzso fitting routine to zzso diffusion weighted data to show differences in zzso density and local spatial arrangement in zzso and white zzso Finally we combine these results to investigate the relationships between the diffusion and zzso zzso to show that zzso in the zzso brain may be measured alongside zzso diffusion characteristics using clinically feasible MR zzso
