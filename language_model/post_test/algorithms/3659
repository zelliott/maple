Several genes involved in the cellular import of copper and its subsequent incorporation into the zzso iron transport complex in zzso zzso are known to be zzso between zzso and zzso However, the degree to which these genes share their functional context as members of the same zzso in the zzso domain is less zzso 

The zzso of gene families involved in zzso copper transport in the zzso and zzso structures of 80 zzso zzso was zzso For this purpose, we developed a Web tool zzso to display the zzso context for a given set of zzso In total, a set of 43 putative zzso was zzso These were found to be involved in a variety of pathways and indicate a large diversity in the functional context of the individual gene family zzso 

The zzso tool can be found at zzso supplemental data are available at zzso
