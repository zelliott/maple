The paper presents machine learning zzso models that predict zzso in the zzso basin of the Port of zzso The important factors affecting the zzso process such as waves, wind, zzso surge, river zzso zzso are zzso the corresponding time series data is zzso missing values are estimated and the most important variables behind the process are chosen as the zzso Two zzso methods are zzso zzso ANN and zzso model zzso The latter is a collection of zzso linear zzso models, each being an expert for a particular region of the input zzso The models are trained on the data collected during zzso and tested by the data of zzso The zzso accuracy of the models is found to be adequate for the potential use in the operational decision zzso
