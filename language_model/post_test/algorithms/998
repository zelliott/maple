This paper deals with the clinical application value of zzso formula for cardiac stroke volume calculation from the angle of zzso model simulation by zzso finite element zzso In the process of computer zzso we have made a comparison between the result of model zzso the specific value of zzso formula for cardiac stroke volume zzso and the theoretical value of the prescribed zzso The simulation results showed that an approximately linear relationship exists between the zzso change and the blood volume change of the zzso in the model, which has proved that zzso formula for cardiac stroke volume calculation has great clinical application zzso On the other hand, the new method has opened up a path for studying the basic theory of zzso zzso
