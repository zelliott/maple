Tablet production involves zzso of free flowing powder in an enclosed cavity of defined zzso The complexity of the powder bed system zzso that a way be found to better understand what occurs during zzso One such approach is by means of zzso zzso of which, the zzso and zzso equations are the best zzso This work attempts to zzso evaluate the zzso of the effective medium zzso equation introduced by zzso et zzso zzso to powder zzso Two powder types zzso zzso and zzso zzso each consisting of three size zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and compressed to a pressure of zzso These zzso were chosen because of their differing mechanical zzso An zzso which is inherent in the zzso equation is exposed by varying the starting points of zzso and can yield insights into zzso zzso Such zzso regions were observed once plastic particle deformation started to dominate the zzso zzso and enabled the determination of the point where particle zzso zzso
