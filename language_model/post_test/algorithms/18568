This paper introduces an automatic robust zzso identification zzso using the zzso test score also known as the PRESS zzso zzso zzso of zzso statistic and zzso zzso least zzso The proposed zzso aims to achieve zzso model zzso via two effective and complementary approaches, zzso zzso via zzso zzso and model optimal zzso structure zzso The major contributions are to derive the PRESS error in a zzso zzso weight model, develop an efficient zzso zzso formula for PRESS errors in the zzso zzso least squares forward zzso framework and hence construct a model with a good zzso zzso Based on the properties of the PRESS statistic the proposed zzso can achieve a fully automated model construction procedure without resort to any other validation data set for model zzso
