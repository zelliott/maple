A method to determine zzso for an imaging system is zzso This method uses zzso test and is different in that the value of zzso of the system can be determined without depending on any particular zzso Two different sizes of zzso for a common system were investigated and the corresponding zzso were compared with those calculated by a lens design zzso In addition, the determined zzso are proved to be consistent with other values obtained in this zzso
