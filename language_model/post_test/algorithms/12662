Architectural distortion is an important sign of breast cancer, but because of its subtlety, it is a common cause of zzso findings on screening zzso This paper presents methods for the detection of architectural distortion in zzso of zzso cancer cases taken prior to the detection of breast cancer using zzso zzso phase portrait analysis, zzso analysis, and texture zzso The methods were used to detect initial candidates for sites of architectural distortion in prior zzso of zzso cancer and also normal control zzso A total of zzso regions of interest zzso were automatically obtained from 106 prior zzso of 56 zzso cancer cases, including 301 zzso related to architectural zzso and from 52 prior zzso of 13 normal zzso For each zzso the zzso dimension and zzso texture features were zzso Feature selection was performed separately using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The best results zzso in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, with the features selected by zzso zzso zzso are zzso with the zzso zzso zzso with Fisher linear zzso analysis, zzso with an artificial neural network based on zzso basis functions, and zzso with a support zzso zzso Analysis of the performance of the methods with zzso receiver operating characteristics indicated a sensitivity of zzso at zzso false zzso per zzso The methods have good potential in detecting architectural distortion in zzso of zzso cancer zzso
