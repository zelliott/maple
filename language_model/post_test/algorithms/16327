In this paper, we propose a modified electronic zzso zzso method for low-cost portable ultrasound zzso This method uses a unique combination of analog and digital zzso zzso Two versions of zzso zzso are presented in this zzso zzso (4 different time delays or phase zzso and zzso (8 different time delays or phase zzso The advantage of this method is that a system with 4 to 8 transmit channels and 2 receive channels with a network of switches can be used to focus an array with 64 to 128 zzso The simulation and experimental results show that zzso zzso image quality is comparable to traditional zzso zzso zzso in terms of spatial resolution and zzso ratio zzso under certain system zzso With an zzso of 2 and 50% signal zzso the experimental lateral zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso pulse lengths are zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The experimental zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso These experimental results are in good agreement with simulation zzso
