zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is a potential candidate to be used in commercial processes to convert simple zzso compounds to a variety of zzso chemicals and zzso To better understand zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso at the systems level, zzso profiling tools were developed and applied in this zzso Comprehensive two-dimensional gas zzso coupled with zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso zzso organic zzso and to identify the zzso differences between cells grown on methanol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, a list of compounds that included zzso acids and major zzso of central zzso and zzso metabolism were studied as target zzso For these, zzso zzso were obtained for absolute zzso by zzso different amounts of standard zzso to cell zzso Parallel factor analysis zzso was used for accurate peak zzso Unknown chemical differences between cells grown on methanol and zzso were identified by applying Fisher ratio analysis at a selective mass channel zzso zzso zzso compounds were discovered to be statistically zzso expressed between zzso and zzso zzso Among these, 13 were identified by matching to library mass zzso and the rest were novel compounds that were not included in zzso These zzso expressed compounds have provided clues to new pathways that are specifically linked to zzso zzso
