When studying three-dimensional motion of zzso spine segments in zzso it is often desirable to report the zzso at the individual zzso levels in terms of each zzso local coordinates zzso A novel technique is described for constructing local zzso coordinate axes using a standard zzso zzso 

To describe a technique that was developed to allow researchers to relate zzso landmarks to optical markers and to set the local coordinate axes of several zzso accurately through a short, simple procedure performed only once at the beginning of a spine testing zzso 

Other researchers have used zzso and careful marker placement for establishing the coordinate systems of zzso and the relationships of zzso landmarks to optical zzso The authors found no publications giving details of how zzso coordinate systems are established from zzso zzso 

A zzso probe is used to identify zzso landmarks and to relate these landmarks to optical markers attached to the zzso An zzso is described zzso zzso coordinate axes are constructed from the zzso 

The method described has been implemented successfully in a computerized in zzso spinal flexibility testing system that plots each individual motion segment's zzso zzso in real time during zzso The proposed technique is less labor intensive and error prone than the earlier methods because landmarks are identified zzso 

The described technique quickly, easily, and accurately relates zzso landmarks to optical markers and zzso local coordinate zzso two steps that are necessary before monitoring the zzso of individual motion segments during zzso spine zzso
