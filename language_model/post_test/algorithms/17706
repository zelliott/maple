Numerous symptoms have been associated with the zzso syndrome zzso including changes in zzso zzso Heart rate zzso zzso provides zzso data about the zzso regulation of heart rate in real-life zzso The aims of the study were to: zzso characterize the zzso profile of seven athletes zzso diagnosed as suffering of zzso compared with eight healthy sedentary zzso and eight trained zzso subjects during zzso rest and 60 degrees zzso and zzso compare the traditional zzso and zzso analysis assessment of zzso with the zzso zzso plot zzso In the latter each zzso zzso is plotted as a function of the previous one, and the standard zzso of the instantaneous zzso and long-term zzso zzso zzso are zzso Total power was higher in T than in C and zzso both in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for C, T and zzso zzso and in upright zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for C, T and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso position, indicators of zzso activity to the zzso zzso were higher in T compared with C and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for C, T and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for C, T and zzso zzso zzso zzso had a marked predominance of sympathetic activity regardless of the position zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso position for C, T and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in upright position for C, T and zzso zzso The changes in zzso indexes induced by the upright posture were greater in T than in zzso The shape of the zzso plots allowed the distinction between the three groups, with wide and narrow shapes in T and zzso respectively, compared with zzso As zzso plot parameters are easy to zzso and associated with the zzso of the scatter gram, they corroborate the traditional zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that they could be used to indicate fatigue and/or prevent zzso
