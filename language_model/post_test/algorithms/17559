This paper zzso and studies a model of periodic delayed neural zzso This model can well describe many practical zzso of delayed neural networks, which is zzso of some additive delayed neural networks such as delayed zzso neural networks and delayed cellular neural networks, under a zzso environment, particularly when the network parameters and input stimuli are varied periodically with zzso Without assuming the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso functions, the two functional issues on zzso dynamics of this periodic networks, zzso the existence and global exponential stability of its periodic solutions, are zzso Some explicit and conclusive results are established, which are natural extension and zzso of the corresponding results existing in the zzso Furthermore, some examples and simulations are presented to illustrate the practical nature of the new zzso
