The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of repetitions to be used in competition trials of popcorn traits related to production and quality, including grain yield and expansion zzso The experiments were conducted in 3 environments representative of the north and northwest regions of the State of Rio de zzso with 10 Brazilian zzso of zzso consisting by 4 commercial hybrids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4 improved varieties zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso and zzso and 2 experimental populations zzso and zzso The experimental design zzso was a zzso complete block design with 7 zzso The zzso method was employed to obtain samples of all of the possible combinations within the 7 zzso zzso the confidence intervals of the parameters of interest were calculated for all simulated data zzso The optimal number of repetition for all of the traits was considered when all of the estimates of the parameters in question were encountered within the confidence zzso The estimates of the number of repetitions varied according to the zzso estimated, variable zzso and environment zzso ranging from 2 to zzso It is believed that only the expansion capacity traits in the zzso zzso environment (for residual zzso and zzso of zzso and number of ears per plot, in the zzso environment (for zzso of zzso needed 7 repetitions to fall within the confidence zzso Thus, for the 3 studies conducted, we can conclude that 6 repetitions are optimal for obtaining high experimental zzso
