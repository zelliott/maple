In support of zzso imaging system performance zzso an zzso triangle orientation discrimination zzso model is zzso Specifically, with the characteristic of the test pattern related to spectrum, the mathematical equations for predicting the zzso threshold of the system with distributed fusion architecture in the zzso spectrum band are derived based on human vision with the zzso fusion rule, with emphasis on the impacts of fusion on the zzso Furthermore, a figure of merit Q related to the zzso calculation results is introduced to analyze the relation of the discrimination performance of zzso imaging system to the size and the spectral difference of test zzso The preliminary validation with the experiment results suggests that our proposed model can provide a reasonable prediction of the performance for a zzso imaging zzso
