Based on previous studies related to the zzso cell cycle, it is well known that the underlying cellular network in zzso consists of many interactions between genes that have periodic expression patterns during the cell division zzso In this study, it is proposed that cell zzso gene expression can be understood as a phenomenon of collective synchronization or, in other words, an ensemble of zzso zzso response signals from different zzso zzso we aimed to apply the theory of statistical zzso phase synchronization to understand the cell's zzso zzso as a phenomenon of collective zzso To this end, a novel zzso called zzso zzso with statistical Phase zzso zzso is proposed and evaluated using zzso cell zzso gene expression zzso From the evaluation experiments, we draw the following zzso 1) It is possible to find groups of genes that have biological interactions with each other and significantly share gene zzso slim terms of biological processes using the theory of zzso phase synchronization with cell zzso gene expression zzso 2) Among all output clusters of zzso a relatively large cluster with high zzso with respect to its trained mean field can be considered a prominent zzso 3) For each zzso it is possible to identify the degree of the strength of its biological interactions with other genes using the zzso strength of synchronization with its trained mean field; and 4) It is feasible to understand cell zzso expression patterns as a phenomenon of collective zzso
