Surface zzso zzso signals detected over the skin surface may be zzso of signals generated by many active muscles due to poor spatial selectivity of the zzso In this paper, we propose a new method for blind source separation zzso of zzso signals modeled as linear instantaneous zzso The method is based on zzso of the observations and rotation of the zzso zzso The rotation is performed by joint zzso of a set of spatial zzso zzso zzso The zzso depend on the selection of the mother zzso which can be defined by zzso parameters via the lattice zzso within the zzso analysis zzso As the sources are classically supposed to be mutually zzso the design parameters of the mother zzso can be blindly zzso by minimizing the average (over time zzso cross correlation between the estimated zzso The method was tested on simulated and experimental surface zzso signals and results were compared with those obtained with spatial zzso zzso and with zzso statistics zzso spectral zzso On a set of simulated signals, for zzso zzso ratio zzso the zzso zzso between original and estimated sources was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso leading to the poorest performance, zzso zzso zzso with zzso distribution, zzso zzso zzso with zzso distribution, and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso In experimental conditions, when the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso active for 50% of the time, zzso was zzso zzso zzso before zzso and was reduced to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the worst zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso distribution, zzso zzso zzso with zzso distribution, and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso In conclusion, the proposed approach resulted in better performance than previous methods for the separation of zzso zzso zzso
