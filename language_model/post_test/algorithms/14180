To evaluate the accuracy of a new method of zzso lens zzso power calculation for eyes having cataract extraction after previous laser in zzso zzso zzso 

Clinical private practice and ambulatory surgical center, Astoria, New York, zzso 

This retrospective study was of 12 eyes of 9 patients who presented for cataract extraction after previous zzso zzso removal was performed under topical zzso without zzso zzso zzso 30 minutes later, a manifest zzso refraction was zzso The calculation of the zzso power was obtained by using an zzso derived from previous experience with secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso The patient then returned to the operating room for lens zzso zzso refraction zzso 

The zzso error 2 weeks zzso defined as the difference between the intended and actual zzso outcome, ranged from zzso zzso zzso of unintended zzso to zzso zzso of unintended zzso 

The zzso refraction technique provided an extremely accurate zzso refraction in eyes having cataract with zzso zzso surgery after previous zzso Although the pool sample was small (12 zzso and the range of the zzso refraction was limited zzso to zzso zzso the technique was found to be remarkably zzso
