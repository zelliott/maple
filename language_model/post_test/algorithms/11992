zzso methods have attracted less attention than their zzso counterparts for cure rate zzso In this paper, we study a general zzso mixture zzso The zzso hazards assumption is employed in modeling the effect of zzso on the failure time of patients who are not zzso The zzso algorithm, the marginal likelihood approach, and multiple zzso are employed to estimate parameters of interest in the zzso This model extends models and improves zzso methods proposed by other zzso It also extends Cox's zzso hazards zzso model by allowing a proportion of zzso patients and investigating zzso effects on that zzso The model and its zzso method are investigated by zzso An application to breast cancer data, including comparisons with previous analyses using a zzso model and an existing zzso model by other researchers, confirms the conclusions from the zzso model but not those from the existing zzso zzso
