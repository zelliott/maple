A zzso stereo zzso technique has been developed for the dynamic assessment of the leaflet deformation of zzso heart valves under simulated zzso zzso By using a specially designed triggering technique, which takes the advantage of the field transfer mechanisms of the charge coupled device camera, two consecutive images separated by a time zzso as short as 5 zzso were zzso This made it possible to investigate the realistic leaflet deformation during the valve opening and closing processes which typically last zzso zzso This technique was applied to assess a newly developed zzso valve leaflet in a zzso pulse flow zzso zzso leaflet zzso of the valve opening and closing were generated from sequences of digital zzso The results can later be applied to finite element analysis of zzso heart valve leaflet stress and strain during a complete cardiac zzso
