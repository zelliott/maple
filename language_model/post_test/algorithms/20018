zzso cardiovascular zzso and zzso zzso are frequent in patients with Turner syndrome zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the cardiovascular findings and management in a large cohort of patients, including children and zzso 

We recruited 336 patients with zzso from a network of zzso zzso We reviewed their files, checking for cardiovascular events, cardiac valve zzso and zzso diameters zzso to body surface area zzso from magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso cardiovascular data were available for only 233 zzso zzso surgery was reported in zzso of the zzso The first cause of surgery was zzso zzso detected in zzso at a median age of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso valve zzso was detected in zzso at a median age of 20 years zzso zzso zzso At least one zzso diameter exceeded 32 zzso in zzso of the zzso This was detected at a median age of 19 zzso zzso When zzso to zzso at least one zzso diameter exceeded 20 zzso in zzso of the zzso 

Our study shows that cardiovascular monitoring for zzso patients is currently insufficient in zzso zzso is present at birth, but often remains zzso until later in zzso zzso improved management in cardiovascular monitoring is required and a more systematic approach should be zzso
