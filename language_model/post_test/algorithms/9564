zzso treatment of large zzso zzso zzso remains difficult and not very effective, even though seemingly promising methods such as staged volume treatments have been proposed by some radiation treatment zzso In symptomatic patients harboring large zzso zzso not amenable to zzso or zzso zzso high-dose zzso radiation therapy is a viable option, and the special characteristics of zzso zzso beams offer several treatment advantages over zzso and zzso zzso These advantages include a more favorable zzso distribution in zzso an almost negligible lateral scatter of the zzso a sharper zzso a steep dose zzso beyond the Bragg peak, and a higher probability of vascular response due to high zzso density and associated induction of zzso cell proliferation and/or zzso zzso zzso were recently shown to be an effective treatment for zzso zzso zzso that in mind, the authors zzso that the unique physical and biological characteristics of zzso beams should convey considerable clinical advantages in the treatment of large zzso In the present zzso the authors present a comparison between zzso beam therapy and more conventional zzso of radiation treatment with respect to these zzso 

zzso zzso and data on peripheral radiation doses for treatment of large zzso were collected from various radiation treatment zzso zzso parameters were then derived by applying a maximum likelihood fitting of a zzso model to these zzso The present zzso model was needed because the effective number of crucial blood vessels in zzso (the number of vessels that must be obliterated to effect a zzso such as large zzso zzso zzso is low, making the zzso model less zzso In this study the authors also focused on zzso differences between various radiation zzso 

zzso zzso dose delivery has the precision required for treating very large zzso as well as for delivering extremely sharp, focused beams to irregular zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in better zzso defined obliteration rates, less zzso zzso lower complication rates, and more favorable clinical zzso In addition, in patients treated by He zzso beams, a sharper zzso zzso was observed, probably due to a more homogeneous zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso beam radiation than that seen when zzso radiation zzso such as photons and zzso are zzso 

zzso zzso can be recommended for most large and irregular zzso and for the treatment of zzso located in front of or adjacent to sensitive and functionally important brain zzso The unique physical and biological characteristics of zzso beams are of considerable advantage for the treatment of zzso the densely zzso beams of light zzso create a better dose and biological effect distribution than conventional radiation zzso such as photons and zzso Using light zzso greater flexibility can be achieved while avoiding healthy critical structures such as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with the light zzso He or Li is more suitable for zzso zzso 10 zzso whereas treatment with the light zzso Li, zzso or C may be more appropriate for larger zzso A zzso model based on the effective number of crucial vessels in the zzso may be used quite well to predict zzso obliteration probabilities for both small and large zzso when therapies involving either photons or light zzso are zzso
