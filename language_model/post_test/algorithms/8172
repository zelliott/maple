In this article, we present a general procedure to analyze zzso zzso data that may also be viewed as zzso of zzso zzso Our approach zzso existing models and is practical and zzso zzso zzso from completely zzso functions, we introduce a rich family of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the incomplete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso We show that the family is closed under convex linear combinations, products, and zzso We also give the moments and the zzso property of the zzso With such zzso we can perform statistical zzso on correlated zzso data and, in particular, zzso zzso We propose a zzso procedure that zzso zzso zzso We provide a forward model selection zzso We run a small simulation to validate the inclusion of the zzso zzso Finally, we apply the proposed procedure to analyze the 2, 4, zzso acid and zzso data and compare the results with existing zzso
