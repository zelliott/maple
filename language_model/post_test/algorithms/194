This study was undertaken to correlate apparent diffusion zzso zzso and relative regional cerebral blood volume zzso to zzso findings in a large series of patients with primary or secondary brain zzso to evaluate zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging in the zzso of cerebral zzso 

zzso patients with cerebral zzso 46 of which were primary zzso grade zzso nine zzso zzso two zzso zzso nine zzso and 19 high-grade zzso and 52 secondary, underwent conventional magnetic resonance zzso imaging completed with zzso and dynamic contrast zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were calculated on a zzso by using zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso test was used to determine any statistically significant differences in the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of 98 zzso were zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso the zzso value of zzso zzso areas was zzso zzso The zzso value of solid zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso value was zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in grade III zzso zzso zzso zzso in grade IV zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso has an important role in the differential diagnosis of zzso cerebral masses but not in zzso zzso zzso is helpful in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from high-grade zzso
