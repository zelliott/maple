The objective of this paper was to investigate the zzso ability of the fuzzy zzso mixture model zzso zzso algorithm, applied on complementary DNA zzso zzso Following a standard established zzso a simulated zzso image of 1600 cells, each containing one spot, was zzso For further evaluation of the algorithm, three real zzso images were also used, each containing zzso zzso For the task of locating spot borders and surrounding background zzso in each cell, an automatic zzso process was developed and applied on zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso mixture model zzso zzso were applied to each cell with the purpose of discriminating foreground zzso from zzso The zzso abilities of both zzso were evaluated by means of the zzso matching factor, zzso of determination, and zzso zzso in respect to the actual classes zzso zzso of the simulated zzso zzso correlation and mean absolute error of the real images among replicates were also zzso The zzso was found to perform better and with equal processing time, as compared to the zzso rendering the zzso zzso an efficient alternative for zzso zzso zzso zzso
