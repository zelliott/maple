zzso zzso are negative gene regulators acting at the zzso level, modulating the translation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso could impact the zzso gene regulation either by weakening or by reinforcing the binding zzso Thus, the zzso of the normal regulation of a given gene could affect the zzso risk of zzso zzso it is helpful to develop a tool enabling the researchers to predict which of the many zzso could really impact the regulation of a target zzso At present, there are several available databases and zzso able to predict potential binding sites in the zzso of zzso However, each zzso gives different predictions and none of them zzso for each zzso a direct measurement of the biological zzso We propose an approach allowing the assignment to each zzso a ranking of its biological zzso The method is based on a simple zzso of predictions from zzso well-established zzso As an example, we show the application of this approach to 140 genes candidate for zzso cancer zzso These genes were identified following a zzso sequencing of zzso transcripts from zzso genes in 11 zzso specimens and were found zzso zzso and thought to be crucial for the development of zzso
