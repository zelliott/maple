To assess the feasibility to generate a confident image of normal breath sounds zzso based on the quantitative analysis of zzso sensors and imaging them in three known clinical classes, zzso zzso zzso and zzso identifying their spatial distribution with high resolution on the zzso zzso zzso 

Three zzso techniques, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso were evaluated when applied to zzso These sounds were acquired in twelve healthy subjects by a zzso sensor array on the zzso zzso surface plus the sound at the zzso position, to obtain feature zzso that fed a supervised zzso neural zzso Based on zzso zzso rate, the spatial distribution of each zzso class was obtained by constructing an image using deterministic zzso 

The zzso zzso modeling was the best zzso technique producing a zzso performance of zzso during the validation phase and just zzso of not classified feature zzso zzso values for the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso whereas for the zzso were zzso and zzso 

This work shows that it is possible to generate confident images associated with the distribution of normal zzso zzso zzso a detailed image about the spatial distribution of zzso in humans might be helpful for detecting lung zzso
