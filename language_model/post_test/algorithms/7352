zzso Word zzso zzso in clinical documents is a prerequisite to accurate extraction of medical zzso Emerging methods utilizing zzso computing present new approaches to this zzso In this paper, we evaluate one such approach, the zzso zzso Code Word zzso zzso algorithm, on 50 ambiguous zzso sets derived from clinical zzso This zzso uses zzso zzso transformations to zzso ambiguous terms and their zzso senses into zzso representing surrounding zzso The sense for a new context is then zzso from zzso representing the terms it zzso zzso zzso achieves average accuracy of zzso when considering the orientation and distance of neighboring terms relative to the target zzso outperforming Support zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it is practical to deal with all 50 zzso in an identical manner using a single zzso zzso model with average accuracy of zzso which is not possible with common machine learning zzso
