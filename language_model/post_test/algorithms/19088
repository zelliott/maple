zzso the dynamics behind domain architecture evolution is of great importance to unravel the functions of zzso Complex zzso have been created throughout evolution by zzso and zzso zzso An interesting question is how many times a particular architecture has been created, a form of zzso evolution or domain architecture zzso Previous studies have approached this issue by comparing zzso found in different zzso We wanted to achieve a zzso analysis by reconstructing protein zzso on complete domain zzso The prevalence of domain architecture reinvention in 96 zzso was investigated with a novel domain zzso method that uses maximum zzso for zzso ancestral protein zzso zzso zzso were taken from zzso To ensure zzso we applied the method to zzso trees and only considered results with strong statistical zzso We detected multiple origins for zzso of the scored zzso In a much smaller data set, the subset of completely zzso zzso the figure was zzso These results indicate that domain architecture reinvention is a much more common phenomenon than previously zzso We also determined which zzso are most frequent in multiply created zzso and assessed whether specific functions could be attributed to zzso However, no strong functional bias was found in zzso with multiple zzso
