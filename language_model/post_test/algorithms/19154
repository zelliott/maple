zzso for converting descriptive measures of health status into zzso life year zzso are now widely available, and their application in economic evaluation is increasingly zzso The objective of this study is to describe and compare existing conversion zzso and to highlight issues bearing on the derivation and interpretation of the zzso so zzso 

zzso review of zzso for converting descriptive measures of health status into zzso 

The review identified a substantial body of literature zzso 46 derivation studies and 16 studies that provided evidence or commentary on the zzso of conversion zzso zzso zzso were derived using 1 of 4 zzso 1) transfer to utility regression, 2) response zzso 3) effect size translation, and 4) zzso outcome measures using zzso zzso zzso Although these techniques differ in their zzso tradition, data requirements, and ease of derivation and application, the available evidence suggests that the sensitivity and zzso of derived zzso may be more dependent on the coverage and sensitivity of measures and the disease zzso group under evaluation than on the technique used in zzso 

Despite the recent proliferation of conversion zzso a number of questions bearing on the derivation and interpretation of derived zzso remain zzso These unresolved issues suggest directions for future research in this zzso In the meantime, analysts seeking guidance in selecting derived zzso should consider the zzso and feasibility of each conversion zzso in the disease area and patient group under evaluation rather than restricting their choice to weights from a particular derivation zzso
