The paper proposes a zzso based zzso applying the zzso distance measure enabling detection of zzso and characteristic zzso points from a zzso zzso zzso zzso It extends the zzso detection in the phase space by detecting the P and T zzso zzso The zzso is derived by reconstructing the zzso signals in a two-dimensional zzso phase space according to the delay method and zzso geometrical properties of the reconstructed phase portrait of the signal in the phase space for the heartbeat and zzso zzso It uses zzso zzso and the zzso distance measure between the signal points in the phase portrait as an alternative to the zzso area calculation zzso et zzso zzso It was verified with the zzso Database zzso and its performance was assessed using sensitivity zzso and the positive zzso value zzso zzso for the proposed zzso are zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso for the P points, zzso and T points, zzso
