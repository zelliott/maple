We consider an extension of zzso causality to zzso zzso time zzso In this frame, if the prediction error of the first time series is reduced by including zzso from the second time series, then the second time series is said to have a zzso influence on the first zzso Not all the zzso prediction schemes are suitable to evaluate zzso indeed, not all of them allow one to zzso how much knowledge of the other time series counts to improve prediction zzso We present an approach with zzso time series modeled by a zzso of zzso basis functions and show its application to a pair of zzso coupled chaotic maps and to zzso zzso
