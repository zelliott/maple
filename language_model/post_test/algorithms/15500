A zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso wounds in a zzso model was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of zzso imaging as an alternate method for wound zzso Analysis of a randomly selected zzso yielded distinct spectral signatures for zzso regions of interest including the zzso injured zzso and normal zzso The scanning of the entire zzso group using these zzso signatures revealed an zzso zzso pattern zzso a central wound region was consistently defined by a unique spectral zzso An zzso was derived as an objective tool for the comparison of the wound regions defined by the zzso zzso versus the zzso manual zzso The dimensions of the wound identified in the zzso zzso did not differ significantly from the wound region identified by the zzso using standard zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso analysis may provide a zzso alternative for wound zzso that zzso standard zzso imaging and pathologist zzso
