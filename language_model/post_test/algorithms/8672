We present an zzso for zzso edges from noisy zzso Our method uses an zzso learning approach for local threshold zzso by means of zzso method for mixture density zzso We tested the technique by applying it to computer-generated images corrupted with artificial noise and to an actual zzso heart image and it is shown that the technique has potential use for noisy zzso
