This paper considers the problem of exponential stability analysis of neural networks with zzso zzso The zzso functions are assumed to be globally zzso zzso A linear zzso inequality zzso approach is developed to derive sufficient conditions ensuring the delayed neural network to have a unique equilibrium point, which is globally zzso zzso The proposed zzso conditions can be checked easily by recently developed zzso solving zzso Examples are provided to demonstrate the reduced zzso of the proposed zzso
