zzso models are commonly used to predict future benefits of new therapies or interventions in the zzso zzso The reliability of model results is greatly dependent on accuracy of model zzso but on occasion, data sources may not provide all the required zzso zzso zzso of model zzso to zzso zzso informed by existing data can be a useful tool to ensure credibility of the zzso 

To compare different zzso methods of zzso a zzso model to US zzso 

We developed a zzso model that simulates the natural history of human zzso zzso infection and subsequent cervical disease in the zzso Because the model consists of numerous transition probabilities that cannot be directly estimated from data, zzso to multiple disease zzso was required to ensure its zzso zzso zzso of fit was measured as the mean percentage zzso of zzso zzso from target zzso During the zzso process we used the manual, random and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and manual zzso methods achieved the best fit, with mean zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso accomplished this result with substantially less analyst time than the manual method, but required more intensive computing zzso The random search method achieved a mean zzso of zzso which we considered unacceptable despite the ease of zzso of that zzso 

The zzso and manual techniques may be preferable zzso methods based on both performance and efficiency, provided that sufficient resources are zzso
