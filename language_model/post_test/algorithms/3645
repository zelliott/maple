zzso of information on biological processes from large-scale expression data is still a time-consuming zzso An automated analysis utilizing all expression information would greatly increase our understanding of the samples under zzso 

We describe here a novel method to obtain a functional analysis of complex gene expression zzso Instead of applying a zzso expression zzso Gene zzso zzso terms are weighted using the actual measured levels of expression of all associated zzso Based on this concept, the application zzso was developed to zzso link gene expression levels to zzso for multiple experiments in an automated zzso The zzso of zzso was developed and validated on in house and public human zzso data and mouse zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso allows for zzso relevant biological functions with the experiments under zzso 

The zzso application is free of charge available from our zzso
