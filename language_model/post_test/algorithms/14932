Dynamic image sequences allow zzso mechanisms to be monitored after the injection of a zzso Factor analysis of medical image sequences zzso hence creates a synthesis of the information in one image zzso It estimates a limited number of structures zzso zzso assuming that the zzso zzso zzso are similar at each point inside the zzso A spatial zzso method for computing factor images zzso is proposed to remove irregularities due to noise in the original data while preserving zzso between zzso zzso has been applied to two sets of zzso zzso dynamic data with zzso noise and zzso dynamic studies in zzso zzso zzso or zzso which respect real zzso acquisition parameters and noise zzso zzso zzso parameters are estimated in order to minimize the distance between reference images and zzso factor zzso Compared with conventional factor images, the root mean square error between zzso images and reference factor images is improved by 3 for the first set of simulations, and by about zzso for the second set of zzso In all cases, zzso factor images are zzso and zzso zzso
