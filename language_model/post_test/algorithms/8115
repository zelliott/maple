Object selection refers to the mechanism of zzso objects of interest while ignoring other objects and background in a given visual zzso It is a fundamental issue for many computer vision and image analysis techniques and it is still a challenging task to artificial visual zzso zzso phase synchronization takes place in cases involving almost identical zzso systems and it means that the phase difference between the systems is kept bounded over the time, while their zzso remain chaotic and may be zzso Instead of complete zzso phase synchronization is believed to be a mechanism for neural integration in zzso In this paper, an object selection model is zzso zzso in the network representing the salient object in a given scene are phase zzso while no phase synchronization occurs for background zzso In this way, the salient object can be zzso In this model, a shift mechanism is also introduced to change attention from one object to zzso Computer simulations show that the model produces some results similar to those observed in natural vision zzso
