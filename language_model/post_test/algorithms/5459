In zzso valve sparing surgery, cusp zzso is a common cause of residual zzso zzso To correct cusp pathology, native leaflets of the valve frequently require adjustment which can be performed using a variety of described correction techniques, such as central or zzso zzso or zzso of the leaflet free zzso The practical question then arises of determining which surgical technique provides the best valve performance with the most zzso zzso To answer this question, we created a new finite element model with the ability to simulate zzso function in normal valves, and zzso zzso due to leaflet zzso in zzso diseased or zzso repaired zzso The existing leaflet correction techniques were simulated in a controlled situation, and the performance of the repaired valve was zzso in terms of maximum leaflets stress, valve orifice area, valve opening and closing characteristics as well as total zzso area in zzso On the one hand, the existing leaflet correction techniques were shown not to adversely affect the dynamic properties of the repaired zzso On the other hand, leaflet zzso appeared as the best technique compared to central or zzso leaflet zzso It was the only method able to achieve zzso competence and fix an individual leaflet zzso while simultaneously restoring normal values for mechanical stress, valve orifice area and zzso zzso
