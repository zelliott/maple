This paper presents an zzso control zzso for realizing a zzso angle measuring zzso so that rotation angle can be directly measured without integration of angular rate, thus eliminating the zzso of zzso integration zzso The proposed control zzso uses a trajectory following approach and the reference trajectory is generated by an ideal angle measuring zzso driven by the estimate of angular rate and the auxiliary zzso input so that the persistent zzso condition is zzso The developed control zzso can compensate for all types of fabrication imperfections such as coupled zzso and zzso and mismatched zzso and zzso zzso term in an zzso zzso The simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed control zzso that is capable of directly measuring rotation angle without the integration of angular zzso
