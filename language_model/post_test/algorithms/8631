In this work, we have developed a new zzso named local intersection volume zzso in order to compose a zzso zzso model for zzso zzso zzso The zzso can be classified as a zzso local shape zzso in zzso to the global shape zzso We have selected from the literature 49 zzso compounds as a training data set and the model was obtained and evaluated by genetic zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso methods using zzso as zzso The zzso zzso model has a good zzso capacity according the zzso test by zzso procedure zzso The developed model was compared to a comprehensive and extensive zzso zzso model, recently proposed by Cook and co-workers, for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso zzso It showed a relevant correlation with the zzso groups pointed out in that zzso Our zzso zzso model was also able to predict affinity values for a series of nine compounds zzso data zzso that was not included into the training data zzso
