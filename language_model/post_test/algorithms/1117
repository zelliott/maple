The present study was performed to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso transport in the zzso urinary zzso which is known to occur via a specialized zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso The zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso were filled with zzso zzso solution containing 370 zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso was determined by sampling the zzso and zzso bathing medium at zzso intervals for measurement of zzso It was found that, from the zzso side, zzso (10 zzso to 1 zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control, zzso zzso As in response to zzso the zzso zzso a maximum in zzso h after the zzso was zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso applied together were not zzso zzso zzso transport was strongly inhibited by nearly zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was enhanced up to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused no changes in zzso zzso increased the content of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso protein per 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso whereas zzso (20 zzso a protein zzso A zzso reduced it by zzso ( zzso zzso zzso not change the zzso zzso measured in zzso conditions, but inhibited the last one in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso The data obtained show that, in the zzso urinary zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Its effect seems to be zzso by zzso zzso generation of zzso zzso
