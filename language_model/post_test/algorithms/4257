X-ray zzso allows the structure of a zzso to be determined from a large ensemble of zzso However, several zzso including crystal sizes, zzso and incident zzso flux zzso are initially unknown and images are highly corrupted with zzso zzso techniques, commonly used in conventional zzso can determine zzso using Bragg peak patterns, but only up to crystal lattice zzso This limitation results in an ambiguity in the zzso known as the indexing zzso when the zzso pattern displays less symmetry than the lattice and leads to data that appear twinned if left zzso Furthermore, missing phase information must be recovered to determine the zzso zzso zzso We present an zzso framework to determine crystal size, incident zzso flux density, and orientation in the presence of the indexing zzso We show that phase information can be zzso from zzso zzso using an zzso phasing algorithm, without extra experimental requirements, zzso zzso or knowledge of similar structures required by current phasing zzso The feasibility of this approach is tested on simulated data with parameters and noise levels common in current zzso
