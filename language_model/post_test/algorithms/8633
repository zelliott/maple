The necessity to assess sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants zzso as integral parts of the wastewater system has been well known for several years and discussed in many zzso Until recently, sewer systems and zzso were improved (or zzso separately or zzso which resulted in zzso zzso Nowadays, in The Netherlands as well as in other European countries, a trend can be zzso towards more integral zzso Nevertheless, due to a lack of knowledge on the interactions between the sewer systems and the zzso the zzso of this way of thinking in practice takes a long zzso This paper describes the results of two cases in which the interactions between zzso and wastewater treatment are incorporated within the zzso of a wastewater zzso The first case illustrates the importance of taking the interactions into account, while the second case shows how to deal with the interactions within a wastewater system zzso zzso It is concluded that the combination of total wastewater system analysis, incorporating the interactions within the wastewater system, with efficient search zzso is expected to be very valuable in future wastewater system zzso zzso
