zzso sequence data are being produced at an ever increasing zzso zzso such sequences by similarity is often an essential first step in their zzso to reduce zzso define gene families or suggest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso scale relatively poorly in terms of run time and memory zzso yet they are desirable because zzso shortcuts taken during zzso might have unintended consequences in later analysis zzso 

Here we present zzso a highly zzso software pipeline that can cluster large numbers of zzso DNA sequences by running on distributed computing zzso It zzso both memory and computing resources zzso and can process more than a million sequences in a few hours on a small zzso 

zzso code and zzso are freely available at zzso the pipeline is implemented in zzso and uses the zzso Passing zzso zzso standard for distributed zzso
