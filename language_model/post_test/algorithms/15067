zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors in rats, but not zzso Species differences in zzso patterns, zzso and zzso complicate zzso of zzso zzso from rats to zzso zzso based zzso modeling of vinyl zzso zzso in rats suggested the presence of a zzso zzso removal zzso in rat zzso zzso We explored the possibility that this zzso is either a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso extraction of vinyl zzso vapor zzso zzso was measured in the surgically isolated zzso cavity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was extracted with zzso efficiency in zzso zzso of rats with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso despite significantly reducing zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso reduced extraction to approximately zzso zzso production was similarly unaffected by zzso but was reduced to zzso of control by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity had a zzso value (32 zzso similar, within a factor of 2, to the value predicted by the zzso based model, although zzso was significantly lower than the model zzso zzso observations support the zzso that the zzso zzso is bound to the zzso plasma membrane of zzso tissue and is not readily released by zzso zzso providing an explanation for the low zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso could be important in the removal of zzso from the sensory zzso zzso zzso zzso
