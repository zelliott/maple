To analyze the influence of parameters and functions on the energy and geometry obtained through different force field calculations, we have developed program zzso This software allows the user to choose between two sets of functions and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso option of the program was developed to zzso the zzso energy in a zzso or zzso zzso To establish comparisons between the energy values, the zzso contribution is zzso in the same way in the zzso and zzso options of the zzso The force field parameters can be handled zzso (through addition or zzso The program was used to study molecules of a representative sample displaying most of the problems encountered in molecular mechanics zzso
