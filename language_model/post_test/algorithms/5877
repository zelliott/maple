This paper is concerned with the performance evaluation of fingerprint zzso zzso After an initial zzso of zzso testing initiatives, we explore both the theoretical and practical issues related to performance evaluation by presenting the outcome of the recent zzso zzso Competition zzso zzso was organized by the authors of this work for the purpose of assessing the state-of-the-art in this challenging pattern recognition application and making available a new common benchmark for an zzso comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an independent, strongly supervised evaluation performed at the zzso site on zzso zzso This allowed the test to be completely controlled and the zzso times of different zzso to be fairly zzso The experience and feedback received from zzso similar competitions zzso and zzso allowed us to improve the organization and methodology of zzso and to capture the attention of a significantly higher number of academic and commercial organizations zzso zzso were submitted for zzso A new, zzso competition category was included to estimate the loss of matching performance caused by imposing zzso zzso This paper discusses data collection and testing zzso and includes a detailed analysis of the zzso We introduce a simple but effective method for comparing zzso at the score level, allowing us to isolate difficult cases zzso and to study error correlations and zzso zzso The huge amount of information zzso including a structured zzso of the submitted zzso on the basis of their features, makes it possible to better understand how current fingerprint recognition systems work and to delineate useful research directions for the zzso
