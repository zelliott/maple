The zzso study zzso zzso or zzso was designed to investigate the role of human zzso zzso infection and its zzso in the development of cervical zzso and to evaluate new cervical cancer screening zzso The follow-up phase of the zzso was designed to study why a small proportion of women infected with zzso develop cervical zzso zzso grade 2 zzso zzso zzso 3, or cancer zzso three together are globally referred to as zzso or zzso zzso 2, that is, zzso 2 or zzso The purpose of this article is to describe this prospective study in detail and to present the preliminary findings regarding the zzso of cervical zzso 

A cohort of 10 zzso randomly selected women from 18 to 97 years old from zzso a province in northwestern Costa zzso was zzso screened in zzso and then followed up for seven years after being zzso A questionnaire for demographic and risk factors was zzso and a pelvic examination was performed on sexually active women at each follow-up visit in order to obtain samples for screening tests and for research zzso The final diagnosis given at the end of the enrollment phase zzso women into several groups according to the perceived risk of their developing either high-grade precursors of cancer or zzso These groups were followed up at different intervals according to the risk of developing zzso or zzso zzso zzso The most active follow-up zzso zzso zzso was concentrated on the women most likely to develop zzso zzso zzso 2, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso The remainder of the cohort was followed either annually zzso zzso 2 zzso or after five to seven years of passive follow-up zzso zzso 3 zzso All women with possibly severe zzso detected by any technique were referred to zzso for further evaluation and treatment, and they were also censored from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 served as both the zzso outcome and our surrogate for cancer zzso 

Participation during follow-up was high (near zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 2 by any screening technique censored zzso of zzso Most of the women censored because of suspected zzso or zzso zzso 2 came from the large group perceived at entry as being at low risk of developing zzso or zzso zzso 2, but the greatest rates of progression to zzso or zzso zzso 2 were observed among women perceived at entry to be at highest risk of zzso or zzso zzso 2, based on their zzso zzso or sexual zzso 

The zzso is the largest zzso zzso cohort for the study of zzso and cervical zzso in the world, and its results will hopefully let us soon plan future worldwide prevention zzso Research projects such as this one require the long-term commitment of a large multidisciplinary team and ample financial zzso The intensive effort and expertise applied in all aspects of this study were key factors in its success as a model of zzso interdisciplinary cancer research in Latin zzso Quality control played an important role at all times during the study and made it possible to adapt new diagnostic and screening technology to zzso The systematic follow-up of a zzso group of close to 10 zzso women in zzso should permit careful, zzso evaluation of factors zzso to be linked to the development of cervical cancer as well as the evaluation of clinical markers of disease zzso The study results that have already been published have validated sensitive screening techniques and have also promoted the use of more affordable screening techniques in zzso developing zzso The zzso has also contributed to building knowledge for the search for vaccines against zzso as part of the effort to develop an effective tool to reduce the zzso and mortality of cervical cancer zzso
