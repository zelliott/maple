We evaluated the feasibility of the zzso zzso test using Upper zzso during zzso zzso which was designed to provide a confirmed, low zzso energy value during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with only two induced zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients (62 zzso 12 years, 86 zzso from 13 clinical zzso underwent an active can zzso zzso A single zzso zzso derived from zzso lead II during zzso pacing was used for zzso induction shocks at 13, 11, 9, and 6 J in a zzso manner until the upper limit of zzso induction zzso was zzso If zzso zzso J, a zzso energy of zzso + 4 J was zzso For zzso zzso J, the zzso test energy was 9 zzso In zzso patients zzso two induced zzso episodes were sufficient to obtain confirmed zzso energy of zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean strength of the successful zzso induction shock was zzso zzso zzso J, the zzso zzso was zzso zzso 35 zzso and the number of delivered induction shocks until the first zzso induction was zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a safe and simple device testing procedure allowing the determination of confirmed, low zzso energy in most patients with two zzso episodes induced at a single zzso zzso
