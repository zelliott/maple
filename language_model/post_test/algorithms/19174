In this study, we investigated dynamic changes in light scattering and zzso oxygen zzso zzso on the rat spinal zzso due to peripheral electrical stimulation by measuring near infrared zzso and visible zzso zzso The spectral slope in the wavelength region between 700 and 900 zzso is used as an index zzso to zzso light zzso With a zzso zzso zzso fiber-optic needle probe, optical zzso was measured from the left zzso region, specifically zzso of the spinal zzso surface at a height of zzso zzso from the spinal zzso zzso zzso electrical zzso from 20 to 50 zzso in increments of 10 zzso were given to the zzso surface of the rat left hind paw for a period of 20 zzso Changes in both light scattering zzso and zzso were determined as a difference between the baseline and the maximum of slope value and zzso oxygen zzso respectively, during the stimulation zzso There were significant differences in both zzso and zzso during zzso with the average percentage changes of zzso and zzso zzso We observed that both zzso and zzso measured at the spinal zzso are insensitive to the intensity of the electrical zzso which is possibly caused by the zzso process of zzso zzso Our finding essentially indicates that peripheral electrical stimulation results in significant changes in both light scattering and zzso oxygen zzso on the rat spinal cord, and ignoring light scattering changes could lead to possible negative zzso of zzso parameters zzso zzso and total zzso zzso obtained in the functional optical imaging in the zzso
