An zzso patient's risk of harboring an underlying vascular zzso varies according to baseline clinical and zzso zzso Our aim was to develop a practical scoring system to zzso patients with zzso according to their risk of harboring a vascular zzso 

Using a data base of zzso patients with zzso evaluated with zzso during a zzso period, we developed a scoring system based on baseline clinical characteristics (age group zzso zzso sex zzso zzso neither known zzso nor impaired zzso zzso zzso and zzso categorization zzso points) to predict the risk of harboring a vascular zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso We subsequently applied the zzso score to a prospective cohort of 222 patients with zzso who presented to our emergency department during a zzso zzso Using zzso analysis, we calculated the zzso and zzso for the zzso score in both the retrospective and prospective patient zzso separately and the entire patient zzso Patients with zzso in the zzso zzso were zzso 

A vascular zzso was found in 120 of zzso patients with zzso evaluated with zzso zzso most commonly zzso zzso zzso with purely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was reached at a zzso score of zzso with the highest zzso of vascular zzso zzso in patients with zzso scores of 3 zzso 4 zzso 5 zzso and 6 zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso between both patient zzso zzso 

The zzso score successfully predicts a given zzso patient's risk of harboring an underlying vascular zzso and could be used as a guide to select patients with zzso for zzso evaluation to exclude the presence of a vascular zzso
