In this work, recent improvements in the capability of the zzso zzso binding data global analysis program, zzso are zzso These improvements represent an expansion of the types of physical models which can be zzso The first realm of improvement concerns the modeling of systems which include several species of the same zzso and differing chemical zzso or site zzso Such an option is generally used in the analysis of binding of multiple zzso to multiple protein zzso In addition to classical zzso binding problems, such a capability is useful in considering the binding of protein to different sites on the same DNA zzso and the effects of zzso upon these zzso It can also be employed for consideration of the equilibrium unfolding of zzso proteins with folded zzso zzso The effect of dilution of the protein and zzso by up to two different types of zzso at multiple binding sites upon the zzso and unfolding properties of the zzso is now zzso The second advance which has been incorporated into the modeling capabilities of the zzso program is the option of considering zzso to the multiple binding or folding zzso by chemical zzso temperature, or high zzso zzso Additional improvements to the zzso program include direct mapping of individual species or sums of species to the zzso physical experimental zzso The values of the zzso corresponding to particular species or to 0 and zzso completion of a zzso can be either fixed or floating parameters in the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
