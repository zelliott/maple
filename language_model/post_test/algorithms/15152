Right zzso pacing zzso causes zzso zzso and may lead to the development of heart failure zzso zzso of zzso delay zzso in zzso zzso reduces unnecessary RV zzso The aim of the study was to verify the influence of zzso reduction on zzso zzso 

The study comprised 31 patients (17 men, mean age: zzso zzso 8 zzso with zzso zzso implanted due to zzso zzso dysfunction zzso At zzso 28 patients did not present any symptoms of zzso Three patients were in zzso class zzso Patients were zzso either to 150 zzso zzso or to minimizing right zzso pacing zzso Crossing over to the alternate mode took place after 4 zzso zzso exercise test zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were done before zzso zzso after 4 and 8 zzso 

The percentage of zzso was significantly higher in 150 zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso Patients with 150 zzso mode had worse zzso parameters than those with zzso zzso peak oxygen zzso was zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso higher zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso and worse left zzso zzso zzso ejection zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in patients without symptoms of zzso at baseline may be responsible for worse performance in zzso exercise test, higher zzso zzso and impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso programming promotes intrinsic zzso zzso and may prevent the development of zzso zzso
