A study of the feasibility of focused zzso zzso extraction of acorn oil and comparison of results from analysis of trans fatty acids in the oil thus obtained with those for oils obtained by use of other methods commonly used for oil extraction are reported zzso The proposed method was zzso by means of a zzso screening design to zzso by means of a reduced number of experiments, which factors affect both extraction efficiency and the degree of zzso of the fatty acids in the zzso The proposed method enables total extraction of the fatty acids in 30 zzso which is much less than the time required by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (16 zzso and zzso (8 zzso reference methods and the zzso method zzso zzso The efficiency of extraction achieved by use of the proposed method is statistically equivalent to that achieved by use of the other zzso the composition of the extracts obtained by use of the proposed method and the zzso and stirring reference methods are also statistically zzso No trans fatty acids were present in the extracts obtained by use of the zzso zzso and proposed methods but they were detected in the extracts obtained by use of both the zzso and zzso zzso
