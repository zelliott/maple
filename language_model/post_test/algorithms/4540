zzso screening has increased detection of zzso breast zzso and has decreased mortality from breast zzso A Breast zzso and Data System zzso 4 zzso zzso a biopsy that most often reveals benign zzso Our objective was to determine if serum zzso profiles could be used to differentiate between benign and zzso zzso zzso 

After zzso approval, women undergoing an zzso biopsy for a zzso category 4 zzso were zzso zzso was collected zzso and labeled zzso after final pathology was zzso zzso was incubated with weak zzso exchange magnetic beads and zzso in duplicate for analysis on zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso software zzso zzso and zzso determined using a zzso zzso 

In a zzso period, 260 subjects were recruited into this zzso zzso from 92 subjects were randomly selected to form benign zzso zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis yielded 273 peaks, with 14 zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso between the cancer and benign zzso A genetic zzso model was generated, yielding a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso 

zzso zzso profiles generated from zzso 4 zzso could be used to distinguish between benign and zzso zzso zzso
