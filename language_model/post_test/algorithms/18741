We describe a distributed zzso zzso model for zzso kinetic analysis in brain and validate the derived zzso values with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed model is applied on actual clinical cases of zzso zzso Nine patients with experienced transient zzso attack or minor stroke and a zzso of the internal carotid artery were referred for zzso zzso zzso and PET zzso The zzso of the zzso model in clinical practice was tested in seven patients with acute stroke who received a baseline zzso CT study and a zzso follow-up CT study after zzso zzso The mean blood flow zzso value for all patients with carotid zzso in the pooled data (54 regions of interest zzso was zzso zzso per 100 g in zzso CT and zzso zzso per 100 g in zzso PET imaging zzso zzso zzso analysis of the pooled zzso for every patient revealed significant correlation between F values in seven patients zzso to zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso maps that corresponded to all zzso parameters were generated for every zzso CT in the patients with acute stroke using the zzso zzso The zzso area was better delineated in zzso zzso blood volume and lag time zzso zzso The correlation zzso comparing the visually outlined regions of zzso between the zzso zzso map and the follow-up CT scans was zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso model using more realistic zzso is feasible in dynamic zzso CT of the brain in patients with acute and chronic cerebrovascular zzso
