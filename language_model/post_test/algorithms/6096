We present a discrete model for a zzso of a single species with overlapping zzso Based on the zzso behavior of the system in absence of zzso we have shown that a migration mechanism which depends only on age can not stabilize a previously unstable homogeneous zzso but can drive a stable zzso system to instability if the migration rules are strongly related to age zzso
