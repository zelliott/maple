A zzso modification of the zzso random field zzso model is proposed for zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso For evaluation purposes, five simulated and a set of five real zzso images were zzso The zzso stationary zzso transform zzso of each zzso image was used to form two images, a zzso image, using hard zzso zzso and a magnitude image, from the zzso of the horizontal and vertical components of zzso zzso from these two images were suitably combined to form the zzso model for zzso spots from their zzso The zzso was compared against the conventional zzso and the zzso C means zzso zzso on simulated and real zzso images and their performances were evaluated by means of the zzso matching factor zzso and the zzso of determination zzso Additionally, the zzso was compared against the zzso and zzso and performances were evaluated by the mean absolute error zzso and the zzso of variation zzso The zzso performed more accurately than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso : zzso zzso and zzso zzso and achieved higher zzso than the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
