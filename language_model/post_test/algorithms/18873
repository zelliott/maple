zzso abnormalities have been documented in the chronic fatigue syndrome zzso indicating functional disturbances of the zzso nervous system responsible for cardiovascular zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso heart rate control during mild zzso stress in adolescents with zzso 

A total of 14 zzso patients and 56 healthy controls having equal distribution of age and gender underwent lower body negative pressure zzso of horizontal line 20 zzso The zzso zzso zzso was recorded zzso and spectral power zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso band zzso zzso and the zzso zzso band zzso zzso from segments of zzso zzso using an zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

At rest, zzso had lower zzso than controls zzso zzso zzso but zzso of zzso were similar in the two zzso During zzso compared to controls, zzso patients had lower zzso and absolute zzso power and zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso power and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

During mild zzso stress, adolescents with zzso appear to have enhanced zzso withdrawal, leading to a sympathetic predominance of heart rate control compared to zzso zzso underlying mechanisms include zzso and abnormalities of zzso zzso
