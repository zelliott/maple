To develop and internally validate a population zzso model for zzso and assess its prediction capacity for zzso doses in cancer zzso 

zzso plasma zzso in zzso cancer patients were used to determine the zzso parameters of a zzso zzso model implemented in zzso VI zzso zzso zzso identification capacity was assessed using the zzso zzso method and the model was validated using the zzso zzso method and zzso visual and zzso zzso zzso The final zzso prediction capacity was evaluated in terms of accuracy and precision during the first (a zzso and second (a zzso chemotherapy zzso 

Mean population zzso clearance is zzso zzso with an zzso zzso of zzso zzso distribution volume at steady state was zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Internal validation confirmed that the population zzso model is appropriate to describe changes over time in zzso plasma zzso as well as its zzso in the study zzso The accuracy and precision of a zzso prediction of zzso zzso improved by zzso and zzso compared to a zzso zzso 

The population zzso model developed adequately described the changes in zzso plasma zzso in cancer patients and can be used to zzso zzso dosing regimes accurately and zzso
