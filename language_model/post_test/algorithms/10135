For more than 50 years it has been known that oxygen therapy can lead to zzso of zzso zzso Recent clinical research has led many zzso to lower the target oxygen zzso alarm limits to zzso and to zzso the inspired oxygen in small zzso Despite efforts to zzso oxygen therapy, the number of cases of severe zzso remains high as more extremely low birth weight infants zzso Based on new insights into the zzso of zzso there are multiple interventions, in addition to zzso oxygen therapy that may help decrease severe zzso zzso that have the potential to prevent phase I zzso zzso to zzso weeks zzso include increasing retinal zzso zzso zzso and serum IGF-1 zzso milk and/or zzso zzso maintaining serum zzso below 120 zzso and providing omega-3 zzso zzso with potential to prevent zzso zzso in phase II zzso zzso weeks zzso include treating anemia with a liberal policy of zzso in premature infants with stage III zzso zzso adaptation, vitamin E supplements zzso weeks zzso and omega-3 zzso The zzso zzso has shown promise as a zzso in the early identification of extremely low birth weight infants at high risk for zzso zzso As there is interplay of multiple factors in the causation of zzso we suggest that the simultaneous application of some combination of multiple interventions, mentioned above, may reduce the burden of zzso in the most vulnerable zzso These concepts need study in zzso zzso clinical trials before being incorporated into clinical zzso
