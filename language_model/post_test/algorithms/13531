To assess the effective dose of zzso and quality of the obtained images while using the zzso of zzso statistical zzso reconstruction zzso 

A total of 57 patients were examined using by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the mode of retrospective zzso In 27 patients we used the filtered zzso of filtered back projection zzso in the zzso treatment, in 30 patients - underwent zzso zzso In all patients we measured the level of contrast, noise and zzso ratio zzso 

There were no significant difference by the level of contrast, noise and zzso in the two groups of zzso The effective dose of using zzso was less by zzso than while using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso 

Using zzso of zzso while performing CT zzso makes it possible to considerably decrease the effective dose of zzso of patients without zzso los of diagnostic zzso
