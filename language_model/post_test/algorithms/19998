This paper introduces a mouse zzso registration system zzso composed of a stationary zzso zzso projector and a zzso optical camera, coupled to a mouse zzso registration zzso This system uses the zzso and optical images to guide a fully automatic zzso of a mouse zzso with each subject, in order to provide anatomical reference for small animal molecular imaging systems such as zzso zzso zzso zzso To facilitate the zzso a statistical zzso that accounts for zzso anatomical variations was constructed based on 83 zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The statistical shape model and conditional zzso model techniques were used to register the zzso with the zzso image and optical zzso The accuracy of the zzso registration was evaluated by comparing the registered zzso with the zzso zzso images of the test zzso The results showed excellent registration accuracy of the zzso region, and good accuracy for the brain, liver, heart, lungs and zzso In its zzso the zzso was integrated with a zzso PET scanner to deliver combined zzso imaging, and to facilitate zzso analysis of the zzso PET zzso
