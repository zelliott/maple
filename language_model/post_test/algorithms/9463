We propose Twin zzso a zzso zzso zzso that determines two zzso planes by solving two related zzso problems, each of which is smaller than in a conventional zzso The Twin zzso zzso is in the spirit of zzso zzso via generalized zzso On several benchmark data sets, Twin zzso is not only fast, but shows good zzso Twin zzso is also useful for automatically discovering two-dimensional projections of the zzso
