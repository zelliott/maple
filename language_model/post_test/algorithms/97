zzso is an exquisitely structured zzso of the calcium zzso mineral zzso with small amounts of proteins and the zzso zzso For many years, it has been the subject of research, not just because of its beauty, but also to discover how nature can produce such a superior product with excellent mechanical properties from such relatively weak raw zzso Four decades ago, Wada zzso K (1966) zzso growth of zzso Nature zzso proposed that the spiral patterns in zzso could be explained by using the theory Frank zzso F zzso The influence of zzso on crystal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had put forward of the growth of zzso by means of screw zzso zzso mechanism of crystal growth has been zzso confirmed by experimental observations of screw zzso in zzso but it is a growth mechanism for a single zzso with growth fronts of zzso However, the growth fronts composed of many zzso of zzso zzso visible in zzso of zzso are not a zzso but a zzso phenomenon, so it has not been evident how the Frank mechanism might be of zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso growth is organized around a zzso core of zzso zzso a skeleton that the other components of zzso subsequently flesh out in a process of zzso zzso We establish that spiral and target patterns can arise in a liquid crystal formed layer by layer through the zzso zzso W, Cabrera zzso Frank F zzso The growth of zzso and the equilibrium structure of their zzso zzso zzso R zzso London zzso A zzso zzso and zzso that this layer growth mechanism is an instance of an important class of physical systems termed excitable zzso zzso liquid zzso grown in this way may have many technological zzso
