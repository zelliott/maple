zzso zzso listeners and zzso zzso listeners detected and zzso zzso harmonic complexes constructed of zzso harmonic components with fundamental zzso zzso ranging from 50 to 800 zzso zzso starting zzso were selected according to the positive and negative zzso zzso to produce zzso frequency sweeps with relatively flat zzso zzso zzso thresholds were not affected by component starting zzso for either group of zzso At presentation levels of 80 zzso zzso zzso listeners could discriminate the two zzso nearly perfectly when the zzso were less than zzso zzso but fell to chance performance for higher zzso zzso listeners performed significantly poorer, with reduced discrimination at several of the zzso In contrast, at a lower presentation level meant to nearly equate sensation levels for the two groups, zzso zzso discrimination was poorer than zzso listeners at most zzso zzso presentation levels had little effect on performance by zzso listeners but reduced performance by zzso zzso The differential impact of zzso level suggests a weaker perception of timbre differences and a greater zzso to the zzso effects of experimental uncertainty in zzso zzso
