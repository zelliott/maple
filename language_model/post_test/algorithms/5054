We recently developed a shotgun tool for zzso sites analysis, zzso for the sensitive and zzso analysis of chemically zzso proteins or zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso 2007, 6, zzso Here, we report a further development of the tool using a zzso scoring zzso It zzso explicit zzso with which sensitive detection of the zzso is possible with very low false zzso and now can be applied to moderate numbers of protein zzso Most of the false zzso in large scale analysis originate from partial matching where one side of the peptides is correctly matched while the other side is incorrectly zzso Additional zzso were calculated for each zzso and effectively minimized false zzso from such partial zzso The usefulness of the new scoring system was demonstrated for a previously published zzso from a zzso zzso c zzso searching against a large database of zzso protein zzso
