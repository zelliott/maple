Based on a detailed experimental investigation in an zzso zzso cell in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we present evidence of possible scenarios of the long-term dynamics of large-scale zzso zzso in bounded zzso turbulent zzso zzso zzso analysis of instantaneous zzso fields from long-time particle image zzso zzso suggests two different states, but both appear to be produced by a single large-scale flow zzso The zzso provide a three-dimensional picture of zzso in the zzso zzso A modified zzso relation between the zzso peak frequency zzso and zzso is zzso
