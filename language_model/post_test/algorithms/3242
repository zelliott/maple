The traditional clinical trail designs always depend on expert opinions and lack statistical zzso In this article, we present a method and illustrate how population zzso uncertainty may be incorporated in the overall simulation zzso Using the techniques of clinical trail simulation zzso and setting up predictions on the basis of zzso zzso models, we advance the modeling methods for zzso for treatment effects, and for the clinical trail power under the given zzso zzso Then we discuss the model of uncertainty, suggest an zzso method, add zzso statistics for sensitivity analysis, and zzso the effect of uncertainty about population parameters on clinical trail zzso The results from simulations and the zzso derived from this type of sensitivity analysis may be used for grading the influence on the prediction quality of uncertainty about different population zzso The experiment results are satisfactory and the approach presented has practical value in clinical zzso
