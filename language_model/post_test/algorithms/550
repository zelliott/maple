To verify the zzso value of zzso of early mortality in coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso 

From January 2005 to March 2007, 310 consecutive patients were operated with zzso zzso data for the zzso risk factor were collected and all patients were scored according to the zzso additive model, zzso or zzso zzso or predicted mortality was calculated for individual patients using the zzso zzso arranged zzso in order of predicted zzso The population was divided into three clinically relevant risk categories according to the range of predicted mortality zzso zzso mortality was compared to observed or actual mortality for each risk zzso zzso was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of operation or within the same hospital zzso 

zzso overall zzso low-risk group was zzso zzso zzso group was zzso zzso high-risk group was zzso zzso In the zzso model, predicted mortality was zzso for low-risk group, zzso for zzso group, zzso for high-risk group, and zzso for overall zzso zzso mortality was 0, zzso and zzso respectively, overall early mortality was zzso Area under the zzso curve was zzso 

The zzso yield good zzso value for hospital mortality of patients undergoing zzso especially in zzso zzso
