Several investigators have zzso the scatter component of digital zzso images by applying a constant weighting factor to a zzso version of the detected zzso The scatter approximation is then zzso from the detected zzso When a constant weighting factor is used, the scatter in areas of low transmission is zzso We have extended this technique by allowing for a zzso variable weighting factor based on the local image zzso This technique improves the scatter estimate and should provide better results for general zzso zzso
