The objective of this study was to evaluate the zzso functions of zzso composite zzso with the use of a resonant dynamic mechanical analysis technique in zzso The materials tested were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dynamic zzso loading was conducted in the frequency range from 1 to 150 zzso Composite specimens were tested after storage in water at 37 degrees C for 24 zzso One group was zzso zzso for zzso cycles with temperatures of zzso degrees zzso zzso were taken at 21 degrees C dry, and at 37 and 50 degrees C zzso Storage zzso loss zzso and other zzso parameters were determined from the zzso zzso Data for storage zzso and loss zzso of the materials were analyzed by means of zzso and zzso test zzso zzso zzso It was found that there were significant differences zzso zzso zzso in storage zzso and loss zzso among the zzso zzso zzso The highest value of storage zzso in zzso at 21 degrees C, was for zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There were significant differences zzso zzso zzso in storage zzso and loss zzso among the four different conditions zzso Storage zzso decreased at higher temperatures, whereas the loss zzso zzso zzso cycling increased storage zzso and decreased loss zzso The results showed that both zzso and zzso composition and zzso loading of the materials significantly affect their zzso functions, and the mechanical properties of the products cannot be characterized from the zzso zzso
