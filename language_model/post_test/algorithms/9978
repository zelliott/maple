zzso transport in closed potential flows is investigated for the specific case of a periodically zzso zzso zzso Despite the zzso nature of the flow, the periodic zzso effectively create zzso and/or zzso points arising from the joining of stable and unstable zzso For zzso zzso zzso chaos can be achieved with breakdown of the regular zzso structure, which is governed by symmetry conditions imposed by the zzso zzso zzso envelopes associated with zzso zzso of fixed points govern which regions of the flow control zzso space admit global zzso These regions are further refined via calculation of zzso zzso These results suggest significant zzso transport enhancement is possible within potential flows, given appropriate programming of stirring zzso
