In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting regular behavior of time zzso this method is based on the zzso section and the zzso zzso zzso The new method aims to distinguish random signals from deterministic zzso In fact, our method provides a pattern for decision making about whether a signal is random or zzso We apply this method to different time series, such as chaotic signals, random signals, and periodic zzso We apply this method to examples from all types of route to chaotic zzso This method has also been applied to data about iris zzso The results show that the new method can distinguish different types of zzso
