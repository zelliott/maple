This study compares normal and zzso voices using a novel voice analysis zzso that examines pitch zzso during connected zzso The study evaluates the clinical potential of the zzso as a mechanism to distinguish between normal and zzso voices using connected zzso 

Adult zzso from normal subjects and patients with known benign zzso vocal fold zzso were zzso zzso had been previously obtained in quiet under controlled zzso Two phrases and sustained zzso were recorded per zzso The subject populations consisted of 10 normal and 31 abnormal zzso The voice analysis zzso generated zzso patterns that represent pitch zzso in time and under variable window zzso zzso were collected from these patterns for window zzso between 10 and 250 zzso For comparison, jitter and zzso measures were collected from sustained zzso by means of the zzso Speech Lab zzso A zzso and tests of sensitivity and specificity assessed discrimination between normal and abnormal zzso 

More than zzso of the measures collected from connected speech outperformed the zzso jitter and zzso measures in population zzso Twenty-five percent of the experimental measures (including zzso indicated significantly different populations zzso zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that the zzso zzso between normal and abnormal populations by use of samples of connected zzso
