zzso regulation is largely enacted by zzso factors zzso binding zzso Large numbers of zzso binding motifs have been revealed by zzso experiments followed by zzso DNA motif zzso However, the success of motif discovery zzso has been limited when applied to sequences bound in zzso (such as those identified by zzso because the observed zzso interactions are not necessarily zzso Some zzso predominantly associate with DNA indirectly through protein partners, while others exhibit both direct and indirect zzso Here, we present the first method for distinguishing between direct and indirect zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding data, in zzso zzso occupancy data, and motifs from in zzso protein binding zzso zzso When applied to zzso zzso data, our method reveals that only zzso of the data sets can be readily explained by direct binding of the zzso zzso while zzso can be explained by indirect DNA zzso In the remaining zzso none of the motifs used in our analysis was able to explain the zzso data, either because the data were too noisy or because the set of motifs was zzso As more in zzso zzso DNA binding motifs become available, our method could be used to build a complete catalog of direct and indirect zzso zzso Our method is not restricted to zzso or to zzso data, but can be applied in any system for which both in zzso binding data and in zzso DNA binding motifs are zzso
