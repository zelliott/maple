We describe zzso deterministic versus zzso methodology, their applications to zzso research and the zzso background underlying both zzso zzso methods are based on the concept of zzso in phase zzso This concept on the one hand incorporates the idea of an autonomous zzso system, on the other hand implicates the investigation of a long time zzso It is an unresolved problem in zzso zzso research that zzso methods per zzso give no feedback about the zzso zzso zzso we introduce a combined strategy utilizing both zzso and zzso deterministic zzso We zzso in a first step to segment the zzso time series into zzso zzso epochs by means of zzso change point zzso zzso zzso measures can be estimated with higher confidence for the segmented epochs fulfilling the zzso zzso
