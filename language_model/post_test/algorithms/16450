This paper proposes a new approach to improve the amount of information extracted from the speech aiming to increase the accuracy of a system developed for the automatic detection of pathological zzso The paper addresses the discrimination capabilities of 11 features extracted using zzso analysis of time zzso Two of these features are based on conventional zzso statistics zzso zzso zzso and correlation zzso two are based on recurrence and zzso analysis, and the remaining are based on different zzso of the zzso Moreover, this paper uses a strategy based on combining zzso for fusing the zzso analysis with the information provided by classic zzso approaches found in the literature zzso parameters and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was carried out in two steps zzso first, a zzso and, later, a zzso zzso Combining both zzso the best accuracy obtained is zzso zzso zzso
