zzso zzso is one of the major sources of zzso in single point imaging sequences with short repetition zzso The unwanted signal is caused by zzso zzso zzso excited in preceding acquisition zzso zzso the problem emerges mainly around the zzso of zzso and has been solved in the past by additional zzso zzso In this work, unwanted residual zzso acquired with the zzso sequence was investigated and a new method for the suppression of residual zzso is zzso It is shown that residual zzso experiences a different phase zzso leading to residual images with a different zzso A phase cycling filter is able to eliminate the unwanted zzso Furthermore, a description of all signal components that occur is presented using an operator zzso The notation is new in this field with respect to its zzso That is, the signal description is based on an understanding of single point imaging zzso such as zzso by the use of an extended phase zzso zzso A prominent in zzso example is that of sodium imaging in biological tissue where zzso relaxation times are such that unwanted zzso can occur and therefore residual zzso becomes a significant zzso For instance, sodium in biological tissue has two zzso relaxation times of approximately zzso and zzso at zzso and this can result in significant zzso if the zzso time is short and zzso
