We evaluated the feasibility of demonstration of the embryonic cerebral zzso using three zzso zzso zzso and software which has been developed to automatically calculate the volume of zzso zzso after zzso zzso In four out of six subsequent ultrasound examinations which were done for determination of zzso age from eight to ten zzso weeks, sufficient resolution was obtained to demonstrate the embryonic cerebral zzso with automated volume calculation software, yielding striking images of a dramatic stage of embryonic zzso
