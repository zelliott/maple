To assess whether a scan triggering technique based on the slope of the zzso curve combined with table speed zzso may improve zzso enhancement in zzso CT zzso compared to conventional zzso triggering zzso zzso of zzso enhancement were performed in a zzso flow phantom over a range of simulated cardiac zzso zzso zzso using contrast media zzso of 80 and 150 zzso injected at 4 zzso These zzso were used to construct computer models of zzso zzso in CT zzso using cardiac zzso zzso diameter, and CT table speed as input zzso zzso enhancement was calculated for normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement was poor zzso zzso along most of the scan length using the zzso triggering technique for low cardiac zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Implementation of the zzso triggering technique with table speed zzso improved enhancement in all scenarios and yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement in all zzso zzso triggering with table speed zzso may improve the technical quality of zzso CT zzso over conventional zzso techniques, and may reduce technical failures related to low cardiac output and slow flow through an zzso zzso
