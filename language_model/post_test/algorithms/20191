zzso heart diseases are present in eight of every 1000 zzso The diagnosis of those zzso usually depends on the available imaging zzso A correct diagnosis requires a detailed observation of the heart chambers, wall motions, valves function, and quantitative evaluation of the cavity zzso For that goal numerous automatic zzso have been proposed to segment the zzso zzso In this paper, the authors evaluate the performance of a level set zzso based on the phase symmetry approach and on a new zzso stopping function to extract the heart cavity contours zzso and in a fully automatic zzso The extracted cardiac borders are then statistically compared with the ones manually sketched by four physicians on a set of 240 zzso zzso statistical tests are conducted on the data using several figures of merit, in order to study the zzso and zzso zzso among the four physicians and the level set algorithm, concerning to the extracted zzso The results show there is a great zzso about all the used similarity zzso A higher zzso zzso was found among the physicians than the zzso obtained when the zzso versus physician performance is zzso The statistical analysis suggests the proposed zzso produces results similar to the ones provided by the zzso
