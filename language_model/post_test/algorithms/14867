An inverse planning zzso for determining the intensity of modulated beams that generates zzso zzso dose zzso is zzso This zzso is based on the mathematical analysis of the singular values zzso It is integrated in the zzso zzso treatment planning zzso The dose is calculated by the separation of the primary and scattered zzso We zzso for a prostate cancer, the modulated intensity profiles and the optimal dose distribution obtained by the inverse zzso software developed and integrated in the treatment planning zzso We obtained a region with high doses which zzso zzso the target volume and spares the neighboring critical zzso This preliminary study showed the feasibility and the managing of the singular value decomposition to generate zzso dose distribution in a clinical zzso
