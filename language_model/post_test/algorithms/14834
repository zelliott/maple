It is well known that the periodic cycle zzso of a periodically forced zzso difference equation is zzso zzso if zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso is the carrying capacity of the environment and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean of the zzso cycle zzso ( zzso zzso In this article, we extend the concept of zzso and resonance of periodic cycles using the geometric mean for the average of a periodic zzso We study the properties of the periodically forced zzso delay zzso model zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso 0, 1, zzso zzso zzso , where zzso ( zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso are positive zzso zzso (K ( zzso zzso r ( zzso zzso as well as k and zzso are zzso zzso We will show that for all positive solutions zzso ( zzso zzso of the previous equation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, in the case where zzso is a zzso solution of the above equation zzso that such solution zzso and r ( zzso zzso the periodic cycle is zzso that is zzso Surprisingly, the obtained results show that the delays k and zzso do not play any zzso
