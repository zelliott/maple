Multiple time step zzso zzso present an effective integration approach to reduce the zzso cost of dynamics zzso By using force splitting to allow larger time steps for the more slowly varying force zzso zzso savings can be zzso The zzso zzso method has been independently devised to provide an effective and efficient treatment of the long-range zzso zzso Here we examine the performance of a combined zzso zzso previously developed for zzso on a large zzso zzso complex containing zzso zzso Our goal is to carefully combine the robust features of the zzso zzso methodology implemented in zzso uses position rather than zzso zzso with zzso to make possible outer time steps of 150 zzso the zzso zzso The developed zzso zzso removes fast terms from the zzso Ewald component by using switch zzso We analyze the advantages and limitations of the resulting scheme by comparing performance to the single time step zzso zzso zzso currently used in zzso by evaluating different zzso protocols using three zzso for zzso zzso and stability, all applied to long zzso zzso simulations to ensure proper energy zzso We also examine the performance of the zzso on a zzso distributed zzso computer zzso zzso 2000 with 8 zzso zzso zzso Good energy conservation and stability behavior can be demonstrated, for zzso protocols with outer time steps of up to 8 zzso and zzso protocols with outer time steps of up to 16 zzso Still, we emphasize the inherent limitations imposed by the incorporation of zzso methods into the zzso zzso that may not be widely zzso zzso the limiting factor on the largest outer zzso size, and hence zzso is an zzso cancellation error inherent to zzso This error stems from the zzso correction term contained in the zzso zzso This cancellation error varies in time and introduces artificial zzso to the governing dynamics zzso Unfortunately, we find that this zzso zzso error cannot be easily eliminated by refining the zzso parameters zzso resolution and/or order of zzso zzso We suggest that methods other than zzso for fast zzso may allow users to reap the full advantages from zzso zzso
