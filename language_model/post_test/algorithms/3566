The presence and quantity of zzso in pharmaceutical drugs can have a significant impact on their quality and zzso With the continuous pressure for increased industry zzso there is urgent need for a systematic and comprehensive drug zzso profiling zzso We report here our development of the fully automated Comprehensive zzso zzso zzso Technology zzso zzso The system includes five zzso seven zzso zzso methods, and zzso zzso zzso which provides automated generic zzso screening for any drug zzso An automated zzso peak tracking approach by zzso mass spectral interpretation is devised to zzso track zzso among all zzso zzso zzso The program passes zzso zzso mass zzso zzso through four sequential decision-making mass zzso tests and determines molecular weights for every zzso The system reduces the time required to obtain zzso profile from weeks to days, while the automated zzso peak tracking takes only minutes to interpret all zzso spectral data of zzso zzso zzso contents of 56 zzso drug candidate samples have all been successfully illustrated by zzso which contained more than 500 chemical zzso The program is able to track more than zzso of the compounds automatically with majority of the failure due to insufficient zzso for some zzso by zzso This system is well suited for efficient drug development and ensuring the quality and safety of drug zzso
