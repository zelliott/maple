The annual percent change zzso has been used as a measure to describe the trend in the zzso cancer zzso or mortality rate over relatively short time zzso The yearly data on these zzso rates are available from the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program of the National Cancer zzso The traditional methods to estimate the zzso is to fit a linear zzso of zzso of zzso rates on time using the least squares method or the weighted least squares method, and use the estimate of the slope zzso to define the zzso as the percent change in the rates between two consecutive zzso For comparing the zzso for two regions, one uses a zzso which assumes that the two zzso on the zzso of the zzso rates are independent and normally distributed with a common zzso Two modifications of this test, when there is an overlap between the two regions or between the time intervals for the two zzso have been recently zzso The first modification zzso the assumption of the independence of the two zzso but still assumes the common zzso The second modification zzso the assumption of the common zzso also, but assumes that the zzso of the zzso rates are obtained using zzso zzso for the mortality or zzso zzso In this paper, a unified approach to the problem of zzso the zzso is undertaken by modeling the counts to follow an zzso zzso zzso model, and by zzso a corrected Z zzso for testing the equality of two zzso A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the test and an application of the test to compare the trends, for a selected number of cancer sites, for two overlapping regions and with varied degree of overlapping time intervals is zzso
