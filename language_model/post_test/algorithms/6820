We examine a minimal model for zzso zzso The zzso potential energy is based on the zzso zzso seen in proteins and is used in conjunction with a zzso zzso We show that the zzso transition involves four zzso As the temperature is zzso the first observed state is a zzso state, the second a collapsed zzso the third a highly flexible zzso state, and the fourth a zzso zzso zzso We discuss in detail what effect the potential energy form has on these various states by systematically varying the potential from strongly zzso to zzso The data demonstrate that the zzso of a zzso is strongly related to zzso nature of the zzso In the zzso case, we show that the transition following a zzso collapse is not first order as zzso for these zzso In the strongly zzso case the zzso transition is consistent with cooperative zzso zzso
