zzso of visual stimuli by the zzso changes strongly during zzso zzso These changes are due to both local zzso processes and to changes in the retinal zzso The feedback zzso from horizontal cells to cones is known to be one of the pathways that is modulated strongly during zzso Although this phenomenon is well zzso the mechanism for this change is poorly zzso The aim of this paper is to describe the mechanism for the increase in efficiency of the feedback zzso from horizontal cells to zzso We show that a train of flashes can increase the feedback response from the horizontal cells, as measured in the cones, up to zzso This process has a time constant of approximately 3 s and can be attributed to processes intrinsic to the zzso It does not require zzso is not the result of changes in the zzso of the cone light response and is not due to changes in horizontal cells zzso During a flash train, cones adapt to the mean light intensity, resulting in a slight (4 zzso zzso of the zzso The time constant of this zzso is approximately 3 zzso We will show that at this zzso membrane potential, a zzso change of the cone membrane potential zzso a larger change in the calcium current than in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we will show that negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones can zzso the calcium current more efficiently at this zzso cone membrane zzso The change in horizontal cell response properties during the train of flashes can be fully attributed to these changes in the synaptic zzso Since feedback has major consequences for the zzso zzso and spectral processing, the described mechanism might be very important to zzso the zzso for ambient light zzso
