The extreme zzso of zzso zzso are important indicators on the influence of zzso structures to the collective zzso behavior of complex zzso Recent findings on the ensemble zzso of the extreme zzso have further zzso its zzso to the study of network zzso However, the ensemble average of extreme zzso has only been solved zzso up to the second order zzso Here, we determine the ensemble average of the extreme zzso and characterize its zzso across the ensemble through the discrete form of random zzso zzso zzso the zzso approximation derived from the discrete form shows significant improvement over previous results, which implies a more accurate prediction of the epidemic zzso In addition, we show that zzso networks, which are more robust against both random and targeted removal of zzso are more vulnerable to the spreading of zzso
