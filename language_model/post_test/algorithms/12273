The acceptance of zzso zzso features in zzso zzso zzso zzso will depend on their ability to appropriately discriminate zzso zzso zzso zzso This study tested the effectiveness of an zzso zzso with advanced zzso detection and new zzso designed to prevent zzso zzso 

zzso patients were implanted with a dual chamber zzso zzso zzso zzso Corporation, zzso zzso at 25 US zzso Ten patients received a coronary zzso zzso lead allowing a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The addition of new zzso features designed for zzso discrimination, and prevention of zzso had no adverse effect upon detection of induced zzso zzso zzso zzso detection time with new features ON was zzso seconds vs zzso seconds with features zzso A total of zzso of the induced and spontaneous zzso and zzso zzso receiving shock therapy were reviewed as appropriate zzso zzso shock conversion efficacy for spontaneous and induced zzso episodes was zzso and zzso respectively zzso spontaneous, 162 induced zzso A zzso zzso crossover trial of zzso preventative pacing features did not result in adverse effects, but there was no clinical efficacy for prevention of zzso 

zzso zzso detection and discrimination features combined with tiered zzso therapies did not adversely impact the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to appropriately detect and treat zzso zzso
