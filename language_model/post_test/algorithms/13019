Gene zzso represent an important class of evolutionary events that is likely to have contributed to the unique human zzso in the short evolutionary time since the zzso zzso With the availability of both human and zzso zzso drafts in high coverage zzso zzso and the high zzso quality of most human zzso it should now be possible to identify all human zzso gene zzso events zzso zzso and a few pioneering studies have attempted to do zzso However, the different levels of coverage in the human and zzso zzso zzso and the differing levels of gene zzso have led to problematic assumptions and zzso in the zzso and the zzso used to detect human zzso gene zzso In this study, we have developed a set of zzso tools to overcome a number of the conceptual problems that are prevalent in previous studies and have collected a reliable and representative set of human zzso
