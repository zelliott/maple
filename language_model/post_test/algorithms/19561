A review of the zzso characteristics and properties of plastic zzso detectors for use in radiation therapy is zzso The detectors show many desirable qualities when exposed to zzso zzso and electron beams, including water zzso energy independence, zzso dose zzso resistance to radiation damage and near temperature zzso These detectors do not require the usual conversion and/or correction factors used to convert the readings from common zzso to absorbed zzso Due to their small detecting volume, plastic zzso detectors exhibit excellent spatial zzso zzso performance, in certain specific cases, can be affected by zzso light arising in the optical zzso that carry the zzso signal to a zzso While this effect is negligible for zzso beams, it may not be ignored for electron beams and needs to be accounted zzso
