We propose a zzso zzso zzso that locally adapts the filtering directions to image content based on directional zzso With the zzso zzso energy zzso is improved for sharp image zzso A mathematical analysis based on an zzso statistical image model is presented to zzso the theoretical gain achieved by adapting the filtering zzso The analysis indicates that the proposed zzso is more effective than other zzso zzso Experimental results report a gain of up to zzso zzso in zzso over the conventional zzso for typical test zzso zzso the reconstruction from the zzso better represents the structure in the image and is visually more zzso
