zzso statistics are widely used in population zzso but they suffer from the drawback that no simple sufficient summary statistic exists, which captures all information required to distinguish different evolutionary zzso Here, we apply zzso a recent statistical method that combines simple zzso rules to maximize their joint zzso zzso We show that our zzso of boosting has a high power to detect selective zzso zzso events, such as zzso do not result in a large excess of false zzso A comparison to other neutrality tests shows that our boosting zzso performs well compared to other neutrality zzso Furthermore, we evaluated the relative contribution of different summary statistics to the identification of selection and found that for recent sweeps integrated zzso zzso is very zzso whereas older sweeps are better detected by zzso zzso Overall, zzso was found to contribute the most information for distinguishing between bottlenecks and zzso
