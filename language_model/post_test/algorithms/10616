Along with over 150 other groups we have tested our zzso protein structure prediction approach by submitting models for 30 target proteins to the sixth round of the Critical Assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of our modeled proteins fall into the comparative or zzso modeling zzso category, and some are fold recognition zzso zzso The key feature of our structure prediction strategy in zzso was an attempt to zzso select structural templates and to make accurate zzso zzso zzso selection was based mainly on consensus results of multiple sequence zzso Likewise, the consensus of multiple alignment zzso (or lack of it) was used to initially delineate reliable and unreliable alignment zzso zzso evaluation approaches were then used to identify the correct zzso zzso Our results suggest that in many cases use of multiple templates is zzso zzso correct alignments even within the context of a three-dimensional structure remains a zzso Together with more effective energy evaluation methods the simultaneous zzso of a zzso backbone inherited from the template is likely needed to see a clear progress in tackling this zzso Our analysis also suggests that human input has little to contribute to automatic methods in modeling high zzso zzso On the other hand, human expertise can be very valuable in modeling zzso related proteins and critical in cases of unexpected evolutionary changes in protein zzso
