Clinical application of the zzso gene expression signature has been delayed due to the large number of genes and complexity of prediction zzso In the current study we aimed to develop an zzso risk score with a limited number of genes that can robustly predict prognosis of patients with zzso zzso zzso The risk score was developed using Cox zzso values of 65 genes in the training set zzso zzso zzso and its zzso was validated in test sets zzso zzso zzso The risk score was a highly significant predictor of overall survival zzso in the first test cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the second test cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, the risk score was a significant risk factor among clinical variables examined together zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso 

The risk score zzso we have developed can identify two clinically distinct zzso zzso at early and late stages of the disease in a simple and highly zzso manner across multiple zzso
