Several hundred programs using different zzso have been designed to predict individual coding features within any zzso zzso but none of these tools covers all aspects of a gene or is zzso accurate in its zzso zzso simultaneous processing of the results from a number of these programs zzso the chance of a false positive prediction and quickly generates integrated zzso We report here on the analysis of two known genes in 5 and 25 zzso segments of zzso sequence using four zzso zzso packages, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene predictions were confirmed using zzso sequences and a comparison was made between the zzso This study showed a similarity in the ability of zzso zzso and zzso to predict zzso genes and basic structures, but poor zzso prediction for a small, 3 zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of all three packages correctly identified the 3 zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso identified a previously zzso possible zzso untranslated zzso for the smaller gene and a number of putative alternatively spliced zzso in the larger zzso Overall, zzso was found to be the most zzso package, in terms of easy access to databases and the interactive zzso display of zzso
