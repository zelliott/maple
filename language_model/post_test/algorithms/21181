zzso fluctuations resulting from the heart beat and zzso are a dominant source of noise in zzso particularly at high field zzso zzso used zzso noise correction techniques, such as zzso Image zzso zzso rely critically on the timing of the image acquisition relative to the heart zzso but do not account for the effects of subject zzso Such motion affects the fluctuation zzso yet volume registration can distort the timing zzso In this study, we aimed to systematically determine the optimal order of volume zzso zzso correction and zzso in their traditional zzso In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity of zzso to timing errors introduced by the slice zzso and we develop a new method of accounting for timing errors introduced by volume registration into zzso correction zzso zzso Both simulation and resting data indicate that the zzso standard zzso is reduced most by performing volume registration before zzso and zzso correction after zzso While simulations indicate that zzso noise correction with zzso constructed on a zzso basis more accurately modeled zzso noise compared to using the same zzso for the entire volume, the difference between these zzso techniques in subject data was zzso The zzso zzso showed marked improvement in simulations with varying amounts of subject motion, reducing the zzso standard zzso by up to zzso over the traditional zzso Though to a lesser degree than in zzso the zzso zzso performed better in nearly every zzso in the brain in both zzso and zzso subject zzso
