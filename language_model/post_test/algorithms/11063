zzso is associated with many conditions that lead to zzso such as cerebrovascular disorders or Alzheimer's zzso However, the specific role of zzso in the progression of cognitive deficits remains zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these events we used a zzso model of focal cerebral stroke, which causes deficits in zzso cognitive zzso 

zzso stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso cognitive function was evaluated by a contextual fear conditioning zzso The zzso zzso responses were investigated by zzso evaluation and diffusion zzso zzso zzso We used knockout mice for zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the release of zzso zzso to examine the links among zzso zzso the zzso response, and cognitive zzso 

zzso in cognitive function and zzso zzso response were observed after zzso in both rats and zzso Changes in the zzso tissue were detected by zzso as the mean zzso zzso value, which corresponded with the cognitive decline at 4 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 2 months after zzso Interestingly, the zzso mice with zzso showed a decline in zzso function, but not in zzso Furthermore, the zzso mice showed neither a zzso zzso zzso response (as assessed by zzso nor a change in zzso MD value after zzso In addition, zzso mice treated with a zzso zzso immediately after zzso did not show cognitive zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso zzso receptors are involved in the zzso inflammatory zzso The findings from this study may contribute to the development of a therapeutic strategy for brain zzso targeting the zzso zzso
