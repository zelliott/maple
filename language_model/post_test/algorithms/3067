In virtual reality zzso systems, the user's finger and hand positions are sensed and used to control the virtual zzso zzso zzso of zzso environments using surface zzso zzso signals may be more synergistic and zzso to the zzso The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a technique to predict the finger joint angle from the surface zzso zzso of the zzso muscle using neural network zzso 

zzso together with the actual joint angle zzso were obtained while the subject was performing zzso rotation of the index finger at three zzso Several neural networks were trained to predict the joint angle from the parameters extracted from the zzso zzso The best networks were selected to form six zzso The neural network committees were evaluated using data from new zzso 

There was zzso in the measured zzso signals during the zzso zzso However, neural network committees were able to predict the joint angle with reasonable zzso zzso errors ranged from zzso zzso zzso for fast speed zzso to zzso zzso zzso for slow speed finger extension, and from zzso zzso zzso for the fast speed finger zzso to zzso zzso zzso for slow speed finger zzso 

Although zzso was observed in the measured zzso signals, the committees of neural networks were able to predict the finger joint angle from zzso zzso
