Image zzso the process of zzso aligning zzso structures in multiple images, has recently been demonstrated to support automated zzso analysis of zzso images and, zzso to extract unique and zzso relevant information from zzso pressure zzso Recent registration methods have focused on zzso with slow but globally powerful zzso In this paper, we present an alternative registration approach that zzso both speed and zzso with the goal of making zzso image registration more practical for zzso laboratory and clinical zzso The current zzso first extracts zzso zzso zzso from pressure image zzso and then zzso matches these zzso profiles using zzso based on dynamic zzso Special cases of disconnected images zzso occur in zzso subjects, for example) are dealt with by introducing an artificial zzso linear bridge between adjacent image zzso Two registration zzso were developed: a zzso algorithm, which exclusively matched zzso and a zzso algorithm, which performed subsequent zzso After testing the two zzso on 30 control image pairs considered in a previous study, we found that, when compared with previously published results, the hybrid zzso improved overlap ratio zzso but both current zzso had slightly higher zzso error, zzso because they did not consider zzso zzso Nonetheless, both zzso greatly improved the zzso efficiency zzso and zzso zzso per image pair for geometric and hybrid registrations, zzso These results imply that zzso zzso pressure image analyses can, eventually, be implemented for practical clinical zzso
