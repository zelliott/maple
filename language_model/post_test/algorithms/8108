The analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been an essential step in characterizing the dynamics of molecules in the zzso Although clearly important, the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the powder patterns is often complicated by poor sensitivity and/or spectral zzso Previously, others have demonstrated the utility of zzso a mathematical transform that yields the zzso in a straightforward manner for zzso zzso zzso In this short paper, we describe our analysis of a powder sample of zzso acid, a zzso with two distinct zzso environments and zzso The zzso sites are immediately amenable to the standard zzso transform analysis due to their low zzso However, the zzso methodology for the acid zzso for which the asymmetry deviates significantly from zero, requires more analysis to extract their zzso The impact of this work on the future application of zzso to a wider range of samples is also zzso
