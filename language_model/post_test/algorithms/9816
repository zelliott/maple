DNA molecules under good zzso conditions zzso when subjected to strong zzso electrical zzso It is shown that zzso electrical fields couple charge fluctuations to molecular shape zzso which produces a zzso noise source that can dominate over equilibrium zzso noise in the zzso zzso The zzso excess charge fluctuations amplify the zzso fluctuation attraction force between neighboring zzso providing a mechanism for zzso DNA zzso
