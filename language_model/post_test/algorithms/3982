In this paper, we consider the design for comparing the performance of two zzso zzso rules, for example, two record linkage zzso or two screening zzso zzso methods are well developed for comparing these accuracy measures when the gold standard is available for every unit in the sample, or in a zzso study when the gold standard is zzso only in the second phase in a zzso using a fixed sampling zzso However, these methods do not attempt to zzso the sampling scheme to minimize the zzso of the zzso of zzso In comparing the performance of two zzso rules, the parameters of primary interest are the difference in sensitivities, zzso and positive zzso zzso We derived the zzso zzso formulas for these zzso estimates and used them to obtain the optimal sampling zzso The efficiency of the optimal sampling design is evaluated through an empirical investigation that compares the optimal sampling with simple random sampling and with zzso zzso zzso of the empirical study show that the optimal sampling design is similar for zzso the difference in sensitivities and in zzso and both achieve a substantial amount of zzso reduction with an zzso of subjects with zzso results and zzso of subjects with zzso zzso A zzso rule is recommended when there is no prior knowledge of individual sensitivities and zzso or the prevalence of the true positive findings in the study zzso The optimal sampling is applied to a real-world example in record linkage to evaluate the difference in zzso accuracy of two matching zzso
