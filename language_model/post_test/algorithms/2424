Contemporary research is developing techniques to tracking objects in videos using color features, and the mean shift zzso zzso is one of the zzso This known zzso is employed to find the location of an object, in image zzso by using a zzso called the zzso zzso This zzso is calculated through an object tracking zzso to present the similarity in appearance between an object and its candidate model, where the best representation of an object is acquired, once this is could be zzso However, the zzso zzso performance is zzso by color clutter in background, various zzso zzso types and other related zzso Because of such effects, the zzso necessarily decreases the value of the zzso zzso indicating reduced certainty in the object zzso In the present research, an improved convex kernel function is proposed to overcome the partial zzso zzso in order to improve the zzso zzso against the low zzso and also sudden light, changes are made from motion information of the desired zzso By using both the color feature and the motion information zzso the capability of the zzso zzso is zzso increased, in the present zzso Moreover, by assuming a constant speed for the object, a robust zzso zzso the Kalman zzso is realized to solve the full zzso zzso At the end, experimental results on various videos verify that the proposed method has an optimum performance in real-time object zzso while the result of the original zzso zzso may be zzso
