zzso uses estimates of the time delay zzso by zzso to zzso strain estimates in tissue due to zzso zzso Because the time delay estimates do not generally occur at the sampling zzso the location of the zzso peak does not give an accurate estimate of the time zzso zzso errors in the zzso estimate are reduced using signal zzso techniques to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso of the echo signals due to tissue zzso introduce correlation artifacts in the zzso These artifacts are reduced by a combination of small zzso and zzso stretching of the zzso zzso Random noise effects in the resulting zzso are reduced by averaging several zzso obtained from successive small zzso zzso that the errors are zzso zzso averaging with zzso stretching is shown to increase the zzso ratio in the zzso by an order of zzso without sacrificing sensitivity, resolution or dynamic zzso The strain filter concept is extended in this article to theoretically characterize the performance of zzso averaging with zzso zzso
