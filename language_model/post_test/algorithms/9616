zzso and direct methods have been developed for reconstructing zzso images from dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods are simple and easy to implement because reconstruction and kinetic modeling are performed in two separate zzso zzso methods estimate zzso images directly from dynamic PET zzso and, in theory, can be statistically more efficient, but the zzso are often difficult to implement and are very specific to the kinetic model being zzso This paper presents a class of generalized zzso for direct reconstruction of zzso images that are relatively easy to implement and can be adapted to different kinetic zzso The proposed zzso use zzso transfer principle to convert the zzso of a penalized likelihood into a zzso weighted least squares zzso kinetic fitting problem at each zzso Thus, it can employ existing zzso zzso developed for kinetic zzso The proposed zzso resemble the empirical zzso zzso of the indirect approach, but zzso to a solution of the direct zzso Computer simulations showed that the proposed direct reconstruction zzso are flexible and achieve a better zzso zzso than indirect reconstruction zzso
