We propose an zzso zzso method, named zzso for finding common patterns from two zzso secondary zzso The method works by representing zzso secondary structures as ordered labeled trees and performs tree pattern discovery using an efficient dynamic programming zzso zzso is able to identify and extract the largest common zzso from two zzso molecules having different sizes without prior knowledge of the locations and zzso of these zzso We also extend zzso to find repeated regions in an zzso secondary structure, and apply this extended method to detect structural repeats in the zzso region of a protein zzso zzso We describe the biological significance of a repeated hairpin found by our method, demonstrating the usefulness of the zzso zzso is implemented in zzso a jar file including the source code of the program is available for download at zzso
