zzso regulatory interactions between genes from zzso zzso data, yielding reverse engineered gene regulatory networks, is of paramount importance to systems biology and zzso zzso zzso methods to address this problem can ultimately provide a deeper insight into the complexity, behavior, and functions of the underlying biological zzso However, the large number of interacting genes coupled with short and often noisy zzso zzso of the system renders the reverse engineering a challenging zzso zzso the development and assessment of methods which are zzso efficient, robust against noise, zzso to short time series data, and preferably capable of reconstructing the zzso of the regulatory interactions remains a pressing research problem with valuable zzso 

Here we perform the largest systematic analysis of a set of similarity measures and scoring schemes within the scope of the relevance network approach which are commonly used for gene regulatory network reconstruction from time series zzso In addition, we define and analyze several novel measures and schemes which are particularly suitable for short zzso time zzso We also compare the considered 21 measures and 6 scoring schemes according to their ability to correctly reconstruct such networks from short time series data by calculating summary statistics based on the corresponding specificity and zzso Our results demonstrate that rank and symbol based measures have the highest performance in zzso regulatory zzso In addition, the proposed scoring scheme by zzso weighting has shown to be valuable in reducing the number of false positive zzso On the other hand, zzso causality as well as zzso measures, frequently used in zzso of regulatory networks, show low performance on the short time series analyzed in this zzso 

Our study is intended to serve as a guide for choosing a particular combination of similarity measures and scoring schemes suitable for reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from short time series zzso We show that further improvement of zzso for reverse engineering can be obtained if one considers measures that are rooted in the study of symbolic dynamics or ranks, in contrast to the application of common similarity measures which do not consider the zzso character of the employed zzso Moreover, we establish that the zzso weighting scoring scheme together with symbol based measures (for low noise zzso and rank based measures (for high noise zzso are the most suitable zzso
