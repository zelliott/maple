Lung zzso are commonly encountered in clinical practice, yet little is known about their management in community zzso An automated method for identifying patients with lung zzso would greatly facilitate research in this zzso 

Using members of a large, community-based health plan from 2006 to 2010, we developed a method to identify patients with lung zzso by combining five diagnostic codes, four procedural codes, and a natural language processing zzso that performed free text searches of zzso zzso An experienced zzso reviewed a random sample of 116 zzso zzso providing a reference standard for the natural language processing zzso 

With the use of an automated method, we identified zzso unique members as having one or more incident lung zzso The mean age of the patients was 65 years zzso zzso 14 zzso There were slightly more women zzso than men, and Hispanics and zzso comprised zzso of the lung zzso zzso zzso percent were never smokers whereas zzso were current zzso Fourteen percent of the patients were subsequently diagnosed with lung zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the natural language processing zzso for identifying the presence of lung zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso Among the true positive transcripts in the validation sample, only zzso were solitary and unaccompanied by one or more associated findings, and zzso measured 8 to 30 zzso in zzso 

A combination of diagnostic codes, procedural codes, and a natural language processing zzso for free text searching of zzso reports can accurately and efficiently identify patients with incident lung zzso many of whom are subsequently diagnosed with lung zzso
