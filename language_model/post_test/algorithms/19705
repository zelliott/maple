zzso protein structures such as secondary structures or contact numbers are useful for three-dimensional structure prediction and helpful for intuitive understanding of the zzso zzso zzso prediction methods will serve as a basis for these and other zzso 

We implemented a program zzso which predicts secondary structures, contact numbers and zzso contact zzso This program is based on a novel machine learning scheme called critical random zzso Unlike most conventional one-dimensional structure prediction methods which are based on local windows of an zzso acid zzso zzso takes into account the whole zzso zzso zzso on average per chain, zzso zzso zzso for secondary structure zzso and correlation zzso of zzso and zzso for contact number and zzso contact order predictions, zzso 

zzso will be a useful tool for zzso as well as experimental biologists who need accurate one-dimensional protein structure zzso
