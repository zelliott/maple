The zzso assessment of zzso zzso has been an elusive clinical zzso Recent studies have highlighted the value of pulmonary zzso zzso flow reversal in indicating the presence of severe zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the basic zzso of zzso inflow in the presence and absence of zzso In particular, the hypothesis that zzso zzso flow depends on the interaction of zzso volume with zzso and zzso properties zzso initial volume, total area of the pulmonary veins at the zzso zzso and the inertia of zzso zzso was tested and further, that the combination of these zzso rather than zzso volume alone, determines zzso zzso A mathematical model of the atrium and pulmonary veins was zzso zzso and zzso pressure were modeled as the product of chamber zzso and volume, where zzso zzso varied in time to simulate zzso relaxation and descent of the zzso zzso A zzso of the modified unsteady zzso equation was used to zzso the zzso zzso that resulted from the developed pressure zzso The modeling was performed over a range of initial zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso initial zzso volumes (20 to 75 zzso total zzso areas zzso to zzso zzso and zzso inflow zzso (8 to 18 zzso with and without the addition of two zzso jets zzso volume of 20 and 60 zzso The model realistically simulated the zzso zzso zzso in magnitude and zzso As the volume of zzso increased, zzso peak flow zzso zzso and eventually late zzso flow reversal zzso However, the peak flow zzso the time to peak flow, and the presence and magnitude of flow reversal were influenced by zzso compliance, volume, total zzso inlet area, and zzso inflow zzso This study found that zzso flow zzso and reversal increased as zzso compliance, volume, and zzso inertia decreased and as zzso inlet area zzso zzso and zzso properties zzso volume, total zzso zzso inlet area, and zzso inflow zzso acting in zzso mediate the zzso impact of the zzso zzso in terms of the resulting rise in zzso pressure as reflected by the pattern of zzso zzso zzso For example, zzso flow reversal is more likely in acute compared with chronic zzso because the atrium is less zzso and has a smaller initial zzso zzso the clinical assessment of zzso zzso using changes in zzso zzso flow must be viewed in the context of zzso and zzso zzso
