We studied the zzso zzso model, which was introduced to explain zzso law in a real economy, on a random zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we zzso obtained the stationary probability distribution function of zzso The results show that wealth zzso indicated by the divergence of the zzso of wealth, occurs at a larger J than that obtained by the zzso theory, where J represents the strength of interaction between zzso We compared our results with zzso simulation results and found that they were in good zzso
