To use the power of knowledge acquisition and machine learning in the development of a collaborative computer zzso system based on the features of age-related zzso zzso zzso 

A vocabulary was acquired from four zzso experts who examined 100 zzso zzso The vocabulary was zzso zzso zzso and incorporated into a collaborative computer zzso system called zzso Using this system, three of the experts examined images from a second set of digital images compiled from more than 1000 patients with zzso Images were zzso and features were identified and zzso zzso trees, a machine learning method, were trained on the data collected and used to extract zzso zzso between the data from the different clinicians were zzso 

Six zzso classes in the structured vocabulary were largely sufficient to describe all the identified zzso The decision trees classified the data with zzso to zzso accuracy and distilled patterns in the form of zzso trees composed of 5 to 15 zzso Experts were largely consistent in their characterization of soft, and to a lesser extent, hard zzso but diverge in definition of other zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the main zzso of zzso type across all zzso 

zzso learning is a powerful tool for the characterization of disease zzso The creation of a defined feature set for zzso will facilitate the development of an zzso zzso zzso
