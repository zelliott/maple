The aim of this paper is to report an extension to the zzso efficient zzso Similar zzso model zzso et zzso zzso zzso 53, zzso zzso to include the effects of local gain control in the zzso The method employed to do this has been to fit a family of zzso functions to the human contrast sensitivity function zzso of van zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso within each family are zzso in a simplified manifestation of the zzso channels found by Wilson et zzso zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso The sensitivity of each level, or channel, that formed the original zzso model is modulated individually according to the fitted values, as the local zzso varies within an zzso The model was tested against zzso data obtained by zzso and Burton zzso zzso 26, zzso 1987) during experiments on visual zzso The consistency of the results indicates the zzso of the approximations and the zzso of the model, either for machine vision purposes or for predicting human visual zzso A simple algorithm, developed for use with a machine vision application of this model, provides a means by which a TV camera may be focused zzso The success of this algorithm, using the newly zzso channel sensitivities, suggests that human focal accommodation may be regulated by a similar form of zzso
