zzso stroke is a suddenly developing temporary or often permanent damage of the zzso Several candidate genes have been shown to have an impact in the zzso of zzso zzso Recently, the zzso zzso in zzso A5 zzso gene has been reported to be associated with zzso stroke in different racial groups, but no data is available currently in Han zzso Our study is to investigate the association between the zzso gene zzso zzso and the zzso to zzso stroke in Han zzso 

310 controls and zzso patients with classified zzso stroke were performed to detect the zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso analysis in independent zzso zzso 

zzso levels of subjects carrying zzso zzso were elevated compared to the subjects with zzso zzso in all zzso stroke zzso and in zzso The serum zzso zzso and zzso levels did not differ between subjects with T or C zzso in each zzso The overall distribution of zzso zzso zzso among stroke patients and controls was significantly different zzso zzso of zzso zzso and C zzso were significantly higher in all stroke zzso than those in control zzso After adjustment for conventional risk factors, zzso zzso analysis showed that C zzso carrier zzso of zzso was an independent risk factor for all stroke zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso zzso is independently associated with the development of zzso stroke in Chinese Han population, and zzso zzso may have a promoting effect on zzso zzso
