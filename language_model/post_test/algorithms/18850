zzso caused by zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso is a zzso disease, second only to zzso The emergence of zzso resistant to commonly used drugs and the lack of availability of vaccines zzso the zzso One of the preventive approaches targets zzso of zzso to host cells and zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by proteins called zzso zzso of zzso by either zzso the host with zzso or zzso the interaction using structural zzso of host cell receptors holds the potential to develop novel preventive zzso The availability of complete zzso sequence offers new opportunities for identifying zzso and zzso zzso Development of zzso zzso can simplify this task and accelerate experimental characterization of the predicted zzso from complete zzso A curated positive zzso of zzso known zzso from zzso species was prepared by careful examination of literature zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso The negative zzso consisted of proteins representing various zzso functions including information processing, zzso and interface zzso We did not include proteins likely to be on the surface with unknown zzso properties or which are linked even indirectly to the zzso process in either of the training zzso A zzso approach using zzso compositional properties of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso was used to develop zzso Web server with Support zzso zzso zzso model zzso as its engine for the prediction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso engine has six zzso zzso models identified through an exhaustive search from zzso kernel parameters zzso These models displayed an efficiency zzso correlation zzso of zzso The final prediction zzso score is the maximum score attained by a given sequence in any of the six zzso The results of zzso runs on complete zzso of zzso species revealed that in zzso zzso at zzso scores above zzso we observed a sensitivity of zzso with two false zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso an optimal threshold zzso score of zzso was optimal with very few false zzso zzso zzso Several new predictions were zzso This list includes hypothetical protein zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso liver stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mature zzso zzso surface zzso or zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 2, zzso surface protein 6 in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso related anonymous zzso 28 zzso zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Among these, a few proteins identified by zzso were matched with those identified by other groups using different experimental and theoretical zzso Most other zzso repeat proteins in zzso species had lower zzso zzso These new predictions could serve as new leads for further experimental characterization zzso zzso zzso
