zzso placement is an important zzso in protein zzso zzso zzso for zzso is a difficult problem because of the large search space to be zzso This problem can be addressed using constraint logic programming zzso which is an artificial intelligence technique developed to solve large zzso search zzso The zzso placement problem can be expressed as a zzso program in which zzso zzso are used as values for finite domain zzso and bad zzso contacts involving zzso are represented as zzso This paper introduces the concept of zzso zzso and shows how these can be used in implementing a novel zzso zzso We present results that compare the accuracy of models constructed using different zzso libraries and different domain variable zzso zzso The results obtained using this zzso approach compare zzso with those obtained by other zzso
