Authors of several recent papers have independently introduced a family of transformations (the zzso family), which zzso the zzso of zzso data up to the first zzso However, for data from zzso zzso tests for differential expression may require that the zzso of the difference of transformed observations be constant, rather than that of the transformed observations zzso 

We introduce a transformation within the zzso family which zzso to the first order, the zzso of the difference of transformed zzso We also introduce transformations from the zzso and zzso families which provide good approximate zzso stabilization of zzso Examples using zzso data show that any of these transformations may provide sufficient zzso stabilization for practical applications, and all perform well compared to log zzso
