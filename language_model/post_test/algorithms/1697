Finding genes associated with a disease is an important issue in the biomedical area and many gene zzso methods have been proposed for this zzso Among these, network-based approaches are recently proposed and outperformed functional zzso zzso Here, we introduce a novel zzso zzso zzso to help identify putative genes likely to be associated with specific diseases or zzso In the zzso gene zzso is performed through a random walk with zzso algorithm, a zzso art network-based method, along with a zzso relationship zzso The plug-in also allows users efficiently collect biomedical evidence for highly ranked candidate zzso A set of known zzso candidate genes and a zzso relationship network can be provided in a flexible zzso
