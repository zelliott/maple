We have designed and built an zzso zzso zzso imaging system, dubbed the zzso zzso system, or zzso zzso zzso into the system shielding allow for the interchange of pinhole plates, enabling the system to operate over a wide range of zzso and with virtually any desired pinhole zzso The flexibility of the system allows system zzso for specific imaging tasks and also allows for modifications necessary due to improved zzso electronics, and knowledge of system construction zzso system sensitivity zzso We provide an overview of zzso focusing primarily on system design and construction, zzso construction, and zzso zzso Reconstruction zzso will be described and reconstructed images zzso
