It is understood that zzso genes are useful for exploring scientific knowledge from DNA zzso gene expression zzso The explored knowledge can be finally used for zzso biological function for novel zzso zzso the explored knowledge in an efficient manner is then closely related to the zzso zzso However, this issue has not yet been paid the attention it zzso 

A novel method based on template theory in cognitive psychology and pattern recognition is developed in this study for representing knowledge extracted from cluster analysis zzso The basic principle is to represent knowledge according to the relationship between genes and a found cluster zzso Based on this novel knowledge representation method, a pattern recognition zzso (the decision tree zzso zzso is then used to construct a zzso for zzso biological functions of novel zzso The experiments on five published zzso show that this method has improved the zzso performance compared with the conventional zzso The statistical tests indicate that this improvement is zzso 

The software package can be obtained upon request from the zzso
