zzso are zzso in zzso that are integrated into, and zzso as part of, the host bacterial zzso These mobile elements can have tremendous impact on their bacterial zzso zzso and zzso which may lead to strain emergence and diversification, increased zzso or zzso zzso However, finding zzso in microbial zzso remains a problem with no definitive zzso The majority of existing tools rely on detecting zzso regions enriched in zzso genes with known zzso zzso which zzso the de zzso discovery of zzso zzso In this study, a weighted zzso detection algorithm, zzso was developed based on seven distinctive characteristics of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso strand zzso customized AT and zzso zzso the abundance of unique zzso words, zzso zzso points and the similarity of zzso zzso The first five characteristics are capable of identifying zzso without any sequence similarity with known zzso zzso zzso locates zzso by ranking zzso regions enriched in distinctive zzso traits, which leads to the successful prediction of zzso of zzso in 50 complete bacterial zzso with a zzso zzso rate and a zzso zzso zzso
