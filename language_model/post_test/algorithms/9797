The objective of this study was to evaluate the existence of cognitive zzso in some individuals during the course of Alzheimer's disease zzso 

Data came from the historical patient group collected via the zzso to zzso a zzso for Alzheimer's Disease zzso Duke University, zzso Data reduction was performed by using principal components analysis to derive a single cognitive measure zzso followed by application of a novel zzso zzso to individual patient data, looking for stable periods of 3 years or zzso To evaluate the time dependence of zzso we fitted a linear mixed model to the group and to individual data zzso 

Twenty-two percent of zzso subjects zzso and zzso of healthy control subjects zzso exhibited a zzso Within the zzso plateau group, the most common pattern was a single plateau zzso zzso years; range, 3 to 7 zzso that extended for the entire measurement period zzso zzso zzso plateau zzso were seen at the beginning or end of the measurement zzso zzso cognitive function zzso was slightly higher in the plateau group, which was also slightly older and less zzso Men and women were equally zzso 

In a patient sample predating the widespread use of zzso zzso we found that approximately one fifth of individuals with zzso demonstrated periods of prolonged cognitive zzso This significant zzso zzso must be considered when providing zzso information to families and when assessing individual patient responses to zzso We advise caution when assessing results of potentially zzso agents at the individual patient zzso
