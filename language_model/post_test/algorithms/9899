In this paper, electroencephalogram zzso signals of 20 schizophrenic patients and 20 zzso control participants are analyzed with the objective of zzso the two zzso 

For each case, 20 channels of zzso are zzso Several features including Shannon zzso spectral zzso approximate zzso zzso complexity and zzso zzso dimension are extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used for reliable estimate of the zzso of the two zzso The training set is used for training the two zzso zzso linear zzso analysis zzso and zzso boosting zzso Each zzso is assessed using the test zzso 

A zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso is obtained by zzso and zzso zzso For further improvement, genetic programming is employed to select the best features and remove the redundant zzso zzso the two zzso to the reduced feature set, a zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso is obtained by zzso and zzso zzso The proposed technique is compared and contrasted with a recently reported method and it is demonstrated that a considerably enhanced performance is zzso 

This study shows that zzso signals can be a useful tool for discrimination of the schizophrenic and control zzso It is suggested that this analysis can be a complementary tool to help psychiatrists diagnosing schizophrenic zzso
