zzso labeling of anatomical structures in medical images is very important in many zzso zzso Recently, zzso labeling in the zzso manner has been widely investigated to alleviate the possible zzso when registering zzso to the target zzso However, the weights used for label fusion from the registered zzso in conventional methods are generally zzso independently and thus lack the capability of preventing the ambiguous zzso patches from contributing to the label zzso More zzso these weights are often calculated based only on the simple patch zzso thus not necessarily providing optimal solution for label zzso To address these issues, we present a novel zzso label fusion method in zzso scenario, for the goal of labeling each zzso in the target image by the best representative zzso patches that also have the lowest joint risk of zzso Specifically, sparse coding is used to select a small number of zzso patches which best represent the underlying patch at each point of the target image, thus minimizing the chance of including the misleading zzso patches for zzso Furthermore, we examine the joint risk of any pair of zzso patches in making similar labeling error, by analyzing the correlation of their zzso error patterns and also the labeling consensus among zzso This joint risk will be further zzso updated based on the latest labeling results to correct the possible labeling zzso To demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, we have evaluated it on both whole brain zzso and zzso zzso and achieved promising labeling results, compared with the state-of-the-art zzso
