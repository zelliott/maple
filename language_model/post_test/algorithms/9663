zzso zzso zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso is becoming an important protocol in simplifying zzso since it reduces the need of cumbersome planning of zzso However the acquisition times of zzso zzso are prohibitive due to the large fields of view zzso and the high spatial resolution required for depicting small structures and zzso To address this problem, we propose a three-dimensional zzso acquisition scheme that combines Cartesian sampling in the zzso direction with an zzso zzso scheme in the zzso zzso Different zzso patterns were investigated in combination with an zzso sensitivity zzso zzso reconstruction and a zzso cardiac zzso Noise amplification maps were calculated to compare the performance of the different patterns using zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso scheme was implemented on a clinical MR scanner and tested on zzso and healthy zzso The proposed method exhibits better image quality even for high acceleration factors (up to zzso in comparison to Cartesian zzso
