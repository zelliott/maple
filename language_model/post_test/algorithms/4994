We describe a technique that enhances the sensitivity of a zzso for trace gas detection employing an external cavity continuously zzso CW quantum cascade laser and zzso the zzso zzso across multiple lines of the zzso We demonstrate the power of this method by continuously recording the zzso zzso of zzso across the R branch from zzso to zzso zzso By zzso the resulting zzso the detection sensitivity of zzso is improved by a factor of 15 compared to the sensitivity achieved using single line laser zzso zzso with the same zzso This procedure offers much shorter data acquisition times for the real-time monitoring of trace gas species compared to adding repeated scans of the zzso to improve the zzso zzso
