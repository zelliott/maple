zzso zzso zzso is a cornerstone of small animal research, but conventional methods cannot detect regional zzso in cardiac zzso Reliable assessment of regional cardiac function would be of value in transgenic models of zzso zzso Until now zzso zzso for achieving this suffers from a number of zzso We developed a simple zzso for rapidly assessing the relative zzso zzso zzso that occurs between zzso and zzso that is, regional zzso zzso zzso strain zzso 

zzso assessment was performed in mice at baseline zzso zzso zzso 2 hours zzso zzso zzso injection zzso zzso zzso and 10 days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso loop was acquired by the zzso zzso zzso technique in the zzso zzso projection at 3 zzso below the zzso zzso zzso and zzso borders were traced at zzso and zzso and zzso was calculated for each of zzso segments by the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of variation for zzso zzso assessment were zzso and zzso zzso At zzso average zzso zzso was zzso and zzso was similar in all cardiac segments regardless of how many segments the heart was divided zzso In the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice, zzso and zzso length of the zzso respectively, zzso was near zero and significantly different from the remaining zzso 

We describe a simple and straightforward approach to zzso regional zzso deformation in mouse models of cardiovascular zzso
