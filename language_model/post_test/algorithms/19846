Current strategies for functional rehabilitation of zzso patients with zzso implants or surgical zzso repair have been extended by the feasibility of active middle ear zzso The aim of the present research is to evaluate a new zzso of the treatment of these patients that considers active middle ear zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso cases are provided with a zzso hearing aid after birth and implanted with an active middle ear implant within the second zzso zzso cases are provided with a zzso hearing aid and implanted with a middle ear or zzso device in early zzso zzso cases without amplification in the vulnerable time after birth are carefully selected for late zzso At age 8 to 10, the zzso reconstruction is zzso 

zzso of zzso irrespective of age, functional gain in zzso 

The results of early zzso are as good as those previously published for zzso Mean reaction threshold with the Vibrant zzso was 21 zzso Mean functional gain was 48 zzso The local zzso are zzso and ready for zzso zzso 

Active middle ear implants allow early and selective stimulation of the auditory zzso in children with zzso zzso hearing loss and are expected to lead to the normal development of the zzso hearing zzso To date, it is the only option if the stimulation is to be started at the age of 12 to 18 zzso This was implemented into a new zzso for zzso zzso
