An improved method for the high-speed zzso for zzso zzso employing an injection marker is zzso The critical process of zzso is automated sampling of the water phase, which prevents contamination from the zzso zzso However, deployment of zzso sometimes produces incorrect and inaccurate values compared with data from closely related methods due to low zzso of compounds or instrument zzso zzso careful manual inspection of data is needed to confirm the results obtained by this zzso To solve this problem, compounds were screened for suitability as injection markers and zzso was the most suitable compound zzso Introduction of the injection marker into the process successfully eliminated the need for the tedious and time-consuming manual inspection zzso
