A new approach to the problem of zzso medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information zzso or relative zzso as a new matching zzso The method presented in this paper applies zzso to measure the statistical dependence or information zzso between the image zzso of corresponding zzso in both images, which is assumed to be zzso if the images are zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a very general and powerful zzso because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the zzso zzso The accuracy of the zzso criterion is validated for rigid body registration of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images by comparison with the zzso registration solution, while zzso is evaluated with respect to zzso issues, such as zzso and zzso and image content, including partial overlap and image zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso accuracy with respect to the zzso reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior zzso feature zzso or other zzso steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical zzso
