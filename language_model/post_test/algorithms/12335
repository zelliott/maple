Due to the difficulty of the specific zzso rate zzso measurement in an actual human body for electromagnetic zzso zzso exposure, in various compliance assessment procedures the incident electric field or power density is being used as a reference level, which should never yield a larger zzso average zzso than the basic safety zzso The relationship between the reference level and the zzso average zzso however, was established mainly based on zzso calculations for highly simplified human zzso dozens of years zzso Its zzso is being questioned by the latest calculation zzso In zzso the zzso of the reference level with respect to the basic zzso limit for zzso exposure, it is essential to have a high accuracy of human zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we made a detailed error analysis in the zzso average zzso calculation for the zzso zzso zzso method in conjunction with the perfectly matched layer zzso absorbing zzso We derived a basic rule for the zzso employment based on a zzso sphere and the zzso theory zzso We then attempted to clarify to what extent the zzso average zzso may reach using an zzso based Japanese adult model and a scaled child zzso The results show that the zzso average zzso under the zzso reference level exceeds the basic safety limit nearly zzso for the child model both in the resonance frequency and 2 zzso zzso
