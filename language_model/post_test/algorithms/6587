The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso which determine the rate of elimination of zzso drugs, demonstrates considerable zzso zzso The extent to which age and sex influence zzso activity remains unclear in zzso Our objectives were to determine whether in zzso activity of selected zzso zzso is affected by age or sex and to evaluate sex zzso in a large sample zzso 

We have assessed in zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 161 normal subjects zzso female subjects and zzso aged zzso zzso After simultaneous administration of a cocktail of selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), zzso zzso for metabolism of these drugs were used as measures of individual zzso zzso Sex zzso analysis used the zzso zzso 

There were no sex differences associated with zzso zzso A significant negative correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso between zzso activity and age was observed for zzso but there were no sex zzso zzso activity showed no dependence on age or zzso In contrast, zzso activity showed an zzso increase zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso which developed earlier in life in male subjects compared with female zzso These results were further supported by the sex zzso analysis of zzso zzso activity, which revealed that sexes were equivalent with respect to zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and just exceeded the zzso to zzso limits to be equivalent with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that the presence of selective mechanisms of regulation for individual zzso zzso can be influenced by age and zzso However, we suggest that sex has a limited ability to explain zzso variation of activity for these zzso measures of zzso zzso zzso
