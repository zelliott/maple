zzso heart rate turbulence zzso has been documented as a strong predictor of total mortality and sudden death in zzso patients, but data in patients with zzso heart failure zzso are zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso significance of zzso for predicting mortality in zzso patients in New York Heart Association zzso class zzso 

In 651 zzso patients with zzso rhythm enrolled into the MUSIC zzso zzso en zzso zzso study, the standard zzso parameters turbulence onset zzso and slope zzso as well as zzso categories, were assessed for predicting total mortality and sudden zzso 

zzso was zzso in 607 patients, mean age 63 years zzso zzso 50% of zzso zzso During a median follow up of 44 months, 129 patients died, 52 from sudden zzso zzso zzso and zzso category 2 zzso were independently associated with increased zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso respectively), sudden death zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso for zzso and death due to heart failure progression zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso for zzso after adjustment for clinical zzso in zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso for predicting total mortality was similar in various groups zzso by age, zzso zzso class, left zzso ejection zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso for total mortality only in patients with zzso zzso 120 zzso 

zzso is a potent risk predictor for both heart failure and zzso death in patients with class II and III zzso
