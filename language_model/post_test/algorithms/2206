The zzso technique is the standard used by zzso to assess zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, this technique exposes patients to radiation, preventing zzso from taking frequent zzso to assess growth and to monitor zzso Recently, the Dolphin Imaging Company developed the zzso a zzso zzso method that uses sound waves and mathematical zzso and consequently does not expose patients to zzso But the zzso accuracy as a zzso alternative has not been adequately zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the values obtained by traditional zzso with those obtained by the zzso technique for 30 well-known zzso and then to assess the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for both zzso zzso of the 30 zzso had mean differences that were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso plots generally illustrate low correlations for the zzso although zzso zzso line zzso and lower zzso and Steiner's zzso zzso reveal strong linear relationships between the two zzso Additionally, the zzso generated zzso showed greater zzso and zzso
