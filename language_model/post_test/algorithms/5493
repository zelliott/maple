zzso liver zzso have a distinct tumor biology and zzso that render their management zzso This difficulty is reflected in the literature, which lacks consensus on a treatment zzso The aim of this study is to propose a treatment zzso based on patient morbidity and the efficacy of different treatment zzso 

The medical records of zzso patients with neuroendocrine liver zzso were zzso As zzso treatment, 69 of these patients underwent zzso zzso zzso 29 patients were treated by liver zzso and 29 underwent zzso Clinical characteristics and surgical parameters were analyzed with the zzso test, and cumulative survival was analyzed with the zzso zzso All data are expressed as mean zzso standard error of the zzso 

Of the 3 treatment zzso zzso was the most commonly used initial treatment for patients with up to approximately 16 discrete zzso zzso was used to zzso large tumors of limited zzso zzso was the zzso treatment for more extensive disease not amenable to zzso or zzso zzso provided effective zzso while zzso patients a shorter duration of stay and lower complication zzso On zzso analysis, the size of dominant zzso zzso disease, zzso of primary zzso and treatment zzso affected zzso On zzso analysis, sex, the size of dominant zzso and zzso disease were independent zzso of zzso 

To our knowledge, this study is the largest report on a zzso approach to the treatment of neuroendocrine liver zzso yet published in the zzso Because of the patient selection criteria used in our study, a direct comparison of the treatment arms is not strictly zzso We used an initial treatment zzso based on the presentation of the zzso Because this disease has a zzso nature and accompanying elevated recurrence rate, careful follow-up of patients and subsequent treatments are often needed to minimize disease zzso
