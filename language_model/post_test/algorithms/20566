zzso size in mice was studied using a model including zzso rate, potential embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso results were compared with experimental results from a selection experiment with zzso The four criteria of selection were selection on number born zzso selection on an index of zzso rate and zzso success zzso selection on number born to unilaterally zzso females zzso and zzso control zzso Comparisons were made to statistics of the base generation and to responses after 13 generations of zzso zzso and genetic statistics for zzso capacity were generated so that simulations produced the experimental means, standard zzso and correlations between left and right litter size, as well as responses in number born using the zzso IX, and zzso zzso Statistics for the simulated data generally agreed with observed zzso zzso zzso in the base generation for zzso capacity was zzso Experimental and simulated responses per generation in litter size through 13 generations of selection were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso IX, and zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso capacity after 13 generations were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso IX, and zzso zzso zzso means for the base generation were zzso and zzso for zzso rate and zzso capacity, zzso zzso capacity was an important component of the zzso in litter size; however, zzso rate was the more limiting zzso
