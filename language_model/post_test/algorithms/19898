We present a zzso approach to zzso suspicious zzso in digital zzso based on a novel maximum likelihood active zzso model using level sets zzso The zzso estimates the zzso zzso that best separates the zzso from the background using the zzso distribution to model the intensity of both regions zzso and zzso The zzso distribution parameters are estimated by the zzso We evaluate the performance of zzso on real zzso zzso Our results are compared to those of two leading related zzso The zzso level zzso zzso method zzso and the zzso zzso using level sets zzso approach, and show higher zzso accuracy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, our results are zzso compared with those of the Active zzso Without Edge zzso and show a better zzso Further, the suitability of using zzso as the objective function as opposed to the zzso divergence and to the energy functional of the zzso is also zzso Our zzso is also shown to be robust to the selection of a required single seed zzso
