In order to predict zzso zzso many zzso features, extracted from the zzso signals, have been zzso Before checking out the performance of features in detection of zzso state, it is required to see whether these features are accurately zzso zzso of feature zzso methods has been less considered, mainly due to the lack of a ground truth for the real zzso zzso zzso In this paper, some simulated long-term zzso signals, with known state spaces, are generated via a realistic neural mass model with zzso zzso Thanks to the known ground truth of these synthetic signals, they are suitable for evaluating different zzso used to extract the zzso It is shown that conventional methods of zzso correlation dimension, the largest zzso zzso and phase zzso have zzso zzso Then, a zzso zzso method is introduced for zzso the features, which leads to better zzso results for synthetic zzso It is shown that the neural mass model is able to reproduce real zzso signals zzso thus, assuming this model underlying real zzso signals, can improve the accuracy of zzso zzso
