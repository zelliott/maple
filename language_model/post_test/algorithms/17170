zzso properties of single zzso zzso were studied via zzso zzso inserted zzso into zzso zzso of the zzso nerve in awake zzso zzso was induced by radiant heat and measured by changes in skin electrical resistance within the zzso territory on the zzso of the zzso Eight units were classified as zzso zzso because zzso averaging revealed a zzso relationship between the zzso discharge and the subsequent decrease in skin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso but no relationship to skin blood flow zzso by a zzso zzso zzso units usually fired only one zzso zzso zzso in a sympathetic zzso The mean firing rate was zzso zzso but instantaneous zzso above 50 zzso could be zzso zzso triggered zzso and zzso analysis revealed significant zzso between the firing of three zzso zzso and the zzso Moreover, the firing of four zzso zzso showed a weak but significant correlation with the spontaneous fluctuations in cardiac zzso zzso pressure, or the rate of fall in zzso zzso We conclude that the discharge of human zzso zzso is modulated by zzso zzso
