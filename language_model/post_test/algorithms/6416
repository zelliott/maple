Based on how zzso pair at zzso the nature of zzso can be described by zzso zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso In zzso zzso only two zzso pair, during which two more similar zzso have a higher pairing probability zzso zzso than two less similar zzso whereas in zzso zzso more than two zzso pair at a time, which results in double zzso zzso zzso pairings and double reduction affect the zzso of zzso formation and, therefore, linkage analysis of zzso markers in zzso and zzso zzso zzso For mixed zzso in which both zzso and zzso zzso occur zzso linkage analysis is affected by both preferential pairings and double zzso In this study, we develop a zzso maximum likelihood model for discerning zzso zzso derived from different pairing mechanisms and different formation zzso The zzso model in the hierarchy is formulated to characterize the relative zzso of zzso and zzso pairing zzso in terms of the preferential pairing zzso The second-stage model is derived to rule out identical zzso zzso into their different formation modes with relative probabilities determined by the zzso zzso The zzso pairing mechanism and second-stage formation mode are integrated to provide the simultaneous maximum likelihood estimates of the preferential pairing factor, the frequency of double reduction, and the zzso zzso by implementing the zzso zzso We performed extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the statistical properties of our zzso model for linkage analysis in zzso The implications of our model for zzso linkage mapping are zzso
