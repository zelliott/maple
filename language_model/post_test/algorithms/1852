During zzso development the cerebral zzso rate zzso zzso with zzso and both often exhibit zzso zzso zzso Despite these zzso zzso it is found based on empirical data for different zzso that regional zzso rate per zzso is approximately zzso from birth to adulthood for a given species (with a slight zzso from this constancy for human visual and zzso zzso during zzso A typical zzso uses about zzso zzso molecules per second in zzso cerebral cortex, and about five times of that amount in cat and rat visual zzso A theoretical model for brain zzso expenditure is used to estimate synaptic signaling and neural zzso activity during zzso It is found that synaptic efficacy is generally zzso correlated with average firing rate, and, zzso zzso consume a bulk of zzso energy, roughly zzso during most of the zzso process (except human zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest a tight regulation of brain electrical and chemical activities during the formation and consolidation of neural zzso This presumably reflects strong energetic constraints on brain zzso
