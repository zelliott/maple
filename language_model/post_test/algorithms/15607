zzso of composite zzso materials to teeth usually involves surface zzso and drying of both zzso and zzso These two hard zzso have very different water zzso 

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of changes in humidity on the zzso changes in zzso disks constrained by zzso and in zzso zzso 

Changes in humidity were used to induce changes in the moisture level of the hard zzso which created a mechanical load across the zzso junction zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (with a sensitivity of zzso zzso were transferred to moist polished sections of human teeth, which were subsequently dehydrated and then hydrated zzso The fringe patterns from zzso zzso recorded the change in deformation between the moisture zzso 

The results indicated that there were wide variations in strain between the two zzso zzso The strains were fairly constant through the bulk of the zzso in both zzso zzso However, the strain zzso were very high across the zzso interface into the zzso in the zzso zzso and nearly zero in the constrained zzso 

zzso zzso is a powerful tool to study the deformation of materials that are not zzso and are not zzso zzso It provides zzso high-resolution deformation fields in tooth zzso zzso observed in this study indicate that the zzso zone is a unique material interface that needs to be better understood in terms of normal tooth function, and that its material properties be taken into account when natural hard zzso are zzso
