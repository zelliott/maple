To derive zzso recommendations in a zzso sound way, it is important to obtain and zzso all published information on the association between zzso intake and zzso proxies for zzso status using a systematic zzso zzso it is important to incorporate information from zzso controlled trials as well as zzso studies as both of these provide information on the zzso However, original research papers present their data in various zzso 

This paper presents a methodology to obtain an estimate of the zzso curve, assuming a zzso normal linear model on the zzso scale, incorporating a range of transformations of the original reported zzso 

The simulation study, conducted to validate the methodology, shows that there is no bias in the zzso Furthermore, it is shown that when the original studies report the mean and standard zzso or the geometric mean and confidence zzso the results are less variable compared to when the median with zzso or range is reported in the original zzso 

The presented methodology with transformations for various reported data provides a valid way to estimate the zzso curve for zzso intake and status using both zzso controlled trials and zzso zzso
