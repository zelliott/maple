The direct zzso zzso injection method was applied to a zzso liquid zzso study of zzso binding interactions in zzso The protein and the zzso complex are excluded on the basis of the size from the zzso support, and the free zzso zzso into the pores and is more zzso The pattern of the zzso zzso profile depends on the zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso zzso by developing a zzso simulation zzso in which the column is divided into slices of given zzso The column zzso zzso and shape of the injection signal are given as input zzso A global zzso zzso accounts for peak zzso A rapid equilibrium is assumed with the hypothesis that a zzso zzso interacts with a single binding site on the zzso The interaction of bovine serum zzso with zzso was zzso and an apparent zzso constant for the zzso complex was determined by fitting the theoretical profile to the experimental zzso The effect of the zzso content in the zzso was zzso An important decrease of the zzso constant is observed that affects the zzso zzso zzso
