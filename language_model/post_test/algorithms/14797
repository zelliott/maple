Image registration is a fundamental task used in image processing to match two or more images taken at different times, from different sensors or from different zzso The objective is to find in a huge search space of geometric zzso an acceptable accurate solution in a reasonable time to provide better registered zzso Exhaustive search is zzso expensive and the zzso cost increases zzso with the number of transformation parameters and the size of the data zzso In this work, we present an efficient image registration zzso that uses genetic zzso within a zzso framework based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso An adaptable genetic zzso for registration is adopted in order to minimize the search zzso This approach is used within a hybrid scheme applying the two techniques fitness sharing and zzso Two zzso based methods are proposed for zzso A comparative study is established between these methods and a zzso based zzso Because the zzso is a zzso zzso zzso the second method is adopted for its search speeding up zzso zzso results clearly show that both proposed techniques are really promising methods for image registration compared to the zzso approach, while the second technique has led to the best performance results of zzso Moreover, to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, these registration techniques have been successfully applied to register zzso zzso and zzso zzso Radar zzso zzso The zzso has been shown to work perfectly well for zzso satellite images as well, even in the presence of zzso
