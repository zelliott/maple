zzso evidence indicates that zzso asthma zzso with high serum zzso levels though the contribution of zzso specific zzso to the zzso and the severity of the disease is still zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso containing 103 zzso to study the zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso individuals belonging to families whose members have a documented history of asthma and zzso We employed zzso zzso to investigate whether a particular zzso zzso profile correlated with asthma and other zzso conditions such as zzso conjunctivitis and zzso 

Both zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that while the presence of specific zzso against individual zzso correlated poorly with pathological conditions, particular zzso profiles were significantly associated with asthma zzso An artificial neural network zzso algorithm, zzso with the profile zzso data, correctly classified as zzso or zzso zzso of the individual zzso zzso statistical analysis demonstrated that the familiar relationships of the study population did not affect the observed zzso 

These findings indicate that asthma is a zzso phenomenon related to patterns of zzso zzso rather than to single zzso zzso This notion sheds new light on the zzso of the disease and can be readily employed to distinguish zzso and zzso individuals on the basis of their serum zzso zzso
