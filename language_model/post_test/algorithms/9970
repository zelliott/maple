The aim of this paper is twofold: one is to give a detailed description of an alternative zzso analysis method, which we call zzso connectivity zzso for analyzing the global topography and the zzso properties of zzso zzso landscapes and the other is to give examples of applications of this method in the analysis of the zzso of realistic zzso A zzso shortest path zzso is proposed to extract zzso dominant transition pathways by zzso defining transition zzso The zzso of this approach is first confirmed by an illustrative example of a zzso random zzso We then show that a zzso procedure tailored for zzso connectivity zzso can be used to obtain the kinetic properties of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso method not only reduces the complexity of the zzso but also, with zzso use, reveals a zzso zzso structure in these zzso We also propose that the zzso is common to zzso zzso zzso
