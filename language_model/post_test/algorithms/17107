The three-dimensional solution structure of rat zzso fatty zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso has been determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure is based on zzso zzso restraints derived mostly from 3-D zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso The 3-D zzso data for this zzso zzso complex contained an average of nine possible interpretations per zzso To circumvent this zzso an zzso zzso procedure was employed to gradually interpret and introduce zzso distance restraints during subsequent rounds of structure zzso The first stage of this procedure relied critically upon an initial structural model based on the consensus zzso chemical zzso secondary structure and a set of zzso restraints derived from the 3-D zzso zzso zzso The structures were calculated using zzso a program that zzso a novel distance geometry zzso with zzso zzso zzso A central feature of this zzso is the use of an zzso zzso zzso distribution for the selection of trial zzso which overcomes the tendency of zzso to produce crushed zzso In addition, this zzso randomly selects zzso elements of the distance zzso which results in an improved sampling of zzso space for a given zzso zzso The final family of 20 distance zzso zzso structures exhibited an average zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso A, and their zzso quality, as assessed by zzso was comparable to that of zzso A X-ray crystal zzso The zzso structure was compared with the X-ray crystal structure of the same zzso complex and was found to be essentially identical within the precision of the zzso The zzso structure was also compared with that of the zzso complex with bovine heart zzso which shares zzso sequence identity with rat zzso The overall folds were the same, but differences were noted with respect to the presence or absence of apparent zzso zzso and the location and zzso of the bound fatty zzso
