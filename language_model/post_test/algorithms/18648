The spatial resolution of near infrared zzso imaging in brain function mapping studies needs to be zzso Most near infrared zzso imaging systems use optical fibers that are arranged like a zzso The light source and the detector have one-on-one correspondence at intervals of about 3 zzso In this study, we apply several detectors against one source to improve spatial zzso We assume that a local zzso within a strong scattering medium is a model for local cerebral zzso When we calculate zzso which is used to zzso calculate zzso zzso the peak position shifts away from above the position where an zzso is zzso As far as zzso is zzso we cannot obtain spatial information about the zzso even if many detectors are used against one zzso When we calculate the difference between detected light zzso however, we demonstrate that an zzso projected onto the measuring surface has an influence directly above zzso We predict this property from a light diffusion equation and also prove it zzso through zzso of a uniform zzso phantom with an zzso This is one of the basic principles supporting the achievement of higher spatial resolutions with near infrared zzso zzso
