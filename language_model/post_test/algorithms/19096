zzso pulmonary vein isolation zzso had been proved effective for treating zzso zzso zzso However, the achievement of pulmonary vein zzso isolation was sometimes zzso zzso could not be isolated until some key target sites zzso were zzso zzso The aim of our study was to explore the distribution of zzso 

Four hundred and zzso cases zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were enrolled for zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in all cases with one circular zzso for zzso of zzso zzso Target sites where zzso zzso delayed, zzso sequence changed, slowed down, or isolated were defined as zzso From zzso zzso procedures, zzso zzso were zzso zzso of which were located at left zzso zzso and zzso were at right zzso zzso zzso at left zzso zzso were most commonly situated at anterior wall zzso while zzso at right zzso zzso were most commonly situated at zzso wall zzso Additional gaps zzso was performed for left zzso in 344 cases and for right zzso in 248 cases zzso to incomplete zzso isolation by a single attempt of zzso One thousand one hundred and zzso zzso were identified, zzso of which were located at left zzso zzso and zzso were at right zzso zzso At the anterior wall, zzso of left zzso zzso were located, and zzso of right zzso zzso were located at the zzso zzso Out of zzso 961 zzso zzso were predicted correctly by circular zzso zzso isolation could not be achieved until some zzso were zzso by higher power, longer zzso and higher irrigation rate than zzso 

zzso during zzso were most commonly situated at the anterior wall of left zzso and at the zzso wall of right zzso zzso mapping within zzso zzso zzso could accurately predict the location of zzso Some zzso must be zzso thoroughly by applying higher power, longer zzso and higher irrigation rate than usual to achieve zzso zzso
