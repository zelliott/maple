A zzso history is an assignment of branches of a gene tree to branches of a species tree on which zzso in the gene tree zzso The number of zzso histories for a pair consisting of a labeled gene tree zzso and a labeled species tree zzso is important in gene tree probability zzso and more generally, in studying evolutionary possibilities for gene trees on species zzso Defining the zzso family as a sequence of zzso trees constructed by replacing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by a specific zzso labeled zzso zzso we examine the number of zzso histories for zzso families with matching gene tree and species tree labeled zzso For each zzso with size zzso we zzso the number of zzso histories for zzso trees in the zzso zzso Next, as zzso we find that the limiting ratio of the numbers of zzso histories for the zzso family and zzso themselves is correlated with the number of labeled histories for zzso The results support a view that large numbers of zzso histories occur when a tree has both a relatively balanced zzso and a high tree depth, contributing to deeper understanding of the zzso of gene trees and species zzso
