We describe a method to zzso zzso quantities in the harmonic approximation for identical zzso and zzso in an external zzso zzso We use the zzso partition function where only energies and their zzso zzso The number of states of given energy and symmetry is found by separating the zzso motion, and by counting the remaining states of given symmetry and zzso energy of the relative zzso The zzso zzso that enter the harmonic zzso can be derived from realistic model zzso and the method zzso to an effective interaction approach based on harmonic zzso To demonstrate the method, we apply it to systems in two zzso zzso calculations are compared to a zzso force method, which is considerably more zzso zzso
