The zzso of allergic zzso reactions zzso ranges from zzso to zzso of all zzso and they are difficult to zzso This study evaluated whether removing plasma from zzso zzso zzso or red blood cells zzso by concentrating or washing zzso products can decrease the zzso of zzso 

A retrospective cohort study of 179 individuals who received zzso and subsequently concentrated and/or washed zzso was zzso zzso zzso with generalized zzso equations was used to estimate the incident rate ratios and zzso confidence intervals zzso of zzso 

The zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when individuals received concentrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (21 zzso zzso zzso when individuals received washed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 39 individuals who received zzso zzso and subsequently washed zzso the zzso of zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The median number of zzso zzso to first zzso was six zzso range zzso zzso for zzso zzso and increased to 13 zzso zzso for concentrated zzso and 40 zzso zzso for washed zzso 

zzso zzso and washing zzso and zzso substantially reduces zzso suggesting that the plasma component of zzso and zzso has an essential role in the zzso of zzso
