In recent years the number of zzso and zzso plant zzso has increased significantly, and novel approaches are required to retrieve valuable information from these data zzso The field of systems biology has accelerated the simulation and prediction of zzso derived from specific zzso modifications under defined growth zzso The zzso potential of a cell from a specific plant tissue zzso seed zzso can be derived from its zzso in the form of a mathematical model by the method of zzso network zzso This model can be further analyzed by studying its network properties, analyzing feasible zzso routes through the network, or simulating possible flux zzso of the network zzso Here, we describe two approaches for identification of all feasible routes through the network zzso mode zzso and for simulation of flux distribution in the network based on plant zzso zzso and zzso rates zzso balance zzso
