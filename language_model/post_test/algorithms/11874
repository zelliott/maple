We studied the bias and zzso characteristics of the zzso expectation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso in zzso zzso under extreme, but zzso zzso 

We used the zzso zzso cardiac torso phantom to simulate 2 patient zzso a large male with a raised zzso and a female with large breast size, zzso extreme cases of zzso conditions found in the zzso For each zzso realistic zzso projection data were simulated for a 180 degrees acquisition zzso Three cases of zzso for a 90 zzso dual detector system were zzso no zzso moderate zzso and extreme zzso For each case, an ensemble of 250 noise simulations was generated, and each noisy zzso was reconstructed with the zzso and zzso zzso The reconstructions modeled only the effects of zzso zzso and used a range of subset zzso Over the ensemble, we zzso means and zzso of activity in 8 regions of interest zzso in the heart as a function of zzso 

Under conditions of no zzso and moderate zzso the results from zzso and zzso were very close to those from zzso zzso zzso in all cases, the difference in zzso means was zzso For extreme zzso the errors increased to as much as zzso with zzso but these were no greater than the errors for zzso under the same zzso The zzso zzso with 2 views per subset was found to result in much higher zzso of zzso estimates for the same bias as compared with zzso or zzso with 4 or more views per zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso are at least as robust to highly attenuating patients and zzso as zzso zzso and can be adequate zzso for zzso even in extreme zzso Clinical users should apply the smallest number of zzso that can be zzso by allowable processing time to reduce image noise and zzso in quantitative zzso
