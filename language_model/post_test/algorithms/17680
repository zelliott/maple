The roles of six zzso acid zzso downward from an zzso zzso bond involving zzso in rat zzso zzso were zzso When zzso or zzso was replaced with zzso the responsiveness to zzso was zzso When zzso was replaced with other zzso zzso zzso the responsiveness to zzso was reduced or zzso When zzso was replaced with zzso or zzso the responsiveness to zzso was zzso The responsiveness to zzso was moderately decreased with the zzso for zzso and it was markedly decreased with the zzso for zzso As for the zzso for zzso the sensitivity was changed, but the zzso response to zzso was not zzso The results suggested that a precise structure is required for zzso acid zzso close to the zzso bond and, in general, the zzso acid zzso at odd number positions and those closer to the zzso bond are more influential to the zzso zzso
