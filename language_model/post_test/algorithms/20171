The exquisite human ability to perceive facial features has been explained by the activity of zzso particularly responsive to faces, found in the zzso zzso and the anterior part of the superior zzso zzso This study zzso and demonstrates that it is possible to automatically discriminate face processing from processing of a simple control stimulus based on processed zzso in an online fashion with high zzso resolution using measures of statistical dependence applied on zzso visual evoked zzso zzso mutual information, and a novel measure of association, referred to as generalized measure of association zzso were applied on filtered current source density zzso zzso between channel locations were assessed for two separate conditions zzso by distinct pictures (a face and a zzso zzso zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso settings were chosen to minimize the distortion produced by zzso parameters on dependence zzso zzso analysis was performed for automated stimulus zzso using the zzso zzso zzso show active regions in the zzso part of the brain for both conditions with a greater dependence between zzso and zzso sites for the face zzso zzso achieved a higher performance in discriminating the two zzso Because no additional zzso stimuli were zzso this study established a basic difference between one particular face and one zzso zzso Future work may use additional stimuli and experimental zzso to determine the specificity of the current connectivity zzso
