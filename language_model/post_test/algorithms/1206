The analysis of variations is an important area of interest in health services and outcomes research and has two main zzso to identify and zzso zzso across units, such as geographic regions or health care providers, in terms of procedure zzso and zzso and to explore the links between process, such as regional or hospital practice patterns, and zzso such as patient mortality and functional zzso zzso zzso models are well suited for this type of zzso In this paper we formulate a zzso zzso zzso model and apply it to the analysis of variations in the zzso of alternative cardiac procedures in a national cohort of elderly Medicare patients who had an acute zzso zzso during zzso The model is designed to accommodate clustered zzso data with zzso zzso available on individual cases and on zzso We present a zzso approach to fitting and checking the model using simulated values from the zzso distribution of the zzso The simulation zzso are based on Gibbs sampling in combination with zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso model, we examine how the rates of cardiac procedures depend on zzso zzso including age, gender and race, and whether there exist interstate differences and regional patterns in the use of these zzso
