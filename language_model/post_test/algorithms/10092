This work investigates the complex relationships between cerebrovascular zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso response, and short-term systemic regulation via an original mathematical zzso The model has been used to analyze the effects of zzso response on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular quantities during constant zzso zzso and during the occurrence of zzso plateau waves and to investigate the conditions leading to system instability with the formation of slow zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso The model may be of value to assist clinicians in finding the balance between clinical benefits of zzso response and its zzso
