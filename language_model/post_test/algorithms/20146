Although zzso is the only clinically accepted imaging zzso for screening the general population to detect breast cancer, interpreting zzso is difficult with lower sensitivity and zzso To provide zzso zzso visual zzso in interpreting zzso we developed and tested an interactive system for zzso detection and diagnosis zzso of zzso zzso Using this system, an observer can view zzso mass regions depicted on one image and then query any suspicious regions zzso cued or not cued by zzso zzso scheme automatically segments the suspicious region or accepts manually defined region and zzso a set of image zzso Using zzso image retrieval zzso algorithm, zzso searches for a set of reference images depicting zzso similar to the zzso zzso Based on image retrieval results and a decision algorithm, a zzso score is assigned to the zzso zzso In this study, a reference database with 1,800 zzso mass regions and 1,800 benign and zzso zzso regions was zzso A modified zzso zzso with a new function of stretching the attributes in the zzso space and decision scheme was zzso using a genetic zzso Using a zzso testing method to zzso suspicious mass regions, we compared the zzso performance using two zzso zzso with either equally weighted or zzso stretched zzso Using the modified zzso algorithm, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly increased from zzso to zzso zzso This study demonstrated the feasibility of developing an interactive zzso system with a large reference database and achieving improved zzso
