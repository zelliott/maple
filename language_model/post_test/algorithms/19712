Whereas much is known about the visual shape selectivity of zzso in the inferior zzso zzso zzso less is known about the role of visual learning in the development and refinement of zzso shape zzso To address this, we trained monkeys to perform a visual categorization task with a zzso set of highly familiar zzso During training, the stimuli were always presented at the same zzso In this experiment, we recorded from zzso zzso while monkeys viewed the trained stimuli in addition to zzso rotated versions of those zzso We found that, zzso with the zzso behavioral performance, zzso stimulus selectivity was stronger for stimuli presented at the trained orientation than for rotated versions of the same zzso We also recorded from zzso zzso while monkeys viewed sets of novel and familiar (but not explicitly zzso randomly chosen complex zzso We again found that zzso stimulus selectivity was sharper for familiar than novel zzso suggesting that enhanced shape tuning in zzso can arise for both passively experienced and explicitly trained zzso
