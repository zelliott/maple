To compare the safety and efficacy of continuous insulin infusion zzso via a zzso and a standard paper form protocol in a medical intensive care unit zzso 

zzso zzso trial of 153 zzso patients zzso to zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso or a standard paper protocol zzso zzso zzso Both protocols used zzso insulin and targeted blood zzso zzso between 80 zzso and 120 zzso 

The zzso resulted in a lower mean zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 117 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in a shorter time to reach zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso hours zzso zzso hours, P zzso zzso and once at target resulted in a higher percentage of zzso readings within target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than the standard zzso Mean insulin infusion rate in the zzso was similar to the standard protocol zzso zzso zzso The percentages of patients with zzso episode of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso and zzso in the standard, respectively zzso zzso not significant zzso zzso measures analyses show that the probabilities of zzso reading zzso zzso or zzso zzso were not significantly different between groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after accounting for zzso correlations with or without adjusting for time zzso There were no differences between groups in the length of hospital stay zzso zzso zzso zzso stay zzso zzso zzso or zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso 

Both treatment zzso resulted in significant improvement in zzso control in critically ill patients in the medical zzso The computer-based zzso resulted in tighter zzso control without an increased risk of zzso events compared to the standard paper zzso
