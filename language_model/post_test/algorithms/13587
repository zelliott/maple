Comprehensive land-use planning zzso at the county level in China must include land-use zzso This is specifically stipulated by the China Land Management Law and aims to achieve strict control on the zzso of zzso The land-use zoning problem is treated as a zzso zzso problem zzso in this article, which is different from the traditional zzso A particle swarm zzso zzso based model is applied to the problem and is developed to maximize the attribute differences between land-use zones, the spatial zzso the degree of spatial harmony and the ecological benefits of the land-use zzso This is subject to some constraints such zzso the quantity limitations for varying land-use zones, regulations assigning land units to a certain land-use zone, and the stipulation of a minimum parcel area in a land-use zoning zzso In addition, a crossover and zzso operator from a genetic zzso is adopted to avoid the zzso of zzso The results obtained for zzso a county in central China, using different objective weighting schemes, are compared and suggest that: zzso the fundamental demand for attribute difference between land-use zones leads to a mass of zzso land-use zzso zzso the spatial pattern of land-use zones is remarkably zzso when a weight is given to the zzso of spatial zzso and the degree of spatial zzso zzso with a reduction of attribute difference between land-use zzso zzso when a weight is given to the zzso of ecological benefits of the land-use zones, the ecological benefits get a slight increase also at the expense of a reduction in attribute difference between land-use zzso zzso the pursuit of spatial harmony or spatial zzso may have a negative effect on each zzso zzso an increase in the ecological benefits may improve the spatial zzso and spatial harmony of the land-use zzso zzso adjusting the weights assigned to each zzso can generate a corresponding optimal solution, with a different quantity structure and spatial pattern to satisfy the preference of the different decision zzso zzso the model proposed in this paper is capable of handling the land-use zoning problem, and the crossover and zzso operator can improve the performance of the model, but, zzso leads to increased time zzso
