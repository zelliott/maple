In zzso zzso Monitoring zzso there is a high demand for short zzso zzso zzso Testing zzso is a promising method for efficient zzso In this article, the efficiency of a zzso version of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso - zzso Depression scale zzso for use in zzso was scrutinized in a simulation zzso 

The responses of a large sample of patients (N zzso zzso obtained through zzso were zzso The zzso evaluation showed that the items met the requirements for zzso In the simulations, zzso with several measurement precision requirements were run on the item responses as if they had been collected zzso 

zzso employing only a small number of items gave results which, both in terms of depression measurement and criterion zzso were only marginally different from the results of a full zzso zzso 

It was concluded that zzso improved the efficiency of the zzso questionnaire very zzso The strengths and limitations of the application of zzso in zzso are zzso
