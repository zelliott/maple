We discuss a modification to random zzso theory zzso zzso statistics that systematically takes into account the zzso zzso behavior of chaotic zzso The method avoids zzso of the zzso instead requiring only knowledge of zzso dynamics for a chaotic system or ensemble of similar zzso Standard zzso and zzso predictions are recovered in the limits of zero zzso time and infinite zzso time, zzso As examples, we discuss zzso zzso and cross correlations and show how the approach leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy for simple chaotic systems where comparison can be made with zzso zzso
