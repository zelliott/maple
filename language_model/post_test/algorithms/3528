Diagnosis of zzso systems zzso is a challenging problem that has been tackled both by automatic control and artificial intelligence zzso The relevant approaches share similarities, including modeling by zzso compositional zzso and zzso zzso This paper aims to bridge two complementary approaches from these communities, zzso the zzso approach and the active system approach, zzso The more significant shortcomings of such approaches are, on the one side, the need for the generation of the global system model and, on the other, the lack of monitoring zzso The former makes the application of the zzso approach prohibitive in real zzso where the system model is too large to be generated, even zzso The latter requires the completion of the system observation before starting the diagnostic task, zzso making the monitoring of the zzso zzso The bridged diagnostic method zzso to a large extent on the peculiarities of the two approaches and is capable of coping with an extended class of zzso that integrate both zzso and zzso zzso The bridge is built by extending the active system approach by means of several enhanced techniques, which eventually, allow the efficient monitoring of zzso zzso Upon the occurrence of each system message, two pieces of diagnostic information are generated, zzso the snapshot and historic diagnostic zzso While the former accounts for the faults pertinent to the newly generated message only, the latter is based on the whole sequence of messages yielded by the system during zzso
