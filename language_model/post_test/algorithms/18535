zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a software package developed for the zzso part of a zzso project where the sequence is obtained by a shotgun zzso zzso contains new tools to predict links between zzso by using similarity searches with other whole zzso zzso Most importantly, it allows zzso of a zzso to zzso during the finishing phase using a zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso creates an Individual zzso file zzso for each zzso of an zzso The zzso sequence reported in an zzso zzso to the sequence of the zzso with 500 additional bases before the zzso and 200 bases zzso For zzso additional information like zzso results can be added or linked to the zzso as well as automatic and/or manual zzso When a new assembly is performed, zzso creates new zzso according to the old zzso zzso zzso recognizes the modified zzso which are the only ones used for a new automatic analysis after each zzso Using this strategy, the user works with a group of zzso independently of the closure phase zzso The zzso are accessible by a web server and can therefore be modified and commented by different zzso 

zzso was used to obtain and to zzso several complete zzso like zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

The program may be obtained from the authors and is freely available to zzso zzso
