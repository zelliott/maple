For men, the mean percentage energy from fat estimates for the different methods were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For women, the results were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations between true intake and screener were zzso and zzso for men and women, respectively, and between true intake and zzso were zzso for men and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for the screener were zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The percentage energy from fat zzso when used in conjunction with external reference data, may be useful to compare mean zzso of fat for different population subgroups, and to examine relationships between fat intake and other zzso
