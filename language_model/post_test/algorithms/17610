A study has been made of the effect of sodium zzso zzso zzso at several zzso from zzso to zzso zzso on skin zzso Seven model drugs were selected for this study on the basis of their zzso as represented by their zzso values (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso with zzso solutions of zzso does not increase the zzso zzso of the most zzso compounds zzso or zzso For the other compounds zzso the increase in the zzso zzso depends on the concentration of zzso used in the skin zzso and on the zzso of the compounds zzso correlation between the inverse of zzso efficacy as an zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the model zzso was established via a zzso zzso This model makes it possible to predict the zzso zzso enhancing effect of zzso expected for a compound of specific zzso according to the concentration used in skin zzso An excellent accuracy zzso for the linear relationship between the experimental zzso and theoretical zzso values predicted by the equation was zzso The model proposed was also useful for experimental data obtained previously using zzso and compounds with the same range of zzso
