Medical image zzso techniques typically require some form of expert human supervision to provide accurate and consistent identification of zzso structures of zzso A novel zzso technique was developed that combines a zzso zzso system with a sophisticated active zzso zzso This approach exploits the guidance of a zzso process to robustly perform the zzso of various zzso zzso The user need not provide initial zzso placement, and the high-level process carries out the required zzso zzso zzso zzso about the zzso structures to be segmented is defined statistically in terms of probability density functions of parameters such as location, size, and image intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results suggest that the performance of the zzso at chest and abdominal CT is comparable to that of more traditional zzso techniques like region growing and zzso zzso In some cases, the active zzso technique may outperform standard zzso methods due to its capacity to fully enforce the available a zzso knowledge concerning the zzso structure of zzso The active zzso zzso is particularly suitable for integration with high-level image understanding zzso providing a robust and easily controlled low-level zzso zzso Further study is required to determine whether the proposed zzso is indeed capable of providing consistently superior zzso
