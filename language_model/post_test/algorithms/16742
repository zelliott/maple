The zzso even color of human skin is maintained by the uniform distribution of zzso among zzso in the zzso layer of the human zzso In this work, we investigated three possible hypotheses on the mechanism by which the zzso and zzso organize themselves to generate this zzso We let the zzso migration be aided by zzso negative zzso due to a substance produced by the zzso themselves, or zzso positive zzso due to a substance produced by zzso lacking direct physical contact with a zzso or zzso positive zzso due to a substance produced by zzso in a zzso dependent zzso The three hypotheses were implemented in an zzso zzso model of cellular interactions in the zzso layer of the human zzso We found that they generate mutually exclusive predictions that can be tested by existing experimental zzso This model forms a basis for further understanding of the communication between zzso and other skin cells in skin zzso
