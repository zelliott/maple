Novel techniques for acquiring zzso data continue to zzso Such data require proper storage in suitably configured databases, which then permit one to establish the size of microbial zzso zzso of major zzso and allow the nature, zzso and control of zzso networks to be zzso A variety of zzso for zzso network reconstruction coupled to suitable zzso zzso are the ground substances for the development of zzso network and systems zzso Even qualitative models of zzso networks, when subject to zzso constraints, can prove highly zzso and are the first step to the quantitative models, which alone can allow the true representation of complex zzso zzso
