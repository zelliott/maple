This paper presents a review of the current literature on zzso and zzso approaches to solving various problems in medical imaging such as medical image zzso object zzso and image zzso zzso set zzso zzso with other zzso intelligence technologies that include neural networks, particle swarm zzso support zzso machines, and fuzzy sets are also zzso In addition, a brief introduction to near sets and near images with an application to zzso images is zzso Near sets offer a zzso of traditional rough set theory and a promising approach to solving the medical image correspondence problem as well as an approach to zzso zzso objects by means of features in solving medical imaging zzso Other zzso of rough sets such as neighborhood systems, zzso sets, and tolerance spaces are also briefly considered in solving a variety of medical imaging zzso Challenges to be addressed and future directions of research are identified and an extensive bibliography is also zzso
