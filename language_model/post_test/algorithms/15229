By capturing various zzso zzso biological pathways provide insight into underlying biological zzso Given zzso zzso or zzso data, a critical challenge is how to integrate them with rich information from zzso databases to jointly select relevant pathways and genes for zzso prediction or disease zzso Addressing this challenge can help us deepen biological understanding of zzso and diseases from a systems zzso 

In this article, we propose a novel sparse zzso model for joint network and zzso zzso This model zzso information from networks zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by a hybrid of conditional and zzso zzso For the conditional zzso we propose a sparse prior based on graph zzso zzso each of which encodes detailed correlation structures between network zzso For the zzso zzso we use a spike and slab prior over network zzso The integration of these two zzso coupled with efficient zzso zzso enables the selection of networks as well as correlated network zzso in the selected zzso zzso results demonstrate improved zzso performance and selection accuracy of our method over alternative zzso Based on three expression zzso for cancer study and the zzso zzso database, we selected relevant genes and zzso many of which are supported by biological zzso In addition to zzso analysis, our method is expected to have a wide range of applications in selecting relevant groups of correlated zzso zzso
