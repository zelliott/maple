zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of left zzso block zzso is challenging due to ST zzso from the altered zzso The purpose of this study was to introduce a new zzso for zzso detection in zzso and compare the performance to three existing zzso 

zzso data of the study group zzso with acute zzso and 239 zzso comes from multiple zzso zzso were selected by computer interpretation of zzso Acute zzso reference was hospital discharge zzso zzso zzso came from the Philips zzso zzso Three existing zzso were zzso zzso zzso criteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso criteria and zzso Smith zzso zzso zzso The new zzso uses an ST threshold based on zzso zzso All zzso share the zzso ST zzso and anterior ST depression criteria from the zzso zzso The difference is in the threshold for zzso ST zzso The zzso zzso Smith and Philips zzso ST zzso criteria are zzso ST zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso ST zzso zzso zzso of zzso plus zzso limits, zzso ST zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso ST zzso zzso 100 zzso + zzso zzso * zzso zzso The Smith zzso and Philips zzso area criteria were tested using both a single and 2 lead zzso Algorithm performance was measured by sensitivity, zzso and positive likelihood ratio zzso 

Algorithm performance can be organized in bands of similar sensitivity and specificity ranging from zzso score zzso 3 with the lowest sensitivity and highest zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso rule with the highest sensitivity and lower specificity of zzso and zzso The Smith zzso and Philips zzso area zzso were in the middle band with sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

As can be seen from the difference between zzso score zzso 3 and other zzso for zzso in zzso a zzso ST zzso criterion improves the sensitivity for detection but also results in a drop in zzso For applications of automated zzso detection that require higher sensitivity, the zzso zzso is zzso For applications that require a low false positive rate such as relying on the zzso for zzso zzso of cardiac zzso laboratory for urgent zzso it may be better to use the 2 lead Philips zzso area or Smith zzso zzso zzso
