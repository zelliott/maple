zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has evolved into one of the major zzso tools to study the healthy and diseased mouse zzso This study presents a Cartesian zzso zzso protocol based on a fast zzso shot sequence with a zzso echo to generate cardiac triggering and respiratory gating signals zzso making the use of zzso leads and respiratory motion sensors zzso zzso of the in zzso mouse heart using this sequence resulted in zzso images with no zzso cardiac and respiratory motion zzso The retrospective method allows for zzso imaging of the mouse heart, which is essential for quantitative zzso zzso zzso A comparison was made between prospective and retrospective methods in terms of the zzso ratio and the zzso ratio between blood and zzso wall, as well as global cardiac functional zzso zzso volume, zzso volume, stroke volume and ejection zzso The retrospective method resulted in almost constant zzso wall signal intensity throughout the cardiac cycle, at the expense of a decrease in the zzso ratio and the zzso ratio between blood and zzso wall as compared with the prospective zzso Prospective and retrospective sequences yielded comparable global cardiac functional zzso The largest mean relative difference found was zzso for the zzso zzso
