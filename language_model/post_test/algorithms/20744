Adjustment for zzso is an important component of any clinical outcome study using administrative zzso The zzso Index is a relatively newer zzso index for use with administrative data and has not been used to assess prognosis in patients with zzso Similarly, an International zzso of Diseases zzso coding zzso has been rarely reported for zzso zzso 

To evaluate whether the zzso Index provides a useful zzso adjustment for predicting zzso zzso in stroke outcome studies and to compare the degree of consistency using zzso and zzso coding zzso 

Patients who had stroke from 1998 to 2000 zzso A in the zzso zzso and 2003 to 2005 zzso B in the zzso zzso in a large Canadian city were identified from the Hospital Discharge zzso The performance of two coding zzso for predicting the zzso zzso was assessed using multivariable zzso zzso zzso The zzso was used to compare the performance of each coding zzso in predicting zzso zzso 

Among zzso patients with stroke in the zzso data zzso zzso and zzso patients with stroke in the zzso data zzso B), there was no difference in model performance using zzso zzso was zzso as compared with zzso coding zzso zzso was zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso adjustment provided a better prediction of zzso zzso compared to reduced models including only age and gender zzso zzso zzso for both coding zzso 

The zzso Index provides similar zzso adjusted risk estimates using both zzso and zzso and may be useful for predicting zzso zzso zzso in stroke outcome zzso
