In this paper, a novel framework for visual tracking of human body parts is zzso The approach presented demonstrates the feasibility of recovering human poses with data from a single zzso camera by using a zzso system based on a zzso articulated model and a zzso zzso Its key contribution is that the zzso model is only constrained by zzso knowledge about human bipedal motion, instead of relying on constraints that are linked to a specific activity or camera zzso These characteristics make our approach suitable for real visual surveillance zzso zzso on a set of indoor and outdoor sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on tracking human lower body zzso Moreover, a detail comparison with current tracking methods is zzso
