The zzso of Continuous Point zzso with zzso zzso Search zzso strategy exhibits its efficiency in solving zzso point location zzso zzso However, there is one bottleneck for this zzso strategy which is that, when the dimension of the feature, or the number of divided zzso for each zzso d is large, the decision table for elimination process is almost zzso On the other hand, the larger dimension of the features d can generally make this zzso strategy avoid zzso and zzso zzso This paper presents a generalized universal decision formula to solve this bottleneck zzso As a matter of fact, this decision formula has a wider usage beyond handling out this zzso problems, such as dealing with deterministic point location problems and searching data in Single zzso zzso Data Stream based on zzso Read and Exclusive zzso parallel computer zzso Meanwhile, we generalized the zzso strategy with an extending formula, which is capable of tracking an unknown dynamic zzso zzso in both zzso and deceptive zzso Furthermore, we employed different learning zzso in the generalized zzso method to find out if faster learning zzso will lead to better realization of the generalized zzso zzso All of these aforementioned contributions are vitally important whether in theory or in practical zzso Finally, extensive experiments show that our proposed approaches are efficient and zzso
