The surface zzso lining the zzso tract renews itself rapidly by a coordinated zzso of cell zzso migration and differentiation events that is initiated in the zzso of zzso It is generally believed that zzso cancer arises due to zzso that disrupt the normal cellular dynamics of the zzso Using a zzso structured zzso model of a zzso zzso we investigate the likelihood that the progeny of a zzso cell will dominate, or be zzso out of, a zzso Our approach is to perform multiple simulations, varying the spatial location of the initial zzso and the zzso and adhesive properties of the zzso cells, to obtain statistical zzso for the probability of their zzso Our simulations lead us to make a number of zzso The process of zzso conversion always occurs, and does not require that the cell which initially gave rise to the population remains in the zzso zzso occurring more than one to two cells from the base of the zzso are unlikely to become the dominant zzso The probability of a zzso clone zzso in the zzso is sensitive to zzso of zzso By comparing simulation results with those from a simple one-dimensional zzso model of population dynamics at the base of the zzso we zzso that this sensitivity is due to direct competition between zzso and zzso cells at the base of the zzso We also predict that increases in the extent of the spatial domain in which the zzso cells zzso can give rise to zzso zzso changes to the probability of their zzso due to effects that cannot be captured in simpler zzso
