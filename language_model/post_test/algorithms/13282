Previous studies on tumor zzso based on gene expression profiles suggest that gene selection plays a key role in improving the zzso zzso Moreover, finding important zzso genes with the highest accuracy is a very important task because these genes might serve as tumor zzso which is of great benefit to not only tumor molecular diagnosis but also drug zzso 

This paper proposes a novel gene selection method with rich biomedical meaning based on zzso zzso Search Algorithm zzso to find as many optimal gene zzso as zzso Due to the curse of zzso this type of method could suffer from zzso and selection bias zzso To address these potential problems, a zzso ensemble zzso is constructed using majority voting strategy from individual zzso constructed by the selected gene subsets, and a novel zzso gene ranking method is designed to find important zzso genes by measuring the significance of genes using their occurrence zzso in the selected gene zzso The experimental results on nine tumor zzso including three pairs of zzso zzso indicate that the proposed method can not only obtain better zzso performance but also find many important zzso zzso 

It is found that the zzso of the selected genes follow a zzso distribution, indicating that only a few top-ranked genes can be used as potential diagnosis zzso Moreover, the top-ranked genes leading to very high prediction accuracy are closely related to specific tumor zzso and even hub zzso Compared with other related methods, the proposed method can achieve higher prediction accuracy with fewer zzso Moreover, they are further justified by analyzing the top-ranked genes in the context of individual gene function, biological pathway, and zzso interaction zzso
