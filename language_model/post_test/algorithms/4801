We report zzso studies of the zzso and zzso of an active liquid zzso We confirm the existence of a transition between a passive and an active phase, with spontaneous flow in steady zzso We explore how the zzso profile changes with activity, and we point out the difference in behavior for zzso and tumbling zzso We find that an active material can thicken or thin under a flow, or even exhibit both behaviors as the forcing zzso
