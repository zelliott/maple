zzso zzso were developed to predict zzso mortality in cardiac zzso This study was designed to evaluate the reliability of zzso zzso and to analyze the predicting role of the scoring system's factors on patients that undergo isolate zzso 339 patients underwent zzso valve zzso Data collection was prospective and the zzso and additive zzso zzso were calculated according to published zzso The zzso mortality ratio was zzso In the zzso curve analysis, the zzso significance was greater than zzso On zzso analysis, only critical zzso state remained significant independent predictor of zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These outcomes suggest that zzso models may fail in predicting hospital mortality in zzso of cardiac surgery patients and dedicated risk models for isolate zzso zzso surgery may be useful to provide more precise estimates of hospital zzso
