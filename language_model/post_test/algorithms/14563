We have proposed a parallel simulated zzso using genetic crossover as one of powerful zzso search methods, in order to find the global minimum energy structures for protein zzso The simulated zzso using genetic crossover method, which incorporates the attractive features of the simulated zzso and the genetic algorithm, is useful for finding a minimum potential energy zzso of protein zzso However, when we perform simulations by using this method, we often find obviously zzso stable zzso which have zzso of a string of an zzso zzso zzso we combined knot theory with our simulated zzso using genetic crossover method in order to avoid the knot zzso from the zzso search zzso We applied this improved method to protein G, which has 56 zzso zzso As the result, we could perform the simulations, which avoid knot zzso
