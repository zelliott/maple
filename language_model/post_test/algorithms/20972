zzso is a neurological disorder caused by intense electrical activity in the zzso The electrical activity, which can be zzso through the zzso of several electrical zzso can be determined in a zzso way by zzso the zzso This source zzso requires the solution of an inverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be trapped in local solutions and when using global zzso techniques, the zzso effort can become zzso Fast recovery of the electrical sources becomes difficult that zzso zzso there is a need to solve the inverse problem in an accurate and fast zzso This paper performs the zzso of multiple zzso using a zzso hybrid zzso Global convergence is guaranteed by using space mapping techniques and independent component analysis in a zzso efficient zzso The accuracy is locally obtained by using the zzso zzso and zzso Signal zzso zzso zzso When using this hybrid algorithm, a four times faster solution is zzso
