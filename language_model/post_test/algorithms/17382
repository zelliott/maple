The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso quality of Joint Photographic Experts Group zzso compressed images of zzso zzso with file sizes of 30 zzso or less, which can be transmitted quickly on the World Wide zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso were digitized at sampling rates of 100, zzso zzso 400, and 600 dots per inch through use of a flatbed scanner and saved in zzso format in 11 zzso zzso Fifty-five combinations of sampling rate and zzso degree were evaluated by means of a visual analog zzso zzso rate and zzso degree combinations whose quality was inferior to that of an average image were zzso The quality of the remaining combinations was subsequently evaluated through assessment of 8 anatomical features in each zzso 

Forty of the 55 combinations provided a file size less than 30 zzso Thirty combinations obtained zzso scores of 0 or higher on the standardized zzso As a result, 16 combinations of sampling and zzso conditions were selected for the second part of the zzso Only one combination of sampling rate and zzso degree was found to provide sufficient image quality for all 8 anatomical zzso 

Under the file size limit of the study design, the zzso compressed image of an zzso zzso did not always provide sufficient zzso This problem will be reduced by improvements in telecommunications infrastructure, which will permit faster transfer of files of larger zzso
