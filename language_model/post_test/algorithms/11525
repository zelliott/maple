This chapter reviews the research in the computer simulation of bone zzso caused by hip implants and also attempts to give zzso personnel a basic introduction to total hip zzso and zzso bone zzso First, a short discussion of the hip zzso procedure and the results of follow-up studies are presented to motivate the study of hip zzso Current implant materials and technologies and future trends in implant design are zzso A description of what are believed to be the mechanisms of bone zzso due to zzso zzso is zzso Different mathematical theories of bone zzso and their application to the problem of implant analysis are zzso and recent advances in the finite element modeling of bone zzso and implant zzso are zzso
