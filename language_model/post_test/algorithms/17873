Various zzso studies have shown that artificial neural networks and support zzso machines often have superior performance when compared to more traditional machine learning zzso The main resistance against these newer techniques is based on their lack of zzso it is difficult for the human analyst to understand the reasoning behind these zzso zzso Various rule extraction zzso techniques have been proposed to overcome this zzso zzso These techniques are able to represent the behavior of the complex model with a set of easily understandable zzso However, most of the existing zzso techniques can only be applied under limited circumstances, zzso they assume that all zzso are zzso or can only be applied if the black-box model is a neural zzso In this paper, we present zzso which is a new zzso for zzso The main advantage of zzso is its ability to extract a set of rules from any type of black-box zzso zzso show that the extracted models perform well in comparison with various other rule and decision tree zzso
