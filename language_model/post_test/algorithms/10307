For patients in intensive care units, zzso is a common and potentially deadly complication and prompt initiation of appropriate zzso therapy improves zzso The objective of this trial was to determine whether a strategy of zzso spectrum zzso guided by daily zzso of the zzso zzso could reduce the time to appropriate therapy, thus improving zzso 

zzso controlled zzso zzso 

Nine multidisciplinary intensive care units across zzso 

A total of 1,200 critically ill patients were included after meeting the following eligibility zzso expected intensive care unit stay of zzso 24 zzso zzso judged to not be harmed by blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (not zzso 

: Patients were zzso either to the zzso zzso receiving treatment according to the current international guidelines and blinded to zzso levels, or to the zzso zzso in which current guidelines were supplemented with a zzso zzso and intensified zzso based on daily zzso zzso 

The primary end point was death from any cause at day zzso this occurred for zzso zzso of zzso patients in the zzso arm and for zzso zzso of zzso patients in the zzso arm zzso risk reduction, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of stay in the intensive care unit was increased by one day zzso zzso zzso in the zzso arm, the rate of mechanical ventilation per day in the intensive care unit increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and the relative risk of days with estimated zzso zzso rate zzso zzso m was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso escalation in the intensive care unit did not improve survival and did lead to zzso harm and prolonged admission to the intensive care zzso The zzso strategy like the one used in this trial cannot be zzso
