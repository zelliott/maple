A method based on a modified zzso scheme is presented to estimate parameters of a zzso zzso system from the time series data of the zzso The method removes some of the problems associated with the standard synchronization based zzso An important achievement of this method is that it is possible to determine the exact form of zzso equations for systems with zzso zzso
