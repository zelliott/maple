Social interactions among individuals are zzso both in natural and domestic zzso As a result, trait values of individuals may be affected by genes in other individuals, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects zzso zzso can be estimated using linear mixed zzso The traditional zzso model assumes that an individual interacts equally with all its partners, whether kin or zzso There is abundant evidence, however, that individuals behave differently towards kin as compared with zzso which agrees with predictions from zzso zzso With a mix of kin and zzso therefore, zzso estimated from a traditional model may be zzso and selection based on those estimates will be zzso Here we investigate whether genetic parameters for zzso are statistically identifiable in zzso populations when zzso differ between kin and zzso and develop models to estimate such zzso First, we extend the definition of total breeding value and total zzso zzso to cases where zzso depend on zzso Next, we show that the full set of genetic parameters is not identifiable when zzso differ between kin and zzso zzso we present a reduced model that yields estimates of the total zzso effects on zzso on zzso and on all social partners of an individual, as well as the total zzso zzso for response to zzso Finally we discuss the consequences of zzso data in which zzso depend on zzso using a traditional zzso model, and investigate group structures that may allow zzso of the full set of genetic parameters when zzso depend on zzso
