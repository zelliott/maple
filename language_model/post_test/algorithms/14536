The speed of the surface zzso wave, which is related to the zzso properties of the zzso can be measured by zzso and zzso zzso This technique has been applied in biomedical applications such as detecting skin zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso material elasticity through the relationship between loading force and zzso has been applied in various areas including a number of biomedical zzso This paper compares the results obtained from these two methods on five gelatin zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are chosen because the elasticity of such gelatin zzso is close to that of tissue types such as zzso The results show that both the surface wave method and the zzso zzso zzso method produce the same values for zzso zzso For example, the zzso zzso measured by the surface wave method are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the five zzso zzso In addition, by studying the zzso curve of the surface wave speed, zzso zzso can be zzso The measured zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the five zzso zzso The results also show that the zzso elasticity of the gelatin zzso increases zzso with their prepared zzso The linear zzso between concentration and zzso elasticity have zzso values larger than zzso for both zzso
