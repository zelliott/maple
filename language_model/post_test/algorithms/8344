zzso is a fluorescent and zzso zzso group which can be used for investigating the lateral distribution and dynamics of lipids in zzso In zzso recovery after zzso or in zzso experiments, and when using this zzso the zzso (or zzso step in the illuminated part of the membrane is in fact the sum of two zzso zzso zzso zzso which is due to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso recovery, which is due to a diffusion zzso exchange of zzso and zzso particles between the illuminated and diffusion area in the zzso Here, we propose a new mathematical zzso that enables such a zzso zzso process to be zzso After zzso a zzso recovery step to a zzso step, this zzso allows us to calculate the lateral diffusion zzso D and the zzso constant K of zzso lipids in zzso two parameters which contribute to the understanding of the fluidity of the zzso phase in zzso This zzso also provides us with a complete description of the zzso molecules distribution in the illuminated and diffusion area, at any time of the zzso The zzso recovery after zzso procedure we propose was tested with an zzso zzso inserted in zzso zzso in zzso zzso onto zzso glass surfaces and in the plasma membrane of Chinese zzso zzso zzso It is shown that this procedure can also be used to evaluate the important parameters of probe mobile fraction and to determine the relative size of the illuminated and diffusion zzso This will enable zzso to be explored in terms of zzso and/or zzso
