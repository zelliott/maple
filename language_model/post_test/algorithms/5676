With the advent of zzso analysis for profiling tumor zzso a pressing need has emerged for zzso methods of organizing the large amounts of resulting zzso zzso We propose the concept of zzso measures on cancer and gene networks to organize the information in a clinically meaningful zzso zzso applied in this context extends zzso and zzso zzso genetic model of zzso zzso across multiple zzso 

Using the zzso of zzso zzso in Cancer zzso we construct networks of interacting zzso and zzso zzso is calculated by evaluating the number of zzso and genes linked by the measurement of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso is used to find a two-dimensional minimum energy solution with zzso as an input similarity zzso zzso and genes are positioned in two dimensions according to this zzso A third dimension is added to the network by assigning a zzso zzso to each cancer or zzso zzso zzso within this three-dimensional network is used to identify similar clusters in zzso zzso patterns across cancer zzso 

The zzso of genes in a three-dimensional network reveals a similarity in acquired zzso across different cancer zzso Surprisingly, the clusters separate known zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique identifies a set of zzso genes with an area under the zzso curve of zzso versus zzso when zzso on gene zzso rate zzso The cluster zzso value and number of zzso genes are positively correlated via zzso Rank Order correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A zzso analysis of cancer types zzso different types of zzso All blood tumors cluster together, and the cluster zzso values differ significantly zzso H zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, p zzso zzso 

We demonstrate the principle of zzso for organizing zzso zzso and zzso in clinically relevant zzso These clusters of zzso and zzso provide representations that identify zzso of cancer and genes driving cancer zzso
