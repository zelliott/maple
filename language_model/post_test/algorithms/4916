zzso zzso often follow the evolution of key traits, such as the origin of the zzso egg and the subsequent radiation of zzso zzso The mechanism by which a species determines the sex of its offspring has been linked to critical ecological and zzso traits but not to major zzso zzso in part because zzso mechanisms do not zzso Here we establish a previously unknown zzso relationship in 94 zzso species between zzso mechanism and whether a species bears live young or lays zzso We use that relationship to predict the zzso mechanism in three independent lineages of extinct zzso marine zzso zzso zzso and zzso each of which is known from fossils to have evolved live zzso Our results indicate that each lineage evolved zzso sex determination before acquiring live zzso This enabled their zzso zzso where the relatively stable temperatures of the open ocean zzso zzso sex determination in zzso zzso Freed from the need to move and nest on land, extreme physical adaptations to a zzso lifestyle evolved in each group, such as the zzso tails, zzso fins and zzso limbs of zzso With the inclusion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sex determination is present in all known fully zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that this mode of sex determination and the subsequent evolution of live birth are key traits required for marine zzso zzso in zzso zzso
