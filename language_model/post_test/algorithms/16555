zzso how vegetation growth responds to climate change is a critical requirement for projecting future zzso zzso Parts of North America zzso have experienced a spring cooling trend over the last three decades, but little is known about the response of vegetation growth to this zzso Using observed climate data and zzso zzso zzso zzso Index zzso data from 1982 to 2006, we investigated changes in spring zzso temperature trends and their impact on vegetation growth in zzso A zzso linear zzso approach shows that the trend in spring temperature is not continuous through the zzso zzso In the northwestern region of zzso spring temperature increased until the late 1980s or early 1990s, and stalled or decreased zzso In response, a spring vegetation zzso trend, which was evident in this region during the 1980s, stalled or reversed zzso zzso an opposite phenomenon occurred in the northeastern region of zzso due to different spring temperature zzso Additionally, the trends of summer vegetation growth vary between the periods before and after the turning point zzso of spring temperature zzso This change cannot be fully explained by summer drought stress change alone and is partly explained by changes in the trends of spring temperature as well as those of summer zzso As reported in previous studies, summer vegetation zzso trends have occurred in the northwestern region of zzso since the early 1990s, which is consistent with the spring and summer cooling trends in this region during this zzso
