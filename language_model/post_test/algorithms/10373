A large-scale similarity search investigation has been carried out on zzso zzso compound activity classes extracted from the zzso zzso The analysis was performed using two widely applied two-dimensional zzso fingerprints that mark opposite ends of the current performance spectrum of these types of zzso zzso zzso structural keys and the extended connectivity fingerprint with bond diameter four zzso For each zzso three nearest neighbor search strategies were zzso On the basis of these search calculations, a similarity search profile of the zzso database was zzso Overall, the fingerprint search campaign was surprisingly zzso In zzso of zzso test cases zzso a compound recovery rate of at least 50% was observed with at least the better performing fingerprint and one search zzso The similarity search profile also revealed several general zzso For example, fingerprint searching was often characterized by an early enrichment of active compounds in database selection zzso In addition, compound activity classes have been zzso according to different similarity search performance levels, which helps to put the results of benchmark calculations into zzso zzso a compendium of activity classes falling into different search performance categories is zzso On the basis of our large-scale investigation, the performance range of state-of-the-art zzso zzso has been delineated for compound data sets directed against a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical zzso
