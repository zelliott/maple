Human visual search is an everyday activity that enables humans to explore the real zzso Given the visual zzso during a visual search, it is necessary to select some aspects of input to shift the gaze to next zzso The aim of the study is to develop a mathematical method able to evaluate the visual selection process during the execution of a high cognitively demanding task such as the trial making test part B zzso The zzso is a zzso instrument where numbers and letters should be connected to each other in zzso and zzso zzso We adapted the zzso to an zzso version, and we used a zzso model, the zzso pointed zzso zzso to discover how selection zzso guides next exploration zzso and how human zzso factors interact with bottom-up zzso The results reported a trend to move away from the last zzso correlated to the number of zzso and the execution zzso
