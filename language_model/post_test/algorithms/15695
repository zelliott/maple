The effect of zzso flow on the structure and dynamics of zzso zzso polystyrene particles suspended at the interface between zzso and water was zzso While zzso the particles arrange themselves on a zzso lattice due to strong zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso groups on their zzso As the interface is subjected to zzso flow, however, the lattice adopts a new zzso zzso state for which two distinct regimes are zzso At low particle zzso or high zzso rates, nearest neighbors in the lattice align in the flow direction and create strings of particles that slip past each other fairly zzso This results in a stretching of the overall structure and achievement of a steady state orientation in the zzso In contrast, at high zzso or low zzso rates, the zzso forces gain importance and tend to keep the particles more strongly in their lattice zzso As a result, zzso within the lattice are forced to zzso thus giving rise to movement of particles perpendicular to the flow zzso Thus a zzso in addition to zzso of the structure is apparent in this zzso
