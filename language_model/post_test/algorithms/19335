zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso filament capping zzso the main function of which is to regulate the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso in cells and it is generally assumed that this interaction is zzso by zzso zzso particularly zzso which has been characterized in zzso 

We propose that zzso lipids also bind zzso Data from zzso sequence and structure analyses further suggest that zzso could become partially buried in the zzso zzso probably under mildly zzso conditions, in a manner that is not only dependent on the presence of zzso We show that zzso binding could involve a number of sites that are spread throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, a zzso segment between zzso zzso is most likely to be involved in interacting with and inserting into zzso membrane due to a zzso higher ratio of positively to zzso charged zzso and also due to the presence of a small zzso zzso 

zzso may therefore play an essential role in providing a stable membrane anchor for zzso zzso
