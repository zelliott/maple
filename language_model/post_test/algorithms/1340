In dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso data analysis, regions of interest zzso are analyzed by fitting a zzso model to the zzso curve acquired after a zzso zzso has been introduced into the patient's zzso This procedure can be carried out for multiple zzso and/or multiple injections of the same or a different zzso The approach presented here takes advantage of prior knowledge that some of the parameters of those multiple fits are the zzso Reduction of the total number of parameters to be estimated results in smaller statistical uncertainty for all zzso estimates, especially those common to multiple zzso
