zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis usually requires rescuers to zzso zzso resuscitation zzso However, prolonged zzso time has a deleterious impact on the zzso We developed a new filter technique that could clean the zzso artifacts and help preserve the zzso index of zzso zzso We analyzed corrupted zzso which were constructed by randomly adding different scaled zzso artifacts to the zzso zzso A newly developed zzso was used to identify the zzso zzso The zzso contained two zzso First, zzso the raw data by empirical mode decomposition zzso into several intrinsic mode fluctuations zzso and combining the dominant zzso to reconstruct a new zzso Second, calculating each zzso cycle frequency from the new signal and fitting the new signal to the original corrupted zzso by least square mean zzso method to derive the zzso zzso The estimated zzso zzso was derived by zzso of the zzso artifacts from the corrupted zzso We then performed zzso spectrum analysis zzso for original zzso corrupted zzso and estimated zzso 

A total of 150 zzso subjects with initial zzso rhythm were included for zzso Ten zzso artifacts signals were used to construct corrupted zzso Even though the correlations of zzso between the corrupted zzso zzso the original zzso and the estimated zzso zzso the original zzso are all high (all zzso the values of zzso were obviously biased in corrupted zzso with wide limits of agreement in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso in the prediction of zzso success showed that the new zzso could preserve the zzso zzso value for zzso artifacts with power ratio to zzso from 0 to 6 zzso 

The new zzso could efficiently filter the zzso artifacts of the zzso zzso and preserve the zzso index of the original zzso zzso
