We present a newly adapted zzso zzso protein zzso method for predicting native protein zzso The approach includes global BD zzso zzso compact complex selection, and local energy zzso In order to reduce the zzso costs for energy evaluations, a zzso grid force field was developed to represent the zzso protein and zzso zzso The performance of this BD protein zzso approach has been evaluated on a test set of 24 crystal protein zzso zzso of experimental structures in the test set indicates the adequate zzso sampling and accurate scoring of this BD protein zzso zzso Furthermore, we have developed an approach to account for the flexibility of zzso which has been successfully applied to reproduce the experimental complex structure from the structure of two zzso zzso These results indicate that this adapted BD protein zzso approach can be useful for the prediction of zzso zzso
