The learning of the shape and appearance behavior of complex anatomical structures is of growing importance in the successful use of medical imaging zzso We propose a method to simultaneously learn a model of shape variation and the behavioral structure of objects in zzso data zzso The zzso performs a zzso registration of a set of examples, and accounts for the zzso deformation or zzso properties of the zzso We use the method for the in zzso analysis of zzso deformation in the zzso zzso during the cardiac zzso The method is based on an emerging model of the shape variation, which is learned autonomously from a gated zzso zzso zzso It automatically adapts to the highly zzso elasticity properties of the structure during zzso The resulting deformation model is used for the measurement of global and local characteristics of the zzso zzso The method allows for the in zzso zzso of the zzso during the cardiac cycle, and the measurement of its zzso Furthermore, it makes the comparison of different zzso designs possible, and can serve as a basis for fitting a physical model of the zzso and vessel surface to individual zzso The latter is essential for long-term risk assessment of the impact of zzso in highly mobile zzso We evaluate the approach on 10 data sets from patients that underwent zzso placement after traumatic zzso of the zzso zzso
