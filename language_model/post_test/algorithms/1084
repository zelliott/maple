In current clinical practice the degree of zzso or zzso is zzso determined with zzso magnetic stimulation zzso and zzso zzso zzso We measured the zzso signal following electrical stimulation of upper and lower limbs in two normal and three clinically complete zzso zzso From the zzso signal we zzso distributed estimates of brain activity and identified zzso just behind the central zzso consistent in location with primary zzso zzso for arm and foot and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso from regions of interest defined around these zzso zzso of the zzso foot area was observed in normal and zzso subjects when the upper limb was zzso Surprisingly, for each zzso subject, stimulation below the zzso was followed by cortical zzso These zzso were weak, only loosely zzso to the stimulus and were seen zzso behind the central zzso and nearby cortical zzso zzso analysis of zzso solutions and zzso zzso showed consistent responses following foot stimulation in one zzso zzso and zzso in another zzso zzso We repeated the same experiment for zzso in a different laboratory and the results from the analysis of foot stimulation from both laboratories revealed statistically significant focal cortical response only in the zzso zzso foot zzso
