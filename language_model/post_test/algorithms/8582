Previous work suggested that the cocaine analog zzso labels a novel binding site in rat brain zzso which is not associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1995 J zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we tested whether this site is a product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso at the zzso gene that results in an effective zzso zzso zzso confirmed by Southern zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso were prepared from frozen whole brain minus zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and minus zzso sign zzso zzso zzso mice were used at approximately 23 days of zzso zzso surface analysis of zzso binding to zzso prepared from the brains of zzso mice, with 100 zzso zzso to block binding to the zzso zzso zzso revealed two binding sites: the zzso and a second site, replicating previous studies conducted with rat zzso In the absence of the zzso zzso zzso sign zzso binding surface analysis demonstrated that zzso labeled two sites: the zzso and a second site called site zzso zzso studies of site zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso have low or negligible affinity for site zzso The relatively high density of site zzso in brain zzso and the fact that the zzso values of cocaine and zzso for site zzso are in the range achieved in the brain following cocaine administration suggests that site zzso could contribute to the pharmacological or zzso effects of zzso Further progress in zzso the function of site zzso will depend on developing potent and selective agents for this zzso
