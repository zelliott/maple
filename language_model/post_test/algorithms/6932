This paper describes a new framework for zzso zzso data zzso The foundation of this framework is a minimum spanning tree zzso representation of a set of zzso gene expression zzso A key property of this representation is that each cluster of the expression data zzso to one zzso of the zzso which rigorously converts a zzso zzso problem to a tree zzso zzso We have demonstrated that though the zzso relationship is greatly simplified in the zzso zzso no essential information is lost for the purpose of zzso Two key advantages in representing a set of zzso data as an zzso are: zzso the simple structure of a tree zzso efficient zzso of rigorous zzso zzso which otherwise are highly zzso zzso and zzso as an zzso zzso does not depend on detailed geometric shape of a zzso it can overcome many of the problems faced by classical zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso we have developed a number of rigorous and efficient zzso zzso including two with guaranteed global zzso We have implemented these zzso as a computer software zzso To demonstrate its effectiveness, we have tested it on two data sets, zzso expression data from zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression data in response to zzso zzso
