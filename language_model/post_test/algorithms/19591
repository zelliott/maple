To assess the feasibility and safety of selective zzso management in penetrating abdominal solid organ zzso 

zzso management of blunt abdominal solid organ injuries has become the standard of zzso However, routine surgical exploration remains the standard practice for all penetrating solid organ zzso The present study examines the role of zzso management in selected patients with penetrating injuries to abdominal solid zzso 

zzso zzso study, which included all penetrating abdominal solid organ zzso zzso zzso injuries admitted to a level I trauma center, over a zzso zzso Patients with zzso instability, zzso or an zzso abdomen underwent an immediate zzso Patients who were zzso stable and had no signs of zzso were selected for further CT scan zzso In the absence of CT scan findings suggestive of hollow zzso injury, the patients were observed with serial clinical zzso zzso levels, and white cell zzso Patients with left zzso injuries underwent zzso zzso to rule out zzso zzso zzso parameters included survival, zzso need for delayed zzso in observed patients, and length of hospital zzso 

During the study period, there were 152 patients with 185 penetrating solid organ zzso zzso wounds accounted for zzso and stab wounds for zzso of zzso zzso patients zzso met the criteria for immediate zzso The remaining 61 zzso patients were selected for CT scan zzso zzso patients zzso of all zzso with 47 solid organ injuries who had no CT scan findings suspicious of hollow zzso injury were selected for clinical observation and additional zzso in zzso Four patients with a zzso on CT scan underwent zzso zzso of the zzso Overall, 41 patients zzso including 18 cases with grade III to V injuries, were successfully managed without a zzso and without any abdominal zzso Overall, zzso of all liver, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso injuries were successfully managed zzso Patients with isolated solid organ injuries treated zzso had a significantly shorter hospital stay than patients treated zzso even though the former group had more severe zzso In 3 patients with failed zzso management and delayed zzso there were no zzso 

In the appropriate environment, selective zzso management of penetrating abdominal solid organ injuries has a high success rate and a low complication zzso
