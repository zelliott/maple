zzso correction is very important in 3-D PET reconstruction due to a large scatter contribution in zzso Currently, one of the most popular methods is the so-called single scatter simulation zzso which considers single Compton scattering contributions from many randomly distributed scatter zzso The zzso enables a fast calculation of scattering with a relatively high zzso however, the accuracy of zzso is dependent on the accuracy of tail fitting to find a correct zzso factor, which is often difficult in low zzso count zzso To overcome this drawback as well as to improve accuracy of scatter zzso by incorporating multiple scattering contribution, we propose a multiple scatter simulation zzso based on a simplified zzso Carlo zzso simulation that considers zzso migration and interactions due to zzso zzso and Compton zzso Unlike the zzso the zzso zzso a zzso factor by comparing simulated prompt data with the measured data in the whole volume, which enables a more robust zzso of a zzso zzso Even though the proposed zzso is based on zzso a significant acceleration of the zzso time is possible by using a virtual detector array with a larger pitch by exploiting that the scatter distribution varies slowly in spatial zzso Furthermore, our zzso zzso is nicely fit to a parallel zzso using graphic zzso unit zzso In particular, we exploit a hybrid zzso technique using the open zzso and the zzso unified device architecture, which results in zzso faster than using a single zzso Overall, the zzso time of zzso is zzso for a high-resolution research zzso zzso zzso The performance of the proposed zzso is validated through actual experiments using an zzso
