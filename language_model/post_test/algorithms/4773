In zzso with scanned particle beams, tissue zzso lateral to the beam direction are problematic in two ways: they pose a challenge to dose calculation zzso and they lead to a high sensitivity to setup zzso In order to zzso and avoid these problems, a zzso number zzso as a method to zzso lateral tissue zzso of single beam spot i is zzso To evaluate this new concept, two kinds of potential errors were investigated for single beam zzso First, the dose calculation error has been obtained by comparing the dose distribution zzso by a simple pencil beam zzso to more accurate zzso Carlo zzso The resulting error is clearly correlated with zzso Second, the analysis of the sensitivity to setup errors of single beam spots also showed a dependence on zzso From this data it is concluded that zzso can be used as a criterion to assess the risks of a compromised delivered dose due to lateral tissue zzso Furthermore, a method how to incorporate this information into the inverse planning process for intensity modulated zzso therapy is zzso By suppressing beam spots with a high value of zzso the zzso impact of lateral tissue zzso can be reduced, leading to treatment plans which are more robust to dose calculation errors of the pencil beam zzso Additional possibilities to use the information of zzso are outlined in the zzso
