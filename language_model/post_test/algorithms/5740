The zzso of bread wheat zzso zzso is predicted to be greater than 16 zzso in size and consist predominantly of repetitive zzso making the sequencing and assembly of this zzso a major zzso We have reduced zzso sequence complexity by zzso zzso arm zzso and applied second-generation technology and appropriate zzso analysis to sequence and assemble low copy and zzso regions of this zzso zzso The assembly represents approximately zzso of the zzso arm and all known zzso zzso zzso of the zzso assembly with the zzso zzso of rice zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified large regions of zzso The zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso along with available genetic mapping data, has been used to produce an zzso draft zzso zzso build, which is publicly available at zzso Our results suggest that the sequencing of isolated zzso arms can provide valuable information of the gene content of wheat and is a step towards zzso sequencing and variation discovery in this important zzso
