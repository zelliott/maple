Local zzso zzso are generated by zzso ensembles and contain information about the activity of single zzso Here, the zzso of the zzso zzso layer and their changes during long-term synaptic plasticity zzso and zzso were recorded in response to zzso facial stimulation in the rat in zzso The zzso comprised a zzso zzso and a cortical zzso zzso T and C, which derived from independent zzso cell zzso zzso during zzso and zzso To extract information about the underlying cellular activities, the zzso was reconstructed using a repetitive zzso zzso of the zzso potential generated by a detailed zzso model of the zzso zzso The mossy fiber input patterns were determined using a Blind zzso zzso zzso zzso The major component of the zzso was generated by the zzso cell spike zzso zzso which caused a powerful sink in the zzso initial segment with the source located in the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso changes observed during zzso and zzso required modifications in both release probability and intrinsic zzso at the mossy zzso cells zzso zzso plasticity and zzso cell zzso zzso proved critical for controlling the percentage of active zzso cells, which was zzso in standard conditions but ranged from zzso during zzso to zzso during zzso and raised over 50% when zzso was zzso The emerging picture is that of independent (but zzso zzso and cortical channels, in which synaptic plasticity and zzso zzso effectively regulate the number of discharging zzso cells and zzso spikes generating zzso activity clusters in the zzso zzso zzso
