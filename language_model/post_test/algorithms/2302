We developed an zzso to analyze the distribution and geometry of simple and complex salt bridges in 94 proteins selected from the zzso Data zzso In this study, the term zzso zzso denotes both zzso and zzso paired zzso interactions between zzso zzso groups and basic zzso groups in single or adjacent protein zzso We defined complex salt bridges as those joining more than two charged zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and excluding zzso The survey related the following special features of complex salt zzso zzso The abundance of complex salt bridges is high; one-third of all zzso participating in zzso formation were part of complex salt zzso zzso The geometry of the interaction between zzso and basic zzso is very similar in simple and complex salt zzso Adding one zzso to a simple interaction represents a minor change in the geometry but provides the zzso with a more complex interaction, a phenomenon that may explain the cooperative effect of salt bridges in zzso Such moderate changes in zzso networks can be generated zzso and zzso without zzso the protein in a local energetic zzso zzso One important role of complex salt bridges is connecting protein zzso or joining two secondary structures to form zzso structures, where they can connect as many as five secondary structure zzso zzso zzso serves as a key zzso and/or a branching unit because its geometry allows three possible directions of zzso The information gained from this study of complex salt bridges should enhance the understanding of protein zzso
