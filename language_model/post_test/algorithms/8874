Modeling the behavior of zzso is the realm of evolutionary zzso zzso From a zzso point of view, theory must provide some guidelines regarding which zzso to use in order to solve a particular zzso Unfortunately, most theoretical models of evolutionary zzso are difficult to apply to realistic zzso However, in recent work zzso and zzso 2008, zzso where we developed a method to practically estimate the performance of evolutionary zzso zzso zzso we started addressing this zzso The method was quite general; however, it suffered from some zzso it required the identification of a set of reference problems, it required hand picking a distance measure in each particular domain, and the resulting models were zzso typically being linear combinations of 100 features or zzso In this paper, we propose a significant improvement of this technique that overcomes the three limitations of our previous zzso We achieve this through the use of a novel set of features for assessing problem difficulty for zzso which are very general, essentially based on the notion of finite zzso To show the capabilities or our technique and to compare it with our previous performance models, we create models for the same two important classes of zzso zzso on rational functions and zzso function zzso in our previous zzso We model a variety of zzso The comparison showed that for the majority of the zzso and problem classes, the new method produced much simpler and more accurate models than zzso To further illustrate the practicality of the technique and its zzso zzso zzso we have also used it to predict the performance of both zzso models and zzso on the problem of wind speed zzso obtaining simpler and more accurate models that outperform in all cases our previous performance zzso
