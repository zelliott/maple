The zzso Image Analysis Contest zzso 2005 zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso First, we performed a standard analysis of the functional and anatomical data that includes zzso spatial zzso into zzso space, zzso statistics (one- and zzso zzso and zzso random effects, General Linear Model zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Strong sentence and weak speaker zzso effects were detected in zzso and frontal zzso Following this standard analysis, we performed zzso and zzso zzso Independent zzso Analysis zzso that highlights the presence of functionally connected clusters in zzso and frontal regions for sentence processing, besides revealing other networks related to auditory stimulation or to the default state of the zzso Finally, we applied a high-resolution cortical alignment method to improve the spatial correspondence across brains and zzso the random effects group zzso as well as the zzso zzso in this zzso Using zzso and temporally zzso data, this zzso analysis revealed comparable results but with a set of zzso more confined group clusters and more differential group region of interest time zzso
