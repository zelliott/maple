To determine the relative effectiveness of second generation zzso techniques in the treatment of heavy zzso zzso 

Network zzso on the primary outcome measures of zzso heavy zzso and patients' dissatisfaction with zzso 

zzso zzso controlled trials zzso zzso zzso were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Library, zzso zzso and zzso databases from inception to April zzso The reference lists of known relevant articles were searched for further zzso Two zzso independently selected articles without language zzso 

zzso controlled trials involving second generation zzso destruction techniques for women with heavy zzso bleeding unresponsive to medical zzso 

Of the three most commonly used techniques, network zzso showed that bipolar zzso and zzso zzso resulted in higher rates of zzso than zzso balloon zzso at around 12 months zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso respectively), but there was no evidence of a convincing difference between the three techniques in the number of women dissatisfied with treatment or still experiencing heavy zzso Compared with bipolar radio frequency and zzso devices, an increased number of women still experienced heavy bleeding after free fluid zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Compared with radio frequency zzso free fluid zzso was associated with reduced rates of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and increased rates of dissatisfaction zzso zzso to zzso zzso Of the less commonly used devices, zzso laser zzso zzso was associated with increased rates of zzso compared with all the other devices, while zzso led to a reduced rate compared with bipolar radio frequency and zzso 

zzso radio frequency and zzso zzso devices are more effective than zzso balloon and free fluid zzso in the treatment of heavy zzso bleeding with second generation zzso zzso zzso
