zzso for the detection of rotation and divergence in the presence of a zzso component in sparse random dot patterns are determined for human observers and two computer zzso The zzso only make use of local zzso directions and not of local zzso magnitude zzso The results show that zzso performance in this task can be well described without the need of specialized mechanisms tuned to either rotation or zzso zzso integration of information over more than two frames occurs for low zzso For high zzso the correspondence problem seems to limit zzso
