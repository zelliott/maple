zzso validation data and comparison metrics for zzso of magnetic resonance images zzso are difficult tasks due to the lack of reliable ground zzso This problem is even more evident for images presenting pathology, which can both alter tissue appearance through zzso and cause geometric zzso Systems for generating synthetic images with zzso degradation by noise and intensity zzso offer the possibility for testing and comparison of zzso zzso Such systems do not yet offer simulation of sufficiently realistic looking zzso This paper presents a system that combines physical and statistical modeling to generate synthetic zzso zzso brain zzso with tumor and zzso along with the underlying anatomical ground truth, Main emphasis is placed on simulation of the major effects known for tumor zzso such as contrast enhancement, local distortion of healthy zzso zzso zzso adjacent to tumors, destruction and deformation of fiber zzso and zzso zzso contrast of healthy tissue and zzso The new method zzso pathology in zzso zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso by simulating mass effect, zzso and destruction of white matter zzso and zzso of brain zzso by tumor zzso We generate synthetic contrast enhanced MR images by simulating the zzso of contrast agent within the zzso The appearance of the the brain tissue and tumor in zzso is simulated by zzso texture images from real MR zzso The proposed method is able to generate synthetic ground truth and zzso MR images with tumor and zzso that exhibit comparable zzso challenges to real tumor zzso Such image data sets will find use in zzso reliability studies, comparison and validation of different zzso methods, training and teaching, or even in evaluating standards for tumor size like the zzso criteria zzso evaluation criteria in solid zzso
