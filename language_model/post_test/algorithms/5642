zzso zzso zzso in individual zzso has important applications for biomedical and functional zzso Recent zzso zzso zzso approaches require injecting fluorescent zzso moreover, only one or few vessels can be zzso at a zzso To overcome these shortcomings, we used zzso optical imaging of intrinsic zzso changes in zzso vascular networks to record zzso zzso over several zzso zzso of cortical zzso We then demonstrate the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso from such zzso data, using two zzso independent, zzso The first one is a recently published zzso zzso zzso that estimates zzso zzso zzso We adapt it to data obtained in zzso imaging and show, for the first time, its performance on such zzso The second zzso zzso is zzso It is based on global energy zzso techniques to estimate the full zzso zzso zzso inside zzso We test the two zzso on both simulated and biological data, obtained in rat cerebral zzso in a spreading depression zzso On vessels with zzso zzso zzso both zzso performed well, allowing their usage as benchmark one for zzso However, our novel zzso zzso outperformed the other one for higher zzso as encountered in the zzso zzso
