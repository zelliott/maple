With current zzso triggering design, in initiating zzso breaths patient effort is only a small fraction of the total effort zzso to overcome the zzso zzso Similarly, advances in zzso pressure or flow delivery and zzso flow termination improve patient effort or zzso muscle work during mechanical zzso Yet refinements in zzso design do not necessarily allow optimal zzso zzso as the zzso is key in managing patient factors and selecting appropriate zzso factors to maintain zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso patient flow demand by zzso flow delivery results in flow zzso whereas zzso between mechanical zzso time zzso zzso and neural zzso produce timing zzso zzso efforts are an example of timing zzso In the triggering phase, trigger thresholds that are set too high or the type of triggering methods zzso wasted zzso zzso efforts can be aggravated by respiratory muscle weakness or other conditions that reduce respiratory zzso In the zzso phase, zzso factors play an important role in zzso zzso this role includes the assistance level, set zzso flow rate, zzso zzso rate, and zzso zzso and to some extent, applied zzso This paper proposes an zzso that clinicians can use to adjust zzso settings with the goal to eliminate or reduce patients' wasted zzso
