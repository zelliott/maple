zzso mechanics still provides new unexpected effects when considering the transport of energy and zzso Models of continuous time quantum walks, which implicitly use zzso zzso zzso have been intensely used to investigate the effectiveness of zzso Here we show how breaking zzso symmetry of the zzso dynamics in this model can enable directional control, enhancement, and suppression of quantum zzso Examples ranging from zzso transport to complex networks are zzso This opens new prospects for more efficient methods to transport energy and zzso
