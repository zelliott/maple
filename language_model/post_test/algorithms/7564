This paper is concerned with the problem of filter design for target tracking over sensor zzso Different from most existing works on sensor networks, we consider the zzso sensor networks with two types of sensors different on processing abilities zzso as zzso and zzso sensors, zzso However, questions of how to deal with the zzso of sensors and how to design a filter for target tracking over such kind of networks remain largely zzso propose in this paper a novel distributed consensus filter to solve the target tracking zzso Two criteria, zzso zzso and zzso are imposed for the filter zzso The so-called sequential design scheme is then presented to tackle the zzso of zzso The minimum principle of zzso is adopted for zzso sensors to zzso the zzso zzso As for zzso sensors, the zzso zzso method coupled with the generalized inverse of zzso is then used for filter zzso Furthermore, it is proven that convergence property is guaranteed for the proposed consensus filter in the presence of process and measurement zzso zzso results have validated the performance of the proposed zzso It is also demonstrated that the zzso sensor networks with the proposed filter outperform the zzso counterparts in light of reduction in the network cost, with slight degradation of zzso zzso
