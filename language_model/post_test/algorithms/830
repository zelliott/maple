zzso techniques have been proposed to avoid extended or repeated zzso in patients with zzso disease zzso but without precise zzso prospective zzso and with a technically limited zzso 

A prospective zzso study of new zzso zzso zzso in order to evaluate the safety, type and site of zzso and zzso clinical and surgical zzso 

Between January 1993 and December 2002, 102 among zzso consecutive patients underwent at least one zzso for complicated zzso Patients were treated following precise indications and then included in a prospective database with scheduled zzso zzso claimed to influence zzso and zzso outcomes and type and site of recurrence were zzso We performed 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 41 widening zzso SP, 32 zzso zzso zzso SP, associated with zzso SP (in 80 zzso or with minimal zzso zzso or both (in 47 zzso zzso mortality was zzso complication rate was zzso Ten years clinical and surgical recurrence rates were zzso and zzso zzso zzso rate on an zzso site was zzso No specific factor was identified as related to zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso results of zzso are comparable to or even better than both conservative and zzso surgery as reported in the literature, with a low recurrence rate on the zzso zzso Considering the zzso of the clinical course of CD and the lifetime need for surgical procedures, zzso together with minimal zzso and classic SP repertoire, should be considered zzso treatment in complicated zzso
