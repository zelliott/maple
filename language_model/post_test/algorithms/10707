Current approaches for mining association rules usually assume that the mining is performed in a zzso database, where the problem of missing attribute values does not practically zzso However, these assumptions are not preserved in some medical databases, like in a home care zzso In this paper, a novel uncertainty rule zzso is zzso namely zzso zzso Rule zzso which addresses the problem of mining dynamic databases containing missing zzso This zzso requires only one pass from the initial zzso in order to generate the item set, while new metrics corresponding to the notion of Support and zzso are zzso zzso was evaluated over two medical databases, introducing randomly multiple missing values for each zzso attribute zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the initial zzso Compared with the classical approach zzso with missing values are zzso the proposed zzso was more robust in mining rules from zzso containing missing zzso In all cases, the difference in preserving the initial rules ranged between zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso Moreover, due to its incremental nature, zzso saved over zzso of the time required for thorough zzso Thus, the proposed zzso can offer a preferable solution for mining in dynamic zzso zzso
