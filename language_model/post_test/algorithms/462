A physical theory explaining the zzso zzso of water and zzso in biological zzso is introduced based on the phenomena of Taylor zzso in which highly zzso zzso cycle between flowing and stagnant regions in the zzso enhancing zzso in the direction of zzso zzso An effective diffusion equation is zzso for which the zzso of zzso in the zzso direction zzso of zzso zzso depends on the molecular diffusion zzso tissue zzso and vessel zzso This analysis provides a homogenization that represents three-dimensional transport in zzso beds as an effectively one-dimensional zzso The derived zzso equation may be used to simulate the transport of zzso in zzso such as in zzso zzso In addition, the analysis provides a physically based hypothesis for explaining zzso zzso observed in zzso imaging zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and suggests the means of obtaining quantitative functional information on zzso vessel density from zzso of zzso zzso It is shown that a failure to account for zzso zzso in vascular zzso may lead to zzso of imaging data and significant zzso of directional bias in molecular zzso in biological zzso zzso of the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso may be combined with an independent measurement of zzso to provide an estimate of zzso vessel density in the zzso
