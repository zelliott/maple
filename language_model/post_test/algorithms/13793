Estimates have been made of the proportion of zzso zzso zzso caused by sun exposure by comparing the observed zzso of melanoma with estimates of the zzso in the absence of sun zzso The estimated proportions varied from zzso in males and zzso in females in Queensland, Australia, when the zzso on the whole body was compared with that on zzso sites, to zzso when zzso in people born in Australia was compared with that in migrants to Australia from areas of lower sun zzso A comparison of US zzso and US zzso in which the zzso in zzso was taken as the zzso in zzso zzso gave estimates of zzso in males and zzso in zzso It was estimated that some zzso zzso of about zzso zzso that occurred worldwide in 1985 were caused by sun zzso This is probably a minimum zzso That zzso of the world's zzso are estimated to occur in Black African and Asian populations and are of unknown cause would justify studies of the causes of melanoma in these zzso
