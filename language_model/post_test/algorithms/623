The progress zzso of conversion of zzso zzso at different zzso to zzso zzso and hydrogen cyanide zzso zzso by zzso zzso from zzso zzso together with the zzso excess zzso of zzso are converted into individual progress zzso of the zzso and zzso They reveal that, under the prevailing experimental conditions, the zzso conversion is sufficiently slow compared to its zzso counterpart, so that it can be ignored in a simplified zzso zzso zzso is then used to convert the progress zzso of the zzso into reaction rate zzso These zzso are used to determine the rate zzso in the rate expression based on a three-step zzso ordered zzso reaction scheme that describes this zzso zzso The resulting rate zzso are compared against published zzso Some of the problems encountered and their solution are briefly zzso
