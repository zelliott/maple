To evaluate the accuracy of the zzso of zzso cortical zzso using molecular zzso 

A search of publicly available databases was performed to identify zzso zzso with multiple zzso zzso of zzso cortical zzso zzso techniques were zzso to identify zzso expressed genes for each zzso zzso The lists of genes obtained from the zzso were used to create zzso signatures through the use of a zzso zzso These signatures were organized into an zzso to zzso zzso zzso The use of these signatures according to our zzso was validated on several independent zzso 

We identified three Gene zzso zzso zzso that fit our criteria to develop a training zzso All of the zzso in our study zzso the zzso zzso The final training zzso included 149 samples represented by the four most common zzso zzso of zzso cortical zzso 69 clear cell, 41 zzso 16 zzso and 23 zzso When validation of our signatures was performed on external zzso we were able to correctly zzso 68 of the 72 samples zzso The correct zzso by zzso was zzso zzso for clear cell, zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Through the use of zzso techniques, we were able to create an zzso that zzso zzso zzso on a molecular level with zzso accuracy across multiple independent zzso This zzso may aid in selecting molecular therapies and may improve the accuracy of zzso of zzso cortical zzso
