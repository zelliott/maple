zzso CT zzso is arguably the most accurate energy mapping technique in zzso zzso correction zzso implemented on hybrid zzso zzso However, this approach is not attractive for clinical use zzso to increased patient zzso The authors propose a novel energy mapping approach referred to as virtual zzso zzso taking advantage of the zzso zzso but using CT data acquired at a single energy zzso For this purpose, the CT image acquired at one energy is used to generate the CT image at a second energy using calculated zzso conversion zzso derived from phantom zzso 

The zzso map zzso at zzso zzso was generated for the zzso phantom and clinical studies using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The generated zzso at zzso zzso are compared to the reference derived from the zzso phantom serving as ground zzso PET data generated from a zzso activity map for the zzso phantom were then corrected for zzso using zzso generated using the different energy mapping zzso In addition, the generated zzso using the above described methods for a zzso zzso phantom containing different zzso of zzso in water were compared to actual zzso zzso Likewise, CT images of five clinical zzso studies were used to generate zzso using the various zzso approaches were compared with zzso acquired at zzso zzso using zzso rod sources for the clinical zzso 

The results of phantom studies demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate than the zzso zzso All three zzso yielded almost similar results for soft and lung zzso whereas for bone zzso the zzso and the zzso methods produced a much smaller mean relative difference zzso and zzso zzso than the zzso approach zzso Likewise, the comparison of PET images corrected for zzso using the various methods showed that the proposed method provides better accuracy zzso than the zzso method zzso Clinical studies further demonstrated that, compared to the zzso method, the zzso approach has better agreement for zzso structures with the zzso technique zzso versus zzso and transmission scanning zzso versus zzso 

It was concluded that the proposed method zzso the zzso method especially in zzso zzso Further evaluation using a large clinical zzso database is zzso to evaluate the potential of the technique in a clinical zzso
