A rough bone implant surface was zzso as being built up of pits of different sizes and of different zzso zzso were formulated regarding the mechanical strength of the zzso bone based upon the present knowledge of the character of the zzso adjacent to zzso implants and the mechanical characteristics of different bone zzso A surface zzso zzso was zzso the pit zzso factor zzso which describes how effective the individual pits of the rough surface are as retention elements with regard to zzso Another surface zzso zzso was zzso the pit density factor zzso the value of which depends upon how densely packed the pits zzso The zzso zzso strength of a rough implant surface with known zzso can be estimated by means of these two surface zzso zzso The effectiveness of pits of different sizes and of different shapes was investigated using this zzso
