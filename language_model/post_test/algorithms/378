zzso reaction time zzso to a visual target tends to be shorter when auditory stimuli are presented in close zzso and spatial zzso even when subjects are instructed to ignore the auditory zzso zzso attention zzso Previous studies using pairs of visual and auditory stimuli differing in both zzso and vertical position suggest that the amount of zzso zzso decreases not with the physical but with the zzso distance between visual target and auditory zzso zzso et zzso zzso Res zzso zzso presented an additional zzso zzso background of three seconds zzso zzso the zzso level had a zzso effect on zzso in zzso zzso versus disparate stimulus zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso stimuli are slowed down, whereas zzso responses to disparate stimuli are zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso model accounts for this observation by variation of a zzso zzso in the second stage of the model whose value does not depend on stimulus onset zzso between target and zzso
