During the passage of a cold front in March 2002, zzso properties examined in coastal waters impacted by the Mississippi River indicated that westward zzso flows and increasing river discharge containing high zzso of zzso particles contributed significantly to surface optical zzso A comparison of seasonal data from three cruises indicated spectral models of zzso and scattering to be generally consistent with other coastal zzso while their zzso in terms of zzso zzso alpha concentration showed seasonal zzso The exponential slope of the colored dissolved organic matter zzso averaged zzso zzso and zzso zzso averaged zzso zzso with zzso from general trends observed due to anomalous water zzso Although the zzso specific zzso zzso varied over a wide range zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso being higher in offshore surface waters, values of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso Wide zzso Sensor zzso wave bands were highly correlated to modeled zzso zzso scattering characteristics were similar to observations for other coastal waters, while zzso ratios were on average lower in zzso surface waters zzso and higher in low zzso zzso waters zzso Average percent differences in remote sensing zzso zzso derived from modeled and zzso zzso zzso were highest in the blue wave bands zzso and at locations with more zzso water zzso zzso estimates of zzso and zzso zzso derived using regional empirical zzso were highly correlated to in zzso zzso
