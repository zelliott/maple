As shown previously for two-dimensional zzso zzso effects should not be ignored in electrical zzso zzso zzso and structural information is important for the reconstruction of zzso zzso Here, we will describe the zzso reconstruction of an zzso zzso distribution for the more realistic three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso between different zzso regions are zzso constrained using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The values of the zzso are then determined using zzso zzso in a zzso zzso At each zzso the forward problem is solved by the finite element zzso The approach is used to reconstruct the 3-D zzso profile of a canine zzso Both zzso performance and simulated reconstruction results are presented together with a detailed study on the sensitivity of the prediction error with respect to different zzso In particular, the use of an zzso zzso to better extract interior zzso is zzso
