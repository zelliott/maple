zzso edge structures is a challenge to image zzso zzso that reconstruct a high-resolution image from a zzso zzso We propose a new zzso zzso zzso technique through directional filtering and data zzso For a zzso to be zzso two observation sets are defined in two zzso directions, and each set produces an estimate of the zzso zzso These directional estimates, modeled as different noisy zzso of the missing zzso are fused by the linear minimum mean zzso zzso zzso technique into a more robust estimate, using the statistics of the two observation zzso We also present a simplified version of the zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso cost without sacrificing much the zzso zzso zzso show that the new zzso techniques can preserve edge sharpness and reduce ringing zzso
