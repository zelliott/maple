This study is aimed at establishing a neural network and fuzzy feedback control zzso system used for adjusting the optimum electrical stimulating current to control the motion of an ankle zzso The proposed method further improves the zzso problem existing in zzso zzso The proposed system includes both hardware and zzso The hardware system determines the patient's ankle joint angle using a position sensor located in the patient's affected zzso This sensor stimulates the zzso anterior with an electrical zzso that zzso the zzso action and achieves the ideal ankle joint trace zzso The software system estimates the stimulating current using a neural zzso The fuzzy controller zzso the zzso problem by zzso the motion trace errors between the neural network control and actual zzso The control qualities of various controllers for four subjects were compared in the clinical zzso It was found that both the root mean square error and the mean error were minimal when using the neural network and fuzzy zzso The zzso problem in zzso locomotion was effectively improved by incorporating the neural network and fuzzy controller with the functional electrical zzso
