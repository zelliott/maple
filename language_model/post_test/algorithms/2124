The aim of the study was to determine and compare zzso and zzso moments across zzso fractures, for different positions of the bite point and different sites of the zzso Three identical zzso zzso each with a single zzso were zzso The fracture sites were in the angle, body and zzso zzso A zzso bone plate was used for zzso zzso bite forces were applied at 13 bite zzso For each bite point, the zzso of the fragments were registered and converted into zzso and zzso moments across the zzso Positive zzso moments were defined as those moments that caused zzso at the lower border and tension at the zzso side of the zzso negative zzso moments did the zzso zzso fractures had relatively high positive zzso zzso Body fractures had positive as well as negative zzso moments and the highest zzso zzso zzso fractures had negative zzso moments only and relatively high zzso zzso It was found that angle, body and zzso fractures each have a characteristic load zzso These load patterns should play a decisive role in the treatment of zzso fractures with regard to number and positioning of zzso
