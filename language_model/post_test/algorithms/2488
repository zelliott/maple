A new zzso that uses a zzso technique to solve the linear zzso transport equation zzso has been developed to improve the accuracy and speed of external zzso beam treatment planning zzso The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of this zzso in both zzso and homogeneous zzso 

zzso factors, depth dose zzso and profiles for zzso fields were measured in water using diamond and zzso chamber zzso Furthermore, zzso fields, fields zzso with the zzso zzso enhanced dynamic wedge fields as well as fields with different zzso distances were zzso Various test plans were created on a zzso zzso phantom including zzso zzso and corresponding dose zzso within the phantom were measured with zzso zzso The new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso version zzso zzso Medical Systems, CA, zzso was used to calculate dose zzso for all field zzso and plans, for both 6 zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso were also performed with zzso a standard zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso the output factors were within zzso for zzso zzso For the depth doses, the average zzso were within zzso in dose and 1 zzso in distance to agreement zzso For the profiles, the zzso were within zzso zzso except near the zzso Similar results were obtained for the other field zzso Good agreement with AAA was also zzso For the plans calculated on the zzso zzso the number of points meeting the gamma criterion of zzso in dose and 3 zzso in zzso was higher with zzso zzso zzso for 6 zzso zzso for 15 zzso than with AAA zzso for 6 zzso zzso for 15 zzso 

zzso calculations with the zzso zzso zzso in homogeneous media are in good agreement with both zzso and the AAA zzso In zzso media, the zzso zzso zzso is superior to AAA in both lung and zzso zzso
