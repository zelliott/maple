Most studies of zzso detection zzso for pulmonary zzso have focused on solid zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a commercially available zzso system in the detection of pulmonary zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso compared to visual zzso 

zzso zzso examinations were performed on 48 patients with existing or suspicious pulmonary zzso on chest zzso Three zzso independently reported the location and pattern zzso solid, or part zzso of each zzso candidate on zzso zzso scans, assigned each a confidence score, and then analyzed all scans using the zzso zzso A reference standard was established by a consensus panel of different zzso who found 229 zzso zzso with diameters zzso or zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso results and confidence levels were used to generate zzso alternative zzso zzso characteristic zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso for 3 zzso zzso was significantly higher than that for the zzso system zzso zzso test, P zzso zzso For overall and solid zzso the zzso values without and with the zzso system were significantly different zzso zzso zzso on zzso alternative zzso zzso characteristic zzso For zzso and zzso zzso the zzso values with the zzso system were greater than those without the zzso system, indicating no significant zzso 

zzso are significantly superior to this zzso system in the detection of zzso but the zzso system can still play a complementary role in detecting zzso with or without zzso
