A review of the selection of models in dynamic zzso zzso zzso is conducted, with emphasis on the balance between the bias and zzso required to produce stable and accurate estimates of vascular zzso The vascular parameters considered as a zzso model are the forward volume transfer constant zzso , the plasma volume fraction zzso and the zzso volume fraction zzso zzso To illustrate the critical issues in model selection, a zzso selection of models in an animal model of cerebral zzso is zzso zzso errors and extended models are zzso Studies with zzso and zzso zzso models are zzso models considering water exchange are zzso
