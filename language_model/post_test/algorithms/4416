zzso and ranking high pedestrian crash zones plays a key role in developing efficient and effective strategies to enhance pedestrian zzso This paper presents zzso a zzso Information Systems zzso methodology to study the spatial patterns of pedestrian crashes in order to identify high pedestrian crash zones, and zzso an evaluation of methods to rank these high pedestrian crash zzso The zzso based methodology to identify high pedestrian crash zones includes zzso crash data, creating crash concentration zzso and then identifying high pedestrian crash zzso Two methods generally used to create crash concentration maps based on density values are the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso methods such as crash frequency, crash density, and crash rate, as well as composite methods such as the zzso and the crash score methods are used to rank the selected high pedestrian crash zzso The use of this methodology and ranking methods for high pedestrian crash zones are illustrated using the Las Vegas metropolitan area as the study zzso Crash data collected for a zzso period zzso were address matched using the street zzso street name intersection location reference zzso A crash concentration map was then created using the zzso zzso as it zzso the creation of a smooth density surface when compared to the zzso zzso Twenty-two linear high crash zones and seven circular high crash zones were then zzso The zzso based methodology reduced the zzso in the analysis zzso zzso obtained from the evaluation of methods to rank high pedestrian crash zones show a significant variation in ranking when individual methods were zzso However, rankings of high pedestrian crash zones were relatively consistent with little to no variation when the zzso method and the crash score method were zzso Thus, these composite methods are recommended for use in ranking high pedestrian crash zones instead of individual zzso
