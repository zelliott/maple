zzso tree induction zzso is a powerful means of modeling data without much prior zzso Models are zzso by humans, robust and easily applied in real-world applications, features that are mutually exclusive in other commonly used machine learning zzso While zzso is widely used in disciplines ranging from economics to medicine, they are an intriguing option in pharmaceutical research, especially when dealing with large data zzso 

This review covers the automated technologies available for creating decision trees and other rules zzso even from large zzso such as chemical zzso The authors discuss the need for properly documented and validated zzso Lastly, the authors cover several case studies in hit discovery, drug metabolism and zzso and drug zzso and compare them with other established zzso 

zzso is a competitive and zzso tool in basic research as well as in hit and drug zzso Its strengths lie in its ability to handle all sorts of different data formats, the visual nature of the models, and the small zzso effort needed for zzso in real-world zzso zzso include lack of zzso and zzso models for certain types of zzso As with any modeling technique, proper validation and quality measures are of utmost zzso
