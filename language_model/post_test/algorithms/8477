The electrical properties of cervical zzso zzso have been zzso in the frequency range 100 zzso to 10 zzso The zzso zzso process comprises a cellular level stage, which includes detailed models of cells typical of different depths within the zzso and a tissue model, which zzso electrical properties obtained from the cellular zzso The fit between the zzso and measured zzso zzso and the distribution of current with depth depends on the zzso model zzso Both the properties of the basement membrane and the presence of a surface zzso layer are shown to have a significant zzso The best fit with measured data is obtained when a 10 zzso thick, zzso surface layer is included in the tissue zzso
