Deep zzso zzso are large periodic breathing maneuvers that regulate airway caliber and prevent airway obstruction in zzso This study characterized the intrinsic response of the intact airway to zzso isolated from zzso attachments and other in zzso zzso zzso isolated zzso segments were zzso with zzso and subjected to zzso pressures of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with single zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breathing was ceased after zzso in a subset of airways and in control airways in which no zzso was zzso zzso zzso area was measured using a fiber-optic zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced less zzso than zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso duration were not significant zzso zzso after zzso followed a zzso zzso function to zzso airway caliber with time zzso between zzso and zzso zzso However, when tidal breathing was ceased after zzso further zzso occurred within zzso This response was identical in both the presence and absence of zzso zzso We conclude that the normal zzso response to zzso occurs as a result of the direct mechanical effects of zzso on activated zzso in the airway zzso Further zzso occurs by altering the airway wall stress following zzso demonstrating the importance of continual transient strains in maintaining airway zzso
