zzso of the rat zzso zzso system by injection of zzso zzso lead to abnormal zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso motor loop similar to that found in Parkinson's disease zzso In the zzso motor loop the zzso nucleus zzso represents an important structure, which, however, also comprises areas of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We were interested whether zzso activity would differ between the zzso zzso zzso and lateral motor part, and whether selective zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the entrance region of the zzso motor loop, would differently affect these zzso In male zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle zzso zzso 10) was zzso injected in the zzso zzso Four weeks later zzso zzso activity and local field zzso were recorded in zzso and lateral zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso rats the discharge rate and burst activity were higher in the lateral compared to the zzso zzso Similar differences were found for other zzso activity measures zzso of variation of zzso zzso zzso zzso approximate zzso After zzso injection zzso burst activity was zzso while the discharge rate was not zzso In addition, in zzso rats zzso zzso activity was zzso with no difference between zzso zzso We found important differences of zzso activity between zzso zzso indicating functional zzso However, selective zzso zzso of the zzso zzso also had a pronounced effect on the zzso zzso zzso indicating interaction between zzso zzso
