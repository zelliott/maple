zzso wave imaging techniques employed for structural health monitoring zzso can be zzso zzso especially for zzso techniques such as minimum zzso zzso response zzso imaging, which requires a zzso inversion for each zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown in previous work to improve guided wave imaging zzso The use of instantaneous zzso has the additional benefit of significantly reducing the zzso requirements of image zzso This paper derives a zzso for zzso imaging using instantaneous zzso and shows that the zzso inversion associated with zzso imaging can be zzso reducing the zzso complexity to that of conventional zzso imaging zzso Additionally, a zzso approach is presented for implementing guided wave imaging zzso including zzso imaging, in zzso software zzso The improvements in zzso efficiency are zzso by measuring zzso time for different array sizes, zzso zzso and imaging zzso
