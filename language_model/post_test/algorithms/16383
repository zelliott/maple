zzso cancer zzso is virtually incurable with current zzso zzso We used the novel zzso zzso approach for in zzso drug discovery and identified zzso and zzso zzso both zzso as agents with zzso activity in human zzso zzso Because even highly effective zzso is unlikely to cure most patients with zzso and zzso is undergoing clinical trials in other tumor types, we sought to develop the basis for use of zzso in rational combination with other agents in zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate in 40 human zzso cancer cells that the in zzso zzso profile for zzso zzso with that of zzso and compares favorably to that of standard of care zzso Using zzso patterns of synthetic zzso of zzso with open reading frame zzso in budding zzso we determined that combining zzso with a zzso could provide mechanistically rational zzso To determine the zzso relevance of these zzso findings, we evaluated zzso zzso and in zzso combination with zzso in human zzso cancer in the in zzso hollow fiber zzso and observed zzso By applying zzso to gene expression data from 40 zzso cancer cell lines and 30 human tumors with associated clinical response data to zzso chemotherapy, we provide evidence that signatures of zzso sensitivity exist within zzso to this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides rational combinations with zzso and tumor zzso signatures that can be used to select zzso cancer patients for clinical trials with this zzso
