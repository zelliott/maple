The correlation zzso is a fundamental statistic that is used in many zzso For example, zzso a collaborative filtering system, uses the correlation between users for zzso zzso Since the correlation is a natural similarity measure between users, the correlation zzso may be used in the Gram zzso in kernel zzso However, the estimated correlation zzso sometimes has a serious zzso although the correlation zzso is originally positive zzso the estimated one may not be positive zzso when not all ratings are zzso To obtain a positive zzso correlation zzso the nearest correlation zzso problem has recently been studied in the fields of zzso analysis and zzso However, statistical properties are not explicitly used in such zzso To obtain a positive zzso correlation zzso we assume the approximate zzso By using the model, an estimate is obtained as the optimal point of an zzso problem formulated with information on the zzso of the estimated correlation zzso The problem is solved by a convex zzso zzso zzso A penalized likelihood approach is also zzso The zzso data set is used to test our zzso
