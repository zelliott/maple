In this paper, we propose a new class of cellular zzso based on the modification of its state zzso It is introduced to model a zzso which is exposed to an zzso We zzso the zzso as extension and projection processes of its state space and resulting zzso of the zzso This is motivated to zzso the role of an environment into the system itself, which naturally zzso zzso internal zzso rather than the usual external zzso zzso this structure into the elementary cellular zzso we characterized its effect by means of input zzso and power spectral zzso As a result, the cellular zzso with this structure showed robust class IV behavior and a zzso power spectrum in a wide range of rule space comparative to the notion of the edge of zzso
