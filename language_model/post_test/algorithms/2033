In most countries with large drug resistant tuberculosis epidemics, only those cases that are at highest risk of having zzso receive a drug sensitivity test zzso at the time of zzso Because of this zzso testing, identification of zzso transmission hotspots in communities where zzso cases do not receive zzso is challenging, as any observed zzso of zzso may reflect systematic differences in how testing is distributed in zzso We introduce a new disease mapping method, which estimates this missing information through zzso locations, to identify geographic areas of increased risk of zzso zzso We apply this method to routinely collected data from two districts in zzso Peru over three consecutive zzso This method identifies an area in the eastern part of zzso where previously zzso cases have increased risk of zzso This may indicate an area of increased transmission of drug resistant disease, a finding that may otherwise have been missed by routine analysis of zzso zzso The risk of zzso among zzso cases is also highest in these probable transmission zzso though a high level of zzso among zzso cases is present throughout the study zzso zzso potential zzso resistant tuberculosis zzso transmission hotspots may allow for targeted investigation and deployment of zzso
