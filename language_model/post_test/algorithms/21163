In the present work, zzso zzso zzso of zzso was performed during a zzso zzso infusion in monkey brain (six zzso It is shown that zzso zzso labeling occurs significantly faster at higher diffusion zzso for zzso in position zzso and more markedly for zzso in position zzso This demonstrates the existence of different diffusion compartments for zzso associated with different zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso enrichment zzso suggests that these compartments might be gray and white matter, each having a specific zzso metabolism rate possibly paralleled by a specific zzso diffusion zzso
