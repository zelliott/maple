In this study, we aimed to improve the performance of a zzso system based on zzso fusion by introducing additional information about the walking zzso zzso zzso were first designed to identify a lower limb zzso user's locomotion mode based on zzso signals recorded from residual leg muscles and ground reaction forces measured from the prosthetic zzso Nine zzso amputees who wore a passive zzso knee or powered prosthetic knee participated in this zzso Information about the walking terrain was simulated and modeled as prior probability based on the principle of maximum zzso and integrated into the zzso functions of the zzso When the correct prior knowledge of walking terrain was zzso the zzso accuracy for each locomotion mode significantly increased and no task transitions were zzso In addition, simulated incorrect prior knowledge did not significantly reduce system performance, indicating that our design is robust against noisy and imperfect prior zzso Furthermore, these observations were independent of the type of zzso zzso The promising results in this study may assist the further development of an zzso zzso system for zzso recognition for powered lower limb zzso or zzso
