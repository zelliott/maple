Many protein engineering problems involve finding zzso that produce proteins with a particular zzso zzso active learning is an attractive approach to discover desired biological zzso Traditional active learning techniques have been zzso to zzso improve zzso zzso not to quickly discover biologically significant zzso We report here a novel active learning technique, Most zzso Positive zzso which is tailored to biological problems because it seeks novel and zzso positive zzso zzso active learning differs from traditional active learning methods in two ways: zzso it zzso seeks Positive zzso zzso zzso and zzso it may be effectively extended to select gene regions suitable for high zzso zzso zzso We applied zzso to discover zzso in the tumor zzso protein zzso that reactivate zzso zzso found in human zzso This is an important biomedical goal because zzso zzso have been implicated in half of all human zzso and restoring active zzso in tumors leads to tumor zzso zzso found Positive zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso using zzso fewer experiments than traditional zzso active learning, with only a minor decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso to in zzso zzso yielded immediate Positive zzso Ten different zzso zzso found in human zzso were paired in zzso with all possible single zzso acid rescue zzso from which zzso was used to select a Positive Region predicted to be enriched for zzso cancer rescue zzso In zzso zzso showed that the predicted Positive zzso zzso had significantly more zzso new strong cancer rescue zzso than control regions zzso and zzso active zzso zzso had slightly more new strong cancer rescue zzso than an Expert region selected for purely biological zzso and zzso rescued for the first time the previously zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso
