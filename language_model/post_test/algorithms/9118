zzso the zzso of the zzso deficient zzso knees, during different zzso activities and muscle contraction patterns, can improve our understanding of the zzso altered zzso due to zzso zzso as well as the efficacy and safety of the zzso zzso 

Twenty-five male volunteers, including 11 normal and 14 unilateral zzso subjects, participated in this zzso The zzso of the injured knees of the zzso subjects was compared with their intact knees and the healthy group during passive zzso and zzso leg press with the knees zzso from full extension to zzso zzso with zzso zzso An accurate registration zzso was used to obtain the three zzso zzso zzso from magnetic resonance zzso 

The zzso zzso mainly altered the zzso anterior translation, and to some extent its internal zzso with the change in other parameters not zzso During leg press, the anterior translation of the zzso knees was significantly larger than that of the normal knees at zzso zzso but not at zzso zzso of the anterior translations of the zzso knees during leg press with that of the passive zzso revealed improved consistency zzso changed from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso respectively), but considerable larger translations zzso increased by zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The simultaneous contraction of the zzso and zzso during leg press, although reduces the knee zzso cannot compensate for the loss of the zzso to restore the normal zzso of the joint, at least during early zzso
