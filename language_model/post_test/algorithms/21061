In zzso target motion during treatment delivery can be managed either by motion inclusive margins or by gating or tracking based on zzso target position zzso If zzso zzso markers are used the required three-dimensional zzso target position signal for gating or tracking can be obtained by simultaneous acquisition of two zzso images from different zzso However, most treatment machines do not have such zzso imaging zzso zzso the zzso target position may be estimated with a single zzso zzso zzso although it only provides the projected target position in the two dimensions of the zzso zzso In this study, we developed a zzso method to estimate the unresolved motion component parallel to the zzso axis from the projected zzso A zzso zzso probability density was assumed for the target zzso zzso of the target into a certain point on the zzso means that it is located on the ray line that connects this point with the focus point of the zzso zzso The zzso probability density along this line was calculated from the zzso probability density and its expectation value was used as the estimate for the unresolved zzso The mathematical framework of the method was developed including zzso expressions for the estimated unresolved component as a function of resolved components and for the zzso zzso Use of the method was demonstrated for prostate in a simulation study of zzso zzso First, the required zzso probability density was constructed as a population average from a data set consisting of 536 continuous prostate position tracks from 17 patients recorded at 10 zzso Next, zzso imaging at a fixed imaging angle and imaging frequency was simulated for each prostate zzso zzso zzso prostate tracks were constructed from the simulated projection images by the proposed method and compared with the actual tracks in order to determine the zzso zzso zzso The simulations were performed with imaging angles in the range from 0 degrees to 180 degrees zzso to zzso and imaging zzso in the range from zzso s zzso to continuous zzso to 600 s zzso to no zzso zzso For comparison, simulations were also performed with zzso imaging, where perfect position determination in all three directions was zzso and with zzso imaging without zzso of the unresolved motion, where the motion component along the zzso axis was assumed to be zzso For continuous imaging, the accuracy of zzso imaging was limited by the uncertainty in the unresolved position zzso The resulting zzso zzso error for the population corresponded closely to the theoretically derived zzso zzso The zzso did not improve the accuracy of lateral zzso imaging, but it reduced the population zzso error from zzso zzso to zzso zzso for vertical zzso This improvement was most prominent for outlying tracks with large unresolved zzso zzso imaging was clearly superior to zzso imaging for high frequency zzso For less frequent imaging, the accuracy of both zzso and zzso imaging decreased due to target motion between zzso Since this was most prominent for zzso imaging, the difference in accuracy between zzso and zzso imaging decreased with increasing imaging zzso In conclusion, a method for zzso of the zzso target position from zzso projections has been developed and its use has been demonstrated in a simulation study of zzso prostate zzso
