We demonstrate the capability to control the ripple zzso on zzso zzso films by applying temporally delayed zzso double zzso It is shown that there is a characteristic pulse separation time for which one can switch from low- to zzso zzso ripple zzso zzso are interpreted based on the relation of the characteristic delay time with the zzso relaxation time of the zzso Our results indicate that zzso pulse shaping can be zzso used as a mean to control the periodic zzso formation and thus the outcome of laser assisted zzso process, which is desirable for the applications of zzso transparent zzso
