zzso distances between 1 zzso and zzso zzso are measured by continuous wave zzso and zzso electron zzso resonance zzso methods for a series of zzso zzso The upper distance limit for measuring zzso zzso by the broadening of the CW spectrum and the lower distance limit for the present zzso double electron electron resonance zzso zzso are determined and found to be both around zzso zzso The methods for determining distances and corresponding zzso from CW spectral line broadening are reviewed and further zzso Also, the work shows that a correction factor is required for the analysis of zzso distances below approximately 2 zzso for zzso zzso and this is calculated using the density zzso zzso
