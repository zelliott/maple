zzso zzso operations can be very useful to zzso the zzso relationship of gene orders representing zzso We study the problem of finding potential ancestral gene orders for the gene orders of given zzso such that the corresponding zzso scenario has a minimal number of zzso and where each of the zzso has to preserve the common intervals of the given input gene zzso Common intervals identify sets of genes that occur zzso in all input gene zzso The problem of finding such an ancestral gene order is called the preserving reversal median problem zzso A zzso data structure for the representation of the common intervals of all input gene orders is used in our exact zzso zzso for solving the zzso It is known that the minimum number of zzso to transform one gene order into another can be zzso in zzso time, whereas the corresponding problem with the restriction that common intervals should not be destroyed is already zzso It is shown theoretically that zzso can solve a large class of zzso instances in zzso zzso zzso we show the good performance of zzso on biological and artificial zzso
