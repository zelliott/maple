An ideal hearing aid for a peripheral hearing loss would process the incoming signal in order to give a perfect match between the cochlear zzso of the impaired ear and a reference normal zzso As a first step toward this objective, a model of the normal and impaired peripheral auditory system was used to derive the optimal hearing-aid processing filter based on a minimum zzso error zzso The auditory model includes the zzso and suppression effects of the cochlear mechanics and the sensitivity of the neural zzso zzso zzso assumptions were then incorporated into the processing to yield a practical zzso zzso gain zzso zzso examples of several individual speech sounds are presented for a flat hearing loss, and the results indicate that a zzso zzso system with adjustable gains and band edges will be close to the optimal solution for this zzso
