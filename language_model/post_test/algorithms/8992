We present a zzso network model for predicting the outcome of in zzso zzso zzso The problem is characterized by a particular zzso process; we propose a simple but effective averaging approach which improves zzso estimates compared to the traditional zzso zzso We present results with generated data and the analysis of a real data zzso Moreover, we assess by means of a simulation study the effectiveness of the model in supporting the selection of the zzso to be zzso
