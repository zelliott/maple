This article concerns one of the most important problems of zzso zzso zzso based on Steady State Visual zzso zzso zzso that is the selection of the zzso most suitable zzso for zzso Previous works related to this problem were done either with measuring systems that have little in common with actual zzso systems zzso single flashing zzso or were presented on a small number of subjects, or the tested frequency range did not cover a broad zzso Their results indicate a strong zzso response around 10 zzso in the range zzso zzso and at high zzso in the band of zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso stimulation with zzso from various ranges are zzso The zzso are often adapted for each user zzso The selection of these zzso however, was not yet justified in quantitative zzso study with proper statistical account for zzso zzso The aim of this study is to determine the zzso response curve, that is, the magnitude of the evoked signal as a function of zzso The zzso response was induced in conditions as close as possible to the actual zzso system, using a wide range of zzso zzso zzso in step of 1 zzso The data were obtained for 10 zzso zzso zzso for individual subjects and the population curve was zzso zzso analysis were conducted both on the level of individual subjects and for the zzso The main result of the study is the identification of the optimal range of zzso which is zzso zzso for the registration of zzso zzso The applied criterion of zzso was: to find the largest zzso range of zzso yielding the strong and zzso zzso zzso
