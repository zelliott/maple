zzso zzso is a common problem in zzso and other zzso However, it remains a great challenge to engineer proteins for enhanced zzso because our knowledge of protein zzso is still very zzso In this paper, we present a comparative study of proteins from bacteria with zzso (AP) and neutral zzso zzso using an integrated statistical and machine learning zzso We construct a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs and calculate a total of zzso sequence based features for these zzso The zzso alignments of these zzso pairs are used to build a zzso substitution propensity zzso between zzso and zzso We use zzso importance provided by the Random Forest zzso to rank the relative importance of these zzso A scoring function using the 10 most significant features is developed and zzso using a hill climbing zzso The accuracy of the score function is zzso in predicting zzso zzso pairs and is zzso in predicting zzso zzso pairs, suggesting that there are significant differences between zzso and zzso which can be used to predict relative zzso of zzso The overall trends uncovered in the study can be used as general guidelines for designing zzso zzso To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic comparative study of the zzso proteins and their zzso zzso
