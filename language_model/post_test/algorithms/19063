zzso connectivity of the brain has been studied by analyzing correlation differences in time courses among seed zzso or regions with other zzso of the brain in healthy individuals as well as in patients with brain zzso The spatial extent of strongly temporally coherent brain regions zzso during rest has also been examined using independent component analysis zzso However, the weaker zzso relationships among zzso component time courses, which we zzso define as a measure of functional network connectivity zzso have not yet been zzso In this study, we propose an approach for evaluating zzso and apply it to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data collected from persons with schizophrenia and healthy zzso We examined the connectivity and zzso among zzso component time courses to test the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia would show increased functional connectivity and increased lag among resting state networks compared to zzso zzso state zzso data were collected and the zzso among seven selected resting state networks zzso using group zzso were evaluated by zzso each zzso zzso time courses with one zzso Patients showed higher correlation than controls among most of the dominant resting state zzso Patients also had slightly more zzso in functional connectivity than zzso We present a novel approach for zzso functional connectivity among brain networks identified with spatial zzso zzso differences between patient and control connectivity in different networks were revealed possibly reflecting deficiencies in cortical processing in zzso
