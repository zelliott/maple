zzso models have proven to be very useful for studying zzso zzso We consider the fractional zzso model (also called zzso zzso to study both the relaxation function and creep zzso The zzso results are compared with the known experimental results of the human brain tissue to obtain the best fit and brain mechanical zzso The results are also compared to the zzso zzso model and zzso zzso model, indicating that the zzso fractional model gives a substantially better fit for the all experimental zzso
