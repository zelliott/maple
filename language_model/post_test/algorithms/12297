We claim and present arguments to the effect that a large class of zzso learning zzso that are essentially local and can be framed as kernel learning zzso will suffer from the curse of zzso at the dimension of the true underlying zzso This observation invites an exploration of zzso zzso learning zzso that attempt to discover shared structure in the zzso planes at different zzso A training criterion for such an zzso is proposed, and experiments zzso a zzso plane prediction function are zzso showing its advantages with respect to local zzso learning zzso it is able to zzso very far from training data (on learning handwritten character image zzso where local zzso methods zzso
