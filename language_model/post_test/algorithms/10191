The spatial distribution of synaptic zzso on the zzso tree of a zzso can have significant influence on zzso zzso zzso accurate anatomical reconstructions of zzso zzso and synaptic zzso are critical when modeling and predicting zzso responses of individual zzso Historically, generation of three-dimensional zzso zzso reconstructions together with comprehensive mapping of synaptic zzso has been an extensive task requiring manual identification of putative synaptic contacts directly from tissue samples or digital zzso Recent developments in zzso tracing software applications have improved the speed and accuracy of zzso zzso but zzso of synaptic sites through the use of zzso and/or zzso markers has remained largely a manual zzso To address this problem, we have developed an algorithm, based on zzso distance zzso between putative zzso terminals and the zzso zzso to automate synaptic contact detection on zzso of individually labeled zzso from zzso zzso image zzso In this study, the zzso is implemented with custom routines in zzso and its effectiveness is evaluated through analysis of primary sensory zzso terminals on motor zzso zzso of zzso parameters enabled automated identification of synaptic contacts that matched those identified by manual inspection with low zzso of zzso zzso time savings and the elimination of zzso in contact detection introduced by different users are significant advantages of this zzso
