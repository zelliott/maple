Surface zzso are important geometric features for the zzso analysis and detection of zzso in CT zzso zzso However, the general kernel approach for zzso zzso can yield erroneous results for small zzso and for zzso that lie on zzso zzso Those erroneous zzso will reduce the performance of zzso zzso This paper presents an analysis of zzso effect on zzso zzso for thin structures and its application on zzso detection of small zzso in zzso 

The authors demonstrated that a simple technique, image zzso can improve the accuracy of zzso zzso for thin structures and thus significantly improve the sensitivity of small zzso detection in zzso 

Our experiments showed that the merits of zzso included more accurate zzso values for simulated data, and isolation of zzso near folds for clinical zzso After testing on a large clinical data set, it was observed that sensitivities with zzso zzso zzso and cubic zzso zzso significantly improved the sensitivity for small zzso zzso 

The image zzso can improve the accuracy of zzso zzso for thin structures and thus improve the zzso detection of small zzso in zzso
