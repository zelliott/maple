We present, zzso and apply a method to extract the contribution of a zzso of a data set to the global zzso To isolate this contribution, we decompose the flow in the zzso into a potential flow that is induced by the original flow on the boundary and a localized zzso The localized flow is obtained by zzso the potential flow from the original zzso Since the potential flow is free of both divergence and zzso the localized flow retains the original features and captures the zzso flow that contains the local contribution of the considered zzso to the global zzso In the remainder of the paper, we describe an zzso on zzso zzso in both two and three dimensions for steady and unsteady flow zzso We discuss the application of some widely used feature extraction methods on the localized flow and describe applications like zzso detection using the potential zzso Finally, we show that our zzso is robust and zzso by applying it to various flow data sets and giving performance zzso
