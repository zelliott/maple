Recent experiments have shown that the zzso of organisms such as worm, fly, human, and mouse zzso hundreds of zzso zzso Many of these zzso are thought to regulate the zzso expression of other genes by binding to partially complementary sites in zzso zzso zzso and expression analysis suggests an important role of zzso during zzso zzso it is of fundamental importance to identify zzso zzso However, no experimental or zzso zzso method for target site identification in animals has been published zzso Our main result is a new zzso method that is designed to identify zzso target zzso This method recovers with high specificity known zzso target sites that have previously been defined zzso Based on these results, we present a simple model for the mechanism of zzso target site zzso Our model incorporates both kinetic and zzso components of target zzso When we applied our method to a set of 74 zzso zzso zzso searching zzso sequences of a zzso set of fly zzso for target sites which were evolutionary zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that many key zzso body patterning genes such as zzso and zzso are likely to be zzso regulated by zzso
