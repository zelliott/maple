The spatial zzso angle has been identified as a strong predictor of adverse cardiac zzso Mean zzso and T zzso from X, Y, and Z leads generated by a zzso transformation method are often used to calculate the zzso angle zzso Many investigators find this procedure zzso We used zzso data files of zzso men and women aged 45 to 65 years from the zzso in Communities study to derive a simple formula for estimated spatial zzso angle zzso zzso is calculated as the inverse zzso between the mean zzso and T zzso which are zzso by 3 zzso and zzso zzso for each zzso zzso explained zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso detected zzso wide zzso values with a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso It is concluded that this simple method may provide a satisfactory substitute for zzso from the zzso transformation zzso
