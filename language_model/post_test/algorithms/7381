zzso rigidity analysis is an efficient zzso method for zzso flexibility information from static, X-ray zzso protein zzso zzso and bonds are modeled as a mechanical structure and analyzed with a fast zzso algorithm, producing a decomposition of the flexible zzso into interconnected rigid zzso The result depends critically on zzso atomic zzso primarily on how hydrogen bonds and zzso interactions are zzso and zzso zzso research points to the stringent need for zzso rigidity analysis software systems, towards the goal of increasing their accuracy and zzso their results, either against each other and against biologically relevant zzso zzso We propose two new methods for modeling hydrogen bonds and zzso interactions that more accurately reflect a mechanical model, without being zzso more zzso We evaluate them using a novel scoring method, based on the zzso score from the information retrieval literature, which measures how well two cluster zzso zzso 

To evaluate the modeling accuracy of zzso our zzso rigidity analysis system, we use a benchmark data set of 20 zzso each with multiple distinct zzso deposited in the zzso Data zzso zzso zzso for them were previously determined with the zzso method from zzso lab and validated against experimental zzso When zzso default tuning parameters are used, an improvement of the zzso score over a crude baseline is observed in zzso of this zzso With our new modeling options, improvements were observed in over zzso of the proteins in this data zzso We investigate the sensitivity of the cluster decomposition score with case studies on zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

To substantially improve the accuracy of protein rigidity analysis systems, thorough zzso must be performed on all current systems and future zzso We have measured the gain in performance by comparing different modeling methods for zzso zzso We showed that new criteria for modeling hydrogen bonds and zzso interactions can significantly improve the zzso The two new methods proposed here have been implemented and made publicly available in the current version of zzso zzso together with the zzso tools, which can be downloaded from our software's zzso zzso
