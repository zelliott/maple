In chemical kinetic or zzso studies, many mathematical models are zzso with respect to the model zzso This may cause serious problems for zzso zzso A zzso design, which is very popular and effective for linear models, is not so good for zzso models with strong zzso zzso In this article, we compare two zzso criteria applied to a zzso zzso Both of them minimize the volume of the confidence zzso of the zzso zzso uses a linear approximation of the volume, and zzso uses a zzso zzso We zzso the relative design efficiencies and use a zzso zzso measure to zzso the number of observations that reduces the zzso zzso to a specified level and improves the zzso zzso The calculated designs differ significantly, and the zzso design shows increasingly better statistical properties as the zzso zzso We present our results both zzso and as tables of zzso zzso
