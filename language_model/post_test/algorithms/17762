A novel instrumental method for angle and wavelength modulated surface zzso resonance zzso zzso is applied to the problem of spectral selectivity in zzso zzso For transparent zzso zzso zzso data are reduced to a two-dimensional zzso spectrum of resonance wavelength versus incident angle, zzso This spectrum encodes the zzso index zzso zzso of the zzso and illustrates the increased zzso spectral shift per unit zzso change at longer zzso zzso zzso For the absorbing zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso data reduction method is complicated by the way the zzso and zzso spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso models support experimental observations of spectral branching and qualitative fingerprints in the form of zzso zzso and difference zzso zzso zzso zzso plots are zzso
