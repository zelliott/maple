Without proper knowledge of mechanical ventilation effects, physicians can aggravate an existing lung zzso A better understanding of the interaction between zzso and airway tissue during mechanical ventilation will be helpful to physicians so that they can provide appropriate zzso parameters for zzso zzso In this study, a zzso model incorporating the interactions between zzso and airway walls was developed to investigate the effects of airway tissue flexibility on airway pressure and zzso Two flow rates, 30 and 60 zzso from mechanical ventilation were zzso The transient zzso was active inhalation with a constant flow rate and passive zzso zzso showed that airway tissue flexibility decreased airway pressure at zzso sites by approximately zzso and zzso for 30 and 60 zzso respectively, and increased wall zzso stress zzso by approximately zzso and zzso for 30 and 60 zzso zzso The results from the present study suggested that it is very important to consider the interaction between zzso and airway walls when zzso models are zzso zzso of this study help to better zzso how the zzso rate used in mechanical zzso in conjunction with airway tissue flexibility, affects airway pressure and zzso
