In zzso zzso Imaging, image contrast and resolution are position zzso The objective of this work was to characterize the contrast and resolution of an zzso system at a multitude of locations within the imaging plane, then compare the reconstructions of different targets using filtered back projection and zzso reconstruction zzso zzso varied significantly with depth and minimally with lateral position, while resolution varied significantly with lateral position and minimally with zzso The zzso reconstruction zzso was robust against ring and streak zzso The back projection reconstructions suffered from artifacts related to a lack of projection zzso
