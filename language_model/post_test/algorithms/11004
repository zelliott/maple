zzso the zzso properties of soft zzso is essential for the diagnosis of many cardiovascular diseases such as zzso In these zzso it is widely agreed that the zzso wall zzso is an indicator of zzso The present paper focuses on the carotid artery and proposes a new inversion methodology for zzso the zzso properties of the wall from zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso We address this problem by zzso a cost function defined as the distance between the modeled zzso signals and the measured zzso zzso this cost function yields the unknown zzso properties of both the zzso wall and the surrounding zzso The sensitivity of the identified properties to various sources of uncertainty is zzso zzso of the method is performed on a rubber zzso The elastic zzso identified using the developed methodology lies within a mean error of zzso It is then applied to two young healthy subjects as a proof of practical zzso with identified values of 625 zzso and 587 zzso for one of the carotid of each zzso
