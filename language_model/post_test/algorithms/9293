zzso zzso zzso zzso is a powerful solution technique for the study of protein secondary zzso As zzso zzso zzso analyses of high quality zzso zzso radiation circular zzso zzso spectral data can be separated into structural groups based solely on spectral information, the technique can potentially be improved to more accurately determine secondary structures and monitor zzso changes in zzso Secondary structure estimates can be determined through use of reference zzso of circular zzso zzso from proteins with determined crystal zzso As with any empirical method, the zzso of the analyses are dependent upon how closely the reference zzso characteristics match those of the protein to be zzso To date, zzso proteins have not been well zzso by CD because existing reference zzso do not contain good representations of their structural zzso This work describes a zzso specific reference zzso zzso which was created solely for the study of zzso secondary zzso zzso accuracy was assessed for the new zzso using several zzso zzso and it was found to substantially outperform existing more general reference zzso
