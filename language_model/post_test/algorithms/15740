The structure and dynamics of the water zzso peptides and proteins are examined here at atomic resolution via molecular dynamics zzso zzso zzso density and residence time data for all 20 zzso acids in an zzso AXA zzso motif are zzso In addition, the zzso of the protein zzso inhibitor 2 is investigated as a point of zzso zzso on the surface of proteins are not zzso they interact both locally and zzso in sequence space, and comparison of the zzso properties of each zzso acid in both the zzso and protein allow us to distinguish inherent zzso properties from zzso zzso due to neighboring zzso This work moves beyond traditional zzso distribution functions and presents zzso representations of preferential zzso and orientation of water by side chains and the main zzso The combination of zzso zzso of simulation data improves the statistical sampling over previous studies and reveals the significance of bridging water molecules that stabilize and mediate side zzso chain, side zzso chain and main zzso chain interactions at the zzso zzso
