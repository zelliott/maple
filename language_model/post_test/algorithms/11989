The generalized additive model is extended to handle negative zzso zzso The extension is complicated by the fact that the negative zzso distribution has two parameters and is not in the exponential zzso The methodology is applied to data involving DNA zzso counts and smoking variables among zzso with lung zzso A more detailed investigation is made of the zzso relationship between the number of zzso and years since quitting while retaining a smooth relationship between zzso and the other zzso
