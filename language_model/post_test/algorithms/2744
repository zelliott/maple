Since the discovery that, despite the active site complexity, only three gene products suffice to obtain active zzso zzso significant light has been shed on this zzso Both the source of the CO and zzso zzso to iron and the assembly site of the zzso zzso are known, and an zzso structure of zzso has been published zzso However, the nature of the zzso for the synthesis of the bridging zzso zzso to the zzso remains to be zzso From both zzso and model chemistry, it is predicted that an zzso function in this zzso plays a central role in zzso acting as a base in the zzso zzso of zzso
