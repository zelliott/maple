We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso performed well in zzso zzso Assessment of zzso zzso status for zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients can be performed by zzso zzso To establish a testing zzso for zzso zzso status in zzso patients, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso clamp zzso to determine the zzso zzso and zzso to detect the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with zzso were examined by zzso with zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso clamp zzso using zzso or zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso were classified as positive zzso zzso negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso indicating questionable, negative or weak zzso Of these patients, 42 zzso patients received zzso treatment and we analyzed whether expression of zzso zzso proteins was correlated with zzso survival in patients with zzso treated with zzso 

In the 133 samples, positive, negative and zzso results for zzso zzso zzso were observed in 37 patients zzso 85 patients zzso and 11 patients zzso zzso zzso patients showed positive zzso expression by zzso and 35 zzso of these also tested positive in the zzso zzso Of 85 zzso patients by zzso 77 zzso also tested negative in the zzso zzso Of the 11 patients with zzso zzso results, zzso zzso detected zzso zzso in 8 zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of zzso excluding the 11 patients with zzso zzso In zzso patients treated with zzso the zzso survival after the start of zzso treatment was significantly longer in patients with zzso positive expression than in those with zzso and negative expression zzso 

Our results suggest that patients testing positive for zzso zzso by zzso are good candidates for rapid response zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso is a new test for zzso zzso and could be a useful indicator with regard to patient zzso
