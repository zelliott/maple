The synthesis of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and its application for preparation of a zzso optical fiber chemical sensor are zzso The response of the sensor is based on the zzso zzso of zzso by coordination with zzso The zzso zzso sensor shows a linear response toward zzso in the concentration range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a working pH range from zzso to zzso The sensor shows excellent selectivity for zzso over transition metal zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso As a sensing agent, the zzso zzso shows obviously better zzso response characteristics toward zzso compared to zzso zzso or zzso The effect of the composition of the sensor membrane was zzso and the experimental conditions were zzso The sensor has been used for determination of zzso in water zzso
