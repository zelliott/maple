The test method introduced here enables the fatigue test of a brittle material at a stress level that is as high as its ultimate fracture zzso The procedural design of the test eliminates uncertainties that often make interpretation of the results zzso The results, using a statistical analysis, demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are zzso in zzso relevant stress regimes encountered in contemporary zzso artificial heart-valve zzso zzso tests show that the material can withstand zzso stress of zzso cycles at a strain level that equals that of the mean zzso zzso
