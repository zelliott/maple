Systems biology has primarily focused on studying zzso zzso and zzso and their dynamic zzso zzso however, represent only the potential for a biological outcome since the ultimate zzso at the level of the eventually produced zzso is not taken into zzso The emerging field of zzso provides complementary guidance toward an integrated approach to this problem: It allows global profiling of the zzso of a cell, zzso or host and presents information on the actual end points of a zzso A wide range of data collection methods are currently used and allow the extraction of global or zzso zzso zzso The great amount and complexity of data that are collected require zzso analysis techniques, but the increasing amount of work in this field has made zzso analysis programs readily zzso zzso has already shown great potential in drug toxicity studies, disease zzso and zzso and may be integrated with zzso and zzso data in the future to provide in-depth understanding of systems, zzso and their functionally dynamic zzso In this review we discuss the current state of the art of zzso its applications, and future zzso
