zzso image zzso methods often produce zzso of anatomical structures and zzso that require user zzso We present a new method for the correction of zzso zzso Given an initial geometrical mesh, our method zzso automatically identifies the mesh zzso in erroneous regions with zzso zzso It then zzso the mesh by correcting its zzso coordinates with zzso deformation based on local geometrical zzso The key advantages of our method are that: zzso it supports fast user interaction on a single surface rendered zzso zzso zzso its parameters values are fixed to the same value for all zzso zzso it is independent of the initial zzso method, zzso zzso it is zzso to a variety of anatomical structures and zzso Experimental evaluation on 44 initial zzso of kidney and kidney vessels from CT scans show an improvement of zzso and zzso in the average surface distance and the volume overlap error between the initial and the corrected zzso with respect to the zzso
