Assessing the effects of environmental constraints on community structure often relies on methods that consider changes in species functional traits in response to environmental zzso Various zzso have been proposed to measure relevant aspects of community trait composition from different viewpoints and zzso Among these, the zzso mean trait zzso zzso and the zzso zzso have been widely used in ecological research for zzso different zzso of functional composition and zzso zzso changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a zzso zzso zzso in southern Switzerland we show that these two measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community structure, such as the mean and the zzso of functional traits within a given species zzso While zzso can be adequately used to zzso shifts in mean trait values within communities due to environmental selection for certain functional traits, the zzso zzso can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait convergence or divergence compared to a random zzso
