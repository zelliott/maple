A zzso zzso system zzso is proposed to model the unknown dynamic system with zzso and incomplete zzso When compared with the traditional zzso system, the zzso uses a novel zzso zzso function to make a balance among the zzso time, and frequency zzso which achieves a robust modeling performance with poor data zzso The definition, zzso zzso analysis, and zzso of the zzso are presented to construct the whole theoretical zzso zzso studies show that the performance of the proposed zzso is superior to the traditional one in a zzso and incomplete data zzso
