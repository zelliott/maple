The ability to examine the behavior of biological systems in zzso has the potential to greatly accelerate the pace of discovery in diseases, such as stroke, where in zzso analysis is time intensive and zzso In this paper we describe an approach for in zzso examination of responses of the blood zzso to zzso agents and subsequent stroke through the development of dynamic models of the regulatory processes observed in the experimental gene expression zzso First, we identified functional gene clusters from these zzso Next, we derived ordinary differential equations zzso from the data relating these functional clusters to each other in terms of their regulatory influence on one zzso Dynamic models were developed by zzso these zzso into a model that simulates the expression of regulated functional zzso By changing the magnitude of gene expression in the initial input state it was possible to assess the behavior of the networks through time under varying conditions since the dynamic model only requires an initial starting state, and does not require measurement of regulatory influences at each time point in order to make accurate zzso We discuss the implications of our models on zzso in stroke, explore the limitations of the approach, and report that an zzso dynamic model can provide accurate predictions of overall system behavior under several different zzso zzso
