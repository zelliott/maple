The zzso of zzso sites in zzso sequences is a challenging problem in large-scale zzso zzso The intense neutral loss zzso and the coexistence of multiple zzso and/or zzso zzso are limiting factors for zzso scoring site patterns across thousands of zzso Various zzso approaches for zzso site zzso have been proposed, including zzso zzso Delta score, and zzso yet few address direct zzso of the false zzso rate zzso in each zzso Here we propose zzso a modified zzso approach that uses mass accuracy and peak zzso for site zzso scoring and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is a difficult task at the zzso level because the degree of uncertainty in zzso varies significantly across different zzso zzso carries out simultaneous zzso on all candidate sites in each zzso and estimates the zzso based on the zzso zzso where decoy zzso generated by placing artificial zzso on zzso zzso compete with the zzso zzso zzso also reports approximate zzso confidence scores for all candidate sites as a means to zzso additional sites from zzso peptides in which zzso can be partially zzso Unlike the existing tools, zzso is compatible with any search engine output processed through the zzso zzso We evaluated the performance of zzso in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy of zzso estimates using two synthetic zzso libraries and a zzso zzso generated from complex mouse brain zzso
