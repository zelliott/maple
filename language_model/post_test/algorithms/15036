A method for the zzso of medium rate transitions of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The method is zzso to such zzso dynamics that are between zzso fast transitions for which zzso procedures are used and zzso slow transitions for which zzso filters work zzso The zzso of the transition dynamics is based on a novel zzso zzso zzso This model belongs to the class of deterministic zzso zzso zzso models and its zzso allows only simultaneous transitions in all zzso zzso Data from 22 patients was zzso The performance of the method is first evaluated with realistic simulations of known transition dynamics and it is shown to be able to track zzso zzso The method is then applied to the zzso of the dynamics of event related zzso It is shown that the proposed method is able to estimate the transitions which are less apparent, such as from a zzso zzso
