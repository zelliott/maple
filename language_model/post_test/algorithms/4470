Respiratory motion during zzso acquisition can cause zzso and zzso in calculation of standardized zzso values zzso Our aim was to compare the detection and characterization of zzso zzso on zzso with and without a zzso zzso 

We studied 15 patients with suspected pulmonary zzso who underwent clinical zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso CT, the whole chest of the patient was scanned in 15 s at the end of deep zzso For zzso zzso patients were asked to hold their breath 9 times for zzso zzso One zzso reviewed images, aiming to detect and characterize zzso zzso and skeletal zzso Clinical CT and zzso CT were compared for number, size, and location of zzso zzso zzso were compared between clinical PET and zzso zzso Images were also visually assessed for accuracy of fusion and zzso 

All patients had zzso on clinical CT and zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso CT detected more zzso than clinical CT in 13 of 15 patients zzso The total number of lung zzso detected increased from 53 with clinical CT to 82 with zzso CT zzso Eleven patients showed a total of 31 zzso with abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso had the advantage of reducing zzso and permitted a better zzso of sites with zzso zzso A higher zzso was noted in 22 of 31 zzso on zzso PET compared with clinical zzso with an average increase in zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso enabled an increased detection and better characterization of zzso zzso compared with a standard zzso zzso in addition to more precise zzso and zzso of the zzso The technique is easy to implement in clinical practice and requires only a minor increase in the examination zzso
