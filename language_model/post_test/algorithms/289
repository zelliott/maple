zzso and stability criteria for harmonic zzso modes were derived for two zzso pulse coupled zzso based on their first and second order phase zzso zzso Our theoretical methods are general in the sense that no assumptions about the strength of zzso type of synaptic zzso and model are zzso These methods were then tested using two zzso zzso Wang and zzso model zzso The existence of bands of zzso zzso zzso and zzso phase zzso in the relative frequency zzso space was predicted correctly, as was the phase of the slow zzso spike within the cycle of the fast zzso in which it zzso For weak zzso the bands are very narrow, but strong zzso zzso the zzso The predictions of the pulse coupled method agreed with weak zzso methods in the weak zzso regime, but extended predictability into the strong zzso zzso We show that our prediction method zzso to pairs of neural zzso coupled through zzso zzso and to networks of multiple zzso zzso The main limitation of the method is the central assumption that the effect of each input dies out before the next input is zzso
