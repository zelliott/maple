A molecular modeling strategy is proposed to describe the temperature zzso dependence of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso which exhibit zzso transition zzso The commercial zzso zzso is used to support the zzso simulations of the zzso The temperature dependence behavior of zzso for the zzso is modeled by running molecular dynamics zzso simulation at temperatures ranging from 250 up to 650 zzso Comparing the MD predicted zzso value at zzso K and the glass transition temperature zzso of the zzso determined from zzso curve with the experimental value confirm the accuracy of our zzso The MD modeled relationship between zzso and T agrees well with the previous theoretical zzso We also observe the specific volume zzso cohesive energy zzso cohesive energy density zzso and zzso shows a similar temperature dependence characteristics and a drastic change around the zzso Meanwhile, the applications of zzso and its temperature dependence property are addressed and zzso
