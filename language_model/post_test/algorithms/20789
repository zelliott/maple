zzso are presented for zzso the design of Mueller zzso zzso and and in particular selecting the zzso and orientation angles of polarization components to ensure accurate reconstruction of a zzso Mueller zzso in the presence of error zzso zzso related to the condition number and to the singular value decomposition are used to guide the design process for Mueller zzso zzso with the goal of specifying polarization zzso comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for known error zzso The use of these metrics is illustrated with analyses of two example zzso a dual rotating zzso zzso and a dual variable zzso zzso
