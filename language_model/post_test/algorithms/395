The early diagnosis of zzso diabetic zzso zzso a common complication of diabetes that damages the zzso is crucial to the protection of the vision of diabetes zzso The onset of zzso is signaled by the appearance of zzso zzso Such zzso nets might be identified using retinal vessel extraction zzso The commonly used matched filter methods often produce false positive zzso of zzso nets due to their zzso to detect zzso edges as well as zzso In this paper, we propose a modified matched filter for retinal vessel extraction that applies a local vessel zzso analysis using zzso zzso to reduce false responses to zzso zzso Our proposed modified matched filters demonstrated higher true positive rate and lesser false detection than existing zzso schemes in vessel zzso
