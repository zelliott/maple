The zzso trial aimed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso time lengthening in zzso zzso zzso patients zzso paced in zzso pacing zzso 

zzso zzso implanted with zzso zzso programmed in zzso pacing mode, were zzso in two arms for a zzso zzso the low zzso pacing zzso basic rate at 60 zzso dual sensor with minimal slope) and the high zzso pacing zzso basic rate at 70 zzso dual sensor with zzso zzso overdrive zzso zzso At 1 month, crossover was performed for an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso time, zzso block occurrence and zzso zzso time adaptation during exercise were zzso from device memories at each zzso 

zzso zzso participated to the analysis zzso years; 32 zzso zzso zzso bundle branch block zzso zzso history zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso class zzso zzso both zzso The mean zzso zzso time was significantly greater during the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso period zzso Class zzso drugs were the only zzso of this abnormal zzso Degree zzso zzso blocks occurred in 49 % of zzso in the zzso zzso 19 % in the zzso period zzso zzso patients zzso zzso presented a lengthening of zzso zzso time during zzso 

zzso pacing in zzso zzso may induce a significant lengthening of zzso zzso zzso time, including frequent abnormal adaptation of zzso zzso time during zzso
