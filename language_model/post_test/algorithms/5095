An impulsive model of zzso biological control consisting of a general continuous zzso model in ordinary differential zzso zzso a zzso zzso by a discrete part describing periodic introductions of predators is zzso The existence of an zzso periodic solution that zzso to prey zzso is shown and a condition ensuring its global zzso stability is zzso An zzso problem related to the zzso use of zzso biological control is then zzso It is assumed that the per time unit budget of biological control zzso the number of predators to be zzso is fixed and the best deployment of this budget is sought in terms of release zzso The cost function to be zzso is the time needed to reduce an unforeseen prey zzso invasion occurring at a worst time instant under some harmless zzso The analysis shows that the zzso problem admits a zzso infinite number of zzso An argumentation considering the required zzso of the zzso result with respect to the invasive prey population level and to the model parameters is then zzso It is shown that the cost function is decreasing in the zzso release frequency so that the best deployment of the zzso agents is to carry out as frequent introductions as zzso
