In our previous study, we have demonstrated that analyzing the skin zzso measured along the key points of the zzso might be a useful supplementary technique to enhance the diagnosis of spinal zzso injury zzso especially for unconscious and zzso zzso Initially, in order to distinguish between the skin zzso of control group and patients, artificial neural networks zzso were used as the main data zzso zzso However, in the present study, we have proposed two more data zzso approaches, that is, support zzso machine zzso and zzso cluster tree analysis zzso which improved the zzso rate and also the overall zzso A comparison of the performance of these three methods in zzso traumatic zzso patients and controls was zzso The zzso results indicated that zzso analysis based on zzso zzso and zzso achieved higher recognition zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso improved the zzso rate and also the overall performance of zzso zzso
