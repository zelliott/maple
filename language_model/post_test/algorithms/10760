Tight zzso control by intensive insulin therapy has become a key part of critical care and is an important field of study in acute coronary zzso A balance has to be found between frequency of zzso and the risk of zzso Current zzso protocols are zzso and, therefore, rely on simple zzso For safety and efficiency a computer decision support system that employs complex logic may be superior to paper zzso 

We designed and implemented zzso a zzso zzso computer zzso Our zzso of zzso will be released as free zzso Blood zzso values measured by a zzso zzso were automatically retrieved from the central laboratory zzso Additional clinical information was asked from the nurse and the program subsequently advised a new insulin pump rate and zzso sampling zzso 

Implementation of the computer program was zzso and zzso zzso treated 179 patients for a total of zzso zzso Severe zzso zzso zzso zzso only occurred once due to human zzso With a median zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso per day the median percentage of time in which zzso fell in the target range was zzso Nurses rated the program as easy to work with and as an improvement over the preceding paper zzso They reported no increase in time spent on zzso zzso 

A computer driven protocol is a safe and effective means of zzso control at a surgical zzso Future improvements in the recommendation zzso may further improve safety and zzso
