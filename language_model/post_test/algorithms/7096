zzso techniques have been developed and widely used in zzso measurement of blood zzso zzso image zzso zzso which applies a zzso zzso to consecutive zzso images of blood flow has often been employed zzso to its better spatial resolution compared with conventional zzso measurement zzso The zzso technique zzso zzso zzso from red blood cell zzso zzso as flow zzso zzso the intensity and size of such zzso are highly dependent on zzso zzso The zzso intensity of zzso images varies along the zzso direction of blood vessels because of the zzso rate dependence of zzso zzso This zzso distribution of echo zzso decreases the zzso ratio zzso of a zzso analysis and produces zzso zzso In the present study, zzso techniques such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso technique, and zzso of background image zzso method were applied to zzso images to achieve a more accurate zzso zzso A mechanical sector ultrasound scanner was used to obtain ultrasound zzso images from rat blood under steady and zzso zzso The effects of the zzso techniques on zzso analysis were evaluated by comparing image zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso profiles and wall zzso rate zzso obtained from zzso suspension images were compared with the zzso solution for zzso In addition, the zzso techniques were applied to in zzso measurement of blood flow in human zzso The experimental results of both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso show that the intensity zzso in zzso zzso has substantial influence on the zzso zzso The zzso techniques used in this study can minimize errors encountered in ultrasound zzso measurement in which zzso are used as flow zzso instead of zzso contrast zzso
