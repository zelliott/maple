zzso the secondary structure of zzso from the primary structure is a challenging zzso zzso A number of zzso have been developed to predict the secondary structure from the primary zzso It is agreed that there is still room for improvement in each of these zzso In this work we build a zzso model for secondary zzso structure using a zzso tree representation of secondary zzso zzso We model the bonding of two zzso secondary structures to form a larger secondary structure with a graph operation we call zzso We consider all zzso possibilities using all possible tree zzso both those that are zzso in structure and those that are zzso The resulting data from each tree merge operation is represented by a zzso We use these zzso as input values for a neural network and train the network to recognize a tree as zzso or not, based on the merge data zzso The network estimates the probability of a tree being zzso 

The network correctly assigned a high probability of zzso to trees previously identified as zzso and a low probability of zzso to those classified as not zzso We then used the neural network to predict the zzso of the zzso zzso 

There are a number of secondary zzso structure prediction zzso available zzso These programs are based on finding the secondary structure with the lowest total free zzso In this work, we create a zzso tool for secondary zzso structures using zzso values as input for a neural zzso The use of a graph operation to theoretically describe the bonding of secondary zzso is novel and is an entirely different approach to the prediction of secondary zzso zzso Our method correctly predicted trees to be zzso or not zzso for all known zzso In addition, our results convey a measure of likelihood that a tree is zzso or not zzso Given that the majority of secondary zzso folding zzso return more than one possible outcome, our method provides a means of determining the best or most likely structures among all of the possible zzso
