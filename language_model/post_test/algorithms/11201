A hybrid method for zzso temperature with spatial mapping using diagnostic zzso based on detection of echo shifts from tissue undergoing zzso treatment, is zzso zzso and zzso tracking are two conventional zzso used for detecting echo shifts, but their practical applications are zzso The proposed hybrid method combines the advantages of both zzso with improved accuracy in temperature zzso In zzso experiments were performed on zzso muscle for preliminary validation and temperature zzso In addition, zzso mapping of rabbit thigh muscle in zzso during high-intensity focused ultrasound heating was zzso zzso from the in zzso experiments indicated that the difference between the estimated temperature change by the proposed hybrid method and the actual temperature change measured by the zzso was generally less than zzso when the increase in temperature due to heating was less than zzso For the in zzso study, the area predicted to experience the highest temperature coincided well with the focal point of the high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso The zzso efficiency of the hybrid zzso was similar to that of the fast zzso algorithm, but with an improved zzso The proposed hybrid method could provide an alternative means for zzso monitoring of limited temperature changes during zzso zzso
