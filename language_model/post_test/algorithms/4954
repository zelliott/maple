zzso learning approaches have produced some of the highest reported performances for facial expression zzso However, to date, nearly all automatic facial expression recognition research has focused on zzso performance on a few databases that were collected under controlled lighting conditions on a relatively small number of zzso This paper explores whether current machine learning methods can be used to develop an expression recognition system that operates reliably in more realistic zzso We explore the necessary characteristics of the training data set, image zzso feature zzso and machine learning zzso A new database, zzso is presented which contains pictures, photographed by the subjects themselves, from thousands of different people in many different real-world imaging zzso zzso suggest that zzso expression recognition accuracy in real-life zzso conditions is achievable with machine learning zzso However, the data sets currently used in the automatic expression recognition literature to evaluate progress may be overly constrained and could potentially lead research into locally optimal zzso zzso
