Single zzso transmission zzso zzso offer a new approach for the determination of zzso correction factors zzso in zzso A major drawback of this method is the high fraction of scattered photons in the transmission zzso resulting in a marked zzso of the zzso It was, therefore, the aim of the present work, to evaluate a scatter correction zzso proposed by zzso Watson by means of zzso Carlo zzso 

zzso zzso with a zzso point source were simulated for a zzso PET scanner zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso To examine the scatter fraction zzso in the transmission data, the detected photons were classified as zzso or zzso The simulated data were used to determine zzso the spatial distribution of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso from all detected events zzso and zzso from the zzso events only zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso corrected according to the Watson zzso In addition, density images were reconstructed in order to zzso evaluate linear zzso zzso 

A high correlation was found between the zzso and the zzso zzso For the cylinder and the zzso zzso similar correction factors zzso were zzso The determined values resulted in an accurate scatter correction in both the zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso proposed by Watson allows an accurate correction of scattered radiation in zzso zzso The correction factor zzso can by determined zzso using simple zzso and then applied to more complex zzso zzso zzso should be performed in the zzso mode, in order to increase the total zzso of counts and/or to reduce the measurement zzso
