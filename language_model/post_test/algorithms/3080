The potential of maintaining zzso zzso by zzso balance is zzso A large population of zzso individuals is distributed over zzso many zzso connected by zzso zzso are discrete and zzso selection may vary across zzso and zzso are zzso It is shown that if migration and zzso are strong relative to selection, then with weak or no zzso and intermediate dominance at every locus and in every zzso arbitrarily many zzso can be maintained at arbitrarily many zzso at a stable zzso If migration is weak relative to selection and zzso then with weak or no zzso and intermediate dominance at every locus and in every zzso as many zzso as there are zzso can be maintained at arbitrarily many zzso at zzso In both cases open sets of such zzso combinations are constructed, thus the results are robust with respect to small, but arbitrary, zzso in the zzso For weak migration, the number of zzso is, in fact, a generic upper bound to the number of zzso that can be maintained at any zzso Thus, several scenarios are identified under which zzso zzso can be maintained by zzso balance when this is impossible in a zzso zzso
