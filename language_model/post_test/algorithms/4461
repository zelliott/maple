The goal of this work was to develop an extended ultrasound zzso model that would zzso the zzso between accuracy of the calculation and zzso zzso The zzso are presented for a generalized zzso model, that is center frequency, pulse duration and physical dimensions are all zzso The paper presents a zzso efficient model for zzso circular zzso single element zzso ultrasound zzso Specifically, the goal of the model is to determine the lens effect on the zzso response, both on focusing and on matching acoustic zzso The effective focal distance depends on the lens geometry and refraction index, but also on the near field limit, zzso wavelength and source zzso and on the spectrum bandwidth of the ultrasound zzso The broadband zzso source generated by the zzso was therefore considered in this zzso A new model based on a zzso assumption is presented and the error introduced by this assumption is discussed in terms of its maximum value zzso and mean value zzso The simplified model was based on an extension of the classical zzso model for zzso structures and on the related zzso The zzso of the implemented extended zzso model was evaluated by comparison with finite element zzso itself previously validated zzso for the one-dimensional zzso geometry zzso The pressure field was then zzso using the adequate zzso of the zzso integral for both the extended zzso and finite element zzso The simplified approach based on the zzso model delivered the focused response with good zzso and zzso lower calculation time in comparison with a mode comprehensive zzso zzso The zzso between precision and time thus becomes compatible with an zzso zzso used here for the zzso of the acoustic zzso of the lens for the chosen zzso An experimental comparison was performed and found to be in good agreement with such an extension of the zzso zzso The experiments confirm the accuracy of such a model in a zzso domain up to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso within a relative error of zzso between experiment and zzso This extended zzso model can zzso be used for other zzso zzso satisfying the assumption of a predominantly zzso zzso or in an zzso procedure involving an adequate criteria for a particular zzso
