zzso are commonly used in genetic dissection of complex diseases, particularly for zzso zzso zzso association studies have been advocated as powerful tools for fine mapping and zzso cloning of complex disease zzso zzso methods for zzso zzso using data from relatives were originally developed for pedigree zzso In this study, we proposed a new statistical method for zzso zzso for multiple tightly linked zzso zzso zzso which is tailored for extensively accumulated zzso zzso This new method was implemented via an zzso zzso zzso without the usual assumption of linkage equilibrium among zzso Our zzso zzso does not incur extra zzso burden for zzso zzso using zzso data when compared with using unrelated parental zzso Furthermore, its zzso efficiency is not affected by increasing zzso zzso We examined the zzso and statistical performance of our new method in simulated data created from an empirical zzso data set of human growth hormone gene zzso The utility of our method was illustrated with an application to the analyses of zzso of three candidate genes for zzso
