The emergence of zzso resistance among zzso pathogens has zzso the need for effective infection control zzso The spread of resistant pathogens within hospital settings proceeds along various routes of transmission and is characterized by large fluctuations in zzso which are typical for small zzso Identification of the most important route of colonization zzso by zzso or zzso caused by the selective pressure of zzso is important for the design of optimal infection control zzso Such identification can be based on a combination of zzso surveillance and costly and zzso as well as time-consuming methods of zzso Furthermore, analysis of the effects of interventions is hampered by the natural fluctuations in zzso To overcome these problems, we introduce a mathematical zzso based on a zzso chain zzso The input is zzso prevalence data zzso The output is estimates of the key parameters characterizing the two colonization zzso The zzso is tested on two zzso surveillance data sets of intensive care zzso The quality of the estimates is determined by comparing them to accurate estimates based on additional information obtained by zzso The results warrant optimism that this zzso may help to zzso transmission dynamics and can be used to evaluate the effects of infection control interventions more zzso
