To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso carbon dioxide removal zzso on zzso pressures and zzso ratio in a clinically relevant zzso model of severe respiratory zzso 

zzso was developed as a simple zzso shunt with a commercially available zzso gas exchange device of sufficient surface area for zzso CO2 zzso With an zzso shunt zzso to zzso of cardiac zzso zzso allows a reduction in zzso airway pressures without zzso or the complex zzso and monitoring required for conventional zzso 

zzso was applied to a new, clinically relevant zzso model of severe respiratory failure created by smoke inhalation and zzso flame zzso zzso Adult sheep zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso received a zzso total body surface area, zzso After injury, all animals were placed on zzso mechanical ventilation to achieve zzso zzso 60 zzso and zzso zzso 40 zzso Animals were placed on zzso within 40 to 48 hours of injury when the zzso was zzso Animals underwent zzso of the carotid artery and jugular vein with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso flow was continuously monitored using an zzso flow probe and calculated as a percentage of cardiac zzso 

zzso flows of 800 to 900 zzso zzso to zzso cardiac zzso achieved 77 to 104 zzso of CO2 removal zzso to zzso total CO2 zzso while maintaining zzso zzso reductions in zzso settings were tidal volume, zzso to zzso zzso peak zzso pressure, zzso to zzso zzso zzso minute zzso zzso to zzso zzso respiratory rate, zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso The zzso ratio increased from zzso at baseline to zzso after 72 zzso 

zzso zzso allows zzso CO2 removal and significant reductions in zzso pressures with improvement in the zzso zzso
