zzso of the study was the analysis of powered two-wheeler zzso crashes in Italy in order to detect zzso as well as zzso among crash characteristics and provide insights for the development of safety improvement strategies focused on zzso At this aim, data mining techniques were used to analyze the data relative to the zzso crashes involving zzso occurred in Italy in the period zzso zzso trees analysis and rules discovery were zzso zzso methods are zzso and zzso data mining tools for supervised zzso and zzso zzso They do not require a zzso zzso knowledge about the phenomena under studying and consider conditional interactions among input zzso Rules discovery is the identification of sets of items zzso crash zzso that occur together in a given event zzso a crash in our zzso more often than they would if they were independent of each zzso Thus, the method can detect zzso among crash zzso Due to the large number of patterns considered, both methods suffer from an extreme risk of finding patterns that appear due to chance zzso To overcome this problem, in our study we randomly split the sample data in two data sets and used well-established statistical practices to evaluate the statistical significance of the zzso Both the zzso trees and the rules discovery were effective in providing meaningful insights about zzso crash characteristics and their zzso Even though in several cases different crash characteristics were zzso the results of the two the analysis methods were never zzso Furthermore, most of the findings of this study were consistent with the results of previous studies which used different zzso techniques, such as zzso models of crash injury zzso Basing on the analysis results, engineering zzso and policy initiatives to reduce zzso injuries and fatalities were singled zzso The simultaneous use of zzso trees and association discovery must not, however, be seen as an attempt to supplant other techniques, but as a complementary method which can be integrated into other safety zzso
