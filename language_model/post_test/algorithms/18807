zzso molecular interaction data with existing knowledge of molecular function reveals mechanisms that zzso cellular zzso We present zzso a software tool that zzso a comprehensive analysis suite for functional zzso of zzso zzso takes as input a zzso molecular interaction network and zzso of zzso in the network and provides the user with a set of pathways composed of functional zzso which may be thought of zzso templates in the functional zzso space that recur in various contexts zzso groups of specific molecules with similar functional zzso zzso in the molecular interaction zzso zzso has its zzso in formal statistical measures of significance, and zzso bases for zzso Comprehensive evaluation on the zzso coli zzso regulation and zzso interaction data demonstrate zzso ability to detect known, as well as novel zzso
