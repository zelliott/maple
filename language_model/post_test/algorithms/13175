This work focuses on an improved zzso zzso lattice zzso zzso The model results in zzso equilibrium zzso and is capable of simulating zzso zzso ratios greater than zzso External forces are incorporated into the discrete zzso zzso rather than through an equilibrium zzso shift as in the original zzso and Chen zzso zzso zzso The model also requires the derivation of a momentum zzso effective zzso which is zzso into the equilibrium distribution function and applies to both the zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso is used in the calculation of the zzso interaction forces to reduce the magnitude of zzso currents zzso zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso First, we compare the model to the SC model for zzso bubble zzso We demonstrate that the model results in zzso equilibrium bubble zzso for a wide range of zzso zzso which is not the case for the SC zzso Furthermore, we show that the model is capable of simulating stable bubbles for zzso zzso ratios greater than 1000 (when zzso zzso is zzso whereas the SC model is known to be limited to zzso zzso ratios on the order of zzso Next we verify the model for surface tension via zzso law and show that the model results in the same surface tension values for a range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios of 10, 100, and zzso The model is also verified for layered zzso flow though parallel zzso We show that the simulated zzso profiles preserve continuity at the interface for zzso zzso ratios ranging from zzso to 1000 and that the model accurately predicts zzso and zzso phase relative zzso for zzso zzso ratios of zzso to zzso
