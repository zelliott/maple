In tackling data mining and pattern recognition tasks, finding a compact but effective set of features has often been found to be a crucial step in the overall problem-solving zzso In this paper, we present an empirical study on feature analysis for recognition of classical zzso using machine learning techniques to select and evaluate features extracted from a number of different feature zzso It is revealed that there is significant zzso between and within feature schemes commonly used in zzso Our results suggest that further feature analysis research is necessary in order to zzso feature selection and achieve better results for the instrument recognition zzso
