We propose a novel approach for PET respiratory motion correction using zzso and simultaneous zzso zzso 

We use a zzso acquisition followed by motion tracking in the phase domain to estimate the zzso deformation of biological zzso during zzso In order to accurately estimate motion even in the presence of noise and zzso artifacts, we zzso the traditional zzso tracking strategy using a zzso zzso penalty on neighboring displacement zzso zzso We then incorporate the motion fields estimated with zzso in the system zzso of an zzso PET reconstruction zzso formulated both for zzso and zzso data zzso This approach allows reconstruction of all detected zzso in a single image while modeling the effect of motion both in the zzso and the zzso zzso At present, zzso does not allow zzso of motion in the lungs and our approach is therefore limited to motion correction in soft zzso Since it is difficult to assess the accuracy of motion correction approaches in zzso we evaluated the proposed approach in zzso simulations of simultaneous zzso acquisitions using the zzso zzso We also assessed its practical feasibility in zzso acquisitions of a small zzso phantom that mimics the complex deformation pattern of a lung that we zzso on a combined zzso brain zzso 

zzso showed that the zzso tracking strategy accurately estimated realistic respiratory motion fields for different levels of noise in the zzso zzso In simulations of tumors exhibiting increased zzso contrast zzso was zzso more accurate with motion correction than zzso zzso ratio zzso was more than zzso greater when performing zzso reconstruction which included all counts, compared to when reconstructing only zzso detected in the first of eight gated zzso These results were confirmed in our zzso zzso acquisitions, indicating that our motion correction strategy is accurate, practically zzso and is therefore ready to be tested in zzso 

This work shows that PET motion correction using motion fields measured with zzso in simultaneous zzso acquisitions can be made practical for clinical application and that doing so has the potential to remove motion blur in zzso PET studies of the zzso
