A zzso study of road traffic noise in cities is zzso Based on zzso zzso calculations of zzso zzso an efficient engineering zzso is developed to calculate the effect of multiple reflections in street zzso The zzso is supported by a zzso analysis of the zzso sound fields in the source and receiver zzso Using the algorithm, a simple model for traffic noise in cities is zzso Noise maps and exposure zzso of the city of Amsterdam are calculated with the model, and for comparison also with an engineering model that is currently used for traffic noise impact assessments in zzso zzso differences between the two model predictions are found for zzso buildings with zzso levels of zzso zzso at the zzso Further, an analysis is presented of level differences between the most and the least exposed facades of zzso Large level differences are found for buildings directly exposed to traffic noise from nearby zzso It is shown that by a zzso of traffic flow around these buildings, one can achieve low sound levels at quiet sides and a corresponding reduction in the percentage of highly annoyed inhabitants from typically zzso to zzso
