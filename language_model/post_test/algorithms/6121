An integrated methodology for the detection and removal of cracks on digitized paintings is presented in this zzso The cracks are detected by zzso the output of the zzso zzso zzso Afterward, the thin dark brush strokes which have been misidentified as cracks are removed using either a median zzso basis function neural network on hue and zzso data or a zzso procedure based on region zzso Finally, crack filling using order statistics filters or controlled zzso diffusion is zzso The methodology has been shown to perform very well on digitized paintings suffering from zzso
