To compare the performance of two zzso zzso models, zzso zzso zzso and neural network zzso with five different zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with proven zzso zzso as the only known disease were zzso Clinical and CT data were used for zzso and zzso zzso Both models were developed with zzso zzso and three different zzso zzso The final results of each model were compared with error rate and the area under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

The zzso obtained statistically higher zzso values than zzso with zzso The remaining zzso validation methods did not reveal statistically significant differences between zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso performs better than the one based on zzso This advantage is well detected by zzso zzso but remains unnoticed when zzso or zzso zzso are zzso
