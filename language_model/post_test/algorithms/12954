We applied compressed sensing zzso to spectral domain optical zzso zzso zzso zzso and studied its zzso We tested the zzso reconstruction by randomly zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso We achieved this by applying zzso masks to sample zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso camera zzso zzso images are reconstructed by solving an zzso problem that zzso the zzso norm of a transformed image to enforce zzso subject to data consistency zzso zzso could allow an array detector with fewer zzso to reconstruct high resolution zzso images while reducing the total amount of data required to process the zzso
