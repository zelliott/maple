A retrospective analysis was made to examine appropriateness in the zzso of the zzso effectiveness of zzso zzso using zzso data from clinical trials at the zzso medical accelerator complex zzso at the National Institute of zzso Sciences in zzso zzso 

At zzso relative zzso effectiveness zzso values of therapeutic carbon beams were determined based on experimental results of cell responses, on values expected with the zzso model, and based on experiences with zzso zzso We use fixed zzso values independent of dose levels, although this apparently contradicts zzso zzso Our zzso system depends only on LET of the zzso radiation zzso With this zzso system, over 2,000 patients have been treated by carbon zzso With data from these patients, the local control rate of zzso lung cancer was analyzed to verify the clinical zzso of the carbon zzso The local control rate was compared with rates published by groups from zzso University and Massachusetts General zzso Using a simplified tumor control probability zzso model, clinical zzso values were obtained for different levels of zzso 

For the 50% level of the clinical zzso the zzso values nearly coincide with those for in zzso human zzso zzso cell survival at zzso For the higher levels of clinical zzso the zzso values approach closer to those adapted in clinical trials at zzso
