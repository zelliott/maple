We study a zzso model of processing and learning in the visual cortex, which reflects the anatomy of zzso cortical columns and properties of their zzso receptive zzso Based on recent results on the zzso structure of columns in zzso we model the activity dynamics in zzso of zzso zzso and their interaction with systems of zzso zzso We find that a zzso model based on these aspects of zzso anatomy can give rise to specific types of zzso that result in zzso of zzso to the zzso For a given type of zzso zzso reliably extracts the basic input components represented by zzso receptive zzso zzso is very noise tolerant and can robustly be applied to different types of zzso To zzso analyze the system's component extraction capabilities, we use two standard zzso the bars test and natural zzso In the bars test, the system shows the highest noise zzso reported so zzso If natural image patches are used as zzso zzso results in zzso receptive zzso In quantitative comparison with in zzso zzso we find that the obtained receptive fields capture statistical properties of zzso simple cells that zzso such as independent component analysis or sparse coding do not zzso
