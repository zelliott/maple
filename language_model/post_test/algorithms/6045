We test the possible zzso properties of dominant zzso frequency zzso when a subject tracks a path on a map, either only by eyes zzso movement - zzso or by zzso tracking of zzso moving spot in regular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tracking of moving zzso We check the hypotheses that the zzso properties of filtered zzso zzso change with respect to the law of spot zzso zzso differ among filtered zzso components and scalp zzso zzso differ among real and imaginary zzso Sixteen right-handed subjects begin to perform zzso zzso spot tracking zzso and zzso following a moving spot on streets of a zzso displayed on a computer screen, by push zzso a zzso zzso long-lasting zzso is zzso filtered for zzso zzso beta and gamma zzso The zzso is applied to reveal zzso zzso zzso dimensions zzso among task conditions, frequency bands and zzso zzso statistical zzso of the zzso measures h zzso is finally zzso zzso is established for all experimental conditions, zzso components and sites as follows among filtered components - zzso zzso zzso zzso in beta and zzso and long-range correlation zzso zzso zzso for zzso and alpha zzso among zzso zzso and zzso h zzso differ significantly whereas IM resembles mostly zzso among zzso significant difference for local zzso properties is zzso The results suggest that for both imaginary and real zzso tracking a line, zzso zzso specific for lower and higher zzso zzso is a very stable intrinsic one for the activity of large brain zzso The external events zzso zzso insert weak effect on the zzso
