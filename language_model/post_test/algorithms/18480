The objective of this work was to contribute to the development, validation and application of data mining methods for prediction in decision support systems in zzso The particular focus was on the prediction of cardiovascular risk factors in zzso patients, specifically the zzso zzso zzso thickness of the heart of individual patients as an important quantitative indicator to diagnose left zzso zzso The work was based on data from 63 long-term zzso patients of the zzso zzso Centre in zzso zzso 

The approach applied is based on data mining methods and involves four major steps: data based zzso cluster based rule zzso zzso construction and cluster and rule based zzso The methods employed include crisp and fuzzy zzso At each step, logical and medical validation of results was carried zzso Different sets of randomly selected patient data were used to train, test and zzso the zzso and zzso for zzso 

Using the best zzso combination zzso the zzso thickness cluster zzso or zzso was predicted correctly for 30 of the 35 patients with known zzso values in the training data set; no patient was predicted incorrectly and 5 were parity zzso For the test data set, 4 of the 6 patients with known zzso values were predicted correctly, no patient incorrectly and 2 zzso These results did not substantially differ from those obtained using the second best zzso combination which was finally recommended for use based on further performance zzso The prediction of the zzso thickness clusters of the 22 patients with unknown zzso values also yielded good results that were (and could only be) validated by a medical individual risk assessment of these zzso 

The approach applied proved successful for the cluster and rule based prediction of a quantitative zzso such as zzso zzso for individual patients from other variables relevant to the zzso The results obtained demonstrate the high potential of the approach and the methods developed and validated to support decision-making in zzso and other fields of medicine by individual risk zzso
