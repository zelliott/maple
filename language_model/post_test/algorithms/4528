The timing, location, and magnitude of major zzso events are currently major uncertainties in the global carbon zzso zzso information on the location, spatial extent, and duration of zzso at the zzso scale is needed to evaluate the zzso impacts of land cover changes due to zzso insect epidemics, zzso climate change, and zzso land zzso This paper describes an zzso developed to serve as an zzso zzso systematic zzso detection index for global application using zzso Resolution Imaging zzso zzso Land Surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Index zzso data from 2003 to zzso The zzso is based on the consistent zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso on a zzso zzso We used annual maximum composite zzso data to detect fundamental changes in zzso energy zzso while avoiding the high natural zzso associated with tracking zzso at daily, weekly, or seasonal time zzso zzso of potential zzso events from our zzso was carried out by demonstration of close association with independently confirmed, well-documented historical wildfire events throughout the study zzso We also examined the response of the zzso index to irrigation by comparing a heavily zzso zzso tree farm to the adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso results were further examined by association with zzso zzso across areas of the study domain known for large zzso vegetation zzso The results illustrate that our zzso is capable of detecting the location and spatial extent of wildfire with precision, is sensitive to the incremental process of recovery of disturbed zzso and shows strong sensitivity to zzso Disturbance detection in areas with high zzso zzso of zzso will benefit from a multiyear data set to better separate natural zzso from true zzso
