A new type of equation to describe zzso reactions was developed, which allows the description of processes both at or near equilibrium and far from zzso as they are both known to occur in the living zzso These equations combine kinetic as well as energetic characteristics within one single zzso and they describe the steady state as well as zzso as is shown for the zzso metabolism of the pancreatic zzso A simulation of zzso zzso metabolism could be zzso which allows to zzso in detail, how membrane and zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso are generated, and how they are zzso zzso zzso metabolism shows zzso zzso at a resting zzso concentration zzso of 4 zzso The steady state is switched to the zzso state by a first increase of the zzso of the zzso reaction at an elevated zzso of 10 zzso This is in fact sufficient to decrease the zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso at constant zzso zzso The associated changes of the zzso and zzso species can reduce the zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso thereby initiating bursts of the cell membrane potential zzso with a zzso influx of zzso zzso from the zzso space into the zzso The production of zzso of zzso zzso and all other zzso including those of zzso are brought about on the one hand by a zzso dependent zzso of zzso zzso production, on the other hand by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso Both processes must be coordinated in such a way that zzso production slightly precedes its zzso zzso zzso zzso are determined by the zzso zzso zzso of flux through zzso zzso and/or zzso acid zzso The simulation shows that the so-called zzso paradox possibly results from a relatively low membrane zzso of zzso for zzso
