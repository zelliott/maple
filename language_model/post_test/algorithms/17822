The advent of zzso imaging scanners combining PET and CT has led to a new paradigm in image display and presentation that raises new challenges in zzso interpretation software, image zzso and zzso The essence of zzso imaging is the ability to overlay imaging information from different zzso in a visually compelling zzso This is accomplished by combining functional and zzso data into zzso views using zzso techniques that provide visual clues on the spatial distribution of image zzso 

Combined zzso scanners provide zzso registered images from the two zzso acquired simultaneously in a single imaging zzso Special reconstruction software and image display programs are required to zzso the native images from different spatial resolution into zzso or zzso zzso planes in which data from PET images are color coded and superimposed on corresponding zzso CT zzso The color overlay technique allows the user to visually identify areas of high zzso activity and determine the underlying zzso zzso Because of the zzso nature of the data, zzso requires interactive zzso navigation techniques that allow the viewer to move the zzso planes through three spatial directions and two additional zzso The fourth dimension is the zzso blend from PET to CT fusion, and the fifth is the dynamic range of the CT images that can be adjusted to display different tissue zzso such as bones, soft zzso and zzso Software tools currently available are often relatively complex, requiring the user to perform cumbersome maneuvers and time-consuming image manipulation to navigate through all dimensions and obtain adequate image settings and plane positioning for diagnostic interpretation of the image zzso Moreover, the ability to convey these images to referring physicians is usually limited because of the lack of adequate viewing zzso Distribution of results is usually performed instead through zzso zzso of the fused images generated by the interpreting zzso The ability of the referring physician to navigate through the set of zzso image data is thus zzso 

The wider adoption of zzso zzso imaging techniques in routine clinical use will depend heavily on the development of more adequate image display and navigation tools that allow interpreting physicians to navigate easily and efficiently through multiple dimensions of zzso Distribution of results to referring physicians and care providers also requires new tools for zzso reviewing the zzso data, and current zzso images obtained from fused image data remain inadequate for proper zzso of the true content of zzso
