The purpose of this study was to develop and zzso verify a practical spatial averaging model for zzso up to 40 zzso The model is zzso to focused sources of circular zzso accounts for the effects of zzso probe finite zzso and allows zzso by substitution to be performed when the active elements of reference and tested zzso zzso differ zzso Several broadband sources with focal numbers between 3 and 20 were used to produce ultrasound fields with zzso up to 40 zzso The effective diameters of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the focal plane of the sources ranged from 150 to 500 zzso Prior to application of the spatial averaging corrections, the zzso with diameters smaller than that of the reference zzso exhibited zzso determined absolute sensitivities higher than the true zzso This zzso increased with decreasing focal numbers and increasing zzso It was determined that the error was governed by the zzso of the beam in the focal plane and the ratio of the effective diameters of the reference and tested zzso zzso In addition, the error was found to be zzso on the zzso effective zzso zzso After applying the spatial averaging zzso the overall uncertainty in the zzso zzso was on the order of zzso zzso The model developed is being extended to be zzso to zzso beyond 40 zzso which are becoming increasingly important in diagnostic ultrasound imaging zzso
