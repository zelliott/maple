zzso errors and alternate zzso and modeling multiple zzso zzso in poorly ordered regions are overarching problems in zzso structure determination that have limited automation efforts and structure zzso Here, we show that zzso of a full zzso designed set of standard refinement approaches, termed zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly improves structural models compared to the traditional linear tree approach, in which individual zzso are tested zzso and are only incorporated if the model zzso zzso markedly improved maps and models and reveals building errors and alternate zzso that were masked by traditional refinement zzso Surprisingly, an individual zzso that renders a model worse in isolation could still be necessary to produce the best overall model, suggesting that model distortion allows escape from local zzso of zzso target function, here shown to be a hallmark limitation of the traditional zzso zzso thus provides a simple approach to improving structure zzso
