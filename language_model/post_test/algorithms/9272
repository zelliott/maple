The persistent modification of synaptic efficacy as a function of the relative timing of zzso and zzso spikes is a phenomenon known as zzso plasticity zzso Here we show that the zzso of zzso by a global reward signal leads to reinforcement zzso We first derive zzso learning rules involving zzso zzso synaptic and intrinsic zzso by applying a reinforcement learning zzso to the zzso spike response model of zzso zzso These rules have several features common to plasticity mechanisms zzso found in the zzso We then demonstrate in simulations of networks of zzso zzso the efficacy of two simple learning rules involving modulated zzso One rule is a direct extension of the standard zzso model zzso zzso and the other one involves an eligibility trace stored at each zzso that keeps a zzso memory of the relationships between the recent pairs of zzso and zzso spike pairs zzso zzso with eligibility zzso This latter rule permits learning even if the reward signal is zzso The proposed rules are able to solve the zzso problem with both rate coded and temporally coded input and to learn a target output zzso zzso These learning rules are biologically zzso may be used for training generic artificial zzso neural networks, regardless of the neural model used, and suggest the experimental investigation in animals of the existence of zzso zzso
