In acute zzso zzso it is of great value to identify the zzso artery and the site of zzso in a coronary artery zzso versus zzso This study assessed the diagnostic value of two previously published zzso zzso to identify the zzso artery and the site of zzso in anterior and inferior acute zzso zzso 

We studied zzso a group of 88 patients with a first zzso zzso We determined the zzso artery using the zzso zzso on the zzso at the time of admission and compared these results with the zzso determined zzso zzso The best zzso zzso could determine the zzso artery in an inferior zzso zzso as the left zzso coronary artery and as the zzso and zzso right coronary artery with a sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and a specificity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso was unable to diagnose a left zzso coronary artery zzso In an anterior zzso zzso the best zzso zzso could determine the zzso artery as the zzso and zzso left anterior descending coronary artery with a sensitivity of zzso and zzso respectively, and with a specificity of zzso and zzso zzso 

In acute zzso zzso the use of zzso zzso is helpful to predict the site of zzso and can play a crucial role in the care of zzso
