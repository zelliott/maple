In zzso therapy the zzso of secondary particles can be very broad in type and zzso The most accurate calculations of tissue equivalent zzso absorbed dose and biological effect can be achieved using zzso Carlo zzso simulations followed by the application of an appropriate zzso zzso The zzso of zzso simulations is therefore an important quality assurance zzso issue in dose zzso We propose a method of zzso for zzso dose calculations based on zzso of either the integral absorbed dose or the zzso of deposited energies from single secondary particles in zzso material detectors embedded in a target of interest zzso This method was tested in zzso zzso capture therapy and fast zzso therapy zzso
