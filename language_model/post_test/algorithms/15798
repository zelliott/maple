Reliable structural and statistical analyses of three zzso protein structures should be based on unbiased zzso The zzso Data Bank is highly zzso containing several entries for identical or very similar zzso A technique was developed for zzso the known structures based on their sequences and contents of zzso and zzso First, sequences were aligned zzso A representative sample of sequences was then obtained by grouping similar sequences together, and selecting a typical representative from each zzso The similarity significance threshold needed in the zzso method was found by analyzing similarities of random zzso Because three zzso structures for proteins of same structural class are generally more zzso than their zzso the proteins were clustered also according to their contents of secondary structural zzso The results of these zzso indicate conservation of zzso and zzso even when sequence similarity is relatively zzso An unbiased sample of 103 high resolution structures, representing a wide variety of zzso was chosen based on the suggestions made by the zzso zzso The proteins were divided into structural classes according to their contents and ratios of secondary structural zzso Previous zzso have suffered from zzso view of secondary structures, whereas here the zzso was based on backbone zzso The concise view lead to zzso of some zzso The representative set of structures zzso unbiased analyses of relationships between protein zzso function, and structure as well as of structural zzso
