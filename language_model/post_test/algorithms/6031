Global measures of structural diversity within a distribution of zzso such as the radius of zzso and percent native zzso have proven useful in the analysis of simulation data for protein zzso In this paper we describe a zzso methodology to zzso the local structural zzso of a distribution of zzso applied to zzso and zzso zzso zzso model zzso Each folds into zzso zzso First we perform a principal component analysis of all zzso distance variables for a large number of independent, zzso zzso samples of zzso collected at each of a wide range of zzso Next, the principal component zzso are subjected to zzso zzso zzso The results are displayed on so-called zzso zzso These provide a quantitative measure of the contribution to the sample zzso of the position of each zzso relative to the zzso zzso structural zzso those having the largest structural diversity within the sampled distribution, are responsible for zzso and shoulders observed in the specific heat versus temperature curves, generated using the weighted zzso analysis zzso The loading plots indicate that the zzso diversity of these systems changes gradually with temperature through the folding transition but radically changes near the collapse transition zzso The analysis of the structural overlap order statistic suggests that the zzso zzso folding transition involves the native state and at least three other nearly native zzso In the case of the zzso protein model, data are generated at sufficiently low temperatures that zzso zzso coupled with cluster analysis, provide a local and energetic description of its glassy zzso
