We propose a zzso model for detecting and zzso instances from an object class in zzso zzso zzso We divide detection into visual selection and final zzso concentrating on the zzso drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more zzso processing, but with a minimum of zzso and missed zzso zzso processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical zzso They have no a zzso semantic or geometric zzso The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rate in the zzso We show that the statistics in both populations are zzso The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local zzso Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does zzso with evidence about the functions of zzso in zzso and zzso such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns zzso zzso zzso and to scale and translation zzso in zzso Finally, the zzso is applied to face and symbol zzso
