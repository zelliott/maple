Through genetic engineering it is possible to introduce targeted genetic changes and hereby engineer the metabolism of microbial cells with the objective to obtain desirable zzso However, zzso to the complexity of zzso networks, both in terms of structure and regulation, it is often difficult to predict the effects of genetic modifications on the resulting zzso Recently zzso zzso models have been compiled for several different zzso where structural and zzso complexity is inherently accounted zzso New zzso are being developed by using zzso zzso models that enable identification of gene knockout strategies for obtaining improved zzso However, the problem of finding optimal gene deletion strategy is zzso and consequently the zzso time increases zzso with the size of the problem, and it is therefore interesting to develop new faster zzso 

In this study we report an evolutionary programming based method to rapidly identify gene deletion strategies for zzso of a desired zzso objective zzso We illustrate the proposed method for two important design parameters in industrial zzso one linear and other zzso by using a zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso engineering targets for improved production of zzso acid, zzso and zzso are identified and underlying flux changes for the predicted zzso are zzso 

We show that evolutionary programming enables solving large gene knockout problems in relatively short zzso zzso The proposed zzso also allows the zzso of zzso objective functions or incorporation of zzso constraints and additionally provides a family of close to optimal zzso The identified zzso engineering strategies suggest that zzso genetic modifications span several different pathways and may be necessary for solving challenging zzso engineering zzso
