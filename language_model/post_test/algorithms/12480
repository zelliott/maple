We show how a general quantitative theory of neural zzso can be used to explain two recent experimental findings in zzso The first of these findings is that in human zzso zzso lobe there exist zzso that zzso to identifiable concepts, such as a particular zzso Further, even when such concepts are zzso by the zzso such zzso can be found with paradoxical ease, after examining relatively few zzso We offer a quantitative zzso explanation of this phenomenon, where apparently none existed zzso Second, for the locust zzso system estimates of the four parameters of zzso numbers, zzso numbers, zzso strengths, and the numbers of zzso that represent an odor are now zzso We show here that these numbers are related as predicted by the general zzso More generally, we identify two useful regimes for neural zzso with distinct ranges of these quantitative zzso
