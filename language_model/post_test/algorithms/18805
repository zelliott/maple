Many applications of next-generation sequencing technologies involve zzso of a sequence zzso or a tag onto a corresponding position on a reference zzso zzso zzso zzso method, implemented in the zzso zzso program, is specifically designed for the task of high-volume zzso In this article we present zzso gapped zzso zzso and other improvements introduced in zzso zzso that further improve accuracy and speed of zzso zzso The goal of this article is to show that gapped zzso matching with zzso zzso zzso for zzso across close evolutionary distances and for the purpose of human zzso We propose a benchmark for evaluating the performance of zzso programs that captures key parameters in specific applications, including duplicative structure of zzso of humans and other zzso We demonstrate zzso of up to tenfold in large-scale zzso experiments achieved by zzso zzso when compared to zzso another similarity search program frequently used for zzso
