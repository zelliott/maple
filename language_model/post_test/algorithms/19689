In this letter, new design methods for the zzso multistate zzso zzso memories zzso are zzso We show that the well-known projection rule proposed by zzso et zzso can be generalized to complex domain such that the weight zzso of the zzso can be designed by using a simple and effective zzso The stability of the proposed zzso is analyzed by using energy function approach which shows that in zzso update mode the proposed model is guaranteed to zzso to a fixed point from any given initial zzso Moreover, the projection geometry of the generalized projection rule zzso is zzso In order to enhance the recall zzso a strategy of eliminating the zzso memories is also zzso The zzso and the performance of the proposed methods are investigated by computer zzso
