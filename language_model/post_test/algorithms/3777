Recent studies of the zzso processes in the DNA zzso have seriously challenged the principle that zzso occur zzso The zzso zzso mechanism causes zzso transitions in base pairs resulting in zzso during DNA zzso The meticulous study of the zzso phenomena in DNA may reveal that the process of zzso is not completely zzso We are still far away from a complete zzso model of DNA sequence zzso because of the complexity of the processes and the complex three-dimensional structure of the zzso In this paper we have developed a zzso description of DNA evolution and, following its zzso we have constructed a classical model for DNA evolution assuming that some aspects of the zzso processes have influenced the determination of the genetic zzso zzso our model assumes that the genetic code provides information about the zzso mechanisms of zzso as the current code is the product of an evolutionary process that tries to minimize the zzso consequences of zzso Based on this model we develop an zzso that can be used to study the zzso of zzso in a DNA zzso The zzso has a zzso interface and the user can change key parameters in order to study relevant zzso
