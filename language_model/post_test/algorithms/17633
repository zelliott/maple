To determine the accuracy of a protocol for diagnosis of zzso in children based on clinical evaluation by a pediatric surgeon with selective use of diagnostic imaging zzso We performed this study because 1) current reports in the zzso zzso emergency zzso and surgical literature advocate imaging, particularly zzso zzso zzso as the gold standard for diagnosis of zzso and 2) the value of pediatric surgical evaluation early in the management of the child with possible zzso has rarely been zzso zzso zzso zzso AND zzso zzso review of zzso children zzso age: zzso years; zzso zzso zzso referred to a regional pediatric surgical center for possible zzso from 1999 through zzso 

zzso pediatric surgical evaluation consisted of history, physical examination, white blood cell count, differential count, and zzso Children diagnosed with zzso underwent appendectomy without additional zzso those with zzso findings received intravenous zzso rest, and zzso after 4 to 6 zzso Imaging was used selectively by the pediatric zzso 

zzso zzso positive zzso value, negative zzso value, and accuracy of the protocol based on final zzso rate of zzso zzso and rate of negative zzso 

Of zzso children evaluated for zzso 220 zzso had an zzso zzso nine zzso had zzso proven zzso and 11 zzso had a normal zzso Of the 209 children with zzso 139 zzso had acute zzso 34 zzso had advanced zzso without zzso and 36 zzso had advanced zzso with zzso zzso was performed after initial evaluation in 195 zzso of the 220 children and after a period of supportive care and observation in 25 zzso of zzso One hundred zzso children zzso did not have an appendectomy and were discharged with other zzso The sensitivity of this protocol was zzso specificity was zzso positive zzso value was zzso and negative zzso value was zzso The accuracy was zzso compared with an accuracy of zzso for ultrasound alone and zzso for CT scan zzso 

These data show that a protocol based on clinical evaluation by a pediatric surgeon with selective use of imaging was highly accurate for the diagnosis of zzso in zzso Low rates of negative appendectomy zzso and zzso zzso were achieved without the potential costs and radiation exposure of excess zzso
