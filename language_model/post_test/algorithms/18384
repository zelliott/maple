zzso zzso B is an important public health problem worldwide and in the United zzso A treatment zzso for chronic zzso B virus zzso infection was developed by a panel of US zzso based on new developments in the understanding of the zzso of zzso availability of more sensitive molecular diagnostic testing, and advantages and disadvantages of currently approved zzso 

This zzso is based on available evidence, but where data are zzso the panel relied on clinical experience and consensus expert zzso 

zzso zzso DNA can be detected at levels as low as zzso zzso by using molecular zzso and should be determined to establish a baseline level before treatment, monitor response to zzso therapy, and survey for the development of drug zzso The primary aim of zzso therapy is durable suppression of serum zzso DNA to the lowest level zzso The threshold level of zzso DNA for determination of candidacy for therapy is zzso zzso for patients with zzso B e zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso A lower serum zzso DNA threshold is appropriate for patients with zzso chronic zzso B and those with zzso zzso and the panel recommends thresholds of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are all approved as initial therapy for chronic zzso B and have certain advantages and zzso zzso for consideration include zzso safety, zzso of resistance, method of administration, and zzso Studies are under way to explore the safety and efficacy of combination therapy, which may prove to be more effective than zzso in suppressing viral replication and may decrease or delay the zzso of drug zzso
