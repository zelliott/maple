The objective was to investigate zzso relaxation values and to zzso zzso fat zzso using zzso MR zzso zzso zzso at zzso in overweight and obese children and zzso 

The study included 123 consecutive children and adolescents with a body mass index above the zzso zzso according to age and zzso zzso MR zzso was performed at zzso T using point resolved zzso sequence with series zzso zzso relaxation values and zzso fat content corrected for the zzso relaxation effects were zzso 

zzso values for water ranged from 22 zzso to 42 zzso zzso value 28 zzso and zzso values for fat ranged from 36 zzso to 99 zzso zzso value 64 zzso Poor correlation was zzso zzso between zzso relaxation times of fat and zzso relaxation times of water zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso relaxation times of fat and fat content zzso zzso zzso between zzso relaxation times of water and fat content zzso zzso zzso between fat peak content and the zzso corrected fat content decreased with increasing echo time zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso MRS at zzso is an effective technique for measuring zzso fat content in overweight and obese children and zzso It is necessary to measure zzso relaxation values and to correct the zzso for the zzso relaxation effects in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the zzso fat zzso
