The problem of testing for zzso between zzso data has long been debated among zzso but reaches a critical point with the availability of large amount of biological zzso zzso in zzso where the amount of lateral transfers is believed to be important, the zzso of zzso using multiple genes requires testing for zzso before zzso the zzso On another scale, zzso tests can be used to detect zzso points within single gene zzso The zzso length difference test zzso based on zzso has been proved to be useful for finding zzso data sets, but its application remains limited to small data sets for zzso time zzso Here, we have adapted the principle of zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso is based on a tree length zzso criterion and is suitable to replace zzso in this test when used with zzso distance zzso zzso We show that this new test, zzso while being much faster, is often more accurate than the zzso test, especially when the alignments compared are simulated under different evolutionary zzso
