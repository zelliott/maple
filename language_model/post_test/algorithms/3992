The Mongolian zzso is one of the largest remaining zzso zzso Recent studies have reported widespread decline of vegetation across the zzso and about zzso of this zzso is now considered zzso Among the scientific community there has been an active debate about whether the observed degradation is related to climate, or zzso or zzso Here, we employ a new atmospheric correction and cloud screening zzso zzso to investigate trends in satellite observed vegetation zzso We relate these trends to changes in climate and domestic animal zzso A series of harmonic functions is fitted to zzso Resolution Imaging zzso zzso observed zzso zzso to zzso seasonal and zzso changes in zzso Our results show a widespread decline (of about zzso on zzso in zzso observed zzso difference vegetation index zzso across the country but particularly in the transition zone between zzso and the zzso desert, where recent decline was as much as zzso below the 2002 mean zzso While we found considerable regional differences in the causes of landscape degradation, about zzso of the decline in zzso could be attributed to increase in zzso Changes in zzso were able to explain about zzso of degradation across the country as a whole but up to 50% in areas with denser vegetation cover zzso zzso changes, while zzso played only a minor role zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the cumulative effect of zzso is a primary contributor to the degradation of the Mongolian zzso and is at least partially responsible for zzso reported in previous zzso
