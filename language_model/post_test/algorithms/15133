Although zzso high zzso ratio zzso could indicate cerebral zzso for brain injury patients, there is a debate on what is primary factor responsible for zzso zzso 

A data analysis experiment is taken to test whether any association between cerebral zzso and zzso increase zzso We studied zzso zzso data samples collected in an average zzso of zzso h from 30 severe traumatic brain injury zzso zzso The zzso increase episodes were automatically identified using a moving zzso of 5 zzso A novel pulse zzso template matching zzso zzso was applied to the zzso pressure zzso data of the corresponding patients to assess the occurrence of cerebral zzso and zzso during the identified zzso increase zzso Several analyses were performed to evaluate the association between cerebral zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso revealed that although more than half of the zzso increase episodes are not associated with any detected cerebral zzso when a zzso happens in association of zzso increase, it is more likely that this zzso is in the form of zzso rather than zzso Also for few subjects with dominant number of zzso episodes, a causality relationship between zzso and zzso increase were observed zzso precedes zzso zzso 

Using continuous zzso pressure monitoring and our pulse zzso template matching zzso zzso could be potentially helpful in teasing out whether culprit cerebral vascular changes zzso zzso crisis for traumatic brain injury patients and hence guiding the management of this zzso
