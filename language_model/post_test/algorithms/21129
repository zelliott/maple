zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently guided by identification of zzso zzso which are thought to be critical for maintenance of the zzso zzso automated means for identifying zzso independent of physician interpretation have not been standardized or zzso 

The purpose of this study was to zzso and validate an automated zzso to rapidly identify zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Left and right zzso zzso maps were generated by zzso zzso zzso software, using standardized zzso zzso in eight patients with zzso zzso Two blinded zzso interpreted all zzso as either zzso or not zzso A zzso approach was used to zzso automated settings to accurately identify zzso zzso zzso maps were generated with a zzso mapping zzso in eight other zzso Two blinded zzso interpreted all zzso as near field or far zzso The zzso was refined to zzso settings to exclude zzso signals and retain zzso zzso The sampling segment length was adjusted to zzso recording time to ensure zzso 

Using zzso points, the automated software achieved sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for identification of zzso zzso Using 725 points collected via zzso zzso with optimal automated settings, zzso of zzso zzso zzso were accurately zzso A zzso sampling length was needed for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso settings of zzso zzso zzso software with zzso data collection per point can rapidly and accurately generate zzso zzso maps independent of physician zzso zzso This may allow for an zzso standardized approach to zzso zzso zzso zzso
