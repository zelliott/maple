Dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso is the current standard for the measurement of zzso Blood zzso zzso and zzso Blood Volume zzso but it is not suitable for the measurement of zzso zzso zzso and may not allow for absolute zzso The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a methodology to measure zzso zzso and zzso from zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso A zzso modeling approach was developed, which applies both to zzso with an intact and with a broken zzso zzso The approach was evaluated using zzso in normal zzso matter zzso and white matter zzso and in tumors of 15 zzso zzso and precision were estimated with simulations of normal brain zzso All tumor and normal tissue zzso were accurately fitted by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was 82 zzso 21 in zzso and 23 zzso 14 in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was close to zero in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show an overlap between zzso values of zzso and zzso which is eliminated when zzso zzso is zzso The model provides a consistent description of zzso zzso in all brain zzso and an accurate assessment of zzso and zzso in reference zzso The measurement sequence requires zzso to improve zzso and the precision in the zzso zzso With this approach, zzso presents a promising alternative to zzso for quantitative zzso in the zzso
