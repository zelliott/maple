The differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated for zzso zzso that were generated by two different zzso techniques, zzso zzso zzso zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso zzso BAD zzso of these zzso were determined to compare the relative internal energies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso had lower BAD zzso than zzso formed by zzso The BAD zzso of peptides zzso to have a fixed charge on the zzso also were lower for those generated by zzso than those generated by zzso The BAD zzso of zzso formed by zzso did not change with the variation of zzso cooling periods after gating zzso into the zzso trap and after zzso them prior to zzso indicating that the zzso formed by the two zzso techniques would not adopt the same energy zzso It is proposed that the zzso formed by the two techniques differ in secondary structure, and the zzso zzso are zzso cooled to a lower local minimum along the potential energy surface than the zzso
