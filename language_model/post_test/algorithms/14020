Today, the growth of the aging population in Europe needs an increasing number of health care professionals and facilities for aged zzso Medical zzso at home (and, more generally, zzso improves the patient's comfort and reduces hospitalization zzso Using sound surveillance as an alternative solution to video zzso this paper deals with the detection and zzso of alarming sounds in a noisy zzso The proposed sound analysis system can detect distress or everyday sounds everywhere in the monitored apartment, and is connected to classical medical zzso sensors through a data fusion zzso The sound analysis system is divided in two zzso sound detection and zzso The first analysis stage zzso zzso must extract significant sounds from a continuous signal zzso A new detection zzso based on discrete zzso transform is proposed in this paper, which leads to accurate results when applied to zzso signals (such as impulsive zzso The zzso presented in this paper was evaluated in a noisy environment and is favorably compared to the state of the art zzso in the zzso The second stage of the system is sound zzso which uses a statistical approach to identify unknown zzso A statistical study was done to find out the most zzso zzso parameters in the input of the zzso zzso New zzso based zzso better adapted to noise, are proposed in this zzso The zzso system validation is presented through various real and simulated test zzso The global sound based system leads to a zzso missed alarm rate and could be fused with other medical sensors to improve zzso
