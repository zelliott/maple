Acute zzso (AP) has a variable zzso zzso early prediction of severity is essential to direct clinical zzso Current assessment tools are zzso and unable to adapt to new zzso None of the current systems uses zzso protein zzso Modern zzso tools can address these zzso 

370 patients admitted with zzso in a zzso period were zzso assessed; after zzso 265 patients were zzso First recorded values for physical examination and blood tests, zzso severity and complications were zzso A kernel zzso zzso model was used to remove redundant features, and identify the relationships between relevant features and zzso zzso was used to make the best use of data and obtain confidence estimates on the parameters of the zzso 

A model containing 8 variables zzso zzso respiratory rate, zzso on air, zzso zzso serum zzso white cell count and zzso predicted a severe attack with an area under the zzso characteristic curve zzso of zzso zzso zzso The optimum zzso value for predicting severity gave sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso The predictions were significantly better zzso zzso zzso than admission zzso II scores in the same patients zzso zzso and better than historical admission zzso II data zzso zzso 

This system for the first time combines admission values of selected components of zzso II and zzso for prediction of severe zzso The score is simple to use, and is more accurate than admission zzso II zzso It is adaptable and would allow incorporation of new zzso zzso
