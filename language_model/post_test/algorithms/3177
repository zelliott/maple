zzso and extra-large zzso zzso can both zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso It is unknown, however, whether these two zzso products display distinct properties with respect to zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso couples to the zzso more efficiently than zzso In zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells and mouse embryonic zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was higher than that zzso by zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso zzso activity, whereas its effect was markedly blunted on zzso zzso zzso Rank order of zzso zzso regarding zzso zzso was the same when the zzso was coupled to zzso or zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso generation was higher than that zzso by zzso The relatively high efficiency of zzso zzso generation was zzso disappearing with increased level of zzso expression or increased efficacy of zzso zzso responses in zzso and zzso cells were comparable even at low zzso levels, whereas partial zzso responses became comparable only when the zzso expression was increased zzso zzso zzso binding studies showed that the zzso component in zzso binding to zzso was more pronounced in cells expressing zzso than those expressing zzso We discuss these findings in the framework of current zzso protein zzso models and offer an extended zzso complex model that can fully explain our zzso
