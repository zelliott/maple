In this paper, the zzso zzso zzso was used to eliminate noise zzso the important information coming from a zzso zzso for automotive zzso This kind of zzso is designed to be easily mounted in hard to reach places on vehicles under test, and they usually feature ranges from 50 to 2,000 g (where is the zzso zzso zzso zzso and frequency responses to 3,000 zzso or higher, with DC response, durable cables, reliable performance and relatively low zzso However, here we show that the response of the sensor under test had a lot of noise and we carried out the signal processing stage by using both conventional and optimal zzso zzso Usually, designers have to build their specific analog and digital signal processing zzso and this fact increases considerably the cost of the entire sensor system and the results are not always zzso because the relevant signal is sometimes buried in a zzso noise background where the unwanted information and the relevant signal sometimes share a very similar frequency zzso Thus, in order to deal with this problem, here we used the zzso zzso filtering zzso and compare it with others based on the kind of filters that are typically used for automotive zzso The experimental results are zzso
