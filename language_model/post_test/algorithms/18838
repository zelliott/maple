Children in emergencies need peripheral intravenous zzso access in order to receive drugs or zzso The success of IV access is associated with the age of patients and fails in up to 50% of children younger than 6 zzso In such situations, it is essential that physicians and paramedics have a tool and easily zzso skills with a high chance of zzso According to international guidelines zzso zzso access would be the next step after failed IV zzso Our hypothesis was that the success rate in zzso zzso can be improved by zzso the zzso so we developed an zzso zzso 

zzso hospitals and ambulance services participated in an evaluation process over 3 zzso zzso workshops and the distribution of standardized zzso sets were coordinated by the study group of the University Hospital of zzso Any attempted or successful zzso zzso were evaluated with a standardized zzso 

We investigated 35 applications in 30 patients (a total of 49 zzso between November 2001 and December zzso zzso puncture was not successful in 5 zzso The success rate depended neither on the occupation nor the experience of zzso Attendance at a standardized zzso workshop increased the overall success rate from zzso to zzso which was statistically not significant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso training in zzso zzso seems to improve success more than previous experience and occupation of zzso However, we could not show a significant increase in success rate after this zzso zzso zzso studies are needed to show a significant impact of teaching on rarely used emergency zzso
