In this study, we develop a zzso zzso system based on a committee of zzso zzso zzso zzso The system includes a sequence of simple data zzso zzso Each committee consists of 5 zzso zzso of different zzso Each zzso on the committee takes in a different set of zzso The zzso system is then applied to a set of zzso gene expression profiles from zzso zzso We show that the system can be effectively used for zzso zzso gene expression zzso The results demonstrate the committee approach consistently zzso individual zzso zzso in terms of both zzso accuracy and zzso
