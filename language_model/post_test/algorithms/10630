Here we present the evaluation results of the Critical Assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso contact prediction zzso zzso prediction was assessed with standard measures well known in the field and the performance of specialist groups was evaluated alongside groups that submitted models with zzso zzso The evaluation was mainly focused on long range contact predictions for the set of new fold targets, although we analyzed predictions for all zzso Three groups with similar levels of accuracy and coverage performed a little better than the zzso Comparisons of the predictions of the three best methods with those of zzso suggested some improvement, although there were not enough targets in the comparisons to make this statistically zzso
