Rising sea temperatures cause mass coral zzso and threaten reefs zzso We show how maps of variations in zzso stress can be used to help manage reefs for climate zzso We map proxies of chronic and acute zzso stress and develop evidence-based hypotheses for the future response of zzso to each stress zzso We then incorporate zzso realistic predictions of zzso connectivity among reefs of the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design zzso to create reserve networks for a changing zzso We show that scales of zzso zzso are large enough to connect reefs from desirable zzso stress regimes into a reserve zzso zzso we find that reserve designs differ according to the anticipated scope for zzso and genetic adaptation in zzso which remains zzso Attempts to provide a complete reserve design that hedged against different evolutionary outcomes achieved limited success, which zzso the importance of considering the scope for adaptation zzso Nonetheless, zzso of reserve locations were selected under all evolutionary scenarios, making them a high priority for early zzso Our approach allows new insights into coral zzso adaptation to be integrated directly into an zzso approach to zzso
