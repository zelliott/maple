In this paper, we intend to predict protein structural classes zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso data zzso Two data sets were used widely, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with sequence zzso being zzso and zzso zzso We propose to decompose the chaos game representation of proteins into two kinds of time zzso Then, a novel and powerful zzso analysis technique, recurrence zzso analysis zzso is applied to analyze these time zzso For a given protein zzso a total of 16 characteristic parameters can be calculated with zzso which are treated as feature representation of protein zzso Based on such feature zzso the structural class for each protein is predicted with zzso linear zzso zzso The zzso test is used to test and compare our method with other existing zzso The overall zzso with zzso procedure are zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso data sets, zzso With zzso procedure used widely, we compare our method with five other existing zzso zzso the overall zzso of our method are zzso and zzso higher for the two data sets, zzso Furthermore, only 16 parameters are used in our method, which is less than that used by other zzso This suggests that the current method may play a complementary role to the existing methods and is promising to perform the prediction of protein structural zzso
