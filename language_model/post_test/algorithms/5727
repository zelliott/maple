To zzso and zzso skin architecture, the tissue usually has to be destroyed and zzso 

The use of zzso transform infrared zzso zzso as a zzso minimally sample destructive method to define hair zzso structure has been explored and demonstrated in this zzso 

Human scalp skin zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and the data was subsequently zzso with zzso spectral zzso zzso 

This resulted in an excellent distinction of known hair zzso tissue zzso which could be discerned based on their molecular zzso 

The development of a minimally zzso zzso zzso based technique that can differentiate layers of cells in the zzso zzso and zzso tissue sheath in the zzso of the hair zzso zzso the way forward to identifying spectral markers important in wound healing and stem cell zzso
