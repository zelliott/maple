zzso absolute risks are an alternative way of presenting relative risk estimates for zzso risk zzso Instead of choosing one level of the risk factor as a reference category, each level is assigned a zzso zzso which describes the uncertainty in risk without reference to another zzso In this paper, a method for zzso the floated zzso is presented that improves on the previously proposed zzso zzso The estimates may be calculated zzso with a simple zzso A benchmark for zzso the floated zzso estimates is also proposed and an interpretation of floating confidence intervals is zzso
