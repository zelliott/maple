Based on the zzso mode zzso method, zzso interaction of electromagnetic wave in a groove zzso zzso is zzso The zzso obtained by zzso method for a single groove zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso is extended to two zzso By exploring the total scattered field of the zzso zzso interaction ratios are defined to describe the interaction between grooves zzso Since each groove in this groove zzso zzso is regarded as the basic unit, the effects of zzso interaction on the scattered fields of each groove can be investigated zzso zzso results show that an zzso behavior of zzso interaction is zzso with increasing groove zzso The incident and scattering angle dependence of zzso interaction is symmetrical when the two grooves are the zzso For the case of two zzso zzso the zzso interaction is not sensitive to the incident angle and scattering zzso Although the case of two grooves is discussed for zzso the zzso developed in this article can be generalized to arbitrary number of zzso Moreover, our study offers a simple alternative to investigate and design metallic zzso compact directional zzso zzso and other devices especially in low frequency regime such as zzso and zzso zzso
