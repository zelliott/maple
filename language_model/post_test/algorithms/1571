The zzso zzso zzso collections are extensively used genetic resources that are the basis for many zzso screens and new zzso zzso evidence has previously pointed to the putative existence of a neighboring gene effect zzso in these zzso zzso occurs when the zzso of a strain carrying a particular zzso gene is due to the lack of proper function of its adjacent zzso Here we performed a large-scale study of zzso presenting a network-based zzso for detecting zzso and zzso software predictions using zzso zzso We applied our approach to four zzso uncovering a similar magnitude of zzso in each zzso These results have important consequences for systems biology, as the zzso collections are extensively used in almost every aspect of the field, from genetic network analysis to functional gene zzso
