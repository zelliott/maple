A set of new zzso and software tools for automatic protein identification using zzso mass zzso is zzso The software is zzso fast and modular to suit different laboratory needs, and it can be operated either via a zzso user interface or called from within zzso The software zzso do peak zzso peak filtering and protein database matching, and communicate via zzso Individual zzso can therefore easily be replaced with other software if zzso and all intermediate results are available to the zzso The zzso are designed to operate without human intervention and contain several novel zzso The performance and capabilities of the software is illustrated on zzso from different mass zzso manufacturers, and the factors influencing successful identification are discussed and zzso 

zzso identification with mass zzso methods is a key step in modern zzso zzso Some tools are available today for doing different steps in the zzso Only a few commercial systems integrate all the steps in the analysis, often for only one zzso hardware, and the details of these systems are not zzso 

A complete system for doing protein identification with zzso mass fingerprints is zzso including everything from peak picking to matching the database zzso The details of the different zzso are disclosed so that academic researchers can have full control of their zzso 

The described software tools are available from the zzso University zzso zzso 

Details of the zzso are described in supporting information available from the zzso University zzso zzso
