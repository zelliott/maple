Both alignment generation and zzso are important processes for producing biologically meaningful sequence zzso zzso tools that combine reliable, automated and zzso approaches to produce secondary zzso alignments with an appropriate zzso of the results are zzso We have developed zzso a tool to generate and edit secondary zzso sequence zzso It is easy to install and provides a zzso zzso zzso alignments are displayed, with secondary structure assignments mapped to their corresponding regions in the sequence by using a simple zzso zzso The zzso implemented for automated and zzso secondary zzso alignment calculations shows a comparable performance to existing zzso 

zzso has been implemented in zzso to provide zzso zzso zzso is freely available to academic users at zzso Users will be asked for their name, institution and zzso zzso A manual can also be downloaded from this zzso The software, manual and test sets are also available as supplementary zzso
