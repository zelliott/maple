This paper presents the design and zzso of a zzso steering system, wherein a zzso is zzso trapped and propelled to serve as a measurement zzso The zzso in the system consist of a zzso mirror enabling zzso steering and a zzso zzso zzso for lateral zzso The zzso range is designed and zzso to be over 20 zzso along the two lateral axes and over 10 zzso along the zzso zzso The zzso bandwidth of the two lateral axes is over 50 zzso and the associated resolution is zzso zzso zzso The zzso resolution is zzso zzso while the bandwidth is enhanced to over 3 zzso by model cancellation zzso The performance of the zzso steering system is illustrated by three sets of zzso First, active zzso motion control of the trapped probe is zzso to enhance zzso zzso Second, a large range three-dimensional zzso steering of a zzso zzso probe, zzso a complex zzso trajectory in a 6 zzso 6 zzso 4 zzso volume, is zzso Third, a zzso steering is implemented to achieve improved zzso
