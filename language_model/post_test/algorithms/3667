zzso experiments generate a high data zzso However, often due to financial or experimental considerations, zzso lack of sample, there is little or no replication of the experiments or zzso These factors combined with the intrinsic zzso associated with the measurement of gene expression can result in an unsatisfactory detection rate of differential gene expression zzso Our motivation was to provide an easy to use measure of the success rate of zzso detection that could find routine use in the design of zzso experiments or in zzso zzso 

In this study, we address the problem of both random errors and systematic biases in zzso zzso We propose a mathematical model for the measured data in zzso experiments and on the basis of this model present a zzso statistical procedure to determine zzso We have derived a formula to determine the success rate of zzso detection that takes into account the number of zzso the number of zzso the magnitude of zzso and the zzso from biological and technical zzso The formula and zzso tables based on the formula, can be used to assist in the design of zzso zzso We also propose an ad hoc method for zzso the fraction of zzso expressed genes within a set of genes being zzso This will help to increase the power of zzso zzso 

The functions to calculate the success rate of zzso detection have been implemented as a zzso application, which is accessible at zzso
