High quality zzso zzso of zzso structures is necessary for many zzso The zzso structures first need to be zzso A variety of zzso zzso have been developed for this zzso For zzso zzso images, the noise introduced during the zzso preparation process, such as the procedure of penetration or zzso may cause images to be of low contrast in some zzso This property will make zzso zzso Also, the segmented structures may have rugged surfaces in zzso zzso In this paper, we present a hybrid method that is suitable for zzso of zzso zzso zzso A rough zzso result is obtained from the zzso zzso via zzso zzso The boundaries of the zzso result are close to the object zzso and are regarded as the initial contours of the active zzso zzso After convergence of the snake algorithm, the resulting contours in regions of low contrast are locally refined by zzso zzso surfaces to alleviate the problem of incorrect zzso The proposed method increases the accuracy of the snake zzso because of better initial zzso Besides, it can provide zzso segmented results in zzso zzso
