An zzso for recovering a function from essentially localized values of its zzso transform and sparse zzso values was outlined in zzso zzso That zzso zzso the zzso properties of zzso coupled with the range zzso for the zzso zzso to zzso essentially the dependence of the zzso zzso In this paper we zzso alternative zzso projections which were introduced by zzso and Meyer zzso We present evidence that these bases are optimal according to our criterion for localized zzso These bases require significantly less data than the zzso bases that were used in zzso zzso Finally, we present zzso results supporting this zzso
