Steady state zzso network dynamics analysis zzso is a recently proposed zzso zzso tool that zzso captures a zzso network and its rules via a zzso network database, zzso mimics the reasoning of a zzso given a set of zzso zzso and zzso locates efficiently all possible zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a number of factors may cause the zzso zzso to eliminate feasible flux zzso These factors include zzso inherent error margins in observations zzso zzso lack of knowledge to zzso zzso as normal versus zzso and zzso choosing a highly constrained zzso zzso to query zzso In this work, we first present and formalize these zzso Then, we propose techniques to eliminate them and present an experimental evaluation of our proposed zzso
