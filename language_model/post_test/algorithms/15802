A unifying approach to cumulative zzso zzso zzso reduction analysis is zzso zzso two weighted linear zzso models zzso zzso two weighted probability models zzso zzso and a novel integral probability model zzso As a test of their zzso value these zzso were applied to zzso data generated from lung doses, measured by zzso zzso in a female zzso zzso Three arbitrary zzso of breast size and location of zzso zzso within the breast were zzso using an appropriate electron field zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso effective doses from each of the reduction zzso showed the zzso implant to be zzso the most zzso in two the three zzso Likewise, complication zzso based on a zzso zzso response function showed lung complication probabilities to be lower for the zzso technique in the same zzso All zzso tested showed reasonable consistency, with the exception of the zzso The rationale and value of comparative rather than absolute zzso zzso analyses are zzso
