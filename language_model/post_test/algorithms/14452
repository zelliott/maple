zzso structure learning zzso generally perform well on sparse zzso Although zzso is not zzso there are some zzso where the underlying graph can have some dense zzso one of these zzso is gene regulatory networks, which is the main motivation to undertake the study described in this zzso We propose a new zzso zzso that can both increase the quality of output and decrease the zzso requirements for learning the structure of gene regulatory zzso The zzso is based on and extends the PC zzso Two different types of information are derived from the prior knowledge; one is the probability of existence of edges, and the other is the zzso that seem to be dependent on a large number of zzso compared to other zzso in the zzso Also a new method based on Gene zzso for gene regulatory network validation is zzso We demonstrate the zzso and effectiveness of the proposed zzso on both synthetic and real data zzso
