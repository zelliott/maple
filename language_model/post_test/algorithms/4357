The increasing requirement for Solid Waste Management zzso has become a significant challenge for municipal zzso A number of integrated systems and methods have introduced to overcome this zzso Many researchers have aimed to develop an ideal zzso system, including approaches involving software-based zzso zzso Information Systems zzso zzso Identification zzso or sensor intelligent zzso Image processing solutions for the Solid Waste zzso collection have also been zzso however, during capturing the bin image, it is challenging to position the camera for getting a bin area zzso zzso As yet, there is no ideal system which can correctly estimate the amount of zzso This paper briefly discusses an efficient image processing solution to overcome these zzso Dynamic Time zzso zzso was used for detecting and cropping the bin area and zzso zzso zzso was introduced for feature extraction of the waste bin zzso Image features were used to train the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the waste bin level and estimate the amount of waste inside the zzso The area under the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to statistically evaluate zzso zzso The results of this developed system are comparable to previous image processing based zzso The system demonstration using zzso with zzso for feature extraction and an zzso zzso led to promising results with respect to the accuracy of waste level zzso zzso The application can be used to zzso the zzso of waste collection based on the estimated bin zzso
