zzso of living organisms is strongly modulated by the day and night cycle giving rise to a zzso pattern of zzso Such a pattern helps the organisms to coordinate their activities and maintain a balance between what could be performed during the zzso and what could be relegated to the zzso This zzso pattern, called the zzso zzso is a biological phenomenon observed in a large number of zzso In this paper, our goal is to analyze zzso data from zzso for the purpose of discovering genes whose expressions are zzso We cluster these genes into groups that are close in terms of their zzso and show that genes from a specific zzso functional category are tightly zzso indicating perhaps a zzso time of the zzso when the zzso performs this zzso The proposed analysis is applied to two sets of zzso experiments performed under varying incident light zzso zzso we propose a model with a network of three phase zzso together with a central master clock and use it to approximate a set of zzso zzso that can be zzso zzso
