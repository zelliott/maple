This article describes a modification of the conventional membrane zzso technique in which a membrane is used to dose the zzso composition to generate zzso and induce zzso in a drug zzso Two operative zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where the zzso is removed in at higher flow rate than the zzso so that phase inversion promotes zzso and zzso zzso addition, in which the zzso is zzso into the zzso drug zzso In both cases, zzso migration occurs in vapor phase and it is controlled by the porous membrane structure, acting on the operative process zzso This mechanism is different than that observed when forcing the liquid zzso through the pores and the more finely zzso zzso environment would generate zzso with the desired zzso Two organic molecules of relevant industrial zzso like zzso and zzso were used to test the new zzso zzso demonstrated that, by using zzso membrane zzso in both zzso accurate control of solution composition at the zzso point has been achieved with effects on zzso zzso
