We developed a zzso zzso zzso technology for zzso zzso detectors zzso to achieve zzso signal zzso By zzso circuit parameters of the zzso zzso circuit, the input current sensitivity was improved below 10 zzso which is smaller than a typical critical current of zzso The experiment using a zzso generator as an input pulse source revealed that the measured jitter of the zzso zzso circuit is well below the system jitter of our measurement setup for the input current level above 15 zzso The measured jitter of the zzso connected to the zzso zzso circuit was 37 zzso full zzso at half maximum zzso for an zzso bias current of around 18 zzso which is a significant improvement on 67 zzso zzso jitter observed in conventional zzso without an zzso zzso zzso
