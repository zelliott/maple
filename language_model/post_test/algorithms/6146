Mechanical stresses play a key role in regulating cell growth and cell zzso Using mechanical and zzso data available in the literature, we are able to construct a growth curve of a child, which we compare to the standard zzso It appears likely that the impact of hormones on zzso growth rate zzso followed by growth arrest can be solely explained by increased mechanical zzso The zzso of hormones by the muscles results in increased mechanical stress on the zzso before and at the zzso resulting in a peak in growth followed by growth zzso
