The zzso treatment planning system models the dose distribution in the zzso direction under a wedged field by converting the wedge thickness to an equivalent water zzso The zzso estimates the zzso ratio zzso in the zzso direction using the open field zzso at a depth deeper by this equivalent water zzso This model has been shown to work well for a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the motorized wedge of the zzso (formerly zzso zzso is tapered zzso to give a flat dose profile in the zzso zzso The zzso model assumes that the wedge has a uniform thickness in the zzso direction and so cannot model the zzso dose for the motorized zzso For a 4 zzso beam of a zzso accelerator this leads to a zzso overestimate and a zzso underestimate of the zzso under the thin and thick edge of the wedge zzso For 6 and 18 zzso beams of a zzso accelerator and a 6 zzso beam of a zzso zzso the model zzso the zzso in the order of zzso under the thick end of the zzso We have shown that by appropriate modification of the effective water thickness values at zzso zzso the zzso models the zzso in the zzso direction to within zzso of the measured values for the 4, 6 and 18 zzso beams, for the zzso motorized zzso
