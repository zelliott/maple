To determine and zzso risk factors associated with exposure of horses to the following zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso horses were randomly selected from a target population during the period of May 1991 to August zzso 

Blood was collected from the horses and tested for zzso to zzso using the microscopic zzso zzso A zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicated zzso Information was collected on each zzso its environment, and each zzso management zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to develop a zzso indexing system for zzso of exposure and to identify factors zzso with the risk of zzso These zzso were: 1) zzso exposure; 2) wildlife exposure; 3) soil and zzso and 4) zzso 

zzso exposure index value was associated with the risk of exposure to all 3 zzso Management index value was positively associated with the risk of exposure to zzso zzso and zzso but not with risk of exposure to zzso zzso zzso and water index value had a positive association with risk of exposure to zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso The zzso index value and the population density of horses turned out together were associated with the risk of exposure to zzso zzso Age of horse in years was associated zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the risk of exposure to zzso zzso and zzso and only zzso with the risk of exposure to zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso to the 3 zzso of L zzso varies according to age, management practices, population density of horses turned out together, and the values of the zzso exposure, wildlife exposure, and soil and water zzso
