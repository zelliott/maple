zzso approaches for neurological diseases tend to concentrate on specific structures such as the zzso zzso The hypothesis for the novel methodology presented in this work is that zzso will impact large tissue areas with zzso variations of zzso MR signal intensity and registration zzso The technique is applied to zzso of seizure focus in zzso patients with intractable zzso lobe zzso zzso in which the site of seizure onset was determined by comprehensive evaluation zzso with left zzso seizure focus zzso zzso zzso and 58 with right zzso zzso zzso The method analyses large, zzso Volumes of Interest zzso centered on the left and right zzso zzso zzso zzso (55 zzso 82 zzso 80 zzso in zzso scans aligned in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso registered to a reference target zzso Principal zzso zzso of zzso the zzso intensity and zzso the zzso a measure of local volume change, are used to generate a zzso reference space from a set of 152 zzso healthy zzso zzso from zzso patients, processed in a similar fashion, are projected in this space, and zzso forward zzso linear zzso analysis of the zzso zzso is used for zzso Following manual zzso zzso analysis, 80 patients had HC zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso with left zzso or zzso and 38 with right or zzso and the remaining 47 had normal HC volumes zzso zzso (27 with left zzso or zzso and 20 with right zzso or zzso The automated method was zzso accurate at separating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso It was also zzso accurate at separating zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that MR data projected in zzso feature zzso can zzso zzso in zzso patients with a high zzso irrespective of HC zzso This zzso practical and objective method holds promise for the zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
