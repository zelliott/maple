A new zzso efficient and automated zzso zzso zzso is described to assist the prediction of the mode of binding between two zzso using the three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso The method is implemented in a software package called zzso zzso Complex Generation with Global zzso and zzso and works in two sequential steps: first, the complete zzso binding spaces of both molecules is systematically zzso A population of candidate zzso zzso zzso is thus generated and selected on the basis of the geometric zzso and zzso acid zzso affinities between the two molecular zzso Most of the zzso changes observed during protein association are treated in an implicit way and test results are equally zzso regardless of starting from the bound or the zzso forms of known structures of the interacting zzso In contrast to other methods, the entire molecular surfaces are searched during the zzso using absolutely no additional information regarding the binding zzso In a second step, an interaction scoring function is used to rank the putative zzso zzso The function incorporates interaction terms that are thought to be relevant to the stabilization of protein zzso These include: geometric zzso of the surfaces, explicit zzso zzso zzso energy, and zzso zzso of the zzso acid side chains to contact across the molecular zzso The relative functional contribution of each of these interaction terms to the global scoring function has been zzso adjusted through a neural network zzso using a learning set of 25 zzso complexes of known zzso zzso In 22 out of 25 zzso complexes tested, zzso zzso zzso were found with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso A from the experimental structures, of which 14 were found within the 20 top ranking zzso The program works on widely available personal computers and takes 2 to 8 hours of CPU time to run any of the zzso tests zzso zzso Finally, the value and limitations of the method for the study of zzso zzso not yet revealed by experimental techniques, are zzso
