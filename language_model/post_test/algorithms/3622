A zzso analysis was done to compare the efficiency of two treatments in the acute zzso of chronic zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso analysis, modeled through a decision zzso The effectiveness of the treatments was estimated through a zzso and zzso clinical trial in which 800 zzso (5 zzso of zzso were compared with 1,000 zzso (10 zzso of zzso in patients with acute zzso of chronic zzso zzso and 142 patients, zzso Resources use was estimated from clinical trial and from Spanish data, and the unit costs through a health costs zzso The model was validated by a panel of Spanish clinical zzso 

Since the clinical trial was designed to demonstrate zzso there were no significant differences of effectiveness among both treatments (with a rate of clinical cure of zzso and zzso zzso which means that an analysis of costs zzso was zzso In the average case, the average cost of the disease by patient was zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso (a difference of zzso zzso The results were maintained in the analysis of sensitivity, with favorable differences for zzso that ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

With zzso up to 22 zzso by patient with acute zzso of chronic zzso could be saved, in comparison with zzso
