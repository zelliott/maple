There is a growing body of evidence that slow brain rhythms are generated by simple zzso neural zzso zzso switching of zzso zzso activity is a widespread phenomenon underlying such zzso A realistic zzso model explaining such zzso switching is a zzso system that employs a closed stable zzso channel zzso in its phase zzso Despite strong evidence on the existence of zzso the conditions on its emergence in a zzso network are zzso In this paper, we analyze a zzso zzso connected circuit of three zzso units and explore all possible zzso regimes and transitions between zzso We show that the zzso arises due to a zzso zzso of an unstable zzso
