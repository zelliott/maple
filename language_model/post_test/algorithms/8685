An zzso technique has been developed for critical structures on zzso Computer zzso zzso images with one or two overlap regions where object and background have similar CT zzso In this technique, those regions are identified and skipped during zzso zzso The contours thus obtained are zzso which are corrected afterwards by suitable zzso The overlap detection criterion is never satisfied in a zzso environment and the zzso in this case, is essentially tracked on the basis of CT value threshold zzso The entire process can be initiated by minimal operator zzso The method has been successfully tested for zzso and several examples are zzso The success and zzso limitations of this technique are also zzso
