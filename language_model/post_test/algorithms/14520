zzso zzso which are intended for use in clinical environments face harsh expectations from medical zzso they must cope with significant levels of uncertainty arising from zzso zzso population zzso and disease zzso and their validation must provide zzso proof of their zzso and reliability in the clinical zzso This paper describes a systems engineering framework for the validation of an in zzso simulation model of pulmonary zzso We combine explicit zzso of zzso with advanced global zzso methods to demonstrate that the model predictions never zzso from zzso plausible values for realistic levels of zzso zzso The simulation model considered here has been designed to represent a dynamic in zzso zzso state zzso through a zzso set of equations based on established zzso principles and has been developed for a direct clinical application in an zzso zzso The approach to uncertainty zzso is adapted from the current best practice in the field of systems and control engineering, and a range of advanced zzso methods are employed to check the zzso of the model, including sequential zzso programming, zzso direct search and genetic zzso An overview of these methods and a comparison of their reliability and zzso efficiency in comparison to statistical approaches such as zzso Carlo simulation are zzso The results of our study indicate that the simulator provides robust predictions of zzso gas pressures for all realistic ranges of model zzso and also demonstrate the general zzso of the proposed approach to model validation for zzso zzso
