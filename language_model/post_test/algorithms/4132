The accuracy of zzso screw placement during zzso spine surgery zzso can be characterized by zzso the target registration error zzso The major factors that influence zzso were identified, zzso and verified with in zzso zzso 

zzso markers are placed over anatomical landmarks of zzso zzso segments in locations that are feasible and routinely used in surgical zzso zzso was determined directly for markers placed on the zzso of vertebra zzso First, optimum selections of landmarks are proposed for different landmarks according to the minimum achievable zzso values in different zzso These anatomical landmarks are feasible and accessible to overcome constraints that may be imposed during surgical zzso Second, the effect of zzso weighting on corresponding points to overcome zzso zzso error based on maximum likelihood approach is zzso Third, an experimental model for zzso zzso error zzso is derived to obtain the zzso At the end, an error zone was obtained for each marker to indicate the possible acceptable zzso from the zzso exact location in zzso This study was performed in zzso on a spine zzso 

zzso landmark selection led to a zzso reduction in zzso In addition, optimum weighting of the zzso in an zzso model that incorporates zzso zzso error in the registration zzso led to a zzso reduction in the zzso 

zzso zzso transformation zzso and zzso zzso error are factors that significantly affect the total zzso These factors should be zzso to minimize the zzso Both the optimum zzso of landmarks and the zzso weighing of zzso have significant impact on the registration accuracy for zzso
