The concept of zzso zzso zzso has been integrated with variable length zzso for the development of a zzso genetic zzso which can overcome the problems, like zzso and ignoring smaller classes, as faced by single objective zzso The zzso can efficiently approximate any kind of linear and/or zzso class boundaries of a data set using an appropriate number of zzso While designing the zzso the aim is to simultaneously minimize the number of zzso training points and the number of zzso and to maximize the product of class wise recognition zzso The concepts of validation set (in addition to training and test zzso and validation functional are introduced in the zzso zzso for selecting a solution from a set of zzso solutions provided by the zzso zzso This genetic zzso incorporates zzso and some domain specific constraints in the search process, and is called the zzso zzso elitist zzso genetic zzso based zzso Two new quantitative zzso zzso the purity and minimal zzso are developed for evaluating the performance of different zzso zzso These are used, along with zzso zzso required number of zzso and the zzso time, to compare the zzso with other related zzso
