A major issue associated with functional electrical stimulation zzso of a paralyzed limb is the zzso with time of the muscle force as a result of zzso A possible means to reduce fatigue during zzso is by using interrupted zzso in which fatigue and recovery occur in zzso In this study, we present a model which enables us to evaluate the zzso force generation capacity within the zzso activated muscle during first stimulation fatigue, zzso when the muscle is activated from zzso initial conditions, and during zzso zzso zzso after different given rest zzso The force history of the muscle is determined by the zzso as derived from actually measured zzso zzso data, and by the zzso fatigue function expressing the zzso changes of muscle zzso from existing data acquired by in zzso zzso MR zzso in terms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and by the zzso zzso The model was solved for zzso stimulation in zzso zzso separated by rest zzso and compared to zzso obtained zzso zzso data were fundamental for prediction of the ascending force during its zzso zzso On the other hand, prediction of the zzso phase of the force was possible only by means of the zzso fatigue zzso The prediction capability of the model was assessed by means of the error between predicted and measured force zzso The predicted force obtained from the model in first stimulation fatigue fits well with the experimental zzso In zzso stimulation fatigue, the different zzso provided different prediction capabilities of the force, depending on the duration of the rest zzso Following rest duration of 1 zzso zzso provided the best prediction of zzso zzso extended the prediction capacity of the model to up to 6 zzso and pH provided a reliable prediction for rest zzso longer than 12 zzso The results presented shed light on the roles of zzso and of zzso in prediction of the force history of a paralyzed muscle under conditions where fatigue and recovery occur in zzso
