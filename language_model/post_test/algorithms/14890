Despite the growing volume of data on primary zzso zzso the regulatory regions remain a major puzzle with regard to their zzso Numerous zzso programs considering a diversity of properties of regulatory regions have been zzso The system proposed here allows the specific zzso zzso and zzso properties to be revealed based on analysis of extended DNA zzso 

The zzso computer system zzso designed to zzso the extended regulatory regions of zzso zzso has been zzso The computer system comprises the following zzso zzso programs for zzso dividing a set of promoters into zzso and zzso promoters and promoters with and without zzso zzso zzso programs for constructing zzso zzso frequency profiles, zzso sequence complexity profiles and zzso profiles of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the program for constructing the sets of zzso zzso motifs of a specified zzso and zzso the program searching for and zzso repeats in zzso zzso The system has allowed us to demonstrate the following characteristic patterns of zzso promoter zzso the zzso box region is flanked by regions with an increased zzso content and increased zzso zzso the zzso box content is zzso and promoter regions are saturated with both direct and zzso zzso 

The computer system zzso is available via the Internet at zzso zzso zzso zzso
