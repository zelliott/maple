The zzso labeling problem, defined as maximizing a sum of zzso zzso zzso functions of discrete zzso is a general zzso zzso problem with many applications, such as computing the zzso zzso of a zzso random zzso We review a not widely known approach to the problem, developed by Ukrainian researchers Schlesinger et zzso in 1976, and show how it contributes to recent results, most importantly, those on the convex combination of trees and zzso zzso In particular, we review Schlesinger et zzso upper bound on the zzso zzso its zzso by equivalent zzso its relation to the constraint satisfaction problem, the fact that this zzso is dual to a linear programming relaxation of the original problem, and the three kinds of consistency necessary for zzso of the upper zzso We revisit problems with zzso variables and zzso zzso We describe two zzso for decreasing the upper zzso We present an example application for structural image zzso
