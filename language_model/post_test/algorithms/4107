The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso function zzso and zzso zzso on the standardized zzso value zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

This study evaluated 41 zzso zzso zzso in 15 patients who had undergone zzso zzso The zzso diameters were zzso zzso or zzso The mean zzso diameter of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The PET data were reconstructed with baseline zzso algorithm, with zzso with zzso and with zzso A zzso analysis was performed using the maximum and mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and mean zzso of normal lung tissue zzso We also evaluated image quality using the zzso ratio in the liver zzso 

Both zzso and zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso increased the zzso by zzso and the zzso by zzso compared with conventional zzso By contrast, the zzso was not influenced by zzso and zzso zzso significantly improved the zzso 

zzso and zzso both increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso are considered to improve zzso zzso it is important to be aware that zzso and zzso influence the accuracy of quantitative zzso
