We develop several kernel methods for zzso of zzso data and apply them to detect cognitive decline in the zzso We first develop zzso models, a type of zzso empirical zzso zzso models, for the time zzso After demonstrating their utility in likelihood ratio zzso (and the improvement over standard zzso models for such zzso we develop novel Fisher kernels based on mixture of zzso models and use them in support zzso machine zzso The zzso zzso model allows us to handle variations in sequence length and sampling zzso zzso We also give zzso kernels not based on zzso models, but rather on the zzso kernel zzso zzso We apply the methods to detecting cognitive decline from zzso clinical data on motor and zzso zzso The likelihood ratio zzso based on the zzso tests perform better than than zzso based on the motor zzso zzso zzso performed better than likelihood ratio zzso for the motor behavior zzso
