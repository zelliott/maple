In this paper, we describe a new method for the study of clinical information system zzso zzso joined with information in the clinical data zzso This method uses zzso representations and zzso techniques to examine zzso viewing patterns of laboratory test zzso The context of our application of these techniques is to inform the creation of a zzso interface to the zzso 

We address the zzso zzso and usefulness of our method through examination of three zzso 1) The frequency distribution of laboratory test viewing will follow a zzso zzso pattern, indicating that patterns are highly variable and supporting the rationale for a zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso of laboratory testing viewing (by clinician, specialty, zzso and zzso zzso can be distinguished by our zzso 3) The identified clusters will include more than zzso of the laboratory test elements found in 30 randomly selected patient records for one zzso 

The data were plotted as zzso and clustered using zzso zzso zzso Various parameters were tested to give the optimal zzso 

All the hypotheses were zzso For zzso 3, zzso of information elements in the records were covered by the generated zzso 

Study findings support the zzso zzso and usefulness of our methods to examine patterns of information access among clinicians and to inform the creation of zzso zzso The results also contribute to our general understanding of zzso zzso zzso
