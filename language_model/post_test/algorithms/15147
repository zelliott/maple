Automatic image analysis zzso are in general dedicated zzso tools used for very specific types of microscopic cell images, but are not robust enough to accurately zzso the cell number and distribution in the wide variety for zzso images that exist in the field of tissue engineering zzso today, where zzso zzso interactions are being evaluated more and zzso In this study, a semiautomatic zzso was developed that allows the user to manually count a limited part of a TE scaffold image, and then automatically counts the cells of the full image based on that zzso zzso The zzso was validated on images of cells on a two-dimensional zzso titanium zzso zzso in a three-dimensional zzso zzso scaffold and in a zzso zzso by comparison with manual cell counting and with an indirect cell counting using zzso zzso The average relative error between this semiautomatic and the manual approach was zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso a proof of concept was delivered that could lead to an increased use of automated cell imaging as a reliable zzso and zzso quantitative tool for both basic biological research and process control of clinical TE zzso
