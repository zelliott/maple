We propose a model of the evolution of the networks of scientific zzso The model takes an zzso distribution zzso of number of zzso and two parameters as zzso The parameters capture the two main ingredients of the model: the aging of the relevance of papers and the formation of zzso when new papers cite zzso We compare our model to three network structural quantities of an empirical citation zzso We find that unique point in zzso space zzso the match between the real and model data for all zzso The optimal zzso values suggest that the impact of scientific papers, at least in the empirical data set we model, is zzso to the inverse of the number of papers since they were zzso
