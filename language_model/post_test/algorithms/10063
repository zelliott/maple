A major goal in zzso biology is the complete mapping of the gene regulatory networks for every zzso Identification of regulatory elements is a prerequisite for realizing this ambitious zzso A common problem is finding regulatory patterns in promoters of a group of zzso zzso but contemporary methods are challenged by the size and diversity of regulatory regions in higher zzso Two key issues are the small amount of information contained in a pattern compared to the large promoter regions and the repetitive characteristics of zzso DNA, which both lead to zzso zzso We present a new zzso method for identifying zzso factor binding sites in promoters using a zzso approach with a large negative set encompassing a significant sample of the promoters from the relevant zzso The sequences are described by a zzso model and the most zzso motifs are identified by maximizing the probability of the sets given the motif model and prior probabilities of motif zzso in both zzso Due to the large number of promoters in the negative set, an enhanced zzso array is used to improve speed and zzso Using our method, we demonstrate higher accuracy than the best of contemporary methods, high zzso when extending the length of the input sequences and a strong correlation between our objective function and the correct zzso Using a large background set of real promoters instead of a simplified model leads to higher zzso power and markedly reduces the need for repeat zzso a common zzso step for other pattern zzso
