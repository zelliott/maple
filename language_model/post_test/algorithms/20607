This paper describes a two-dimensional cardiac propagation model based on the finite volume method zzso This technique, originally derived and applied within the filed of zzso fluid zzso is well suited to the investigation of zzso in cardiac zzso Specifically, the zzso permits the consideration of propagation in a realistic structure, subject to arbitrary fiber zzso and regionally defined zzso In this application of the zzso an arbitrarily shaped domain is zzso into a set of zzso zzso zzso are performed in a zzso space, in which the zzso are all represented simply as zzso zzso are related to their zzso zzso by means of a transformation zzso The method is applied to a number of zzso First, large-scale propagation is considered, in which a magnetic zzso cardiac zzso serves as the governing zzso Next, zzso is examined in the presence of an zzso formed by the zzso in a slice of zzso muscle zzso Under zzso conditions, the safety factor for propagation is seen to be related to orientation of the fibers within the zzso Finally, zzso is studied in the presence of an zzso obstacle and a curved fiber zzso This example illustrates the dramatic influence of the complex orientation of the fibers on the resulting zzso zzso The zzso provides a means of accurately modeling the cardiac structure and can help bridge the gap between zzso and experiment in cardiac zzso
