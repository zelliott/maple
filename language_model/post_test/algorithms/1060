zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso systems based on the zzso distribution of zzso zzso in a population sample zzso without zzso is difficult because some zzso are not recognized in the data zzso Even in the case of zzso systems, where all zzso can be recognized by zzso so that direct zzso of the zzso of genes zzso is possible zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso based on the data on zzso zzso is sometimes impossible, whether population data or even family data are used for studying zzso segregation or analysis of linkage zzso zzso Such zzso zzso are analyzed based on the corresponding genetic models using the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso based on the zzso model for a zzso population was used to estimate zzso zzso The zzso zzso used in the study does not set any limitations on the number of zzso and the number of zzso of each zzso zzso and zzso are identified by zzso making possible to arrange zzso In each combination of zzso for a given combination of m out of L zzso zzso is the total number of zzso zzso all zzso are assigned value 1, and the remaining zzso are assigned value zzso The sum of zeros and zzso for each zzso is its zzso value zzso and the sum of the zzso values of the zzso that form a given zzso is the zzso value zzso of this zzso Then, zzso with the same h are united into a single class, which reduces the number of the estimated zzso In a general case of m zzso this procedure yields m + 1 classes of zzso and zzso + 1 classes of zzso with zzso values g zzso 0, 1, 2, zzso zzso The unknown zzso of the m + 1 classes of zzso can be represented as functions of the zzso zzso whose maximum likelihood zzso zzso have been obtained in all previous zzso procedures and the only unknown frequency zzso that is to be estimated in the given zzso zzso At the expectation step, the expected zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso values g are expressed in terms of the products of the zzso of m + 1 classes of zzso The data on zzso are the numbers zzso of individuals with zzso values g zzso 0, 1, 2, 3, zzso zzso The zzso step is the zzso of the zzso of the likelihood function zzso for zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is reduced, in each case, to solution of only one equation with one unknown zzso with the use of the zzso values, zzso the numbers of individuals after the corresponding zzso of the data on the zzso zzso Treatment of the data obtained by zzso on the zzso and zzso systems with zzso C, zzso zzso D, zzso zzso e with the use of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso suggested in this study yielded similar zzso However, the zzso of the parameters obtained with the use of either zzso often zzso to a wrong solution: the sum of the zzso of all zzso (4 and 12 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso was not equal to zzso even if the global maximum of zzso was reached for each of them (as it was for zzso with the use of zzso zzso zzso with each zzso falling within admissible limits zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso 2 function is suggested to be used as a zzso function for the distribution of zzso in a sample in order to select acceptable zzso However, the minimum of this function only guarantee the zzso of solutions if all limitations on the parameters are zzso the sum of zzso of zzso zzso is zzso each frequency falls within the admissible limits, and the zzso zzso is complied with zzso of the zzso is zzso
