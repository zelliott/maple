We compare the zzso capability of two mathematical models for red blood cells zzso focusing on blood flow in zzso and zzso Both zzso models as well as their corresponding blood flows are based on the zzso particle dynamics zzso method, a zzso molecular dynamics zzso The first model employs a zzso description of the zzso zzso with its membrane represented by hundreds or even thousands of zzso connected by springs into a triangular network in combination with zzso elastic zzso zzso Extra dissipation within the network accounts for membrane zzso while the characteristic zzso zzso shape is achieved by imposition of constraints for constant membrane area and constant cell zzso The second model is based on a zzso description zzso constructed as a closed zzso ring of only 10 large zzso zzso zzso They are connected into a ring by zzso chain zzso springs combined with zzso zzso The zzso model can be fitted to represent the entire range of zzso elastic zzso as measured by zzso for healthy and for infected zzso in zzso zzso suspensions model the dynamics and zzso of blood flow accurately for any vessel size but this approach is zzso expensive for vessel diameters above zzso Surprisingly, the much more economical suspensions of zzso also capture the blood flow dynamics and zzso accurately except for zzso vessels comparable to zzso zzso In particular, the zzso suspensions are shown to properly capture the experimental data for the apparent zzso of blood and its zzso layer zzso in tube zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a zzso approach in modeling blood flow in the zzso tree, zzso the zzso model should be employed for zzso and zzso below zzso the zzso model for zzso and the zzso description for zzso
