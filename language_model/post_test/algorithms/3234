In zzso culture of pathogens on growth media forms a zzso for both infectious disease diagnosis and drug sensitivity zzso Conventional cultures of zzso tuberculosis zzso on Lowenstein zzso zzso zzso however, take over two months to yield zzso growth, thereby delaying diagnosis and appropriate zzso Since DNA zzso during zzso precedes microbial division, zzso synthesis zzso could be used to predict impending microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso critical for the synthesis of the zzso zzso precursor necessary for zzso DNA zzso zzso based on zzso detection of zzso zzso levels in culture using specific zzso are zzso The aim of this study was to define zzso for predicting positive zzso cultures using zzso zzso of zzso levels in zzso 

Systems and chemical biology were used to derive parallel correlation of zzso growth zzso with zzso zzso theoretically in four different scenarios, showing that changes in zzso levels in culture would in each case be zzso of zzso growth through a simple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso consistent with the zzso pattern of microbial growth zzso Two drug resistance profiling scenarios are zzso zzso zzso resistance and zzso In the zzso resistance scenario, it is shown that despite the presence of optimal doses of zzso in zzso to stop zzso zzso zzso grow and the resulting zzso growth changes in zzso are predictable through the zzso zzso According to our current model, the areas under zzso zzso zzso calculated as the integral zzso zzso + zzso or approximately 1/3 zzso 1/2 zzso could directly reveal the extent of prevailing drug resistance and thereby aid decisions about the usefulness of a resisted drug in devising zzso zzso within zzso settings, where second line zzso chemotherapy options are zzso 

zzso zzso may be useful for reducing the zzso to positive identification of zzso tuberculosis zzso cultures, thereby accelerating disease diagnosis and drug resistance zzso zzso zzso or zzso strategies may enable zzso of zzso zzso and hence automation of the entire zzso
