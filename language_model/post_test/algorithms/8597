We have used a newly developed qualitative zzso approach, zzso zzso zzso of Free Energy zzso to zzso the areas of the zzso zzso where modifications of its structure might lead to tighter binding to the protein zzso The zzso analysis, which includes protein flexibility and zzso zzso led to the suggestion that the zzso hydrogen atom of zzso which is in zzso to the zzso group, might be changed to a larger group and lead to better binding with zzso and zzso Free energy calculations supported this suggestion and predicted that the zzso analogue should bind approximately 3 zzso more tightly to zzso with this difference coming exclusively from the relative zzso free energy of the zzso The zzso analysis further suggested little or no improvement for changing the zzso hydrogen atom to a zzso group, and great reduction in changing the zzso zzso groups to zzso zzso by these results, we zzso zzso and zzso and their binding free energies and zzso were measured for interaction with zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the calculated results, experiments found both zzso zzso to bind more zzso to zzso than zzso The calculated preference for the binding of the zzso over the zzso was zzso In addition, zzso is considerably less soluble in water than zzso as predicted by the zzso and the zzso zzso is, to our knowledge, thus far the tightest binding analogue of zzso to zzso zzso X-ray structures of the complexes between zzso and both zzso and zzso were determined, and the structures were consistent with those used in the free energy zzso Thus, the reason for the zzso between the calculated and experimental binding free energy does not lie in unusual binding modes for the zzso
