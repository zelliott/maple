Gene flow of zzso into zzso populations is an important zzso zzso The case of genetically modified zzso zzso in Mexico has been of particular interest because of the country's status as center of origin and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso in the zzso and Europe, Mexican zzso form part of an evolving zzso in which new genes are subject to evolutionary processes of zzso gene flow and zzso Although these processes are affected by seed management and particularly seed flow, there has been little study into the population zzso of zzso under traditional seed zzso Here, we combine recently compiled data on seed management practices with a zzso explicit population genetic model to evaluate the importance of seed flow as a zzso of the long-term fate of zzso in traditional seed zzso zzso flow between farmers leads to a much wider diffusion of zzso than expected by zzso movement alone, but a predominance of seed replacement over seed mixing lowers the probability of detection due to a relative lack of homogenization in spatial zzso We find that in spite of the spatial complexities of the modeled system, persistence probabilities under positive selection are estimated quite well by existing zzso Our results have important implications concerning the feasibility of long term zzso monitoring and control in traditional seed zzso
