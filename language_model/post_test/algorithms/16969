zzso diseases that can be part of the rare zzso syndrome multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso commonly occur in the general zzso Patients at risk for zzso and consequently their families, must be identified to prevent morbidity through periodic screening for the detection and treatment of manifestations in an early zzso The aim of the study was to develop a model for predicting zzso in individual patients with sporadically occurring zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

In a nationwide study in The Netherlands, patients with sporadically occurring zzso tumors in whom the referring physician suspected the zzso syndrome were identified between 1998 and 2011 zzso zzso zzso analysis with internal validation using zzso and external validation with a cohort from Sweden was zzso 

A zzso zzso was found in zzso of 365 zzso zzso primary zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso of stomach, zzso or zzso zzso zzso positive family history of zzso zzso zzso and age zzso zzso predicted zzso The zzso of the prediction model was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso in the derivation cohort and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the validation zzso 

With the prediction model, the risk of zzso can be calculated in patients suspected for zzso with sporadically occurring zzso zzso
