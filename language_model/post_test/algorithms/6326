Often in imaging systems, the zzso of the system is not zzso In zzso zzso imaging methods such as optical zzso zzso one would like to achieve the most zzso confined impulse response possible with a given source spectrum, minimizing zzso that blur adjacent features zzso Typically the spectrum of the source is controlled in order to remove zzso from the measured zzso However, the measured zzso is not necessarily the best estimate of the scattering density of the zzso In this work, a zzso zzso method is proposed and demonstrated to achieve low zzso even with highly zzso zzso zzso
