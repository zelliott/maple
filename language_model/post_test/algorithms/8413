The Euclid distance zzso method is used to find protein coding genes in the zzso zzso based on the single zzso zzso at three zzso positions in the zzso The method is extremely simple and may be extended to find genes in zzso zzso or zzso zzso with less zzso zzso zzso tests have demonstrated that the accuracy of the zzso is better than zzso Based on this, it is found that the total number of protein coding genes in the zzso zzso is less than or equal to zzso only, about zzso less than zzso which is currently widely zzso The base compositions at three zzso positions are analyzed in details using a graphic zzso The result shows that the preference zzso adopted by zzso genes are of the zzso type, where zzso G and W indicate the bases of zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso in the zzso sequences are of the form zzso where N denotes any zzso This fact constitutes the basis of the zzso to distinguish between coding and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The names of putative zzso zzso are listed here in zzso
