In zzso zzso the human zzso correction can be based on the MR zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso is limited due to physical restrictions such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for large patients, the MR image and the zzso map might be truncated and the zzso correction might be zzso The aim of this work is to explore extending the MR zzso through zzso homogenization using zzso enhancement in which an optimal zzso zzso field is determined to locally compensate zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso sequence was developed that zzso an optimal zzso for certain regions of interest, for example, the patient's zzso A significant distortion reduction was achieved outside the normal zzso zzso This zzso extension was achieved without any hardware zzso zzso zzso in a zzso extended zzso of up to 600 zzso were analyzed in phantom zzso In zzso zzso of the patient's arms lying outside the normal specified zzso were compared with and without the use of zzso homogenization using zzso zzso In zzso we designed a sequence that provides data for reducing the image zzso due to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and used the data to extend the MR zzso
