This paper presents a method for zzso tissue boundaries and their zzso given as input a tissue map consisting of relevant classes of the head, in order to produce anatomical models for finite zzso simulation of zzso zzso zzso Our surface meshing method is based on the zzso model, which is zzso by duality from the zzso accurate results of the Marching zzso algorithm, and which features explicit control over mesh scale, while using tissue information to adhere to relevant zzso Our mesh scale strategy is zzso zzso based on the distance to a central point or zzso surgical zzso The zzso stage also features a zzso varying mesh scale, consistent with that of the surface zzso
