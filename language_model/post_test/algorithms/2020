zzso spin labeling zzso zzso can suffer from artifacts and zzso errors when the time delay between labeling and arrival of labeled blood in the tissue is zzso This transit delay is particularly uncertain in broad clinical zzso where reduced or collateral flow may zzso zzso of transit delay by acquisition of the zzso spin labeling signal at many different time delays typically extends the imaging time and degrades the sensitivity of the resulting zzso zzso Acquisition of transit delay maps at the same spatial resolution as zzso images may not be necessary, however, because transit delay maps tend to contain little high spatial resolution zzso Here, we propose the use of a reduced spatial resolution zzso spin labeling zzso for the rapid measurement of transit zzso zzso to using the derived transit delay information to zzso and zzso higher resolution continuous zzso spin labeling zzso images are zzso zzso in normal volunteers demonstrate zzso of transit delay across different brain regions that lead to zzso errors without the transit maps and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to zzso and transit delay zzso
