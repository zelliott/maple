The zzso transport of zzso zzso an zzso zzso was investigated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso technique in male, zzso zzso zzso was performed in each isolated region of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso at a flow rate of zzso zzso zzso binding and stability studies were conducted to ensure that the loss of zzso in the zzso study can be attributed to zzso zzso The effective zzso zzso of zzso was determined for each segment and zzso zzso exhibits a high zzso zzso over the length of the small zzso indicative of compounds that are well zzso zzso in zzso values at the highest zzso concentration studied in the zzso and zzso suggest a zzso transport zzso Based on these results, passive, zzso diffusion dominates the zzso transport mechanism of zzso with a zzso transport process evident in the zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso is in the range of drugs with high zzso zzso and high fraction of dose absorbed indicating that zzso readily crosses the zzso The dependence of zzso zzso on concentration in the zzso and zzso suggests that zzso is transported by a combination of mechanisms across the zzso Using established zzso the human fraction dose absorbed for zzso was estimated to be zzso The zzso values obtained from this study may be useful in models of exposure zzso
