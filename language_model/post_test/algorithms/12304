We show that a zzso mixture subject to horizontal zzso can be reduced to a zzso system of particles interacting via an effective zzso This interaction is attractive at short distances and strongly zzso and its features explain the system rich zzso including segregation and stripe pattern zzso Finally, we show that a modified zzso zzso which takes into account the characteristics of the effective interaction, is capable of describing the dynamics of the zzso
