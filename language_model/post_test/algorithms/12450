The ability to reliably identify the peptides that can bind to zzso molecules is of practical importance for rapid vaccine zzso Several computer-based prediction methods have been applied to study the interaction of zzso class zzso zzso Here we have compared the binding of peptides predicted by three zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the binding of the peptides to zzso molecules in zzso assessed using a zzso stabilization zzso on live zzso zzso Fifty zzso peptides were selected from several target zzso zzso tumor protein zzso native and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and Ewing's zzso fusion protein type zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were: zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Combining two or more computer methods did not appear to significantly improve the zzso zzso
