zzso zzso screens using zzso screening zzso techniques and automated zzso zzso generate thousands of zzso images that contain an enormous wealth of cell biological zzso Such screens are key to the analysis of basic cell biological principles, such as control of cell cycle and cell zzso However, these screens will ultimately only shed light on human disease mechanisms and potential cures if the analysis can keep up with the generation of zzso A fundamental step toward automated analysis of zzso screening is to construct a robust platform for automatic cellular zzso zzso The authors present a zzso consisting of microscopic image zzso and analysis zzso for automatic recognition of cellular zzso in the context of the zzso family of small zzso To zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso interference zzso was used to zzso gene functions, and the corresponding cellular zzso were analyzed for zzso The data used in the experiments are zzso zzso zzso zzso images of zzso zzso cultured cells stained with markers that allow zzso of DNA, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activated zzso protein zzso The performance of this approach was tested using a cellular database that contained more than 1000 samples of 3 zzso cellular zzso and the zzso error was estimated using a zzso zzso Moreover, the authors applied this approach to analyze the whole zzso zzso images of zzso cells for further zzso gene function zzso
