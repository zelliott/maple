This paper is concerned with the problem of zzso exponential stability of uncertain neural networks with zzso delay and zzso zzso Both linear and zzso zzso zzso are zzso The main features of this paper are twofold: 1) Based on generalized zzso zzso some improved zzso stability criteria are established, which are more efficient than the existing ones in terms of less conservatism and lower zzso zzso and 2) when the zzso zzso zzso acting on the system zzso a class of zzso linear growth conditions, the restrictive condition P zzso zzso (or the similar ones) in the existing results can be relaxed under some zzso The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by illustrative zzso
