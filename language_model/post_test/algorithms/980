The prediction of loop regions in the process of protein structure prediction by zzso is still an zzso zzso In an earlier publication, we could show that the correct placement of the zzso acids serving as an anchor group to be connected by a loop zzso with a predicted geometry is a highly important step and an essential requirement within the process zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this article, we present an analysis of the quality of possible loop predictions with respect to gap zzso zzso zzso zzso acid type, secondary structure, and zzso zzso For 550 insertions and 544 zzso we test all possible positions for anchor groups with an inserted loop of a length between 3 and 12 zzso zzso We could show that approximately zzso of the zzso regions could be predicted within zzso A zzso from a zzso loop data base if criteria for the correct zzso of anchor groups could be found and the zzso can be sorted zzso From our analysis, several conclusions regarding the optimal placement of anchor groups become zzso zzso The correct placement of anchor groups is even more important for longer gap zzso zzso medium length fragments zzso zzso perform better than short or long ones, zzso the placement of anchor groups at zzso zzso acids gives a higher chance to include the best possible loop, zzso anchor groups within secondary structure zzso in particular zzso are zzso zzso zzso acids with lower zzso accessibility are better anchor zzso A preliminary test using a combination of the anchor group positioning criteria deduced from our analysis shows very promising zzso
