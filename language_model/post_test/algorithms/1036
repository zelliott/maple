An inverse treatment planning zzso module on a commercial treatment planning system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is being used for an in-house clinical trial for treatment of zzso cancer with zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated radiation therapy zzso fields are delivered by step and shoot zzso zzso zzso with a zzso enabled zzso zzso CD zzso Associates, Palo Alto, zzso A series of testing procedures have been devised to zzso the modeling and delivery accuracy of routine clinical inverse planned zzso using zzso zzso and the zzso step and shoot zzso delivery zzso Testing was done on specific aspects of the zzso modeling germane to zzso Measured relative dose factors zzso scatter plus phantom zzso for small zzso fields, zzso to a zzso zzso zzso field, were found to differ by zzso from the zzso values for the smallest of the fields zzso Relative zzso for small off axis fields were found to be in good zzso A process for the routine clinical zzso of zzso fields has been zzso Each zzso field in an inverse plan is imported into a flat water tank plan and a zzso eye zzso zzso dose distribution is zzso This is compared to the corresponding measured zzso dose zzso The zzso zzso process has also been performed using an zzso zzso Large clinical fields zzso greater than zzso zzso in the leaf zzso caused difficulties due to a vendor specific machine zzso and several techniques for dealing with these were zzso These techniques were zzso the use of zzso stepping of closed zzso zzso the use of two separate zzso fields for a given zzso angle, and zzso restricting the overall maximum field size zzso The overall process has allowed zzso of an in-house protocol for zzso use on an initial clinical zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for the first ten patients treated at this center reveal an average maximum dose per zzso field delivered of zzso zzso with a mean local zzso from the planned dose of zzso zzso and a standard zzso of zzso zzso
