zzso learning machines zzso have been proposed for generalized zzso zzso networks which need not be zzso alike and perform well in both zzso and zzso zzso The problem of determining the suitable network zzso is recognized to be crucial in the successful application of zzso This paper first proposes a dynamic zzso zzso where the hidden zzso can be recruited or deleted zzso according to their significance to network performance, so that not only the parameters can be adjusted but also the architecture can be zzso zzso Then, this paper proves in theory that such zzso using zzso zzso hidden zzso functions can approximate any zzso zzso function on a compact input zzso zzso results obtained over various test problems demonstrate and verify that the proposed zzso does a good job reducing the network size while preserving good zzso zzso
