A mathematical model of multiple layer skin zzso in zzso a class of aquatic animals, is zzso The model incorporates diffuse and zzso reflection from both zzso and structural zzso components found in the skin of these zzso zzso physical processes of this zzso are identified and modeled utilizing available biological materials zzso Several examples of combination zzso are calculated to illustrate multiple layer and incident light effects as well as the potentially rich repertoire of color schemes available to these zzso A detailed understanding of the physical principles underlying zzso zzso is expected to yield insights into their possible zzso
