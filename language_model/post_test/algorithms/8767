The Gene zzso zzso zzso challenge consisted of predicting gene expression from promoter sequences in a previously unknown zzso generated data zzso The challenge was presented to the community in the framework of the sixth zzso for zzso Engineering zzso and zzso zzso a community effort to evaluate the status of systems biology modeling zzso zzso promoter activity was obtained by measuring zzso from promoter sequences fused upstream of a gene for yellow zzso protein and inserted in the same zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso teams submitted results predicting the expression levels of 53 different promoters from zzso zzso protein zzso Analysis of participant predictions shows that accurate values for zzso and zzso promoters were difficult to zzso although in the latter case, only when the zzso induced a large change in promoter activity compared to the zzso zzso As in previous DREAM challenges, we found that zzso of participant predictions provided robust results, but did not fare better than the three best zzso Finally, this study not only provides a benchmark for the assessment of methods predicting activity of a specific set of promoters from their zzso but it also shows that the top performing algorithm, which used zzso approaches, can be improved by the addition of biological features such as zzso factor binding zzso
