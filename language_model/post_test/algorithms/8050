An international collaborative study of zzso methods applied to control the authenticity of vinegar was organized in order to support the recognition of these procedures as official zzso The determination of the zzso ratio of the zzso site of zzso acid by zzso zzso natural zzso zzso magnetic zzso and the determination of the zzso ratio, by zzso zzso ratio mass zzso provide complementary information to characterize the zzso origin of zzso acid and to detect zzso of vinegar using synthetic zzso zzso Both methods use the same initial steps to recover pure zzso acid from zzso In the case of wine vinegar, the determination of the zzso ratio of water by zzso allows to differentiate wine vinegar from zzso made from dried zzso The same set of vinegar samples was used to validate these three zzso The precision parameters of the method for measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be similar to the values previously obtained for similar methods applied to wine ethanol or zzso extracted from fruit zzso the average zzso zzso was zzso per zzso and the average zzso zzso was zzso per zzso As expected from previous in-house study of the zzso the precision parameters of the method for measuring the zzso ratio of the zzso site were found to be slightly higher than the values previously obtained for similar methods applied to wine ethanol or zzso ethanol in fruit zzso the average zzso was zzso zzso and the average zzso was zzso zzso This precision is still significantly smaller than the differences between various zzso acid sources zzso and zzso and allows a satisfactory discrimination of vinegar zzso The precision parameters of the method for measuring zzso were found to be similar to the values previously obtained for other methods applied to wine and fruit zzso the average zzso was zzso per zzso and the average zzso was zzso per zzso The above values are proposed as zzso and zzso limits in the current state of the zzso On the basis of this satisfactory zzso precision and on the accuracy demonstrated by a zzso experiment, the authors recommend the adoption of the three zzso zzso included in this study as official methods for controlling the authenticity of zzso
