In the aftermath of the London zzso attacks in 2005, UK government agencies required the development of a zzso tool to predict the weapon and injury effects caused by the initiation of a person borne improvised explosive device zzso within crowded metropolitan zzso This prediction zzso termed the zzso zzso injury zzso code, was intended zzso the security services to encourage zzso crowd zzso and zzso within scenarios of zzso zzso guidance to security engineers concerning the most effective location for protection zzso zzso rescue services as to where, in the case of such an event, individuals with particular injuries will be zzso zzso in training medical personnel concerning the scope and types of injuries that would be sustained as a consequence of a particular zzso zzso response planners in determining the types of medical specialists zzso traumatic zzso zzso zzso required and thus identify the appropriate hospitals to receive the various casualty zzso This document describes the zzso used in the development of this zzso together with the pertinent underpinning physical zzso From its zzso beginnings as a simple zzso the zzso code now has a zzso user interface zzso that allows three-dimensional zzso of results and intuitive scenario zzso The code is underpinned by zzso that predict the pressure and momentum zzso produced by zzso within open and confined zzso as well as the zzso of shrapnel deliberately placed within the device to increase zzso zzso Further logic has been implemented to transpose these weapon effects into forms of human injury depending on where individuals are located relative to the zzso Each crowd member is subdivided into representative body parts, each of which is assigned an zzso injury score after a particular calculation zzso The injury levels of each affected body part are then zzso and a zzso state assigned for each individual crowd member based on the criteria specified within the zzso scoring zzso To attain a comprehensive picture of a particular event, it is important that a number of simulations, using what is zzso the same scenario, are undertaken with natural variation being applied to the crowd zzso and the zzso zzso zzso mathematical representation of such complex phenomena is challenging, particularly as the code must be zzso to be of use to the stakeholder zzso In addition to discussing the background and motivation for the zzso and zzso development, this document also discusses the steps taken to validate the tool and the plans for further functionality zzso
