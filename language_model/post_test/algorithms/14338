zzso systems mediate most regulatory processes in living zzso Although the structures of the individual proteins are often zzso less is known of the structures of zzso zzso zzso methods for predicting zzso using evolutionary conservation and/or zzso data, have been zzso Here we consider the use of zzso accessibility, zzso zzso and zzso in conjunction with secondary structure data, as prediction zzso We analyze the influence of zzso type and secondary structure on zzso accessibility and define a measure of zzso zzso zzso zzso high scoring zzso provides a basis for predicting interaction zzso The analysis is extended to investigate zzso exposed secondary structure zzso particularly zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso lacking protective features are more likely to be found at zzso zzso allowing us to create an zzso with approximately zzso and approximately zzso accuracy in zzso between interacting and edge strands in isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso These methods of identifying zzso exposed surface regions are combined in an algorithm, which, on a data set of 77 zzso and zzso zzso chain extracted from zzso structures, predicts zzso of the zzso zzso zzso If zzso complexes, where the inhibitor mimics a zzso zzso are zzso the accuracy increases to zzso
