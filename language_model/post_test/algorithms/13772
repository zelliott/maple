An efficient zzso is described to locate locally optimal alignments between two sequences allowing for insertions and zzso The zzso is based on that of Smith and zzso which returns the single best local zzso However, the zzso described here permits all zzso locally optimal alignments to be determined in a single pass through the comparison zzso The zzso zzso the location of repeats, multiple zzso and shuffled zzso and is fast enough to be used on a conventional zzso to scan large sequence zzso
