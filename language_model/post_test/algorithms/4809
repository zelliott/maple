zzso dynamics calculations are performed to investigate zzso current zzso through zzso in the presence of zzso zzso We find the zzso to be strongly attracted to the zzso groups of the DNA, with resident time on the order of zzso while zzso are strongly zzso The diffusion constant of the zzso is calculated and used to estimate the zzso current through the zzso which gives a similar magnitude as in zzso The results suggest a zzso mechanism along the zzso backbone in the current zzso through zzso
