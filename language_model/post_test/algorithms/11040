We present the zzso zzso zzso Free zzso which is able automatically to cluster data and identify a suitable number of clusters to group them into without requiring any parameters to be specified by the zzso The zzso partitions a zzso into a number of clusters that share some common zzso such as their minimum expectation value and zzso of zzso zzso A set of zzso objects can be clustered into any number of clusters from one to zzso and there are many different zzso and zzso zzso and divisive, zzso zzso available that can be used to do zzso Nonetheless, automatically determining the number of clusters present in a zzso constitutes a significant challenge for zzso zzso zzso a putative optimum number of clusters to group the objects into involves computing and evaluating a range of zzso with different numbers of zzso However, there is no agreed or unique definition of optimum in this zzso Thus, we test zzso on zzso for which an external gold standard of zzso cluster definitions exists, noting that this division into clusters may be zzso according to other reasonable zzso zzso is zzso in the sense that it cannot be described in terms of zzso any single zzso metric over the space of possible zzso 

We validate zzso zzso with reference to a number of synthetic zzso consisting of zzso zzso showing that its zzso performance is at least equal to that of six other leading zzso - even though five of the other methods are told in advance how many clusters to zzso We also demonstrate the ability of zzso to zzso the three zzso structures of protein zzso using a set of folds taken from the structural zzso database zzso 

We show that zzso is able to cluster the test zzso a little better, on average, than any of the other zzso and zzso is able to do this without the need to specify any external zzso zzso on the synthetic zzso demonstrate that zzso generates meaningful zzso while our zzso also shows excellent agreement with the correct assignments for a zzso extracted from the zzso zzso curated zzso of protein domain zzso
