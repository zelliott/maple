A method for computing the slope or the zzso of zzso zzso containing statistical fluctuations is zzso The zzso presented employs digital differentiation as a digital zzso In designing an effective zzso filter the zzso zzso method and zzso exchange zzso are used to zzso the weighted zzso zzso The zzso of this method has been investigated using computer-based zzso Carlo zzso zzso curve analysis is presented as an example of an application of this method to zzso dynamic zzso The ratio of the bilateral slopes of the zzso second segments estimated using this method correlated well with the zzso plasma flow ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional images of the slope of the zzso second segments have been constructed and zzso to be clinically zzso This method is considered to provide a powerful tool for extraction of quantitative information both in research and in routine nuclear medicine clinical work, and may be useful in various other zzso
