A number of different approaches based on zzso data have been developed for cancer zzso However, these methods often ignore the underlying correlation between the expression levels of different zzso which are related to zzso From a biological viewpoint, the modeling of these abnormal associations between zzso will play an important role in cancer zzso In this paper, we propose an approach based on the concept of zzso Association Networks zzso for cancer zzso The zzso is modeled as a neural network, which can capture the associations between the zzso by minimizing an energy zzso Based on the zzso a new cancer zzso approach is zzso We validate the proposed approach on four publicly available zzso expression zzso The derived zzso Association Networks are observed to be significantly different for different cancer classes, which help reveal the underlying zzso zzso association patterns responsible for different cancer zzso zzso comparisons show the superior performance of the zzso zzso approach over several conventional zzso zzso
