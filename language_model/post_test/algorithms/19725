The zzso of Diet in Renal Disease zzso equations provide a rapid method of assessing zzso in patients with chronic kidney disease zzso However, previous research indicated that modification of these equations is necessary for application in Chinese patients with zzso The objective of this study was to modify zzso equations on the basis of the data from the Chinese zzso population and compare the diagnostic performance of the modified zzso equations with that of the original zzso equations across zzso stages in a zzso zzso study of zzso zzso from plasma zzso demographic data, and clinical zzso A total of 684 adult patients with zzso from nine geographic regions of China were zzso A random sample of zzso of these patients were included in the training sample set, and the remaining 230 patients were included in the testing sample zzso With the use of the dual plasma sampling zzso plasma clearance method as a reference for zzso zzso the original zzso equations were modified by two zzso First, by adding a racial factor for Chinese in the original zzso zzso and, second, by applying multiple linear zzso to the training sample and zzso the zzso that is associated with each variable in the original zzso equations and then zzso in the testing sample and comparing it with the original zzso zzso All modified zzso equations showed significant performance improvement in bias, precision, and accuracy compared with the original zzso zzso and the percentage of estimated zzso that did not zzso zzso from the reference zzso was zzso The modified zzso equations that were based on the Chinese patients with zzso offered significant advantages in different zzso stages and could be applied in clinical practice, at least in Chinese patients with zzso
