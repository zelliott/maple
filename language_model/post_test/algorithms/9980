The kinetic equation governing a strongly zzso zzso plasma flow past a convex zzso object is solved zzso for arbitrary zzso to electron temperature ratio zzso zzso The approximation of zzso zzso adopted in a recent fluid treatment of the same plasma model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 101, zzso zzso is shown to have no more than a small quantitative effect on the zzso In particular, the zzso flux density to an elementary portion of the object still only depends on the local surface zzso We rigorously show that the solution can be condensed in a single zzso zzso M zzso function of zzso only, enabling Mach probe zzso of parallel and perpendicular flows by probing flux ratios at two different angles in the plane of flow and magnetic zzso
