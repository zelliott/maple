X-ray scattering is a powerful zzso experimental method that is well suited to study zzso zzso such as zzso zzso X-ray scattering zzso gives information about the size, shape, and zzso orientation of the zzso mineral particles in the zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso allows the characterization of structural zzso describing size and orientation of the zzso zzso Furthermore, scanning an area with zzso or zzso X-ray beams allows one to extend this local information to map large bone or zzso zzso zzso this method contributes to obtaining information on several length scales zzso Combining results from scanning zzso and zzso with those from other zzso methods such as zzso electron imaging or X-ray zzso zzso of the same bone sections allows the exploration of complex biological zzso The method is described and illustrated by a few examples, including the mapping of a complete tooth and the effect of osteoporosis treatment on the bone zzso
