A framework for zzso small molecules is zzso The proposed method consists of a simple zzso flexible zzso The zzso procedure used in the alignment is based on a recently published zzso of the simulated zzso zzso zzso constraints are zzso using zzso zzso It differs from other published zzso zzso in that any number of zzso constraints can be readily imposed on the structural alignment directly through the objective function without assuming an a zzso zzso between competing zzso These can include equality and equality constraints on zzso angles, and energy zzso Examples illustrating the use of the proposed approach are also zzso
