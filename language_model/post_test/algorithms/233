We investigate methods for testing zzso outcome associations in situations where the genetic relationship potentially varies among subjects with differing environmental or clinical zzso We propose a strategy which modestly increases multiple testing by evaluating weighted test statistics which focus (or zzso association tests within zzso and use a zzso method, based on simulating from the approximate large sample distribution of the statistics, to control type 1 zzso We also introduce a zzso calculated test statistic which allows more complex weighting on multiple environmental zzso zzso from simulation studies confirm improved power of the proposed approaches compared to marginal testing in many zzso
