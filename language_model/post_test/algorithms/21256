The zzso interaction between factor B and an activated form of zzso zzso or zzso is fundamental to the formation of the alternative complement zzso zzso zzso The present study reports on the zzso parameters that govern these zzso The zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso and factor B were found to act as competitive zzso in binding to zzso Thus, complex formation between zzso or zzso and factor B could be monitored by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso upon the addition of zzso Under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso 37 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso the zzso governing the binding of zzso to B was zzso X zzso zzso whereas the interaction of zzso with factor B was of zzso lower zzso Both reactions were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso being approximately zzso zzso zzso in each zzso Thus, a large positive zzso change provides the net driving force in these zzso Although zzso increased at higher zzso zzso this was not an zzso zzso Taken together, these data are consistent with zzso interactions being dominant in zzso or zzso complex zzso The enhancement of complex formation by zzso and zzso increase in delta S suggests that the metal zzso plays a role in increasing the number of zzso zzso
