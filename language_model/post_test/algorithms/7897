A novel method of interpretive structural modeling zzso using a zzso zzso is proposed in this zzso zzso is commonly used when the current technology and its application to business administration, industrial and systems engineering, organizational behavior, zzso concern complicated or problematic issues, or situations among an element set of the given problem context for making zzso When structuring a problem with a large number of elements in an zzso process, the crossings among elements should be zzso This zzso complex zzso is zzso The proposed zzso describes how to calculate complex relations among elements to create a zzso restructured zzso This paper also presents a new approach for applying a biological method to zzso to measure the efficiency of the zzso in calculating a large number of elements for decision zzso
