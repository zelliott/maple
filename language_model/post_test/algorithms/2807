In this paper we show how to zzso the zzso and the system zzso terms of the zzso reconstruction zzso for rotating zzso detector PET zzso The method introduced is valid for either zzso or continuous zzso We base our zzso in geometrical considerations, but other effects of the PET process can be easily zzso In this regard, the intrinsic resolution of the detection system, the depth of interaction zzso of the incident gamma rays and the efficiency of the zzso have been modeled in our zzso The zzso of the zzso term and the system zzso is valid for any basis function used for the discrete approximation of the zzso zzso We show that our zzso are comparable to those of a zzso Carlo method at a small fraction of the zzso zzso
