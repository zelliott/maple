The starting point of this paper is the analysis of the reference problem in zzso zzso zzso zzso It is well accepted that both surface and depth zzso signals are always recorded with respect to some unknown zzso signal called zzso This article discusses different methods for determining and reducing the influence of the reference signal for the zzso zzso In particular, we derive optimal approaches for the zzso of the reference signal in zzso recording zzso and demonstrate their relation to the well-known minimum zzso zzso response approaches derived for general array and antenna signal processing zzso We show that the proposed approaches achieve optimal performance in terms of zzso error and that they outperform other reference identification methods proposed in the zzso The developed zzso are illustrated on simulated examples and on real zzso zzso
