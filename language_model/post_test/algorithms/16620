The zzso space zzso lies between the zzso membrane and the pia mater of the human brain, normally filled with zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso zzso is a serious complication of neurological disease that can have high mortality and high risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso head scans are often used for diagnosing zzso which may be difficult when the zzso is small or zzso A zzso diagnosis system from CT images is thus developed to augment image zzso 

zzso learning using the probability of distance features of several landmarks was employed to recognize zzso For each CT image, the zzso was zzso in four steps: zzso Landmarks including brain boundary, zzso plane zzso anterior and zzso intersection points of brain boundary with the zzso and superior point of the brain were zzso zzso zzso to all the landmarks were calculated for every zzso in the CT image, and combined to construct a zzso feature zzso zzso Using head CT images with manually delineated zzso as training zzso the prior probabilities of distances for zzso within zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Any zzso of a head CT scan in the testing zzso was classified as an zzso or zzso zzso in a zzso decision framework based on its distance zzso 

The proposed method was validated on clinical head CT images by comparison with manual zzso The results showed that the automated method is consistent with the gold zzso Compared with elastic registration based on zzso information, the proposed method was less affected by zzso variation between normal controls and zzso Compared with manual zzso the average spatial zzso relative zzso and similarity index were, respectively, 89, 63, and zzso for the automatic zzso approximation of the 69 head CT scans zzso The proposed method was tested for zzso detection and yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

zzso zzso detection with high sensitivity was shown feasible in a zzso zzso diagnosis zzso The proposed method may be extended for zzso diagnosis of several zzso diseases relevant to zzso zzso
