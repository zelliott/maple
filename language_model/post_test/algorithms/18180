The constrained zzso zzso is an attractive alternative to both the zzso zzso zzso and the least square zzso In this letter, we propose a cooperative zzso neural network zzso for solving zzso zzso problems with general linear zzso The proposed zzso model combines four individual neural network models automatically and is suitable for parallel zzso As a special case, the proposed zzso includes two existing neural networks for solving zzso and constrained zzso zzso problems, zzso Unlike existing neural networks, with penalty zzso for solving the constrained zzso zzso problem, the proposed zzso is guaranteed to zzso globally to the exact optimal solution without any additional zzso Compared with conventional zzso zzso the proposed zzso has a low zzso complexity and can deal with the zzso zzso problem with zzso Several applied examples show that the proposed zzso can obtain more accurate estimates than several existing zzso
