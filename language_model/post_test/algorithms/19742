This paper investigates the problem of how to partition unknown speech zzso into a set of zzso such that each cluster consists of zzso from only one speaker, and the number of clusters reflects the unknown speaker population zzso The proposed method begins by specifying a certain number of zzso corresponding to one of the possible speaker population sizes, and then zzso the level of overall zzso zzso of the zzso voice zzso The zzso zzso is characterized by the likelihood probability that a cluster model, trained using all the zzso within a zzso matches each of the zzso zzso To attain the zzso sum of likelihood probabilities for all zzso the proposed method applies a genetic zzso to determine the cluster in which each zzso should be zzso For greater zzso efficiency, also proposed is a zzso criterion that zzso the likelihood probability with a zzso model similarity between a cluster and each of the zzso zzso The zzso method then examines various legitimate numbers of clusters by adapting the zzso information criterion to determine the most likely speaker population zzso The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over conventional methods based on zzso zzso
