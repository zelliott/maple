zzso fluid dynamic modeling software has enabled zzso patterns of zzso toxins and zzso to be predicted and zzso and is being used in inhalation zzso and risk zzso These predicted zzso patterns in airway structures are derived from predicted zzso patterns within these airways and particle tracking zzso used in zzso fluid dynamics zzso software zzso Although these commercial zzso codes have been tested for accuracy under various conditions, they have not been well tested for respiratory flows in zzso Nor has their particle tracking zzso accuracy been well zzso In this study, three software packages, zzso zzso Phase Model zzso zzso Fine zzso Model zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and diffusion were each isolated in a straight tube geometry and tested for zzso A range of flow rates corresponding to adult low activity zzso ventilation zzso 10 zzso and to heavy exertion zzso ventilation zzso 60 zzso were tested by varying the range of zzso diffusion and zzso parameters found using the zzso zzso 23 generation lung zzso zzso results for fully developed zzso and uniform zzso profiles were compared respectively, to zzso zzso and Yu zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso equations for zzso were also zzso zzso results for zzso deposition were compared to zzso solutions of zzso (1975) for zzso and uniform zzso zzso differences were found among the various zzso software packages and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso it is prudent to validate zzso predictions against zzso solutions in idealized geometry before tackling the complex zzso of the respiratory zzso
