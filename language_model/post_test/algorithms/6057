We propose a new zzso method for the prediction of drug properties, called random feature subset boosting for linear zzso analysis zzso The main novelty of this method is the ability to overcome the problems with constructing ensembles of linear zzso models based on generalized zzso of zzso zzso Such linear models are popular in building zzso zzso zzso The introduction of ensembles of zzso models allows for an analysis of more complex problems than by using single zzso for example, those involving multiple mechanisms of zzso Using four data sets, we show zzso that the method is competitive with other recently studied zzso methods, including support zzso machines and models based on decision zzso We present an easy scheme for interpreting the model despite its apparent zzso We also outline theoretical evidence as to why, contrary to the conventional zzso ensemble algorithm, this method is able to increase the accuracy of zzso zzso
