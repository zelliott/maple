zzso the best treatment for a patient's disease may be facilitated by evaluating clinical characteristics or zzso zzso at zzso We consider how to evaluate the potential impact of such zzso on treatment selection zzso For example, magnetic resonance zzso imaging is potentially useful for deciding whether a patient should be treated surgically for zzso Tunnel zzso or should receive zzso conservative zzso We propose a zzso display, the selection impact zzso curve that shows the population response rate as a function of treatment selection criteria based on the zzso The curve can be useful for choosing a treatment policy that incorporates information on the patient's marker value exceeding a zzso The zzso curve can be estimated using data from a comparative zzso trial conducted in the population as long as treatment assignment in the trial is independent of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso curve is therefore part of a post hoc analysis to determine whether the marker identifies patients that are more likely to benefit from one treatment over zzso zzso and zzso estimates of the zzso curve are proposed in this zzso zzso distribution theory is used to evaluate the relative efficiencies of the zzso zzso studies show that zzso is straightforward with realistic sample zzso We illustrate the zzso curve and statistical zzso for it with data motivated by an ongoing trial of surgery versus conservative therapy for zzso Tunnel zzso
