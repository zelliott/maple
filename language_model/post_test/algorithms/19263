It is possible to detect zzso gas bubbles by listening to the zzso audio zzso However, a serious disadvantage of the audio evaluation is the inability of continuous monitoring and the zzso zzso Several researchers have worked on the automated detection of zzso but no current system has the required sensitivity and specificity for clinical zzso 

We developed software that integrated frequency zzso processing, and detection zzso of zzso into a zzso user zzso The detection zzso consists of a zzso criterion with a zzso threshold sliding zzso axis that estimates the duration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso audio recordings obtained from a high altitude diving expedition were analyzed using digital filtering and zzso operator combinations of the zzso The data set includes 43 zzso events in 9 recordings from 4 different zzso 

It was determined that zzso signals are best differentiated from the background signal at the zzso frequency zzso By using the zzso zzso Energy zzso zzso signals were amplified against their background and a high level of sensitivity and specificity was obtained zzso and zzso zzso The duration of the detected zzso was estimated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The optimal frequency band for the detection of zzso zzso is significantly higher than previous findings for the zzso zzso The duration output of the software can be used to estimate the size and the composition of zzso zzso integration of the software into an ambulatory detection system may provide important zzso bubble size distribution data for zzso zzso
