The awesome degree of structural diversity accessible in zzso design has created a demand for zzso resources that can evaluate a multitude of candidate zzso In our specific case, we translate the zzso design problem to an zzso problem, and use evolutionary zzso zzso in tandem with zzso to carry out a zzso zzso However, the use of zzso in huge search spaces with different zzso may pose certain zzso For example, zzso is prone to focus a search in the first good region zzso This is a problem not only because of the zzso and automatic rejection of potentially good search space regions, but also because the found solution may be extremely difficult to zzso chemically or may even be a false zzso zzso In order to avoid rejecting potentially good solutions and to maximize the molecular diversity of the search, we have implemented evolutionary zzso search techniques, as well as the molecular diversity metric needed by the zzso zzso to measure differences between various regions of the search zzso
