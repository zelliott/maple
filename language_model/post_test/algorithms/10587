Human activity patterns display a zzso dynamics with zzso times following a heavy zzso zzso This behavior has been recently shown to be rooted in the fact that humans assign their active tasks different priorities, a process that can be modeled as a priority zzso system zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso In this Letter we obtain exact results for the zzso model with two tasks, calculating the priority and waiting time distribution of active zzso We demonstrate that the model has a singular behavior in the zzso dynamics limit, when the highest priority task is selected zzso We find that independently of the selection zzso the average waiting time is smaller or equal to the number of active tasks, and discuss the zzso behavior of the waiting time zzso These results have important implications for understanding complex systems with zzso zzso
