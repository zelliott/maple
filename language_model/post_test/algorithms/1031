zzso and topographical differences between two groups, artists and zzso during the performances of visual perception and imagery of paintings were presented by means of zzso phase zzso zzso In artists as compared with zzso significantly higher phase zzso was found in the high frequency beta and gamma bands during the perception of the zzso in the low frequency bands zzso zzso phase zzso was mostly enhanced during zzso Strong decreases in phase zzso of alpha were found primarily in artists for both zzso The right zzso was found to present higher zzso than the left in artists, whereas zzso asymmetry was less significant in zzso In the artists, enhanced zzso in the high frequency band is most likely due to their enhanced binding capabilities of numerous visual zzso and enhanced zzso in the low frequency band seems to be due to the higher involvement of long-term visual memory mostly in zzso Thus, the analysis of phase zzso from zzso signals yields new information about the zzso zzso between zzso zzso during the zzso of visual zzso
