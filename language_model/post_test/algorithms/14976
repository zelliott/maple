The efficiency of zzso design in zzso is limited by the simple fact that the zzso zzso current and slew rate cannot exceed hardware threshold zzso In spiral zzso which requires zzso to be very rapidly switched between positive and negative values, zzso of the acquisition time is achieved by maintaining the current and slew rate as high as possible during the entire zzso Since the current and slew rate compete against each other, an efficient zzso design consists of two parts in which current and slew rate are pushed alternatively to their zzso zzso for these types of zzso can be obtained by solving zzso the equation of motion for the spiral zzso This paper shows that simple but reasonable mathematical approximations deliver reliable zzso zzso Images obtained using these zzso solutions do not show evident zzso when compared with images obtained with zzso zzso
