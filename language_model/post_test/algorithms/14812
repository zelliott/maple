The Juvenile zzso zzso zzso System zzso is an active sensing technology developed by the zzso Army Corps of zzso Portland District, for detecting and tracking small zzso It is used primarily for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile zzso zzso through the Federal Columbia River Power System to the Pacific zzso It provides critical data for salmon protection and development of more zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to design and build a zzso and zzso System zzso for evaluating the zzso zzso because the zzso requires comprehensive acceptance and performance testing in a controlled environment before it is deployed in the zzso The zzso consists of a reference zzso a water test tank lined with zzso material, a motion control unit, a reference receiver, a signal zzso and amplifier unit, a data acquisition board, zzso control and analysis zzso and a zzso The fully integrated zzso has been evaluated successfully at various simulated distances and using different zzso signals at zzso within the bandwidth of the zzso zzso The zzso provides accurate acoustic mapping capability in a controlled environment and zzso the process that allows real-time zzso and evaluation of the zzso zzso sensors, or the acoustic zzso The zzso has been in use since 2009 for acceptance and performance testing of, and further improvements to, the zzso
