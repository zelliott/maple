Experimental data from continuous zzso zzso or protein folding experiments often contain zzso or even thousands, of densely spaced data zzso When the sampling zzso is extremely short, the experimental data points might not be statistically zzso The resulting neighborhood correlation zzso important theoretical assumptions of zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, certain zzso criteria, such as the zzso test and the zzso function, might indicate a systematic lack of fit even if the experiment does agree very well with the underlying theoretical zzso A solution to this problem is to analyze only a subset of the zzso of fit, such that any excessive neighborhood correlation is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the unfolding zzso of zzso zzso a zzso protein from zzso zzso serve as two illustrative zzso A suitable zzso zzso has been incorporated into software zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 237 zzso zzso freely available to all academic researchers from zzso
