We have developed a simulation model to zzso and characterize the response of the public health system and the impact of public health advisories in the event of an intentional contamination of the food zzso The model has three zzso zzso definition of individual exposure over time and the outcomes of exposure, zzso definition of the geographical zzso of zzso and zzso response of the public health authorities to symptomatic zzso The model explicitly considers the variation in the multiple interrelated zzso of the response system, including differences among zzso responses to exposure, variation between health care providers, and the subsequent processing of samples and confirmation of zzso To illustrate use of the model, case studies with zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso in three categories of food vehicle were zzso The level of detail required to run the public health component of the model is not zzso While some data may not be available for hazards of particular interest in potential zzso events, the application of expert judgment permits comparisons between different agents, different system zzso and other assumptions within the zzso The model provides the capacity to study the impact of system changes, to compare scenarios and to zzso the benefits of improvement in terms of averted zzso and risk reduction, and constitutes a significant aid to understanding and managing these zzso Essentially, the model provides an explicit valuation of time saved in the identification and intervention in terrorist events in the food zzso
