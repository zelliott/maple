zzso zzso are estimated from scalp zzso using a realistically shaped zzso head model, by means of the boundary element method zzso A new zzso zzso has been developed to achieve high accuracy to link directly the cortical zzso to the scalp zzso in a realistically shaped zzso head model including the thin zzso skull zzso Computer simulations using a concentric zzso head model have tested this zzso The present study demonstrates that the cortical zzso can be directly estimated from the scalp zzso using the zzso in a realistically shaped zzso head zzso
