Word sense zzso zzso is critical in the biomedical domain for improving the precision of natural language processing zzso text mining, and information retrieval systems because ambiguous words zzso impact accurate access to literature containing zzso entities, such as zzso zzso cells, diseases, and other important zzso zzso techniques have been developed that address the zzso problem for a number of text processing situations, but the problem is still a challenging zzso zzso zzso machine learning zzso methods have been applied in the biomedical domain and have shown promising results, but the results typically incorporate a number of zzso factors, and it is problematic to truly understand the effectiveness and zzso of the methods because these factors interact with each other and affect the final zzso Thus, there is a need to explicitly address the factors and to systematically zzso their effects on zzso 

zzso were designed to measure the effect of zzso zzso zzso size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the distribution of the different zzso of the ambiguous zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the measure of the distances between the zzso of the senses of an ambiguous zzso on the performance of zzso zzso Support zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied to an automatically generated data set containing four ambiguous biomedical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were chosen because of varying degrees of differences in their respective zzso zzso showed that: 1) increasing the sample size generally reduced the error rate, but this was limited mainly to zzso senses zzso cases where the distances between the senses were zzso in difficult cases an unusually large increase in sample size was needed to increase performance slightly, which was zzso 2) the sense distribution did not have an effect on performance when the senses were zzso 3) when there was a majority sense of over zzso the zzso zzso was not better than use of the simple majority sense, 4) error rates were zzso to the similarity of zzso and 5) there was no statistical difference between results when using a zzso or zzso zzso zzso Other issues that impact performance are also zzso 

Several different independent aspects affect performance when using zzso techniques for zzso We found that combining them into one single result obscures understanding of the underlying zzso Although we studied only four zzso we zzso a well-established statistical method that guarantees the results are likely to be zzso for zzso with similar zzso The results of our experiments show that in order to understand the performance of these zzso methods it is critical that papers report on the baseline performance, the distribution and sample size of the senses in the zzso and the standard zzso or confidence zzso In addition, papers should also characterize the difficulty of the zzso task, the zzso situations addressed and not zzso as well as the zzso methods and features zzso This should lead to an improved understanding of the zzso and the limitations of the zzso
