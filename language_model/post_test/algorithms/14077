This paper outlines the framework of a porous flow mixture theory for the mathematical zzso of in zzso tissue growth, and gives an application of this theory to an aspect of tissue zzso The problem is formulated as a set of partial differential equations governing the space and time dependence of the amounts of each component of the tissue zzso together with the physical stresses in each zzso The theory requires zzso relations to specify the material properties of each phase, and also requires relations to specify the stresses developed due to mechanical zzso both within each phase and between different zzso An application of the theory is given to the study of the mobility and zzso of a population of cells seeded into an artificial zzso zzso zzso analysis techniques show that the interplay of the forces between the tissue constituents results in two different zzso either the cells form zzso or disperse through the zzso
