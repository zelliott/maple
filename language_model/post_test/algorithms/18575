We describe here the development of a computer program which uses a new method called Expert System zzso zzso to predict toxic end points and pharmacological properties of chemicals based on multiple zzso created by the zzso artificial intelligence zzso The zzso are generally based on different biological models measuring related end zzso The purpose is to improve the decision making process regarding the overall activity or zzso of the chemicals and also to enable rapid in zzso zzso zzso evaluates the significance of the zzso from a different viewpoint and uses this information for predicting the activity of new zzso We have used a unique zzso system to represent relevant features of a chemical in the form of a pattern zzso and a genetic artificial neural network zzso to gain knowledge of the relationship between these patterns and the overall pharmacological zzso The effectiveness of zzso is illustrated in the prediction of general zzso of a diverse set of chemicals using zzso zzso rats and mice zzso zzso
