There has been intense effort over the past couple of decades to identify zzso underlying quantitative traits as a key step in the process of zzso the zzso of complex zzso Recently there has been some effort to coalesce zzso zzso data, zzso high density zzso and zzso wide zzso zzso to drive understanding of the molecular basis of zzso However, a stumbling block has been the difficult question of how to leverage this information to identify molecular mechanisms that explain quantitative trait zzso zzso We have developed a formal statistical hypothesis test, resulting in a zzso to zzso uncertainty in a zzso zzso pertaining to a measured factor, zzso a molecular species, which potentially mediates a known zzso association between a locus and a quantitative zzso 

We treat the zzso zzso as a zzso of mathematical conditions that must be satisfied to conclude that the potential zzso is zzso for the zzso where the zzso is only as good as the weakest link in the zzso zzso are zzso for the component conditions, which include tests of linkage and conditional zzso The zzso zzso in which a series of statistical tests are combined to form an omnibus test, is then employed to generate the overall test zzso Using computer simulated mouse zzso we show that type I error is low under a variety of conditions that include hidden variables and zzso zzso We show that power under a simple zzso model is comparable to other model selection techniques as well as zzso network reconstruction zzso We further show zzso that this method compares favorably to zzso network reconstruction methods for reconstructing zzso regulatory networks in zzso recovering 7 out of 8 zzso validated zzso 

Here we propose a novel statistical framework in which existing notions of zzso mediation are zzso into a hypothesis test, thus providing a standard quantitative measure of uncertainty in the form of a zzso The method is theoretically and zzso accessible and with the provided software may prove a useful tool in zzso molecular zzso
