The ability of the zzso Carlo zzso particle transport codes zzso and zzso zzso and zzso to model zzso transport at grazing zzso onto zzso blocks has been tested and compared to experimental zzso The test geometry consisted of a narrow zzso beam of two zzso 98 zzso and 180 zzso zzso on a thick zzso zzso block at grazing zzso The distribution of forward zzso from the zzso zzso block was measured with a fluorescent screen viewed with a zzso camera via a zzso In the zzso simulations, the experimental setup was zzso and the dose deposited to the fluorescent screen material was zzso zzso and zzso were made for four different zzso angles zzso zzso zzso and 10 degrees zzso Several different sets of calculations were performed, studying the impact of different zzso settings in the different zzso zzso The study of different parameters settings in the zzso simulation showed a strong dependence of the calculated zzso probability on the maximum allowed step zzso For the largest zzso angle an increase of zzso in the zzso probability was found when restricting the maximum allowed step length to zzso zzso We also observed that the stepping zzso of zzso and zzso introduces a small zzso directional and zzso asymmetry at the exit boundary of the zzso zzso zzso The shape of the energy spectrum of zzso being zzso agreed between the zzso The zzso forward zzso zzso zzso the ratio between the total signal from the zzso beam and the zzso zzso showed a qualitative agreement of simulations compared to zzso zzso the zzso of the simulations reached as high as zzso while the experimental uncertainty was zzso The mean zzso angle of the simulations was within zzso of the measurement for all zzso angles with a measurement uncertainty of zzso
