zzso technology has become a powerful research tool in many fields of study; however, the cost of zzso often results in the use of a low number of replicates zzso Under circumstances where k is low, it becomes difficult to perform standard statistical tests to extract the most biologically significant experimental zzso Other more advanced statistical tests have been zzso however, their use and interpretation often remain difficult to implement in routine biological zzso The present work outlines a method that achieves sufficient statistical power for selecting zzso expressed genes under conditions of low zzso while remaining as an intuitive and zzso efficient zzso 

The present study describes a Global zzso Assessment zzso methodology to select zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso and was developed using an in zzso experiment that compared control and zzso treated skin zzso In this experiment, up to nine replicates were used to confidently estimate error, thereby enabling methods of different statistical power to be zzso Gene expression results of a similar absolute expression are zzso so as to enable a highly accurate local estimate of the mean squared error within zzso The model then relates zzso of gene expression in each bin to absolute expression levels and uses this in a test derived from the classical zzso The zzso selection method is compared with both the classical and zzso zzso tests, and demonstrates an increased stability, zzso and confidence in gene zzso A subset of the selected genes were validated by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso All these results suggest that zzso methodology is zzso suitable for selection of zzso expressed genes in zzso data, zzso intuitive and zzso efficient and zzso especially advantageous under conditions of low zzso
