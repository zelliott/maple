zzso morbidity continues to be a significant complication in patients undergoing zzso based breast zzso The purposes of our study were to critically examine abdominal zzso morbidity and to present our zzso for zzso donor site closure to reduce these zzso 

We performed a retrospective cohort study examining all patients undergoing zzso based free tissue transfer for breast reconstruction from 2005 to 2011 at our zzso Data were analyzed for overall donor site zzso as defined by zzso or zzso for zzso and/or mesh removal and for zzso zzso 

A total of zzso patients underwent zzso free tissue zzso zzso patients zzso experienced zzso zzso including 27 zzso zzso No significant difference in overall abdominal morbidity was found between unilateral and bilateral reconstructions zzso zzso zzso or the use of muscle in the zzso zzso zzso zzso unilateral zzso P zzso zzso zzso Prior lower abdominal surgery was associated with higher rates of zzso morbidity zzso zzso zzso hypertension zzso zzso zzso and multiple medical zzso zzso zzso zzso were also significantly more common in these zzso zzso was the only patient characteristic associated with higher rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso Delayed abdominal would healing was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso these patients were significantly more likely to develop this complication zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso attention must be provided to zzso closure in obese patients and those with hypertension and multiple medical zzso Low rates of abdominal wall morbidity result from meticulous zzso reconstruction and reinforcement and careful attention to zzso soft tissue zzso
