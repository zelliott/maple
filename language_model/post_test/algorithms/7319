We show that the space mapping algorithm, originally developed for zzso circuit zzso can enable the efficient design of zzso zzso devices which satisfy a set of desired zzso Space mapping zzso a zzso coarse model to approximate a fine model accurately describing a zzso Here the fine model is a zzso zzso zzso zzso simulation of the device, while the coarse model is based on transmission line zzso We demonstrate that simply zzso the transmission line model of the device is not enough to obtain a device which zzso all the required design zzso On the other hand, when the zzso space mapping zzso is used, it zzso fast to a design which meets all the zzso In addition, zzso zzso simulations of only a few candidate structures are required before the zzso process is zzso Use of the space mapping zzso therefore results in large reductions in the required zzso time when compared to any direct zzso method of the fine zzso zzso
