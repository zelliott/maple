Current zzso diffuse optical zzso zzso systems can provide large data sets and, in addition, the unknown parameters to be estimated are so numerous that the sensitivity zzso is too large to zzso zzso zzso methods can be used, but they can be extremely slow at zzso when dealing with large zzso A few approaches suitable for the reconstruction of images from very large data sets have been zzso However, they either require explicit construction of the sensitivity zzso suffer from slow zzso times, or can only be applied to restricted zzso We introduce a method for fast reconstruction in zzso with large data and solution spaces, which preserves the resolution of the forward operator whilst zzso its zzso The method does not require construction of the full zzso and thus allows storage and direct inversion of the explicitly constructed compressed system zzso The method is tested using simulated and experimental zzso zzso show that the zzso image reconstruction problem can be effectively compressed without significant loss of information and with the added advantage of reducing image zzso
