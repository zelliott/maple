zzso zzso is the unique and important accessory zzso for monitoring toxic zzso in inland zzso In this study, a zzso zzso combining both three band zzso and a baseline zzso zzso was developed to estimate PC zzso and then tested in three zzso and zzso zzso zzso does not need to zzso zzso as either the traditional baseline zzso or zzso zzso does when it is used across different study zzso zzso evidently zzso some effects of zzso due to colored detritus matter and other zzso and zzso of water zzso zzso accurately estimated PC zzso with zzso and zzso for water samples with the PC range from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso outperformed zzso zzso and a previously proposed zzso zzso for the prediction of low PC zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso Further analysis reveals that both the variations of zzso and zzso are important factors influencing the performance of all PC zzso examined in this study and more efforts are required to improve the performance of zzso on water samples with low PC zzso
