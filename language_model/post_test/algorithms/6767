Many zzso coupled receptors zzso undergo zzso zzso upon zzso The zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso following prolonged exposure to zzso although the ultimate fate of the zzso following zzso is largely zzso To investigate zzso of the zzso zzso we have established a stable cell line expressing a zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso and an zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso were compared with cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso in zzso binding and functional zzso zzso binding studies revealed similar zzso and zzso values in cells expressing either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar in both cell lines suggesting that addition of the zzso to the zzso tail of the zzso zzso does not alter the zzso binding or zzso zzso properties of the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso treatment of cells expressing the zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso compartment which was blocked by zzso with zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso zzso showed that zzso trafficking zzso the zzso recycling zzso zzso using zzso to inhibit protein synthesis demonstrated that recycling of the zzso back to the plasma membrane was complete within 1-2 h of zzso removal and was partially blocked by zzso with zzso D, but not zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso zzso upon recycling to the plasma zzso is capable of undergoing a second round of zzso a finding consistent with a role for zzso recycling in functional zzso
