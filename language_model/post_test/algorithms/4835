The purpose of the present work was to validate the zzso by means of plasma fatty acid zzso 

The study sample consisted of 189 men zzso years old) and 185 women zzso years zzso randomly selected from the zzso study zzso All participants completed a food frequency questionnaire (the zzso zzso and a modified version of the zzso zzso zzso was then calculated to evaluate the level of adherence to the Mediterranean zzso Plasma and dietary fatty acids were zzso 

zzso analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between the zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso fatty acids to saturated fatty acids zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and inverse correlations between the diet score and zzso fatty acids zzso of the sum of zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso saturated fatty acids zzso zzso and total zzso fatty acids zzso zzso The effect size of the relationships between the zzso and fatty acids was better than the relationships with the initial version of the diet zzso 

Our findings suggest that the modified zzso is a valid measure of various plasma fatty zzso and may prove a useful tool in assessing diet quality of zzso
