Linking structural effects of zzso to functional outcomes is a major issue in structural zzso and many tools and studies have shown that specific structural properties such as stability and zzso burial can be used to distinguish neutral variations and disease associated zzso 

We have investigated 39 structural properties on a set of zzso and disease zzso from the zzso zzso Base that could be mapped on high quality crystal structures and show that none of these properties can be used as a sole zzso criterion to separate the two data zzso Furthermore, we have reviewed the zzso process from zzso to result and identified the liabilities in each zzso 

Although excellent zzso results of various research groups underline the great potential of using structural zzso to investigate the mechanisms underlying disease, the interpretation of such zzso cannot always be zzso to zzso wide variation zzso zzso for large-scale studies can be found both on the technical level, zzso the zzso of data and the incompleteness of the structural tool suites, and on the conceptual level, zzso the correct interpretation of the results in a cellular zzso
