Brain CT is widely used to exclude or confirm acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the value of zzso measurement and the zzso ratio on zzso brain CT scans in the diagnosis of acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective study evaluated 20 patients with acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso and zzso control participants without zzso Three experienced observers independently evaluated the zzso brain CT scan for the presence of cerebral zzso zzso zzso and measured the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso differences were zzso as well as zzso and zzso ratio between patients with acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso and control zzso 

A significant difference in the average zzso zzso was found between patients with acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A similar difference was found for the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in patients with and without cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso thresholds of 62 zzso and zzso lead to zzso of zzso for average zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso ratio, zzso 

zzso and the zzso ratio in the zzso zzso on zzso brain CT scans have a high accuracy in the detection of acute cerebral zzso zzso zzso
