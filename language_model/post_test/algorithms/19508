We consider the problems of zzso cancer zzso from gene expression zzso After discussing the zzso zzso zzso model with zzso gene selection, we propose two zzso gene selection zzso one employs different strongest genes for different zzso zzso the other employs the same strongest genes for all zzso Some fast zzso issues for zzso gene selection are discussed, including zzso of the strongest genes and zzso zzso of the zzso errors using zzso zzso The proposed gene selection techniques are applied to zzso real breast cancer data, small round zzso zzso the national cancer institute's zzso zzso data and acute zzso zzso Compared with existing zzso cancer zzso our proposed methods can find which genes are the most important genes affecting which kind of zzso Also, the strongest genes selected using our methods are consistent with the biological zzso The recognition zzso are very high using our proposed zzso
