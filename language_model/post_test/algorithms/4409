zzso flutter zzso and zzso zzso zzso generate patterns in the zzso which have some similarity to a normal zzso Therefore their detection is an important step of zzso recognition as well as zzso detection is for zzso block zzso Many approaches to zzso identification are based on correlation with a manually selected zzso The developed method and zzso use a universal zzso template and apply a modified zzso for zzso zzso In order to emphasize the true zzso the sample differences between the template and zzso candidates are introduced in a zzso Each zzso is calculated twice with a shifted template, which locates once its first term closely to the corresponding signal sample and zzso does the same with its middle zzso The zzso sum is compared with zzso threshold zzso to mark zzso zzso To accelerate the zzso process, the two zzso are accomplished only if a preliminary zzso over a reduced number of samples gives an outcome higher than the decreased threshold zzso Further, a rule for zzso recognition is zzso The results show that missed or wrong zzso zzso are observed in a limited number of zzso zzso They do not hamper the discovery of zzso zzso The zzso can be successfully used for such cases except for prediction of zzso zzso The mean delay in zzso onset recognition over a 10 h recording taken from zzso is zzso zzso This value for zzso offset is zzso zzso As a zzso detector is a part of the zzso detection algorithm, both of them may be applied also for zzso block zzso
