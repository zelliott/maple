Nearly every zzso zzso a significant change in structure after binding it's zzso Experimental and theoretical analyses of the role of changes in zzso reverse zzso structure in selecting a correct zzso are zzso zzso detailed simulations using the zzso method predict a rate and free energy profile of the zzso change commensurate with experimental zzso A large zzso change occurring on a zzso zzso locks the correct zzso at the active site but promotes release of a mismatched zzso The positions along the reaction coordinate that decide the yield of the reaction are not determined by the chemical zzso Rather, the initial steps of weak zzso binding and protein zzso transition significantly enrich the yield of a reaction with a correct zzso whereas the same steps diminish the reaction probability of an incorrect zzso
