zzso dose zzso between two planning target volumes zzso as may be required for simultaneous integrated boosts zzso should be an option provided by zzso zzso The aim was to zzso the geometry of the zzso problem and to implement the results in an zzso for zzso segment generation zzso zzso intensity modulated zzso zzso zzso It was hypothesized that a gap between segments directed to the inner and the outer zzso would zzso the dose zzso The mathematical relationships were derived from the individual dose levels and the geometry zzso of the zzso The results generated by means of zzso zzso segments were equivalent or better than the segment generation using a commercial zzso planning zzso The dose to both the inner and the outer zzso was clearly more homogeneous and the composite objective value was the zzso The segment numbers were lower or zzso better sparing of the surrounding zzso In zzso it was demonstrated that zzso zzso was able to achieve steep dose zzso for zzso zzso
