To compare the outcome of two different zzso zzso zzso methods in permanent seed zzso 

Between October 1999 and October 2002, 150 patients with low-risk prostate zzso were treated with zzso and zzso in our zzso A zzso image fusion protocol was used in 21 consecutive patients treated with exclusive zzso The accuracy and zzso of the method was zzso and then the zzso zzso was compared with the zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso related parameters recommended by the American zzso Society and the American Association of Physicists in zzso 

Our method for zzso image fusion was accurate and zzso zzso shift zzso zzso zzso in prostate volume were found, depending on the image zzso zzso Quality assurance zzso parameters strongly depended on the image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Those results depend on the institutional implant technique and reflect the importance of lowering zzso and zzso discrepancies when outlining prostate and zzso at risk for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso fused images allow accurate determination of prostate size, significantly improving the zzso evaluation based on zzso zzso This provides a consistent method to judge a prostate seed zzso zzso
