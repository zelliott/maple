The zzso of zzso zzso conditions in the optical system with zzso zzso wave zzso for bacteria species identification based on zzso patterns is analyzed by digital holographic zzso The obtained results have shown that the colonies of analyzed bacteria species act as biological zzso with the zzso light focusing properties, which are characterized and monitored by means of phase retrieval from zzso captured digital zzso This significantly affects the location of zzso patterns observation plane, which is continuously shifted across optical axis in zzso
