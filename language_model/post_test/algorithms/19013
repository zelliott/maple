The American Board of zzso objective grading system zzso zzso is currently the gold standard for evaluating plaster casts of completed zzso zzso 

zzso cases of finished zzso casts in plaster and digital form were scored by using 2 zzso an electronic version of the zzso zzso designed to be used with digital casts zzso zzso Fairview, zzso and the zzso gauge designed to be used with plaster zzso The 2 scoring methods were compared using descriptive analysis zzso absolute mean difference, and standard zzso the zzso rank correlation zzso and the zzso rank sum zzso 

zzso reliability was high for both the plaster and the digital casts zzso zzso zzso A statistically significant difference zzso zzso was found when comparing the total zzso scores from the plaster and digital zzso The scores from digital casts exceeded the scores from plaster casts by an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference was due to statistically significant differences in 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The results indicate that this computer version of the zzso zzso cannot be used as a substitute for manual grading with the zzso zzso
