Two main types of model structures have been proposed for the zzso of zzso an empirical model structure based on total plasma zzso of zzso and a zzso model structure derived from both total and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso vehicle zzso zzso The purpose was to compare the two zzso model structures when only total zzso zzso are zzso To support the zzso model structure with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were obtained from simulations of a zzso model available in the zzso Local zzso zzso was tested on both model zzso the zzso model structure was found, with high zzso not to be zzso zzso if total zzso concentration is considered to be the only model zzso and if no kind of prior information is zzso zzso analysis was performed to reveal which zzso should be fixed in order to make it locally zzso zzso zzso was then performed on both model structures using zzso mixed effects and data from a clinical zzso The estimated zzso model turned out to have a somewhat better fit to data than the corresponding empirical model, delta zzso where zzso is the zzso Information zzso zzso validation was performed on three patients, but did not zzso any of the zzso In conclusion, since the zzso model structure behaved at least as good as the empirical model structure, it is suggested that the former model structure should be used since it offers a more accurate description of the zzso
