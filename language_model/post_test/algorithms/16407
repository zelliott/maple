zzso techniques have been used for considerable time to predict population zzso zzso usually rely on frequency counts for numbers of zzso however, it may be the case that these are not available for a particular problem, for example if the original data set has been lost and only a summary table is zzso Here, we investigate techniques for specific zzso the motivating example is an epidemiology study by zzso et zzso which zzso on a zzso outbreak in East zzso To demonstrate the wider range of the technique, we also look at a study for predicting the long-term outlook of the AIDS epidemic using information on number of sexual zzso A new zzso is developed here which uses the zzso zzso to zzso zzso values and then uses these values in a similar way to the existing zzso The results show that a truncated approach zzso mimicking the Chao lower bound approach zzso gives an improved estimate when population zzso is zzso
