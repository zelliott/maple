It has been hypothesized that the level of zzso wall stress zzso is a feedback signal that regulates the level of zzso Thus, low levels of zzso may signify inappropriate zzso 

To characterize left zzso zzso structure and zzso function in zzso subjects with low levels of zzso we studied zzso zzso zzso function was studied by zzso zzso zzso Partition values for zzso were derived from a separate group of normal subjects, and the study population was divided into low stress zzso I, zzso zzso zzso high stress zzso III, zzso zzso zzso and intermediate stress group II zzso zzso zzso zzso chamber and zzso function were characterized by relating zzso at the zzso and at the zzso respectively, to zzso 

As expected, group III patients had the highest values for zzso blood pressure and zzso cavity size but the lowest values for wall thickness and relative wall zzso Surprisingly, however, there were no significant differences among stress groups with regard to age or body mass zzso zzso to the hypothesis that low levels of stress are indicative of excessive zzso there were no significant differences among the 3 groups with regard to zzso mass or any form of zzso mass zzso Furthermore, despite lower mean values for zzso group I patients had significantly lower values for zzso zzso and this finding was indicative of reduced zzso zzso zzso plots demonstrated that zzso of group I patients fell below zzso zzso compared with zzso of group II and only zzso of group III zzso 

zzso subjects with low values for zzso have more concentric zzso geometry zzso relative wall zzso and, on average, reduced zzso zzso
