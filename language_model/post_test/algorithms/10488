Patient studies based on diffusion zzso images zzso require spatial correspondence between zzso We propose to obtain the correspondence from white matter zzso by introducing a new method for zzso matching of white matter fiber tracts in zzso The method zzso down to point set registration that involves simultaneously zzso and matching of the data zzso The tracts are implicitly warped to a common frame of reference to avoid the potential bias toward one of the zzso The zzso gradually zzso from global to local zzso which is implemented through deterministic zzso Special care was taken to incorporate the spatial relation between fiber points and the uncertainty in principal diffusion zzso As a result, the zzso clusters are oriented along the fiber tracts and discriminate between adjacent but distinct fiber zzso This is validated on synthetic and clinical zzso The zzso distance with respect to zzso landmarks is low (3 zzso In contrast to a state-of-the-art zzso registration technique, the proposed method is more robust to residual zzso in terms of measured fractional zzso zzso
