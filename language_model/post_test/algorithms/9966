Sharp waves zzso are irregular waves that originate in field zzso and spread throughout the zzso when animals are alert but immobile or as a component of the sleep zzso The work described here used rat zzso slices to investigate the factors that initiate zzso and govern their zzso Acute zzso of the mossy fibers reduced the zzso but not the frequency of zzso suggesting that activity in the zzso zzso may zzso but is not essential for, the zzso zzso However, selective destruction of the zzso cells and mossy fibers by in zzso zzso injections profoundly depressed zzso zzso zzso mossy fiber release with an zzso zzso zzso or enhancing it with zzso respectively depressed or increased the zzso of zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso can be triggered by zzso release from the mossy zzso The waves were not followed by large zzso zzso and their frequency was not strongly affected by zzso of various slow zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also had little effect on zzso It appears from these results that the spacing of zzso is not dictated by slow zzso However, modeling work suggests that the frequency and zzso of large zzso from the mossy zzso can account for the zzso distribution of the zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso release from the mossy fiber terminal zzso regulates the zzso of zzso and their contribution to information processing in zzso
