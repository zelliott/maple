In this paper, we present a texture zzso procedure that makes use of a blind zzso zzso Specifically, the texture is modeled as the output of a linear system driven by a zzso zzso We show that features zzso from one-dimensional slices extracted from the two-dimensional zzso function zzso of the zzso zzso allows representing the texture for zzso zzso zzso The two-dimensional zzso problem is thus zzso to a more simple one-dimensional one, which leads to a significant reduction of the zzso procedure zzso zzso
