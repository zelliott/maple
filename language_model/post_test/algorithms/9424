Advances in biology and engineering have enabled the zzso of cells with zzso functions, leading to the emergence of synthetic zzso Early successes in this nascent field suggest its potential to impact diverse zzso Here, we examine the feasibility of engineering circuits for zzso zzso We illustrate the basic concepts by describing the mapping of several zzso problems to engineered gene zzso zzso around these examples and past studies, we discuss technologies and zzso methods available to design, test, and zzso gene zzso We conclude with discussion of challenges involved in a typical design cycle, as well as those specific to cellular zzso
