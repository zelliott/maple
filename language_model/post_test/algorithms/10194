The zzso model zzso and extended zzso model zzso have become a standard for the analysis of dynamic zzso zzso In this study, a mathematical analysis is used to identify exactly in which tissue types the zzso models may be zzso The results show that the TM is accurate if and only if the tissue is zzso zzso zzso blood zzso The zzso is additionally accurate in highly zzso zzso zzso blood zzso In zzso that are highly zzso or where zzso exchange is very fast or very slow, TM and zzso accurately fit the data but lead to a zzso of the zzso In tissue types with intermediate zzso zzso and zzso exchange, neither model offers a good fit to the tissue zzso A good fit can be obtained with a measured input function by reducing the zzso resolution, but this does not improve the accuracy of the zzso In conclusion, the zzso models only produce reliable zzso values if the tissue is zzso zzso zzso or zzso or highly zzso zzso Without prior knowledge that at least one of these constraints is zzso the zzso interpretation of the values produced by the zzso models is zzso
