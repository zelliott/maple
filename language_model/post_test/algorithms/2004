zzso zzso could lead to cerebral zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, findings of zzso zzso in poorly managed diabetes in humans and animal models are rather zzso We have characterized the cerebral zzso consequences of zzso zzso from the onset to the chronic stage in a zzso rat model of zzso In zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso was used to measure over 20 zzso zzso Upon the onset of zzso zzso zzso increases in brain zzso levels were accompanied by increases in zzso and zzso bodies, all of which remained consistently high through the chronic state of over 10 weeks of zzso Only after over 4 weeks of zzso the levels of other zzso including zzso and zzso were significantly reduced and these zzso persisted into the chronic zzso However, zzso transport was not altered in chronic zzso of over 10 zzso When zzso levels were acutely restored to zzso some zzso changes were zzso indicating the impact of prolonged uncontrolled zzso on the zzso Furthermore, progressive changes in zzso levels from control to acute and chronic conditions demonstrated the utility of zzso magnetic resonance zzso as a zzso tool in monitoring the disease progression in zzso
