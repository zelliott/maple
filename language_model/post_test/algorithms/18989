When analyzing the results of zzso experiments, biologists generally use zzso categorization zzso However, such tools regard each time point as an independent dimension and zzso the zzso distance to zzso the similarities between zzso Furthermore, some of these methods require the number of clusters to be determined in advance, which is clearly impossible in the case of a new zzso zzso this study proposes a novel zzso designated as the zzso zzso zzso zzso algorithm, to analyze the trends of expressions based on their variation over zzso The proposed zzso has two zzso First, it is unnecessary to determine the number of clusters in advance since the zzso automatically detects those genes whose profiles are grouped together and creates patterns for these zzso Second, the zzso features a new measurement criterion for calculating the degree of change of the expressions between adjacent time points and evaluating their trend zzso Three real-world zzso zzso are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed zzso
