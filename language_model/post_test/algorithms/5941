zzso biological pathways across microbial zzso is a highly important technique in functional studies of biological zzso zzso methods mainly rely on zzso zzso gene zzso which often leads to zzso mapping results because zzso information alone does not contain sufficient information for accurate identification of zzso zzso Here we present an zzso for zzso mapping across microbial zzso The zzso takes into account both sequence similarity and zzso structure information such as zzso and zzso One basic premise of our approach is that a microbial zzso could generally be zzso into a few zzso or zzso We formulated the zzso problem to map genes across zzso to maximize their sequence similarity under the constraint that the mapped genes be grouped into a few zzso preferably zzso in the target zzso We have developed an zzso zzso for solving this constrained zzso problem and implemented the zzso as a computer software program, zzso We have tested zzso on a number of known zzso zzso We conclude that using zzso structure information as constraints could greatly improve the zzso accuracy over methods that use zzso information zzso
