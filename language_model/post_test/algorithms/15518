No procedure has yet been identified as the zzso zzso for the detection and treatment of common zzso duct stones zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso This prospective study involves zzso patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso The zzso for diagnostic management in place until July 1997 involved routine intravenous zzso and selective zzso retrograde zzso zzso zzso assessment of the zzso duct was not routinely performed, but a scoring system was applied to single out those patients at risk of zzso who should undergo intravenous zzso and/or zzso (see zzso zzso Whenever zzso duct stones were found, zzso zzso zzso was performed, and zzso was performed with a standardized zzso technique after zzso zzso duct stone zzso Common zzso duct stones were suspected in 340 patients who were referred for zzso zzso 250 patients were referred for zzso 21 patients were referred for open surgery because of failure of zzso or zzso Common zzso duct stones, detected in 283 cases zzso were removed before surgery in 250 cases zzso and during surgery in 28 cases zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso of the patients after zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso of the zzso The conversion rate was zzso if zzso had been performed previously and zzso after standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The morbidity rate was zzso zzso zzso During follow-up five patients zzso had retained stones zzso zzso Future trials of novel strategies for detecting and treating zzso should compare the results of novel strategies with those of the strategy employed in this study, which includes selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso
