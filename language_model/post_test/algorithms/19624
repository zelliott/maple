zzso zzso zzso is widely used to record zzso blood zzso changes in human brain zzso However, the changes in the zzso signal upon increased flow are influenced not only by the zzso and zzso zzso but also by changes in light scattering by various brain zzso This paper points out the large contribution of zzso red blood cell zzso zzso as a cause of this altered light zzso a phenomenon which has not previously been considered in the theoretical analysis of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso which constitute a major zzso in the zzso not only absorb light at zzso molecules but also scatter it strongly at the cell zzso of zzso zzso and that the blood optical density per zzso changes greatly with the size of the plasma zzso which varies according to zzso When local blood flow increases by zzso the amount of the optical zzso due to zzso zzso (the flow zzso can reach zzso of the zzso signal change for zzso zzso The reasons why the optical signal due to blood zzso alone can be amount to less than zzso of the total are because the zzso lies in the most zzso range in the zzso zzso spectrum for determining blood zzso while the flow effect in the zzso range is zzso We conclude that reported zzso changes in brain blood zzso at least in the peripheral region around the zzso focus, based on zzso can be mainly ascribed to the flow effect arising from zzso zzso with increased flow in the zzso zzso
