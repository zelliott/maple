zzso cancer is the third most common cancer and one of the leading causes of zzso death in the zzso zzso identification of zzso with potential in recognizing the biological characteristics is a key problem for early diagnosis of colon cancer zzso In this study, we used a random forest approach to discover zzso based on a set of zzso zzso data of colon zzso zzso zzso was used to validate the related expression levels of zzso selected by our zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of each zzso in both training and test sample zzso Finally, we analyzed the clinical significance of each zzso based on their differential zzso A single zzso consisting of 4 genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso was selected by random forests with an average sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso The differential expression levels of each zzso was validated by real-time zzso in 48 test colon cancer samples compared to the matched normal zzso Patients with high expression of zzso and zzso and low expression of zzso and zzso had a significantly reduced median survival rate compared to colon cancer zzso The results indicate that our approach can be employed for zzso identification based on zzso zzso These 4 genes identified by our approach have the potential to act as clinical zzso for the early diagnosis of colon zzso
