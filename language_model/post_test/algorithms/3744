Suppose that a family of rooted zzso trees zzso with different sets zzso of leaves is zzso A zzso for the family is a single rooted tree T whose leaf set is the union of all the zzso such that the branching information in T zzso to the branching information in all the trees zzso This paper proposes a zzso method zzso that makes essential use of distance information provided by the trees zzso to construct a rooted tree zzso When a zzso also containing the distance information exists, then zzso is a zzso The zzso zzso often shows increased resolution over the trees found by methods that zzso only the zzso of the input zzso When no zzso exists because the input trees are incompatible, several zzso of the method are described which still produce trees with zzso zzso
