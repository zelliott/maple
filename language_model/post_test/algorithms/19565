Two zzso methods for determining serum zzso zzso zzso at a Veterans Affairs medical center were zzso 

The data for zzso at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center who received zzso zzso and had zzso zzso recorded in 2003 were included in this retrospective zzso zzso clearance was estimated by the zzso and Gault zzso Volume of distribution and zzso clearance were calculated for each patient, using the Leonard and zzso method and the zzso and Ambrose zzso The zzso and Beal method for determining precision and bias was used to evaluate whether the two methods significantly differed in their ability to predict zzso 

Of the 223 patients identified, 122 patients were included, and 212 zzso were zzso The population was mostly male and had a mean age of zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso confidence intervals for relative precision and relative bias between the two zzso In patients whose weight was within zzso of their ideal body weight zzso the Leonard and zzso method was significantly more precise and less biased in predicting zzso In patients whose weight exceeded zzso of their zzso the zzso and Ambrose method was less biased and tended to be more precise, although the difference in precision was not zzso 

Both methods yielded similar predictability for zzso in a veterans zzso The Leonard and zzso method better predicted zzso in patients weighing within zzso of their zzso while the zzso and Ambrose method appeared to be more appropriate for calculating zzso zzso in patients whose weight exceeded zzso of their zzso
