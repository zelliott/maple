zzso the relationship between a search zzso and the space of problems is a fundamental issue in the zzso zzso In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate zzso of problems under zzso of distribution zzso zzso By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group zzso problems according to the behavior of the zzso Throughout the definition of an zzso relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in zzso classes in which the zzso has the same zzso We show that only the zzso model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and zzso it zzso the number of different behaviors that the zzso can zzso As a natural consequence of our zzso all the objective functions are in the same zzso class when the zzso does not impose restrictions to the zzso zzso The zzso of problems, which is also valid for finite zzso is studied in depth for a simple zzso that considers independence among the variables of the zzso We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the zzso between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a zzso In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between zzso zzso and the neighborhood system induced by the zzso distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local zzso and that they are in the same ranking zzso Finally, we carry out zzso simulations in order to analyze the different behaviors that the zzso can exhibit for the functions defined over the search space zzso see zzso
