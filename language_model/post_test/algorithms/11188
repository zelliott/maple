zzso alignment using evolutionary profiles is a commonly employed tool when investigating a zzso Many zzso scoring functions have been developed for use in such zzso but there has not yet been a comprehensive study of zzso optimal zzso alignments for combining multiple such zzso We show that the problem of generating zzso optimal zzso alignments has an optimal zzso property, and develop an efficient zzso for generating zzso optimal frontiers of zzso zzso All possible sets of two, three, and four profile scoring functions are used from a pool of 11 functions and applied to 588 pairs of proteins in the zzso data zzso The performance of the best objective combinations on zzso is also evaluated on an independent set of zzso protein pairs extracted from the zzso zzso data zzso Our zzso zzso approach produces zzso zzso optimal frontiers of zzso alignments that contain comparable alignments to those on the exact zzso but on average in less than zzso the time in the case of four zzso Our results show that the zzso frontiers contain alignments whose quality is better than the alignments obtained by single zzso However, the task of identifying a single high-quality alignment among those in the zzso frontier remains zzso
