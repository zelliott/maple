zzso of zzso such as blood, zzso and air, plays a major role in the normal physiology of all living zzso Within individual organ systems, flow fields may significantly influence the transport of zzso including nutrients and chemical zzso to and from the zzso vessel walls zzso and zzso zzso fluid dynamics zzso provides a potentially useful tool for biologists and zzso investigating zzso disposition in these flow fields in both normal and disease zzso Application of zzso is dependent upon generation of accurate representations of the geometry of the system of interest in the form of a zzso zzso The present zzso which were based on studies of the zzso of zzso zzso gases in the respiratory tract of zzso provide computer programs for the generation of finite element zzso from serial tissue zzso These programs, which interface with a commercial finite element fluid dynamics simulation package zzso zzso zzso zzso International, Evanston, zzso permit simulation of fluid flow in the complex zzso and local zzso mass flux to the vessel walls of biological zzso The use of these programs and their application to studies of respiratory tract zzso are zzso
