This paper examines a zzso representation technique designed for the support of zzso learning in zzso zzso An interesting feature of the many zzso neural sheets in the brain is that closely packed receptive fields must overlap in order to fully cover a spatial zzso This raises interesting scientific questions with engineering zzso zzso is overlap zzso does it have any zzso This paper examines the effects and properties of overlap between elements arranged in zzso or zzso In particular we investigate how overlap affects the representation and transmission of spatial location information on and between zzso zzso Through a series of experiments we determine the conditions under which overlap offers advantages and identify useful ranges of overlap for building zzso in cognitive robotic zzso Our motivation is to understand the phenomena of overlap in order to provide guidance for application in zzso learning zzso
