The zzso approach is a general framework for zzso association analysis, incorporating several previously proposed methods such as the zzso test and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this report, I examine the properties of methods based on a zzso approach when applied to a linked marker rather than (or in addition to) the true disease locus or zzso and when applied to zzso that have been zzso on, or that may simply contain, multiple affected zzso Through simulations and zzso calculations, I show that the expected values of the observed relative risk parameters zzso quantities such as effects due to a child's own zzso maternal zzso and zzso depend zzso on the zzso scheme used, as well as on whether there is zzso zzso between the true disease locus and the locus under zzso In the presence of either zzso or zzso on multiple affected zzso methods based on conditioning on parental zzso are shown to give unbiased zzso relative risk estimates at the true disease locus (or zzso but biased estimates of population zzso relative risks at a linked marker, suggesting that the resulting estimates may be misleading when used to predict the power of future zzso zzso that allow for zzso of parental zzso are shown (in the presence of either zzso or zzso on multiple affected zzso to produce zzso evidence of maternal zzso effects when there are true zzso or zzso interaction effects, even when analyzing the true zzso These results suggest that care should be taken in both the interpretation and application of zzso estimates obtained from zzso genetic association zzso
