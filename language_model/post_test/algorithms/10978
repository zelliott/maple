zzso of a zzso simulation program for the zzso system of human zzso zzso of the zzso errors and their correction with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso power with this zzso 

The program is accomplished in Pascal programming zzso 

zzso the formulas derived from zzso zzso we can calculate all the zzso characteristics of human zzso With this program we can calculate the power of an air zzso of a contact lens and power of an zzso 

This program simulate the zzso system and zzso errors of the human zzso Its necessary to know all the parameters of the zzso system of the eye to calculate the power of an zzso This program can be used in an educational and research zzso
