Pulse zzso is widely used in the critical care setting, but few studies have examined its usefulness in clinical decision zzso One area where pulse zzso might be useful is in the zzso of fractional inspired zzso concentration zzso in zzso zzso Unfortunately, documented guidelines for this use do not exist, and in a survey of directors of intensive care units, we found that they employed a wide range of target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we undertook a study to determine if zzso could be reliably zzso for zzso of zzso zzso tension zzso when adjusting zzso in zzso zzso We examined a number of zzso target values in 54 critically ill patients aiming for a zzso of greater than or equal to 60 zzso zzso while minimizing the risk of zzso zzso In white patients, we found that a zzso target of 92 percent was reliable in predicting a satisfactory level of zzso However, in black patients, such a zzso reading was commonly associated with significant zzso zzso as low as 49 zzso zzso and a higher zzso target, 95 percent, was zzso In addition, inaccurate zzso readings zzso greater than 4 percent difference between zzso and direct zzso zzso were more common in black (27 percent) than in white patients (11 percent, p less than zzso In conclusion, a zzso target of 92 percent was reliable when zzso supplemental zzso in white patients receiving mechanical zzso however, in black patients, such a zzso reading was commonly associated with significant zzso and a higher zzso target, 95 percent, was required to ensure a satisfactory level of zzso
