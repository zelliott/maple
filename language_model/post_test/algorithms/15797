An unknown protein structure can be predicted with fair accuracy once an evolutionary connection at the sequence level has been made to a protein of known 3-D zzso In model building by zzso one typically starts with a backbone zzso zzso new loop regions, and replaces zzso side zzso Here, we use an extremely efficient zzso Carlo zzso in zzso space with simulated zzso and simple potential energy functions to zzso the packing of side chains on given backbone zzso zzso models are generated within minutes on a zzso with reasonable accuracy zzso of zzso side chain zzso 1 zzso angles correct in the zzso of proteins determined at better than zzso A zzso As expected, the quality of the models decreases with decreasing accuracy of backbone zzso If the zzso was taken from a zzso rather than the same zzso about zzso side chain zzso 1 angles were modeled correctly in the core in a case of strong zzso and about zzso in a case of medium zzso The zzso can be used in zzso fast, and zzso model building by zzso
