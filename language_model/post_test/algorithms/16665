Network studies of human brain structural connectivity have identified a specific set of brain regions that are both highly connected and highly zzso Recent analyses have shown that these putative hub regions are mutually and densely zzso forming a zzso zzso within the human zzso Here we show that the set of pathways linking rich club regions forms a central zzso zzso backbone for global brain zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso data of two sets of 40 healthy subjects were used to map structural brain zzso The contributions to network cost and communication capacity of global zzso connections were assessed through measures of their zzso and spatial zzso Rich club connections were found to be more costly than predicted by their density alone and accounted for zzso of the total communication zzso Furthermore, zzso of all minimally short paths between zzso pairs were found to travel through the rich club and a large proportion of these communication paths consisted of ordered sequences of edges zzso zzso that first fed into, then zzso and finally exited the rich club, while passing through zzso of increasing and then decreasing zzso The prevalence of short paths that follow such ordered degree sequences suggests that neural communication might take advantage of strategies for dynamic zzso of information between brain regions, with an important role for a highly central rich zzso Taken together, our results show that rich club connections make an important contribution to zzso signal traffic, forming a central zzso zzso backbone for global brain zzso
