To develop a Bloch wave framework for zzso contrast derived from coherent or incoherent scattering of an electron probe focused onto a zzso boundary conditions which influence the propagation of an arbitrarily distorted coherent electron probe are zzso These boundary conditions are particularly relevant for a probe focused within a unit cell, and lead to a general theory which hinges on Bloch wave zzso zzso being written as a function of beam position and zzso Whereas zzso Bloch states are not excited for an incident plane wave at an exact zone axis orientation, these states may be strongly excited depending on probe focus and position within the unit zzso zzso for both coherent and incoherent lattice image contrast in scanning transmission electron zzso are derived for any detector zzso in the Bloch wave zzso An equivalent expression amenable to evaluation via zzso techniques is also zzso It is shown explicitly how mixed dynamic form factors for incoherent scattering should be taken into account for zzso dark field or zzso electron zzso as well as for characteristic losses detected by X-ray emissions or by electron energy loss zzso A background contribution from zzso electrons is included in the zzso The contribution of zzso from zzso columns to incoherent contrast is examined within the context of this theoretical zzso
