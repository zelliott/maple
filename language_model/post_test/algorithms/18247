zzso of zzso groups to form a zzso de bond is one of the most common zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso de bonds play important roles in stabilizing three-dimensional structure and modulating zzso of the zzso zzso The determination of zzso de bond linkage is therefore an integral part of structural characterization of zzso A mass zzso strategy utilizing chemical zzso at zzso zzso following zzso reaction is described for the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso de bond linkage in zzso The method has been particularly powerful for the assignment of zzso de bonds in proteins containing adjacent or closely spaced zzso
