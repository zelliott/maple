We examine the evolutionary dynamics of zzso and zzso zzso between a zzso gene and a nuclear gene under two mating system models relevant to hybrid zzso In the first model, in which female mating preference is determined by an zzso interaction between the two zzso permanent zzso zzso zzso are possible for a variety of initial zzso zzso particularly when rates of zzso mating for the two parental species are zzso In contrast, when mating preference is effectively determined by interaction between a zzso gene and the zzso nuclear zzso characteristic of the parental species, all zzso zzso as well as zzso of pure zzso rapidly zzso to zero unless zzso mating is nearly zzso zzso of the models are applied to the interpretation of observed zzso associations in a hybrid population of zzso tree zzso
