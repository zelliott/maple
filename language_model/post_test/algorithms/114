Using the zzso dynamics of the movement of hydrated zzso in a viscous water solution, a mathematical model has been built, which describes the transport of charged particles through a single protein pore in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso currents on zzso zzso in solution have been zzso It was shown that, if the geometry of a membrane pore is identical to that of the inner part of the zzso zzso channel and there is no zzso zzso then the values of both zzso and sodium currents are not greater than zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of these zzso If local charge zzso caused by charged zzso acid zzso of zzso protein segments is included into the model calculations, the zzso current increases to about zzso zzso which exceeds more than seven times the value for sodium zzso under the conditions of the complex channel geometry in the range of zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso The model takes changes in the density of charge distribution both inside the channel and near the protein surface into zzso The zzso of pore geometry can be also considered as a zzso at the zzso zzso Thus, the model appears as an effective tool for the description of zzso currents for other types of membrane zzso
