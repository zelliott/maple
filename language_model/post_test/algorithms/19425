zzso zzso have become a standard experimental platform for studies of zzso expression zzso Their success is due, in part, to the multiple zzso features zzso against each transcript zzso zzso This multiple testing allows for more robust background assessments and gene expression measures, and has permitted the development of many zzso methods to translate image data into a single zzso zzso for zzso transcript zzso There are now many probe set zzso that have been developed, with a gradual movement away from zzso methods zzso to zzso zzso methods zzso zzso zzso Data interpretation is often profoundly changed by choice of algorithm, with disoriented biologists questioning what the zzso interpretation of their experiment zzso Here, we zzso the debate concerning probe set zzso We provide examples of how changes in mismatch weight, zzso and construction of expression ratios each dramatically change data zzso All interpretations can be considered as zzso appropriate, but with varying biological zzso We also illustrate the performance of two new hybrid zzso zzso zzso relative to more traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using an interactive power analysis zzso zzso appears superior to other zzso in avoiding false zzso with poorly performing probe zzso Based on our interpretation of the literature, and examples presented here, we suggest that the zzso in performance of probe set zzso is more dependent upon assumptions regarding zzso than on calculations of zzso We argue that zzso is an enormously complex variable that can only be vaguely zzso and thus the zzso probe set zzso will vary from project to zzso
