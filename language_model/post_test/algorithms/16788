In this study, we offered a new feature extraction approach called probability distribution based on equal frequency zzso zzso to be used in the detection of zzso seizure from electroencephalogram zzso zzso Here, after zzso signals were zzso by using zzso method, the probability zzso of the signals were zzso according to the number of data points in each zzso Two different probability density functions were defined by means of the zzso curve fitting for the subjects without zzso seizure and the subjects with zzso seizure, and then when using the mean square error criterion for these two functions, the success of zzso seizure detection was zzso In addition, when the probability zzso of zzso segments were used as the zzso of a zzso zzso neural network zzso model, the success of zzso seizure detection was zzso This results show that zzso zzso can easily detect the zzso zzso from zzso signals by means of probability distribution based on zzso
