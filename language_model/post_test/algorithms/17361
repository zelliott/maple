The aim of the study was to examine the zzso relevance of factors produced by a modified procedure for factor analysis of dynamic zzso zzso Factor analysis has been applied locally to zzso of dynamic zzso data which were well defined in both space and time zzso zzso factor images resulting from different zzso were used as fuzzy regions of interest zzso for the extraction of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular and zzso homogeneous zzso The original procedure employed the factor images of zzso zzso and pelvis resulting from an analysis of the zzso between the zzso of zzso and pelvic zzso In an attempt to improve the separation of zzso zzso and zzso new fuzzy zzso were zzso They zzso to the factor image of zzso zzso obtained from the analysis of the early phase of the study, and to the factor image of the zzso pelvis obtained from the zzso zzso The zzso generated with the new fuzzy zzso were compared with those of the original procedure and tested for the presence of known zzso inconsistent with the expected zzso zzso Unlike with the original zzso no such zzso were zzso The most striking difference was that the pelvic factor zzso did not start from zero time of the study but exhibited a zzso correct initial horizontal zero segment the length of which correlated closely with the minimum zzso transit time zzso zzso zzso The new method permits easy and reliable application of factor analysis to dynamic zzso zzso zzso which remain to be solved are zzso identification of the optimum factors and zzso performance of the method under extreme zzso Our results provide additional evidence that factor analysis can extract zzso relevant information zzso from dynamic zzso zzso
