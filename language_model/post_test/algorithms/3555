The second generation Mining zzso method yields binding affinities accurate to within zzso zzso for the associations of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These calculations require hours to a day on a commodity zzso The calculations also indicate that the changes in zzso zzso upon binding oppose association by as much as 24 zzso and result primarily from a narrowing of energy zzso in the bound versus the free state, rather than from a drop in the number of distinct low-energy zzso on zzso Also, the zzso zzso is found to vary substantially among the bound zzso of a given zzso zzso This result suggests that the zzso zzso must be accounted for to reliably rank zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In close zzso with the common experimental observation of zzso compensation, the zzso zzso changes show a zzso relationship with the changes in mean potential plus zzso zzso
