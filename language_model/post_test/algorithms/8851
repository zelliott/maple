zzso databases have become an important tool to monitor zzso Patients with zzso could be traced using zzso codes and prescriptions, but formal validation is required to obtain an accurate case zzso The aim of the study was to correlate administrative data on zzso with an independent source of patients with zzso in a district of zzso Northern Italy, from 2000 to zzso 

Data of nearly 320 600 inhabitants in the district of zzso collected from the Drug zzso Database of the zzso Region were zzso Among them were included patients who fulfilled the International zzso of Diseases 9 zzso codes and/or the zzso exemption code for zzso and those who had at least one zzso record and took zzso drugs zzso as zzso or in variable zzso To ascertain zzso cases, 11 general practitioners zzso with 15 zzso affiliates were zzso Multiple versions of the diagnostic zzso were developed using different zzso zzso models and all combinations of the four independent zzso 

Among the zzso zzso 71 zzso had a gold standard diagnosis of zzso The best and most conservative zzso included zzso and selected treatment schedules and identified zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 15 zzso 657 patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The positive and negative zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the positive zzso value zzso increased only slightly when patients with single zzso were zzso 

A diagnostic zzso including zzso and selected treatment schedules is only moderately sensitive for the detection of zzso and zzso These findings apply only to the Northern Italian zzso
