zzso similarity calculations of carbohydrates present several problems which must be addressed if a computer zzso is to be zzso These problems range from the zzso representation of the complex zzso structure to the method by which the comparison of zzso and linkage is to be zzso This paper therefore discusses the form of this representation and how two or more carbohydrates can be meaningful zzso An example set of results using this approach is presented and discussed to illustrate how similarity comparison can show relationships between zzso features that are otherwise hidden by the sheer volume of data which must be zzso
