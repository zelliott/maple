The magnitude and distribution of bone and muscle mass within limbs affect limb zzso properties, maximum movement speed and the energy required to maintain zzso zzso zzso modeling and movement simulations were used to determine how changes in bone and muscle zzso area (and thus zzso affect human thigh and shank zzso properties, the maximum speed of unloaded zzso cycling and the energy required to sustain zzso zzso zzso Depending on initial conditions, shank moments of inertia increased zzso zzso zzso per zzso added bone and zzso zzso zzso per zzso added zzso zzso moments of inertia increased zzso zzso zzso per zzso bone and zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso unloaded cycling zzso increased with increased muscle mass zzso zzso zzso zzso but decreased with increased cortical bone mass zzso zzso zzso zzso The internal work associated with unloaded zzso cycling increased with increased muscle mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone mass zzso zzso zzso zzso
