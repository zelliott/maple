The zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstructions by zzso solving a large linear system of zzso We describe a zzso scheme for automatically focusing the attention, and thus the zzso resources, on a subset of the equations and zzso Experimental work with a zzso parallel computer zzso using a simulated phantom as well as real data obtained from an zzso 921 PET scanner indicates that quite significant savings can be obtained with respect to both time and space requirements of the zzso zzso without compromising the quality of the reconstructed zzso
