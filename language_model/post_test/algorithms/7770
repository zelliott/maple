The assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been limited by the lack of an appropriate zzso zzso zzso limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that zzso simulations have become the method of choice in zzso However, previous zzso zzso have consisted of separate zzso embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white zzso In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate zzso structures consisting of densely packed zzso of zzso which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the zzso images that would arise from them under many imaging zzso zzso parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in zzso These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound zzso zzso such as tract kissing and zzso Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of zzso The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated zzso This should greatly improve our understanding of zzso performance and therefore prove an important tool for zzso tracking zzso
