zzso population structure from genetic data sampled from some number of individuals is a formidable statistical zzso One widely used approach considers the number of populations to be fixed and zzso the zzso probability of assigning individuals to each zzso More recently, the assignment of individuals to populations and the number of populations have both been considered random variables that follow a zzso process zzso We examined the statistical behavior of assignment of individuals to populations under a zzso process zzso First, we examined a zzso scenario, in which all of the assumptions of the zzso process prior were satisfied, by generating data under a zzso process zzso Second, we examined the performance of the method when the genetic data were generated under a population zzso model with zzso migration between zzso We examined the accuracy of population assignment using a distance on zzso The method can be quite accurate with a moderate number of zzso As expected, zzso on the number of populations are more accurate when zzso zzso zzso is large and when the migration rate zzso is zzso We also examined the sensitivity of zzso of population structure to choice of the zzso of the zzso process zzso Although zzso could be sensitive to the choice of the prior on the number of zzso this sensitivity occurred when the number of zzso sampled was small; zzso are more robust to the prior on the number of populations when the number of sampled zzso is zzso Finally, we discuss several methods for zzso the results of a zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso analysis of population zzso We develop the notion of the mean population zzso which is the partition of individuals to populations that zzso the squared partition distance to the partitions sampled by the zzso zzso
