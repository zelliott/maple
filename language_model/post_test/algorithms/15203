At the balanced intersection of human and machine adaptation is found the zzso functioning zzso interface zzso In this study, we report a novel experiment of zzso controlling a robotic zzso in three-dimensional zzso physical space using zzso scalp electroencephalogram zzso in human zzso We then zzso the performance of this system using metrics suitable for zzso zzso Lastly, we examine the impact that the operation of a real world device has on subjects' control in comparison to a zzso virtual zzso zzso 

Five human subjects were trained to zzso their zzso rhythms to control an zzso zzso navigating a zzso physical zzso Visual feedback was provided via a forward facing camera on the zzso of the zzso 

Individual subjects were able to accurately acquire up to zzso of all valid targets presented while travelling at an average zzso speed of zzso m zzso 

zzso exploring and interacting with the world around us is a crucial element of autonomy that is lost in the context of neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso are systems that aim to restore or enhance a user's ability to interact with the environment via a computer and through the use of only zzso We demonstrate for the first time the ability to control a flying robot in zzso physical space using zzso scalp recorded zzso in zzso Our work indicates the potential of zzso zzso zzso systems for accomplish complex control in zzso physical zzso The present study may serve as a framework for the investigation of zzso zzso zzso control in a physical environment using zzso zzso
