The paper shows zzso between the results found in various models of zzso It shows that a zzso approach is needed to deal with the problems of zzso An algorithm, called the zzso based on the observation of the meaningful and zzso presence of the golden ratio zzso in all types of spiral patterns, and consequently in all types of regular patterns in zzso is zzso The model is suggested by a property of the zzso model for pattern recognition in zzso It extends recent zzso models developed around the idea of packing efficiency of plant zzso models that yield the noble numbers, among which are the divergence angles of spiral zzso The zzso also gives the noble numbers and zzso orders them in a way that establishes connections with the zzso principles used in models for pattern zzso the order has to do with the relative zzso of the spiral patterns in zzso The zzso is a link between the two zzso models in zzso and offers a nice correspondence with the minimal zzso model generated by a systemic and holistic zzso This latter type of approach is put forward as being able to give a general framework in which to organize the concepts, results, and models in zzso in a way that produces a zzso of zzso The necessity of doing so is seen clearly when one considers that zzso patterns are encountered in other fields of research, so that the problem appears to transcend the strict zzso zzso
