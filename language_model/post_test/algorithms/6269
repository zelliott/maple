This paper propose a first approach to deal with contextual information in structured zzso by zzso neural zzso The proposed model, zzso contextual zzso cascade correlation zzso a zzso of the zzso cascade correlation zzso model, is able to partially remove the causality assumption by exploiting contextual information stored in frozen zzso We formally characterize the properties of zzso showing that it is able to zzso contextual zzso and also some zzso zzso zzso that zzso cannot zzso Experimental results on controlled sequences and on a real-world task involving chemical structures confirm the zzso limitations of zzso while assessing the efficiency and efficacy of zzso in dealing both with pure zzso and contextual prediction zzso Moreover, results obtained for the real-world task show the superiority of the proposed approach versus zzso when exploring a task for which it is not known whether the structural causality assumption zzso
