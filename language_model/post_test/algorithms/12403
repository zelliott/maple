Brain zzso are secondary zzso zzso which occur more frequently than primary brain zzso The four most abundant types of brain zzso originate from primary tumors of lung cancer, zzso cancer, breast cancer and zzso cell zzso As zzso cells contain the molecular information of the primary tissue cells and zzso zzso zzso the molecular fingerprint of cells, zzso zzso based methods constitute a new approach to determine the origin of brain zzso zzso zzso images of 4 by 4 zzso tissue areas were recorded in transmission mode by a zzso imaging zzso coupled to a focal plane array zzso zzso cluster analysis revealed zzso within each zzso zzso clusters of five zzso images with known diagnoses trained a supervised zzso model based on the zzso soft independent modeling of class analogies zzso This model was applied to distinguish normal brain tissue from brain zzso and to identify the primary tumor of brain zzso in 15 independent zzso zzso All specimens were assigned to the correct tissue zzso This zzso study demonstrates that zzso zzso can complement established methods such as zzso or zzso for zzso
