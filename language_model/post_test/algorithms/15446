Missing outcomes or zzso timed zzso zzso data frequently occur in clinical trials or biomedical zzso The zzso zzso linear mixed model zzso has been shown to be a robust approach to modeling zzso continuous repeated measures in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso This paper presents a framework for fitting the zzso with an arbitrary missing data pattern embodied within multiple outcome variables recorded at irregular zzso To address the serial correlation among the zzso zzso a zzso exponential correlation structure is considered in the zzso Under the missing at random zzso an efficient alternating zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to carry out zzso of parameters and zzso of missing zzso The techniques for the zzso of random effects and the prediction of future responses are also zzso zzso to an zzso study and a pregnancy study involving analysis of zzso zzso data with missing outcomes as well as a simulation study have highlighted the superiority of zzso on the provision of more adequate zzso zzso and prediction zzso
