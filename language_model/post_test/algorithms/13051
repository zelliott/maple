Evolution is an zzso walk through a hypothetical fitness landscape, which depicts the relationship between zzso and the fitness of each corresponding zzso We constructed an empirical fitness landscape for a zzso zzso by combining next-generation sequencing, zzso analysis, and zzso zzso an in zzso selection zzso By determining the reaction rate constant for every point zzso of a zzso zzso we demonstrated that abundance in serially depleted pools zzso with zzso activity zzso zzso r zzso zzso standard score Z zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso by deep sequencing yielded a fitness landscape containing zzso unique zzso without requiring measurement of the zzso fitness for each zzso zzso mapping between zzso and zzso may apply to artificial selections, zzso zzso and other zzso relevant evolutionary zzso
