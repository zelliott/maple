The risk for zzso zzso of zzso is predicted by using zzso age and/or weight at zzso All infants below a threshold undergo serial zzso examinations for identification of those who would benefit from treatment zzso zzso We hypothesized that factoring in zzso weight gain could identify children at risk for zzso zzso of zzso more specifically and zzso 

Weekly weights from birth to zzso week 36 were zzso entered into a surveillance system that gave an alarm when the rate of weight gain decreased to a certain zzso For all children (N zzso zzso screened and/or treated for zzso of zzso at zzso University Hospital in zzso weekly weights were zzso One child was excluded because of known zzso weight gain zzso 

For zzso zzso of 353 children, no alarm was zzso for zzso alarm at low risk was given after zzso week zzso None of those children developed zzso of zzso requiring zzso Of the remaining zzso of children who received alarm at high or low risk before 32 zzso weeks, zzso developed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were treated because of zzso zzso The median time from alarm to treatment was 9 zzso 

The weight, zzso growth factor, zzso zzso of zzso zzso detected early zzso of infants who developed zzso of zzso requiring treatment and correctly predicted the majority who did not require zzso With this simple zzso zzso costly stressful eye examinations can be markedly reduced zzso zzso of zzso In addition, early identification of children at risk may lead to the initiation of interventions and possibly prevent zzso zzso of zzso
