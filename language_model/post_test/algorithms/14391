zzso left from right zzso zzso is a critical step for guiding zzso 

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a simple zzso predicting the location of zzso zzso zzso zzso circuits from limited zzso mapping in right atrium zzso and coronary zzso zzso 

In 180 patients with organized zzso zzso zzso was performed at the high zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The difference between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cycle length zzso was calculated at each zzso The location of the AT zzso circuit was determined by mapping and zzso An zzso predicting AT regions was developed from 104 zzso in the first 90 patients zzso I) and zzso evaluated in a validation cohort of 106 zzso in the second 90 patients zzso zzso 

In group I, zzso difference zzso or zzso zzso at the high zzso distinguished zzso from LA zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso difference at the zzso zzso distinguished common flutter from lateral zzso zzso For LA zzso zzso difference at the zzso and zzso zzso distinguished zzso zzso from zzso involving the right pulmonary veins and zzso In group II, an zzso based on zzso difference zzso or zzso zzso at the high zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso had sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and zzso accuracy of zzso for predicting the successful zzso zzso 

Limited zzso from sites accessible from the zzso can zzso suggest the AT location to guide more detailed mapping and potentially avoid unnecessary zzso zzso in some zzso
