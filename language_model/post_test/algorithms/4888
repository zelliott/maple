In order to establish the reference value of zzso zzso zzso serum level in children and to investigate the correlation between the zzso of zzso gene and serum zzso level in healthy Chinese of Han ethnic group and in children of Chinese Han ethnic group with zzso respiratory tract infections zzso the concentration of zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso were analyzed by restriction zzso length zzso of zzso chain reaction and zzso chain zzso specific zzso The median zzso levels in the 470 normal children were zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso Our research showed that two promoter zzso at zzso zzso of start zzso and coding zzso at zzso 54 of zzso gene affected the protein level significantly and the most frequent zzso in Hans is zzso Our results also showed that serum zzso level was significantly lower in zzso respiratory tract infections patients compared with healthy controls zzso zzso P zzso zzso The frequency of the promoter zzso zzso and the B zzso was significantly higher in zzso patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso 

We have established that the reference value of serum zzso level in Chinese aged between 0 and 6 years zzso zzso and we found that zzso and the B are risk factors for zzso
