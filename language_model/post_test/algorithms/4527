zzso of the potential distribution of invasive species can increase the efficiency of their management by focusing prevention zzso Generally, ecological models are built using occurrence data from a zzso native range to predict the distribution in areas that the species may zzso However, historical and geographical constraints can limit a zzso native zzso zzso Algorithm for zzso zzso zzso an ecological niche modeling program, was used to predict the potential distribution of the zzso freshwater New Zealand zzso zzso zzso in Australia and North zzso We compared the strength of the predictions made by models built with data from the zzso native range in New Zealand to models built with data from the locations invaded by the zzso A zzso analysis of the Australian models demonstrated that zzso data can make better predictions about the potential distribution of invasive species than models built with native range zzso Large differences among the model forecasts indicate that zzso choice of the data set used in training the zzso models can result in misleading zzso The models predict a large expansion in the range of zzso zzso in both Australia and North America unless prevention measures are implemented zzso
