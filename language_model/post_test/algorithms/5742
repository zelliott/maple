The aim was to evaluate zzso morbidity after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a total dose of 76 zzso in comparison to conventional zzso zzso zzso up to zzso zzso for patients with prostate zzso 

All patients were zzso surveyed prior to, on the last day, as well as after a median time of 2 and 16 months after zzso using a validated questionnaire zzso zzso Cancer Index zzso zzso for the 78 matched pairs after zzso zzso zzso were patient age, use of zzso treatment volume zzso whole zzso zzso risk group, and zzso quality of life zzso before zzso
