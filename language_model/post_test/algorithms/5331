The periodically forced zzso model displays zzso zzso and zzso zzso period doubling, and zzso We explore the behavior of such media as zzso systems for investigating spiral zzso Besides zzso breakup and zzso breakup resulting from unstable modes in the zzso direction or zzso instability zzso of the zzso zzso the observed complex phenomena include backfiring, spiral zzso and zzso zzso from line zzso zzso zzso of spirals can evolve to zzso spirals resembling those found in nature, such as pine cones and zzso When the forcing zzso is increased, the zzso zzso zzso from simple rotation to complex zzso corresponding to transformation of the local dynamics from simple zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The number of petals is related to the complexity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso standing waves, and homogeneous synchronization zzso the entire system when the forcing zzso is further zzso
