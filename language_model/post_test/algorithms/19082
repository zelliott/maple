zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso offers a highly efficient strategy to zzso prepare zzso zzso zzso transfer to zzso bonds formed zzso zzso which were subjected to various zzso zzso O, zzso and N) to give zzso zzso zzso derivatives zzso The second zzso displacement of zzso zzso of zzso zzso allows straightforward access to zzso with selective zzso or zzso This approach is zzso simple, zzso existing methods, and is a versatile protocol for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso reaction was extensively studied by using zzso zzso
