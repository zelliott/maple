A simple zzso zzso has been zzso demonstrated at zzso range for zzso layer sensing based on the zzso reflecting zzso zzso We zzso study the dependence of zzso detection sensitivity on the optical geometrical parameters of tubes, different thicknesses and tube wall zzso zzso and on different resonant zzso A zzso zzso with zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso is used to sense a zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso on the zzso inner surface, and the minimum zzso quantity of molecules could be down to zzso zzso A zzso zzso model is proposed for calculating the zzso zzso which agrees well with the experimental zzso
