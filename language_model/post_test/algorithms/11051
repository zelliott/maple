We present several procedures to represent molecular zzso potential as a zzso based on the pattern of critical points and their neighborhood zzso This representation is used for the molecular zzso comparison, which is reduced to a comparison of zzso zzso Several methods to compare trees are also zzso The applications of this zzso to compare and zzso molecules through their zzso potential are zzso
