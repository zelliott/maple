This paper describes the development and application of a new fast zzso technique based on the zzso zzso The sequence named zzso zzso for Signal Enhancement zzso is composed of two completely zzso zzso echoes separated by a 180 degrees zzso zzso The zzso pulse zzso 90 degrees zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso enables restoration of the zzso zzso along the zzso zzso and consequently artificially increases zzso relaxation zzso In this zzso the period between the zzso pulse and the restoring pulse zzso zzso zzso evolution zzso is very short zzso 10 zzso This makes possible a significant increase in zzso ratio, even with a relatively short repetition time (20 zzso zzso were performed for different values of zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso and for different values of zzso and zzso at constant zzso and zzso zzso signal enhancement for species with long relaxation time zzso as compared to classical zzso echo and fast zzso imaging was zzso In zzso studies on a zzso phantom confirmed this zzso Application of zzso to mouse brain imaging permitted to zzso almost completely zzso fluid of the zzso a signal usually partially saturated in fast zzso echo zzso
