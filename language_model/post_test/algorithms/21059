zzso is currently the most common zzso method of response assessment on zzso zzso By defining the zzso volume of interest zzso a measure of total zzso volume zzso may be zzso We aimed to zzso zzso in a phantom setting, the accuracy of zzso in reflecting actual zzso activity and to compare zzso with zzso for response zzso The zzso for zzso generation from which zzso was derived included fixed threshold techniques at 50% of maximum zzso zzso of maximum zzso an zzso threshold of 50% of zzso + zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso algorithm, zzso zzso with both actual zzso activity and response scenarios was zzso zzso correlated poorly with actual zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and change in zzso activity zzso zzso zzso In a response zzso scenario zzso performed poorly when all scenarios were considered, but performed well when only clinically likely scenarios were zzso The zzso derived using zzso and zzso zzso performed poorly in evaluation of zzso zzso The zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso however performed extremely well in correlation with actual zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso respectively), change in zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso and in the response scenario zzso zzso demonstrated narrow confidence bands when zzso with actual zzso zzso zzso of zzso generated by zzso zzso such as zzso show potential for increased sensitivity of zzso response monitoring compared to zzso which may have important implications for improved patient zzso
