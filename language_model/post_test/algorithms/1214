To compare the efficacy and complications of three different zzso laser zzso for multizone zzso and zzso zzso 

Three different software zzso were applied to treat zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso had a maximum zzso zone of 6 zzso but differed in the number of zones zzso the proportion of the total treatment allocated to each zzso zone, and the treatment of zzso The Melbourne multizone technique equally divided zzso correction into a maximum of three zzso zzso The Pop multizone technique biased zzso treatment into the smaller diameter zones to a maximum of six zzso zones, with one central island zzso The zzso multizone technique equally divided zzso treatment through all zones up to a maximum of six, with one central island zzso 

A total of zzso patients zzso zzso were treated and 625 eyes zzso were followed for more than 6 zzso The mean baseline zzso equivalent zzso error was zzso D zzso to zzso zzso Between 71 and zzso of eyes were treated for zzso There was no statistically significant differences in baseline zzso error or other characteristics among the three zzso At 6 months, the zzso multizone zzso had more eyes with a zzso error within zzso zzso D of zzso zzso zzso zzso and more within zzso zzso D of zzso zzso zzso zzso This new zzso produced more eyes with an zzso visual acuity of zzso or better at 6 months zzso zzso zzso When multiple zzso zzso was used to correct for any differences in baseline zzso among the three groups, this zzso also had a higher odds ratio for achieving zzso or better zzso visual acuity zzso zzso zzso 

At 6 months, all three zzso were effective in the reduction of zzso zzso better visual acuity and zzso results were achieved with the zzso multizone zzso that spread the total treatment over a larger number of zzso zones, with an equal number of zzso of treatment in each zzso
