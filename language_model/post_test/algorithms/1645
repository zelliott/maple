Wave intensity analysis zzso was used to delineate and maximize the efficacy of a newly developed zzso blood pump zzso The zzso balloon pump zzso was employed as the comparison zzso Acute zzso experiments using eight zzso randomly divided into zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso 4) groups, were conducted to compare the characteristics of zzso and zzso zzso We measured pressure and zzso with zzso installed in the left anterior descending coronary artery and zzso during and without zzso zzso Wave intensity for zzso and left coronary waves were derived from pressure and flow zzso with synchronization correction zzso To achieve zzso support zzso zzso zzso ranging from 25 zzso ahead of to 35 zzso after the zzso were zzso Similar to those associated with zzso zzso the zzso zzso waves predominantly drove zzso and coronary blood zzso However, in contrast with zzso zzso the zzso nature of the zzso allowed zzso unloading to be delayed into early zzso which resulted in near elimination of coronary blood steal without diminution of zzso left zzso ejection wave zzso zzso can zzso subtleties among different zzso support means with high zzso Total accelerating wave intensity zzso which was defined as the sum of the time integration of accelerated parts of the positive and negative wave zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso In general, the larger the zzso gain, the better the zzso support zzso However, when zzso zzso zzso were delayed to after the zzso the zzso was found to be zzso correlated with coronary zzso In this delayed zzso timing setting, greater wave cancellation occurred, which led to decreased zzso but increased coronary zzso attributed to blood zzso zzso
