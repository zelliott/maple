This paper presents a simple and robust secondary structure prediction scheme zzso based on an updated version of the nearest zzso zzso Using a larger database of known structures, the zzso 62 substitution zzso and a zzso algorithm, the three state prediction accuracy is increased by zzso percentage points to zzso for a single sequence and up to zzso when using multiple zzso The increase in prediction accuracy with respect to the previous version can be almost entirely ascribed to the zzso increase in the size of the zzso A more detailed analysis of the results shows that badly predicted regions of a protein sequence are randomly distributed throughout the database and that the goal of perfect secondary structure predictions by methods which use only local sequence information is zzso
