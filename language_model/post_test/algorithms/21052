A cell is a minimal self-sustaining system that can move and zzso Previous work has shown that a zzso slime mold, zzso can be zzso as a biological computer based on zzso flow zzso by a zzso Although the interplay between the modification of the boundary of a cell and the zzso flow surrounded by the boundary plays a key role in zzso zzso no model of a cell has been developed to describe this zzso Here we propose a toy model of a cell that shows zzso motion and can solve a zzso Steiner minimum tree problem and a spanning tree zzso Only by assuming that zzso is hardened after passing external matter (or softened part) through a cell, the shape of the cell and the zzso flow can be zzso Without zzso zzso a cell is easily zzso This suggests that zzso zzso and/or zzso transformation caused by external zzso can keep a cell in a critical state leading to a wide variety of shapes and zzso
