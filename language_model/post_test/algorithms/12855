The purpose of this study is to discover potential zzso in serum for the detection of small cell lung cancer zzso 

74 serum samples including 30 from zzso patients and 44 from healthy controls were analyzed using zzso system combined with zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso software and genetic zzso analysis selected a panel of serum markers that most efficiently predicted which patients had zzso 

The diagnostic pattern combined with 5 potential zzso could differentiate zzso patients from healthy zzso with a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso of stage zzso patients were accurately assigned to zzso 

zzso zzso technology will provide a highly accurate approach for discovering new zzso for the detection of zzso
