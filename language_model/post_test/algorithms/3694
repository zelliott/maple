The basic requirement for direction selectivity is a zzso interaction between two different zzso in zzso In some models, the interaction is hypothesized to occur between zzso and zzso of the zzso type in the zzso zzso zzso How can the required spatial specificity be acquired in an zzso zzso We here propose an zzso local learning model that can account for direction selectivity in visual zzso based on such a local veto operation and that depends on zzso induced changes in zzso calcium zzso Our zzso simulations suggest that a model cell with our learning zzso can develop direction selectivity zzso after zzso zzso The learning rule is also zzso to a zzso with zzso zzso and to a pair of cells with zzso zzso and is stable under different starting conditions, delays, and zzso
