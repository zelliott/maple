zzso of coupled problems such as zzso interaction zzso are becoming more and more important for engineering zzso This is particularly true when modeling the zzso zzso where the zzso between the blood and the valve determines the valve movement and the zzso zzso zzso only a few studies are focusing on the opening and closing behavior during the ejection phase zzso In this paper, we present the validation of a zzso model using the dynamic mesh method of zzso for the two-dimensional zzso simulation of mechanical heart valves during the ejection phase of the cardiac zzso The zzso model is successfully validated by comparing simulation results to experimental data obtained from in zzso studies using a zzso zzso
