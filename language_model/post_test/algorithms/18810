In this paper we introduce a zzso zzso capable of simultaneously zzso two distinct gene expression zzso with the aim of uncovering gene regulatory programs that are common to the two zzso The zzso zzso simultaneously searches for two zzso that share the same gene expression zzso The two key ingredients of this zzso are the zzso constraint and the offset zzso which together ensure the zzso of the zzso While cancer is a very zzso disease, there is overwhelming recent evidence that the differences between cancer zzso zzso entire pathways and biological processes involving large numbers of zzso rather than changes in single zzso We have applied our simultaneous zzso zzso looking for gene expression profiles that are common between the more homogeneous pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and the more zzso colon zzso The fact that the zzso signature is active in a large fraction of colon zzso suggests that the zzso mechanisms involved may be similar to those in zzso at least in this subset of colon zzso There are many approaches to uncovering common mechanisms involved in different zzso but most are based on comparing gene zzso The approach presented in this paper additionally takes gene expression data into account and can thus be more zzso
