The paper presents a joint zzso based resource allocation zzso in order to improve the efficiency and fairness of cooperative zzso zzso frequency division zzso zzso cognitive radio zzso zzso A communication model where one source zzso communicates with one destination zzso assisted by one zzso zzso zzso relay is considered in the zzso An zzso environment is considered, with the constraint of transmitted zzso over all channels and zzso average interference towards multiple primary users zzso The proposed resource allocation zzso is capable of maximizing both the system transmission efficiency and fairness among secondary users zzso Besides, the proposed zzso can also keep the interference introduced to the zzso bands below a zzso A zzso fairness constraint is used to assure that each zzso can achieve a required data rate, with quality of service zzso Moreover, we extend the analysis to the scenario where each cooperative zzso has no channel state information zzso about zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso and fairness zzso in zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed zzso is presented with the simulation zzso
