To investigate the potential value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in evaluating the consistency of brain zzso 

Six patients with known solid brain tumor underwent brain zzso zzso zzso of brain tumors was evaluated at zzso zzso of zzso evaluation with operative result was zzso 

The elasticity of tumors in six patients evaluated by zzso agreed with the tumor consistency given by the operative zzso 

zzso could be used as an imaging technique for zzso assessment of the consistency of brain tumor in zzso
