Although the correlations between magnetic resonance findings and long-term disease evolution range from poor to moderate, conventional zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging provides sensitive and reliable measures to monitor multiple sclerosis activity over zzso New pulse sequences with shorter acquisition times can be cost effective and reduce patients' zzso The application of other techniques that give more accurate estimates of disease burden and have higher pathological specificity might improve our understanding of multiple sclerosis evolution and provide new outcomes for monitoring clinical zzso Work is still needed to obtain optimal imaging of the spinal zzso for multiple sclerosis diagnosis and zzso
