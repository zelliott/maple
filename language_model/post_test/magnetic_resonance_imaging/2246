To develop and to implement a fast, highly zzso zzso on a conventional 1 T MR scanner and to examine this sequence as to its capability of zzso tissue damage due to focal cerebral zzso 

Within a zzso diffusion zzso were inserted in all zzso zzso By phantom zzso the zzso diffusion weighting was determined for different zzso and zzso values and flip zzso The zzso sequence was used for monitoring the diffusion of focal cerebral zzso in 14 rats following zzso zzso of the middle cerebral zzso 

The zzso zzso could be easily zzso as a bright area in the images with high diffusion zzso The mean relative decrease of the diffusion zzso in the zzso brain zzso was zzso The diffusion zzso decreased significantly with increasing zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that the installed sequence is capable of producing highly diffusion weighted images without requiring a special zzso zzso The sequence is potentially useful for monitoring cerebral zzso on the basis of calculating the change of the diffusion zzso
