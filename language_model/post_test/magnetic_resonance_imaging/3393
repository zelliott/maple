zzso of the cardiovascular and zzso fluid zzso system is considered to be important to understand the zzso of cerebrovascular and zzso disease and zzso drug zzso A coupled cardiovascular and zzso system model was designed to examine the relation of spinal zzso zzso blood flow zzso and zzso zzso along the spinal zzso space zzso A one-dimensional zzso cardiovascular tree model was constructed including a simplified SC zzso zzso zzso between the cardiovascular and zzso system was accomplished by a transfer function based on in zzso zzso of zzso and cerebral blood zzso A zzso tube model of the zzso was constructed based on in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and flow throughout the cardiovascular and zzso system were determined for different values of zzso zzso zzso results indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso SC each had a signature zzso zzso The cerebral blood flow to zzso transfer function reproduced an in zzso zzso flow zzso The zzso tube model of the zzso resulted in a distribution of zzso pressure and flow and a wave speed that were similar to those in zzso The zzso to zzso pulse delay was found to vary a great degree along the spine depending on zzso compliance and vascular zzso The properties and anatomy of the SC zzso network and zzso were found to have an important impact on pressure and flow and zzso fluid movement to the zzso Overall, the coupled model provides predictions about the flow and pressure environment in the SC and zzso More detailed zzso are needed to fully validate the zzso
