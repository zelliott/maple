The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of adding combined zzso to zzso for T and N staging of the oral and zzso cancer and calculation of the gross tumor volume zzso having zzso as reference zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed in 66 patients with suspected oral and zzso cancer (41 primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso zzso analysis included the zzso test, sensitivity, specificity for the diagnostic zzso as well as zzso analysis, and zzso zzso for calculated tumor zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference between the two zzso compared to pathological findings regarding detection of disease zzso zzso or zzso The zzso for tumor detection were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In zzso of cases, the zzso T staging resulted in an zzso of the zzso tumor zzso The corresponding rate for zzso was zzso Regarding the treated necks, both zzso showed zzso sensitivity for detection of the zzso zzso In zzso with zzso zzso staging, zzso and zzso gave zzso and zzso false positive findings, zzso The mean tumor volume in the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso the mean volume derived by the MR imaging was zzso zzso zzso zzso while the estimated by zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso between the three zzso The zzso analysis showed a better agreement between zzso and zzso 

The diagnostic performance of zzso in the local staging of oral cancer is not superior to zzso
