Blood flow to the zzso circulation increases zzso which may cause a reduction in systemic and cerebral zzso leading to zzso zzso in the elderly who lack adequate cardiovascular zzso We used zzso zzso phase contrast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the aim of characterizing the time course of the zzso response to an oral zzso challenge test zzso in the large arteries zzso the zzso systemic and cerebral zzso zzso zzso artery zzso abdominal zzso zzso internal carotid zzso zzso and zzso arteries zzso In this study nine zzso healthy volunteers were zzso Separate zzso zzso scans were acquired in the neck and in the abdomen every 88 zzso these two zzso being zzso for ten baseline scans at each station with the scanner automatically moving the subject between the two zzso After zzso of the zzso a further 30 zzso zzso scans were acquired at each zzso Using this technique we were able to characterize with frequent sampling of zzso blood flow the time course of blood flow response to the zzso of the zzso AA and both VA and zzso We found a substantial variation between individuals in the zzso and the time to the peak of the zzso blood flow response to the zzso which correlated positively with body mass zzso zzso provides a zzso zzso method of studying normal physiology that could be valuable in studies of diseases such as zzso zzso
