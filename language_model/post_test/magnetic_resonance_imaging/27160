We sought to create a zzso system for pediatric corpus zzso abnormalities zzso based upon zzso zzso brain zzso We used the term zzso for patients with structural zzso of the corpus zzso excluding patients with zzso zzso zzso or pure zzso without zzso Currently, no system exists for zzso forms of zzso and attempts to create such a system have been hampered by highly variable zzso in patients with sporadic zzso We reasoned that any useful strategy should zzso affected family members within the same type, and that zzso zzso should be minimized in patients with zzso zzso 

We focused recruitment toward multiplex zzso families, zzso 30 patients from 19 zzso families, and analyzed clinical features together with brain zzso 

We identified 3 major zzso classes, including zzso zzso with zzso and complete zzso zzso individuals within a given multiplex family usually displayed the same zzso of the class of zzso and they always displayed the same class of zzso within each family, or they displayed complete zzso The system was validated among a second cohort of 10 sporadic patients with zzso 

The data suggest that complete zzso may be a common zzso and zzso multiple overlapping pathways in the zzso of zzso
