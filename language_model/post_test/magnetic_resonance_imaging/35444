Our objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of an zzso protocol of zzso zzso zzso and integrated zzso zzso zzso with the diagnostic accuracy of a zzso zzso for initial breast cancer zzso 

Forty women zzso age, zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso with suspected breast cancer were zzso For the primary zzso we compared zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso status, zzso zzso versus clinical investigation and zzso and for distant zzso zzso zzso versus a zzso staging zzso zzso and clinical follow-up served as the standard of zzso The Fisher exact test evaluated the significance of differences zzso zzso zzso zzso in patient management caused by zzso zzso were zzso 

No significant differences were found in the detection rate of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso correctly classified zzso zzso significantly more often than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso correctly defined the T stage significantly more often than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso clinical zzso in zzso This difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Distant zzso were detected with zzso zzso in zzso of cases, and the zzso zzso identified distant zzso in zzso This difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Three patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso that were detected only by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changed patient management in zzso of zzso 

Our data suggest that a zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol may be used for staging breast cancer in a single zzso This initial assessment of the zzso zzso protocol indicates similar accuracy to zzso for the detection of breast cancer zzso Although zzso seems to be more accurate when assessing the T stage of the zzso zzso zzso seems able to more accurately define zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso was able to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso with a high sensitivity, this method cannot soon be expected to replace the combination of clinical examination, zzso and zzso zzso zzso biopsy for zzso zzso
