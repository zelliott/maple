The purpose of this study was to compare the size of the entrance of the zzso as measured zzso zzso with the volume of the notch as measured by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For 20 zzso knees, the dimensions of the notch entrance were measured zzso and the notch volume was measured by use of zzso The correlation between the size of the notch entrance and the notch volume was zzso zzso reliability and zzso reliability of the zzso and CT zzso were zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso between zzso notch volume and zzso assessed notch height and zzso at the bottom, middle, and top of the notch were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reliability and zzso reliability of the zzso zzso were above zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso and zzso respectively, for the CT zzso 

There were only moderate correlations between zzso notch zzso and notch zzso Both the zzso and CT zzso proved highly zzso 

The moderate correlation between zzso and zzso notch zzso warrants caution concerning the use of either measurement for assessing risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury or as justification for zzso until studies between the relation of zzso notch volume and anterior cruciate ligament injury are zzso
