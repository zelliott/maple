To determine if zzso residents who used a structured reporting system zzso produced higher quality reports than residents who used conventional zzso dictation to report zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in patients suspected of having a zzso 

The study was approved by an institutional review board and was zzso zzso informed consent was zzso This study included residents, with 16 in the control group and 18 in the intervention zzso For phase 1, each subject reviewed the same set of 25 brain MR imaging cases and dictated the cases by using zzso conventional zzso For phase 2, 4 months later, the control group repeated the same process, whereas the intervention group reread the same MR imaging cases by using zzso to create zzso zzso reports were graded for accuracy and zzso by a zzso on the basis of consensus interpretations and criterion standard diagnoses as established with at least 6 months of clinical zzso imaging zzso and/or zzso examination where zzso zzso and zzso scores were analyzed by using a zzso signed rank test for paired data and a zzso U test for zzso zzso zzso group residents were surveyed regarding their opinions of zzso 

For phase 1 reports, no significant difference in accuracy or zzso scores between control and intervention groups was zzso zzso in accuracy zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso scores for phase 2 compared with phase 1 for the intervention group were zzso increases in accuracy zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso scores for phase 2 compared with phase 1 for the control group were found (all P values zzso zzso The most common complaints were that the zzso was overly constraining with regard to report content and was time-consuming to zzso 

While there are many potential benefits of structuring zzso reports, such changes cannot be assumed to improve report accuracy or zzso Any zzso should be tested for effect on intrinsic report zzso
