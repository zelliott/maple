zzso expression of transforming growth factor zzso has been reported in zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to clarify whether zzso is a risk factor for zzso deep white matter zzso zzso and their progression in a general elderly zzso 

The subjects included 81 participants zzso zzso zzso and zzso who had voluntarily undergone a health examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 2003 and 2008 and 43 zzso patients with previous symptomatic brain zzso Deep white matter zzso were graded from Grade 0 to 3 according to the zzso zzso Group zzso zzso subjects) was defined as zzso with no progression in the grade level, and Group zzso zzso of zzso (12 subjects) was defined as zzso with an increase in one or more grade number and an apparent worsening of Grade zzso zzso zzso control subjects with consistent normal brain zzso were included in Group zzso The associations between zzso and various vascular risk factors, including peripheral blood zzso levels, were zzso 

In addition to the classical risk factors, the highest zzso levels were found in Group zzso The zzso levels were significantly higher in Group zzso than in Group zzso and zzso was significantly correlated with elevated zzso levels zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso 

The present data suggest that zzso may be important in the zzso and progression of zzso and it is expected to be useful as a clinical indicator reflecting the presence of zzso white matter zzso
