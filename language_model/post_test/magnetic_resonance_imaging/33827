A retrospective study evaluating magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso zzso and clinical parameters in patients with cervical zzso zzso 

To investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging can predict the surgical outcome in patients with cervical zzso zzso 

No previous studies have established whether areas of high signal intensity in zzso magnetic resonance images can be a predictor of surgical zzso 

Fifty patients with cervical zzso zzso were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso before surgery and by delayed zzso zzso zzso after zzso The correlation between the recovery rate and the clinical and imaging parameters was zzso 

The best zzso factor was the zzso area of the spinal zzso at maximum zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso The presence of high signal intensity areas on zzso magnetic resonance images correlated poorly with the recovery rate (R zzso zzso However, patients with zzso areas of high signal intensity on zzso magnetic resonance images tended to have poor surgical results associated with muscle zzso in the upper zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso areas of high signal intensity on zzso magnetic resonance images probably represent zzso in the central spinal zzso 

Patients with zzso areas of high signal intensity on zzso magnetic resonance images tended to have poorer surgical zzso However, the zzso area of the spinal zzso at the level of maximum zzso was a better zzso zzso
