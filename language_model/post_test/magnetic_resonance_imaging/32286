zzso lobe zzso zzso presents in childhood with different manifestations, age of onset and zzso features that form distinct zzso The zzso clinical symptoms are difficult to correlate with onset in particular areas in the zzso zzso and the zzso recordings have not been able to overcome this zzso The mapping of zzso cortical regions in zzso remains therefore an important goal in our understanding of these zzso 

In this work, three patients with two types of idiopathic childhood zzso were studied with zzso source analysis and also with mapping of the zzso effect associated with spikes in simultaneous zzso zzso 

Two patients with late onset zzso provided zzso source zzso in the lateral zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were more consistent and restricted to the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso One patient with zzso idiopathic zzso presented with zzso sources in the zzso zzso cortex, but the zzso zzso were widespread over inferior and bilateral zzso areas and also zzso zzso zzso There was little spatial overlap between the zzso and zzso results, but the zzso suggested by the latter are more consistent with the zzso clinical manifestations of each type of zzso zzso 

Overall, the zzso effect associated with zzso spikes maps zzso areas to different zzso than the ones suggested by zzso source zzso These maps are similar in two patients with late onset idiopathic zzso but different from a case of zzso idiopathic zzso
