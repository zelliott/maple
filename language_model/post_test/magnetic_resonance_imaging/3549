Positive zzso contrast using zzso zzso contrast agents can potentially improve detection of labeled cells on magnetic resonance imaging zzso Recently, zzso oxide zzso zzso have shown promise as a sensitive zzso agent for cell labeling at clinical field strengths compared to conventional zzso zzso The objective of this study was to investigate zzso zzso a commercially available zzso zzso for cell labeling and zzso at 7 zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells were labeled with zzso at various zzso and underwent zzso from 1 to 7 days zzso The magnetic resonance relaxation times zzso and zzso of labeled cell zzso were zzso Cellular contrast agent zzso was zzso by zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso which showed very high zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significant positive zzso contrast and stable labeling on zzso Enhancement was optimal at low zzso zzso attained in the zzso to zzso zzso incubation concentration range zzso cell zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso Cell viability and proliferation were unaffected at the zzso tested and up to at least 3 days zzso zzso is a promising sensitive and stable positive contrast agent for cellular zzso at 7 zzso
