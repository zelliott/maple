The aim of this study is to search for relationships between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and disease outcome in patients with zzso zzso zzso Eighty patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 46 zzso mean age at the time of the diagnosis of zzso 55 zzso were zzso zzso All patients were treated with radioactive zzso and evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor tissue sample was available in all zzso zzso patients zzso had a zzso 12 zzso a zzso and 23 zzso a poorly differentiated zzso zzso Cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso capsule zzso and vascular invasion were frequently detected zzso 44, 52, 60, and zzso zzso zzso disclosed zzso zzso in 58 patients zzso and zzso zzso in 37 patients zzso zzso zzso was the only significant zzso factor for survival zzso The maximum standardized zzso value and the number of zzso avid zzso were also related to prognosis zzso and zzso Age at the time of the diagnosis of zzso zzso and the presence of necrosis zzso were independent zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for stable disease zzso and necrosis for progressive disease at 1 year zzso zzso zzso was not correlated with in zzso tumor metabolism and zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer is highly zzso for zzso zzso zzso alone does not correlate with zzso zzso pattern and patient zzso zzso zzso cancer presenting zzso features such as necrosis and zzso zzso on PET scan should be considered aggressive differentiated zzso
