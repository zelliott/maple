zzso zzso zzso channel complex encephalitis is a common form of zzso zzso Patients with zzso due to this form of encephalitis commonly have medically intractable zzso and may require zzso to control zzso It is important that zzso recognize imaging characteristics of this type of zzso encephalitis and suggest it in the differential diagnosis because this seizure zzso is likely zzso Our purpose was to characterize MR imaging findings in this patient zzso 

MR imaging in 42 zzso identified patients zzso zzso median age, 56 years; age range, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso channel complex zzso zzso was evaluated for zzso and zzso swelling and/or zzso zzso zzso restricted zzso and zzso zzso analysis was zzso 

zzso of 42 patients zzso demonstrated enlargement and zzso zzso of zzso zzso lobe structures at some time zzso zzso zzso sclerosis was commonly identified zzso zzso at follow-up zzso Six of 9 patients zzso P zzso zzso initially demonstrating zzso enhancement and zzso zzso P zzso zzso showing zzso restricted diffusion progressed to zzso zzso zzso zzso in 6 of 33 patients, abnormal imaging findings zzso 

zzso zzso zzso channel complex encephalitis is frequently zzso as enlargement, zzso zzso enhancement, and restricted diffusion of the zzso zzso lobe structures in the acute zzso zzso of these typical imaging findings may help prompt zzso diagnosis, preventing unnecessary invasive procedures and zzso early institution of zzso zzso MR imaging may demonstrate resolution or progression of zzso changes, including development of changes involving the zzso side and frequent development of zzso zzso zzso
