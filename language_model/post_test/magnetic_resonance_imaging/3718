In a widely used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data analysis method, functional regions of interest zzso are handpicked in each participant using zzso landmarks as guides, and the response of these regions to new conditions is then zzso A key limitation of this standard handpicked zzso method is the zzso of decisions about which clusters of activated zzso should be treated as the particular zzso in question in each zzso Here we apply the zzso zzso zzso method for defining zzso recently developed for identifying language zzso zzso et zzso zzso to zzso identify zzso well-studied zzso regions of the zzso visual zzso zzso zzso We show that this method retains the benefit of defining zzso in individual subjects without the zzso inherent in the traditional handpicked zzso zzso The tools necessary for using this method are available on our zzso zzso
