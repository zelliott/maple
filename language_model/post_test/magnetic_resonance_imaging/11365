The introduction of new zzso treatment strategies for acute stroke patients has provided a requirement for zzso methods capable of identifying zzso tissue in acute stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence points to the fact that a zzso zone with blood flow of zzso of normal, zzso rate of oxygen of zzso of normal and oxygen extraction ratio zzso of zzso are zzso of tissue at risk of zzso yet with potential for zzso The sensitivity of zzso to blood oxygen level dependent zzso effects allows the mismatch between oxygen delivery and consumption in the brain to be zzso Previous evidence from animal models of cerebral zzso and zzso stroke strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso highlights viable and zzso brain zzso The zzso zzso and diffusion show distinct flow thresholds in the rat brain so that the former zzso zzso areas with high zzso and the latter genuine zzso In the zzso tissue showing negative zzso zzso substantial residual zzso is evident as revealed by zzso zzso zzso in agreement with the idea that tissue zzso viability must be preserved for expression of zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso may have potential for the assessment of tissue viability in acute zzso zzso
