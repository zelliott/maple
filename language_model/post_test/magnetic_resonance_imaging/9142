To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the detection of deep zzso zzso 

The patient group consisted of 53 women with zzso cancer who underwent zzso zzso including zzso and surgical staging between August 1999 and August 2008 at Korea University Medical Center, Seoul, South zzso The pathological data from surgical staging were compared with the zzso zzso zzso 

The mean age of the patients was 51 years and most patients had zzso zzso On pathological evaluation of the zzso zzso had a deep zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso zzso positive zzso value and negative zzso value of zzso in detecting deep zzso invasion were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso findings and zzso grades by zzso biopsy had a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, with a zzso of zzso 

In patients with zzso cancer, zzso is limited in its ability to detect deep zzso zzso The combination of zzso findings and zzso zzso or grade can be helpful in determining if zzso is zzso
