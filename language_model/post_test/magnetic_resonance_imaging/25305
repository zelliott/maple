zzso zzso is zzso but without proper treatment it causes extensive tissue zzso Early diagnosis is critical but usually difficult with cultures or zzso Our aim was to identify characteristic imaging features that facilitated diagnosis in seven patients with zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed the CT and MR findings in seven patients with zzso proved zzso zzso diagnosis was made by means of surgical zzso or biopsy in seven zzso zzso was performed in two zzso zzso CT scans zzso and MR images zzso were evaluated for the location, margin, zzso nature, enhancement pattern, and presence of zzso 

CT and MR images showed either a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Involved areas included the zzso cavity zzso zzso space zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso and zzso zzso and tongue zzso Imaging confirmed the zzso nature, showing the tendency of the zzso to invade across tissue planes and boundaries zzso zzso homogeneous contrast enhancement was seen on CT scans in six patients with several small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images showed intermediate signal intensity with moderate contrast enhancement zzso zzso zzso was associated in three zzso 

Although zzso zzso occurs zzso it should be included in the differential diagnosis when images show a zzso mass with inflammatory changes and an zzso nature in the zzso zzso
