zzso and documenting the nature of normal human brain functional motor zzso using functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso is necessary, if valid statements are to be made about normal and disease functional states using zzso zzso zzso The present study examines zzso maps in zzso zzso Six healthy adult volunteers performed three motor tasks zzso the zzso zzso foot, and zzso thumb during a single magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanning zzso Group maps demonstrated discrete areas of zzso that were task zzso The degree of zzso between the anatomical central location of global maximum intensity for each individual may mean extra care should be applied when using the global maximum to define the area of zzso These differences may represent anatomical zzso among individuals, task complexity, paradigm design, data analysis techniques or a combination zzso which form the basis of our ongoing research zzso Standard notions of strongly associated functions as related to zzso zzso may need to be zzso
