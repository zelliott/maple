The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of zzso zzso zzso scan in planning zzso therapy and follow-up in patients with differentiated zzso zzso zzso Four groups of DTC patients were zzso Group 1 comprised 122 patients with high serum zzso zzso levels and negative high-dose zzso scan during follow-up who had previously undergone total zzso and zzso zzso Group 2 consisted of 27 patients who had previously undergone total zzso and zzso treatment but were now considered zzso this group was considered as zzso Group 3 comprised 49 patients studied after total zzso but prior to zzso zzso Finally, group 4 consisted of 21 patients who had previously undergone partial zzso zzso zzso zzso neck zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso hormonal therapy zzso were obtained in all zzso Neck and chest zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso was also performed in group 1 zzso In group 1, zzso scan and US were very sensitive in detecting cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso scan and US played a complementary role in several patients, yielding a global sensitivity of zzso In contrast, zzso sensitivity for cervical zzso zzso zzso was very low zzso zzso scan also showed a higher sensitivity than zzso in detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso Regarding distant zzso zzso scan provided results similar to those of conventional imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso In group 2, no zzso cases were observed with zzso scan zzso zzso In group 3, zzso scan correctly identified all the zzso zzso zzso except in two patients with zzso pulmonary zzso that were zzso with zzso zzso In contrast, both zzso scan and US showed low sensitivity zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso scan in detecting zzso zzso zzso was increased in all patients with distant zzso but only in zzso of those with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was increased in zzso of patients with zzso remnants alone zzso zzso In group 4, zzso scan was the only examination capable of detecting at an early stage a zzso zzso zzso zzso in one zzso We conclude that the integrated zzso zzso US zzso zzso can be proposed as a zzso diagnostic procedure in the follow-up of DTC patients with high zzso levels and negative high-dose zzso zzso and zzso may be helpful in the follow-up of DTC patients who undergo partial zzso zzso Moreover, the combined zzso zzso zzso protocol appears to be highly sensitive in identifying patients with zzso disease after total zzso and prior to zzso zzso consequently, it may play a zzso role in distinguishing high-risk from low-risk DTC zzso However, due to the low sensitivity of zzso scan and neck US in detecting zzso zzso this diagnostic approach cannot be used as a predictor of zzso scan zzso Lastly, because of the high sensitivity of zzso scan and neck US in revealing both functioning and zzso zzso this integrated protocol might be helpful in the follow-up of high-risk DTC patients, particularly for the early detection of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso during zzso
