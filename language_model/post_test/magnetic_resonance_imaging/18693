The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting bone zzso involvement in cancer zzso 

We studied 50 consecutive patients with zzso confirmed zzso dissemination to the bone zzso using zzso of the zzso zzso zzso intensity zzso were generated from regions of interest zzso obtained from areas of obvious bone zzso disease zzso zzso In 16 patients from group B with focal disease, zzso were also placed on areas with apparently normal bone zzso on zzso magnetic resonance images zzso zzso Twenty-two patients with no history of zzso were used as a control group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rates, time to peak zzso time to maximum slope zzso values and zzso ratios were calculated for each zzso Mean values for the three groups were compared zzso Six patients from group B had follow-up zzso after zzso four patients achieved a clinical partial response and two had resistant zzso 

A significant difference was found between groups A and B for all zzso Between groups A and C, in spite of the similar zzso zzso appearance, all values were significantly zzso Between groups B and C, a significant difference was found for zzso zzso rates and zzso zzso zzso zzso data analysis correlated well with clinical zzso 

zzso can distinguish normal from zzso bone zzso It may identify zzso bone zzso zzso in patients with negative zzso zzso and serve as both a diagnostic and zzso tool for patients with bone zzso zzso
