zzso stimuli consistently activate the zzso zzso zzso in normal subjects and have exaggerated effects on memory in patients with panic zzso We hypothesized that panic patients would show increased response to zzso stimuli in the zzso zzso zzso While undergoing zzso six panic patients and eight healthy volunteers made zzso zzso of zzso and neutral zzso Both groups showed zzso zzso in the left zzso zzso and left middle frontal zzso but the zzso was significantly greater in panic zzso zzso patients also had more zzso asymmetry of zzso in the zzso zzso The increased zzso observed in the zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso is consistent with the hypothesis that panic disorder patients engage in more extensive memory processing of zzso zzso
