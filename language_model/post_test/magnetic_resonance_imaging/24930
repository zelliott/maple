zzso is an important cause of vitamin B12 zzso especially in countries like zzso We managed 17 patients with neurological syndrome due to vitamin B12 zzso in a zzso care referral teaching hospital which caters to relatively affluent zzso 

To evaluate zzso and zzso changes in patients presenting with vitamin B12 zzso neurological syndrome and interpret these is the light of reported autopsy zzso 

zzso care referral teaching zzso 

Patients with vitamin B12 zzso neurological syndrome diagnosed by low serum vitamin B12 and/or zzso bone zzso were subjected to clinical evaluation and spinal zzso The zzso tests included nerve zzso studies, zzso zzso evoked potential zzso motor evoked potential zzso and visual evoked potential zzso zzso The recovery was defined on the basis of 6 months zzso Index score into complete, partial or zzso 

There were 17 patients with vitamin B12 zzso neurological syndrome, 3 were females and 12 zzso The clinical syndrome was that of zzso in 8, zzso in 5, zzso zzso in 3 and zzso in 1 zzso All the patients had impaired joint position and zzso sensation in the lower limbs and 4 had in upper limbs as zzso Lower limbs were zzso in 13 and upper limbs in 2 zzso Spinal zzso revealed zzso zzso in zzso region in 6 and zzso zzso in 3 zzso zzso nerve zzso was abnormal in 8 and zzso zzso in 5 zzso In one patient all sensory nerve zzso were zzso but motor zzso were zzso zzso zzso was abnormal in 12 out of 15 and lower limb zzso in 8 out of 12 zzso zzso zzso of zzso was prolonged in 7 out of 13 zzso Right to left asymmetry was present in zzso zzso in 4 and zzso in 2 zzso At 6 months followup 2 patients improved completely, 7 partially and 3 had poor zzso Clinical recovery correlated with zzso but not with zzso or zzso zzso 

The evoked potential and zzso changes in vitamin B12 zzso neurological syndrome are consistent with focal zzso of white matter in spinal zzso and zzso zzso zzso presentation is zzso and zzso is more frequently zzso The outcome at 6 months correlated with zzso zzso
