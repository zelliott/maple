To compare the diagnostic performances of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso for detection of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso studies were identified with zzso and zzso from January 1990 to July zzso We estimated the weighted summary sensitivities, zzso OR zzso zzso and summary receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso of each imaging technique and conducted zzso comparisons using the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and funnel plots were also performed to explain the zzso zzso 

zzso eligible studies were included, with a total of zzso zzso PET or zzso was a more accurate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was detected between CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso analyses revealed no statistical zzso zzso plots with marked asymmetry suggested a publication zzso 

zzso or zzso is more accurate than CT and MR imaging in the detection of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso
