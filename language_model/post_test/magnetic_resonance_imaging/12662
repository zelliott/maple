The zzso formation, including the zzso zzso is known to be involved in different aspects of navigation and spatial zzso Recently, bilateral zzso zzso during mental imagery of walking and running was demonstrated in zzso For the current study the question was whether distinct functional regions within the zzso formation could be defined from the analysis of brain activity during imagery of stance and locomotion in healthy, blind, and zzso zzso Using the same experimental paradigm in all groups zzso during mental imagery of stance and locomotion after training of actual performance, regions of interest zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso formation, predominantly on the right side, in all zzso In healthy subjects, standing was associated with anterior zzso zzso during locomotion widespread activity was found in the right zzso zzso Compared to healthy controls, blind subjects showed less activity in the right zzso zzso region, whereas zzso subjects had less activity in the anterior zzso zzso The findings show that the zzso formation in humans processes visual and zzso signals in different zzso The data support the assumption that the anterior zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso region are input areas for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are connected to visual cortical areas, are more important for visually guided locomotion and landmark recognition during zzso The zzso dominance reflects the importance of the right zzso for spatial zzso
