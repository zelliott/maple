Safety is a primary concern with contrast agents used for zzso If precautions could be taken before the repeated administration of zzso contrast media, then the awareness and management of adverse reactions would be more zzso 

To assess the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso in Japan, zzso in other zzso a zzso contrast agent, in patients undergoing imaging of the zzso zzso and/or zzso and to identify factors associated with the onset of adverse zzso 

The study ran for 4 years and included zzso zzso The study was conducted before it became known that zzso contrast agents could trigger the development of zzso systemic zzso Patients for whom the contrast agent was indicated and who underwent imaging of the zzso zzso and/or zzso by zzso were zzso There were zzso zzso who were followed up during hospitalization (for several zzso and zzso zzso who were followed up for at least 2 hours zzso After zzso administration, 13 patient baseline characteristics were used to explore factors that might predict a greater likelihood of acute zzso adverse zzso The zzso appraisal of the efficacy of zzso was also zzso 

A total of 40 adverse reactions were recorded in 32 patients, giving an overall zzso of adverse reactions of zzso zzso disorders were the most commonly reported adverse reactions zzso Most adverse reactions reported were of mild intensity and no serious adverse reactions were zzso This study found that statistically significant risk factors for adverse reactions were general patient condition, liver disorder, kidney disorder, health zzso zzso treatments, and zzso dose (although the zzso of adverse reactions was not dose zzso In the majority of cases zzso the efficacy of zzso was rated as zzso or zzso zzso only the presence of kidney disorder was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of zzso zzso 

Overall, this zzso surveillance study did not reveal any zzso or unexpected findings concerning the safety or efficacy of zzso The low zzso of adverse reactions zzso and the absence of serious adverse reactions reported during the survey period showed that zzso was very well zzso The use of zzso as an zzso contrast medium in the clinical practice setting appears to be safe and zzso
