Although variations in zzso zzso occur in diverse zzso and neurodegenerative disorders, little is known about the nature of underlying genetic zzso The current study investigated the importance of a specific type of genetic zzso copy number variation zzso for zzso zzso in a bilateral anterior zzso zzso 

These zzso signals were zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data were collected using the zzso zzso zzso from a sample adults with alcohol use disorders zzso zzso zzso 

The number of base pairs lost through rare copy number deletions zzso in less than zzso of our zzso predicted lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso More total rare deletions also predicted lower zzso zzso and zzso Principal components analyses of the five zzso identified two correlated zzso the first comprised of zzso zzso and zzso and the second comprised of zzso zzso and to a lesser extent, zzso The number and length of rare deletions were correlated with the first zzso capturing approximately zzso of zzso zzso but not the second zzso 

These results suggest that zzso load affects zzso zzso potentially increasing risk for zzso zzso The greater effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso may reflect a greater sensitivity to the effects of zzso zzso reduced zzso for zzso related to zzso activity and cellular zzso due to extensive recent selection pressure on these zzso in the human zzso
