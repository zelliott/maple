Vertigo is sometimes experienced in and around zzso zzso zzso involving stimulation of the zzso system by movement in magnetic fields or magnetic field spatial zzso have been zzso However, it was recently shown that zzso zzso zzso is evoked when stationary in zzso zzso magnetic zzso The proposed mechanism involves zzso forces acting on zzso to deflect semicircular canal zzso zzso To investigate whether vertigo arises from a similar mechanism we recorded qualitative and quantitative aspects of vertigo and zzso eye movements from zzso healthy adults zzso deprived of vision while pushed into the zzso zzso field of an zzso zzso zzso were variable and included up to zzso stationary at zzso zzso was mainly zzso persisted during zzso with partial decline, and reversed upon zzso The dominant zzso perception with the head facing up was rotation in the horizontal plane zzso zzso with a consistent direction across zzso With the head turned 90 degrees in zzso the perception did not transform into equivalent vertical plane zzso indicating a zzso of the zzso During long zzso zzso rotation lasted on average 50 zzso including 42 s whilst stationary at zzso Upon withdrawal, perception re-emerged and zzso lasting on average 30 zzso zzso fields for zzso and perception were significantly correlated zzso Although perception did not persist as long as zzso this is a known feature of continuous zzso zzso These zzso and others in the paper, are compatible with zzso zzso and zzso sharing a common zzso With this zzso response zzso and reversal upon withdrawal from the field, are due to adaptation to continuous zzso zzso Although the study does not entirely exclude the possibility of mechanisms involving transient zzso stimulation during movement in and out of the zzso we argue these are less zzso
