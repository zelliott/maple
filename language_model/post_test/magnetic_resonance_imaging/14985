New zzso complex zzso containing zzso was achieved for selective magnetic resonance imaging towards zzso zzso over other zzso zzso in zzso media and in zzso The formation of strong zzso bonds between zzso and zzso made the zzso in zzso zzso positioned on a suitable site to coordinate with the zzso zzso The substitution of the coordination zzso by the zzso oxygen atoms caused obvious zzso zzso The negligible zzso and appropriate blood circulation time of zzso allow potential application of zzso zzso Imaging in zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the selectivity of these zzso complexes towards zzso was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso and the zzso The zzso detection and lifetime measurement of zzso and zzso suggested that the decrease of the zzso is not attributed to the change of the zzso value, but caused by the zzso of the residence lifetime of zzso zzso
