To zzso evaluate the size of the zzso nerve on magnetic resonance zzso images of patients with unilateral zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was zzso for this zzso zzso The sizes of the zzso nerves in 31 patients (18 men and 13 zzso mean age, 68 years; age range, zzso zzso with clinically confirmed intractable unilateral zzso zzso were measured before treatment with gamma knife zzso Images were analyzed separately by two zzso who were blinded to the side of the face with zzso zzso projection images were used to determine the diameter and zzso area of the zzso nerves at 5 zzso from the entry point of the nerve into the zzso Comparisons were made by using a paired zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by using the zzso correlation zzso 

The mean diameter of the zzso nerve on the symptomatic side was significantly smaller than the mean diameter on the zzso side in 30 of 31 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso area on the symptomatic side was significantly smaller than the area on the zzso side in 27 of 31 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso nerve zzso can be depicted zzso in patients with zzso zzso
