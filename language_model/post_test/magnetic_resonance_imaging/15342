A dual probe with fluorescent and magnetic reporter groups was constructed by linkage of the zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso on the surface of contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso This probe was used for magnetic resonance imaging zzso and optical imaging of zzso breast cancer cells grown as a zzso in zzso and as solid tumor zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso optical imaging, and zzso showed a dramatic increase of in zzso cellular zzso of the fluorescent and magnetic reporter groups from the probe compared with the zzso of contrast agent or zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso blocked zzso of the probe reporters, indicating the importance and specificity of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso administration of the dual probe to nude mice significantly enhanced the tumor contrast in zzso and preferential zzso of the fluorescent signal was clearly seen in zzso optical zzso More interestingly, the contrast enhancement in zzso showed a zzso pattern within tumors, which reflected the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the newly developed dual probe enhances the tumor image contrast and is superior to contrast agent alone for identifying the tumor zzso features on the basis of zzso but also is suitable for zzso optical zzso
