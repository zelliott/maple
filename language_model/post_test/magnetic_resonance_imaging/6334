Twelve patients with different diseases of the brain were examined with sodium and zzso zzso at zzso zzso and the results of both studies zzso Due to the zzso lower concentration in the body, the decreased sensitivity and the shorter relaxation times of sodium compared with hydrogen a sequence with zzso reversal and a volume imaging method was applied to achieve a short echo time zzso zzso As a result of the mainly zzso distribution of sodium the zzso spaces are depicted by their high signal intensity while the normal zzso is not zzso Changes induced by encephalitis, zzso zzso and tumors can also be detected by their increased sodium zzso Different tumors provided different signal zzso not always permitting a distinction between zzso surrounding zzso and zzso The diagnostic impact of these findings is zzso
