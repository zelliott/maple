Whether objects are represented as a collection of parts whose relations are coded independently remains a topic of ongoing discussion among theorists in the domain of shape zzso zzso zzso an individual with zzso zzso and zzso intact zzso individuals learned initially to identify 4 target objects constructed of 2 simple zzso zzso At test, the targets were mixed with zzso some of which could be zzso from the targets on the basis of a zzso part, whereas the rest could be zzso only on the basis of the altered spatial arrangements of zzso zzso zzso learned to identify the target objects, although at a rate slower than that of the normal zzso At test, he correctly rejected zzso on the basis of zzso parts but was profoundly impaired at rejecting zzso made of the same local components but with zzso spatial zzso These results suggest that zzso the spatial arrangements of parts of an object requires a mechanism that is different from that required for zzso the shape of individual parts, with the former selectively compromised in zzso zzso
