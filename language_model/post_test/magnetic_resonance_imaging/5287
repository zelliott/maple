To determine whether the burden of zzso and the number of brain zzso defined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso are zzso and independently associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in a pooled zzso zzso 

Among zzso participants initially free of clinical stroke in the zzso zzso in Communities Study and the zzso Health zzso we assessed white matter grade zzso zzso reflecting increasing zzso and brain zzso using zzso Over a median of 13 years of zzso 71 incident, spontaneous zzso events zzso 

After adjustment for other zzso risk factors, the hazard ratios zzso confidence zzso across white matter grades 0 to 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 9 were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso for trend zzso These hazard ratios were weakened only modestly zzso for trend zzso zzso with adjustment for zzso brain zzso The zzso hazard ratios for 0, 1, 2, or zzso zzso brain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for trend zzso zzso but these were substantially attenuated when adjusted for white matter grade zzso for trend zzso zzso 

Greater zzso burden of zzso is a risk factor for spontaneous zzso zzso zzso should be added to the growing list of potential poor outcomes in people with zzso
