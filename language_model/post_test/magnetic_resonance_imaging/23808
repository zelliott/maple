The aim of this study was to compare the zzso results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using zzso zzso zzso harvested through a zzso traditional technique zzso zzso with the results of a subcutaneous technique aiming at protecting the zzso nerves and the zzso zzso zzso Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the donor zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso was performed to evaluate the zzso after harvesting its central zzso zzso of zzso ability and assessments of anterior knee sensitivity were made in order to evaluate zzso discomfort and the function of zzso zzso zzso consecutive patients were included in the study; group A comprised 35 patients and group B, 37 zzso At the zzso zzso the zzso activity level, the zzso score, and the zzso evaluation system showed no significant differences between groups A and zzso The median loss of normal anterior knee sensitivity was 16 zzso zzso 0 to 200 zzso in group A and 0 zzso zzso 0 to 285 zzso in group B zzso zzso zzso In group A zzso of the patients and in group B zzso had normal sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso gap zzso corresponding to zzso tissue zzso was 5 zzso zzso 0 to 9 zzso in group A and 2 zzso zzso 0 to 5 zzso in group B zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso the subcutaneous zzso technique resulted in less zzso of anterior knee sensitivity and a smaller zzso gap than the traditional zzso
