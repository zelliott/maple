To evaluate the changes in the size of focal zzso zzso zzso during long-term magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

We reviewed 44 zzso in 30 patients studied with zzso with at least two zzso studies at least 12 months zzso We measured the largest diameter of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso images and calculated the percentage of variation as the difference between the maximum diameter in the follow-up and the maximum diameter in the initial zzso We defined significant variation in size as variation greater than zzso We also analyzed zzso hormonal zzso 

The mean zzso between the two imaging studies was zzso months zzso zzso Most zzso zzso remained stable during zzso Only 9 of the 44 zzso zzso showed a significant variation in zzso 7 zzso decreased in size and 2 zzso increased, with variations that reached the double of the initial zzso The change in size was not related to pregnancy, menopause, or the use of birth control pills or zzso 

Changes in the size of zzso during follow-up are relatively common and should not lead to a change in the zzso These variations in size seem to be independent of hormonal factors that are considered to zzso
