Although regions within the zzso frontal zzso are known to be active during voluntary movements their precise role remains zzso Here we combine functional imaging zzso with zzso to demonstrate a zzso selective zzso impairment in the ability to inhibit ongoing movement plans in a patient with a rare zzso involving the right zzso motor area zzso but sparing the supplementary motor area zzso We find no corresponding delay in simple reaction times, and show that the zzso deficit is sensitive to the presence of competition between zzso The findings demonstrate that the zzso plays a critical role in exerting control over voluntary actions in situations of response zzso We discuss these findings in the context of a unified framework of zzso function, and explore the degree to which extant data on this region can be explained by this function zzso
