To better define the survival and cellular composition of human fetal zzso in zzso we performed quantitative zzso MRS to determine the concentration of the zzso zzso acid zzso within zzso zzso In all, 71 zzso in 38 patients zzso Parkinson's disease zzso 14 zzso disease zzso were zzso as well as 24 zzso zzso and HD patients and 13 zzso normal zzso zzso appearances of zzso were present in three out of 71 zzso the remainder being consistent with zzso identified viable neural transplant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso were identified in all zzso zzso with abnormal zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in only three zzso Of 71 zzso 19 occupied more than zzso of the zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso In those, zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in eight zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in 11 HD zzso and was not significantly different from zzso In contrast, transplanted fetal zzso contain less than zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso This suggests that established fetal zzso in the human zzso of both zzso and HD patients are populated by adult zzso zzso and zzso
