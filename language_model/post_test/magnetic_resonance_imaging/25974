To investigate the usefulness of zzso zzso zzso technique in detecting zzso zzso bone injuries in the zzso zzso injuries account for pain and, if not properly treated, may progress to severe zzso and bone zzso An early diagnosis provided by zzso can help avoid zzso zzso 

We submitted to zzso of the knee 51 patients (32 men and 19 zzso with negative plain zzso findings and at least one traumatic bone injury at zzso MR examinations were performed with a zzso T unit and included a conventional zzso or zzso zzso sequence and an opposed phase zzso sequence on the zzso or zzso plane zzso minutes zzso To assess the zzso number and zzso images were zzso reviewed by two zzso zzso zzso was graded zzso 0 zzso zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso signal intensity ratio was calculated in 30 zzso a zzso was positioned in the site of highest signal intensity and adjacent bone zzso and the ratio analyzed with zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso images showed 71 injuries in 51 zzso Conventional zzso imaging missed zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso images was of grade 2 in 58 cases zzso and of grade 1 in 13 cases zzso versus 23 zzso and 42 zzso respectively, on conventional zzso zzso zzso was graded as 0 in 6 cases zzso on conventional zzso zzso analysis of zzso signal intensity ratio showed higher values for zzso zzso than conventional zzso 

zzso zzso are quick sequences available on all MR systems which appear superior to conventional zzso images in detecting zzso injuries in the zzso Injuries are more conspicuous because their signal intensity is lower due to the simultaneous presence of fat and water zzso which is typical of bone zzso zzso sequences make a useful and rapid complement to zzso fat zzso acquisitions in the study of the post-traumatic zzso
