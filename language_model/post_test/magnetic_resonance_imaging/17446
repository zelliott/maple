To investigate the value of zzso CT and zzso in the evaluation of efficacy of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

One hundred patients with zzso cancer were treated by zzso zzso between October 1999 and September zzso All patients had been examined by serum zzso zzso CT or zzso before and within one month after zzso 

Before zzso 34 patients who had had CT, the tumor showed zzso or zzso zzso and enhancement on dynamic zzso After zzso 14 patients were examined by CT zzso Compared with the density on CT scan before zzso 5 patients showed lower density zzso without any enhancement on dynamic zzso but the other 9 patients showed similar images to the previous CT scan before zzso in some parts of their zzso Before zzso 66 patients examined by zzso showed zzso on zzso image, zzso on zzso image and enhancement on dynamic zzso After zzso among 86 patients examined by zzso 44 showed zzso or zzso on zzso image, zzso or zzso on zzso image and no enhancement on dynamic zzso But 42 patients showed similar images to the previous zzso imaging performed before zzso in some parts of their zzso 

Both CT and zzso can be used as imaging evaluation tool on the effect of zzso zzso for zzso zzso However, zzso is better than CT to detect whether the tumor is zzso or still partly viable after zzso zzso Patients can be regarded as clinically cured provided that the serum zzso declines to the normal level from zzso high level and/or zzso or CT scans show a complete zzso zzso after zzso
