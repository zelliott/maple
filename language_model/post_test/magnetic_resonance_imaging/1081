A series of structurally different zzso zzso incorporating a zzso acid zzso have been zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso have been selected as zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso have been incorporated as the zzso acid zzso In first generation zzso the zzso complex is linked to the zzso group of zzso zzso Second generation zzso feature the attachment of the zzso complex to the 3 position of the zzso backbone of the zzso zzso Finally, in third generation zzso the zzso complex is attached to the zzso nitrogen atom of zzso The zzso are eliminated through the zzso route to a various extent zzso to zzso in zzso according to their structural zzso Among the most promising terms, a second generation zzso in which the zzso complex is linked to zzso acid through the zzso zzso group seems to enter zzso using the zzso zzso zzso some of the second generation zzso are characterized by very high zzso zzso up to zzso zzso after intravenous administration in zzso
