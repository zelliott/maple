To evaluate the pattern of failure after limited margin zzso for zzso 

We analyzed 62 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed zzso treated between 2006 and 2008 with standard zzso to a total dose of 60 zzso with concurrent zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The initial clinical target volume included zzso zzso zzso with a median margin of zzso zzso The boost clinical target volume included residual zzso tumor and zzso cavity with a median margin of zzso zzso Planning target volumes added a zzso or zzso margin to clinical target zzso The total boost planning target volume zzso margin was zzso or less in zzso of zzso The volume of zzso tumor (new zzso zzso was zzso by the percent within the zzso zzso line as central zzso infield zzso marginal zzso or distant zzso For comparison, an initial planning target volume with a zzso margin and zzso with a zzso margin were created for each zzso 

With a median follow-up of 12 months, zzso tumor progression developed in 43 of 62 zzso Imaging was available for analysis in zzso 38 zzso had central or infield failure, 2 zzso had marginal failure, and 1 zzso had distant failure relative to the zzso zzso zzso The treated zzso zzso 140 zzso was, on average, zzso less than the zzso with a zzso margin zzso 477 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso margin of zzso or less did not appear to increase the risk of marginal and/or distant tumor failures compared with other published zzso With careful radiation planning and delivery, it appears that treatment margins for zzso can be zzso
