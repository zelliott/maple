zzso zzso zzso is characterized by uncontrolled inflammation that is generally fatal without immune modulating zzso At Texas Children's Hospital, we have observed significant central nervous system zzso toxicity in several patients treated for zzso according to the zzso Society protocol zzso in which zzso is given early in the treatment zzso 

Patients diagnosed with zzso at Texas Children's Hospital between April 2004 and October 2007 were identified and charts were zzso A reference group of patients treated between August 2001 and March 2004, prior to the introduction of zzso was also zzso 

Five of 17 patients in the study group developed severe zzso Four had new onset zzso associated with significant zzso zzso while the fifth died of zzso zzso zzso of the development of zzso side effects ranged from day 5 to week 6 of zzso zzso levels were outside the therapeutic range zzso zzso prior to the onset of symptoms in two of the five zzso zzso blood pressures for all five patients were greater than the 95th zzso for age on at least one measurement within 24 zzso of the onset of zzso zzso zzso scans obtained within 24 zzso of seizure activity in four patients were consistent with zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso By comparison only one patient in the reference group zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso 

Patients being treated for zzso appear to be at risk for zzso particularly zzso zzso blood pressure, worsening zzso and liver function, increased zzso levels, and zzso involvement of zzso may be triggers for the zzso side effects of zzso Patients being treated on zzso require close monitoring of their zzso status and modifiable risk factors such as hypertension should managed zzso If larger studies validate our zzso it will be important to determine if zzso zzso in zzso protocols zzso a survival benefit that outweighs the potential risk of increased zzso
