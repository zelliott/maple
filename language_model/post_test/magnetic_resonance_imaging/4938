The zzso default network zzso is comprised of several cortical regions demonstrating robust intrinsic connectivity at zzso The authors sought to examine the differential effects of emotional reasoning and reasoning under certainty upon the zzso through the employment of an zzso zzso design in healthy zzso Participants were presented with zzso arguments which were organized into a 2 zzso 2 zzso design in which the first factor was emotional zzso and the second factor was zzso We demonstrate that regions of the zzso were activated both during reasoning that is emotionally salient and during reasoning which is more certain, suggesting that these processes are zzso zzso on a network zzso In addition, we present evidence that emotional reasoning zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso whereas reasoning in the context of certainty activates areas specific to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that emotional reasoning zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso because this type of reasoning relies upon the recruitment of zzso and zzso data such as personal bias and zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso during certainty argues that this form of reasoning involves the recruitment of zzso and semantic associations to derive zzso
