The authors analyzed a single group's experience treating abdominal zzso zzso zzso with a new zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso exclusion of zzso by zzso devices has led to several controlled clinical trials evaluating zzso designed and manufactured specifically for this zzso 

Sixteen patients (15 zzso 1 zzso of American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 2 through 4 and average age of 72 years had zzso zzso zzso zzso treated as part of a phase I Food and Drug zzso zzso 

All patients were treated successfully with no surgical zzso No zzso or aneurysm enlargement was noted either zzso by contrast zzso zzso or on follow-up at 1 month by duplex ultrasound zzso At 6 months, 12 of 13 patients who were observed for this zzso had no zzso whereas one patient zzso 3) showed a small area of zzso that appeared to arise from the device in an area that was traumatized at the time of zzso One zzso mortality zzso occurred in a patient who died of septic complications secondary to a zzso gallbladder diagnosed 1 day after the zzso There were no zzso zzso zzso included two zzso artery zzso two groin wound infections, and two transient zzso of serum zzso Other significant variables including median procedure length (5 hours), intensive care unit stay (1 zzso hospitalization zzso zzso zzso and blood loss zzso zzso all decreased as the study zzso Blood replacement in all but three patients was accomplished by zzso or zzso blood zzso At zzso follow-up in 13 patients, the maximum diameter of the aneurysm decreased by an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso area decreased an average of zzso zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso exclusion of zzso using a zzso modular device may be effective in many patients who are otherwise surgical candidates for repair if further clinical studies confirm these zzso
