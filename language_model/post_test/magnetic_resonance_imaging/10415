zzso zzso Imaging zzso has become the method of choice in the evaluation of patients with suspected cervical artery dissection zzso However, reliable identification of acute zzso might be impaired by the limited spatial resolution of standard zzso T zzso In this preliminary study, we implemented a zzso high-resolution zzso vessel wall imaging approach at zzso T in patients with spontaneous zzso 

Ten patients with zzso of the internal carotid artery zzso were included in the zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso was acquired using a dedicated zzso zzso zzso consisted of: zzso bright blood zzso inflow zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso degrees , 120 zzso reconstructed zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso black blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso GE zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso degrees , 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso black blood cardiac triggered fat suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 heart zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso Three observers in consensus performed image zzso Special attention was paid to the integrity of the zzso and zzso vessel boundary and the presence of a zzso zzso tear or zzso 

zzso T zzso provided excellent zzso of vessel zzso and vessel wall as a result of the nearly complete suppression of zzso blood zzso An zzso zzso could be identified in all patients, confined between the zzso and zzso vessel zzso In no patient a zzso zzso tear could be zzso Clear distinction between zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

zzso vessel wall imaging in patients with acute zzso is zzso The increased zzso ratio at zzso T can be invested to obtain a higher spatial resolution, permitting depiction of zzso and zzso vessel wall boundary and the zzso zzso in the diseased vessel zzso The zzso information that is gained is helpful in the understanding of the underlying zzso of zzso
