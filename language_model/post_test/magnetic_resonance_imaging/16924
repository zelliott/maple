The objective of this paper was to automatically segment the zzso from zzso human brain magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The proposed method zzso a zzso template using five sets of zzso MR imaging zzso data, which are used to determine the initial position and the shape prior of the zzso for the active zzso zzso Our zzso includes the active zzso model with shape zzso which thereby maintains the shape of the zzso The proposed active zzso model is zzso applied to zzso zzso and zzso zzso To evaluate the proposed method, it is applied to zzso data and a zzso zzso data set and compared with zzso with respect to performance assessment zzso 

The segmented zzso was compared with the results from zzso Using the manually segmented zzso as reference, we measured the average zzso zzso of the proposed method, which were zzso and zzso for the zzso data and zzso zzso data set, zzso 

We presented the active zzso model with shape prior for zzso the zzso from zzso brain MR zzso The proposed method yielded a robust and accurate zzso zzso
