zzso data are increasingly being used to predict potential outcomes or zzso such as clinical severity, drug dose response, and transitional illness zzso In these examples, the variable zzso we want to predict is zzso in zzso Conventional zzso schemes assume that the targets are nominal and hence ignore their ranked nature, whereas zzso and/or zzso zzso models enforce a metric notion of distance between zzso Here, we propose a novel, alternative zzso approach that overcomes these limitations - whole brain zzso zzso zzso using a zzso process zzso We applied this technique to two data sets of pharmacological zzso data from healthy zzso The first study was designed to investigate the effect of zzso on brain activity and its subsequent zzso with two compounds - zzso and zzso The second study investigates the effect of zzso on cerebral blood flow and its zzso using zzso We compared zzso zzso to zzso zzso schemes and metric zzso Considering the zzso of zzso with zzso we found that zzso zzso significantly outperformed zzso zzso and metric zzso in terms of accuracy and mean absolute zzso However, for zzso zzso zzso significantly outperformed metric zzso but performed similarly to zzso zzso both in terms of accuracy and mean absolute zzso For the zzso data set, zzso zzso was found to outperform both zzso and metric zzso techniques considering the regional cerebral blood flow in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso was thus the only method that performed well in all zzso Our results indicate the potential of an zzso zzso approach for zzso data while providing a fully zzso framework with elegant approaches for model zzso
