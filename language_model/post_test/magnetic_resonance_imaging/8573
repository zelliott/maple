The sustained negative blood zzso zzso zzso response in functional zzso is observed universally, but its interpretation is zzso The origin of the negative response is of fundamental importance because it could provide a measurement of neural zzso However, a substantial component of the negative response may be due to a zzso zzso zzso To distinguish these possibilities, we have measured evoked zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and oxygen metabolism responses to a fixed visual stimulus from two different baseline zzso One is a normal resting zzso and the other is a lower baseline induced by a sustained negative zzso For both baseline conditions, zzso and oxygen metabolism responses reach the same peak zzso zzso evoked responses from the negative baseline are larger than those from the resting zzso The larger zzso response from negative baseline presumably reflects a greater neural response that is required to reach the same peak zzso as that from resting zzso Furthermore, the ratio of zzso to oxygen metabolism remains approximately the same from both baseline states zzso zzso This tight zzso between zzso and zzso components implies that the magnitude of any zzso artifact is zzso We conclude that the negative response is a functionally significant index of neural zzso in early visual zzso
