To determine whether zzso is an accurate marker of right zzso zzso zzso function in patients with zzso of zzso zzso and patients with small zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso plane zzso excursion zzso values were measured and compared with RV ejection fraction zzso 

A prospective study was conducted in pediatric and adolescent patients with zzso zzso with isolated small zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients with normally structured zzso The zzso values showed a positive correlation with age in both patients with zzso and normal zzso No significant difference of zzso values was seen in control subjects and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was not decreased compared to normal subjects in eight infant zzso patients before corrective zzso A reduction of zzso values with increasing time zzso following corrective surgery was zzso After a mean of zzso zzso values become significantly reduced compared to zzso controls, being below the lower bound of the zzso zzso 

In zzso patients the zzso RV function was preserved over the pediatric age group when compared to normal zzso In contrast, although initially zzso we found an impaired zzso with increasing zzso period in our zzso zzso
