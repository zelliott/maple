This article is based on an introductory lecture given for the past many years during the zzso Physics and zzso for zzso course at the Annual Meeting of the zzso This introduction is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the field, as the subject of magnetic resonance imaging zzso physics is large and zzso Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive zzso The presentation is zzso relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of zzso through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an zzso zzso the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso relaxation, and a discussion of the zzso transform and its relation to MR image zzso The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field zzso are used to facilitate spatial zzso and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image zzso
