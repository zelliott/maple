zzso resonance imaging zzso is the most popular follow-up study for patients who have undergone spinal zzso However, the image quality often becomes poor because of artifacts from metal implants and/or from failed fat suppression, which obscure zzso zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and zzso zzso zzso is a new fat suppression method that is less affected by zzso of the magnetic zzso Here, we compared zzso spinal zzso with zzso versus chemical shift selective zzso zzso 

For 35 patients who had spinal surgery, we examined zzso fast zzso zzso images of the spine with both zzso and zzso Two zzso evaluated the degrees of fat suppression and spinal canal projection from 0 zzso to 2 zzso 

Fat suppression and spinal canal scores for zzso were statistically higher than those for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and zzso zzso is clinically useful for zzso spinal zzso
