To evaluate the effectiveness of the single zzso approach for the detection of zzso iron burden in zzso major zzso patients in respect to a whole liver zzso 

Five zzso zzso slices were acquired by a zzso zzso sequence in 101 TM patients and 20 healthy zzso The zzso value was calculated in a single region of interest zzso defined in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso value was extracted on each of the eight zzso defined in the functionally independent zzso The mean zzso zzso value was zzso 

For patients, the mean zzso values over segments zzso and VIII were significantly zzso This pattern was substantially preserved in the two groups identified considering the zzso normal zzso All zzso zzso values were correlated with the single zzso zzso zzso After the application of a correction map based on zzso fluctuations in the healthy subjects, no significant differences were found in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso variations are low and due to artifacts and measurement zzso The single zzso approach can be adopted in the clinical arena, taking care to avoid the zzso artifacts, occurring mainly in segments zzso and zzso
