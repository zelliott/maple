To assess zzso factors of long-term facial nerve function in a series of patients undergoing zzso zzso surgery and to evaluate the zzso of the relevant zzso 

zzso 

Three zzso referral zzso units in two separate zzso 

A total of 67 patients, with normal zzso facial function and an zzso intact facial nerve zzso undergoing zzso zzso surgery during a sequential zzso zzso 

Recording of zzso stimulus zzso zzso intensity zzso to the tumor after zzso and zzso facial nerve function up to 2 years after zzso 

zzso facial nerve function related to tumor size, early zzso facial nerve function, and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso model identified tumor size and the minimum intensity required to provoke a stimulus threshold event zzso to the tumor after zzso as independent zzso of a favorable initial zzso Immediate facial nerve function was the only independent predictor of long-term normal zzso The sensitivity of this predictor was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso zzso and tumor size are zzso and better zzso of initial facial nerve function than any individual zzso but long-term facial nerve function is more likely to have a better outcome if the nerve is left intact and a zzso graft repair is not zzso The study suggests that although the best available predictor of overall long-term facial nerve outcome is the level of early zzso function, this factor is not useful in surgical rehabilitation decision zzso
