Diagnosis of AS and zzso abnormalities by routine MR imaging sequences is challenging for zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of the zzso sequence with zzso in patients with suspected zzso 

zzso and zzso images were obtained in 21 patients who had zzso on routine MR imaging scans and had clinical suspicion of zzso as well as in 12 control zzso zzso zzso was visually scored zzso 0, zzso grade 1, partial zzso grade 2, complete zzso by 2 experienced zzso on zzso (plus routine zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two separate scores were statistically compared with each other as well as with the consensus scores obtained from general agreement of both zzso 

There was an excellent correlation between zzso and zzso scores zzso zzso zzso The correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was higher compared with the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, P zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sequence with zzso alone can be used for adequate and successful evaluation of the zzso zzso without the need for additional sequences and zzso zzso evaluation of the whole zzso is possible in a short time with high resolution by using zzso
