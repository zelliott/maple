We evaluate novel magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative imaging zzso and associated zzso zzso analysis zzso with the ultimate aim of providing clinically zzso zzso measures for early assessment of response to cancer zzso A focus of this work is method development and an investigation of the relationship between the information content of the two zzso Imaging studies were conducted on subjects who were enrolled in zzso zzso zzso therapeutic clinical zzso Data were acquired, analyzed and displayed using methods that could be adapted for clinical zzso zzso underwent dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso structural zzso scans at baseline zzso initiation of zzso at an early time point after beginning therapy and at a late follow-up time point after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso PET images were registered to the structural zzso zzso zzso PET zzso distribution volumes and sodium zzso zzso were calculated on a zzso basis to address the zzso of tumor zzso Changes in, and differences between, these quantities as a function of scan timing were zzso While both zzso independently show a change in tissue status as a function of scan time point, results illustrate that the two zzso may provide complementary information regarding tumor progression and zzso Additionally, tumor status changes were found to vary in different regions of zzso The degree to which these methods are useful for zzso therapy response assessment and particularly for zzso true progression from zzso requires additional patient data and correlation of these imaging zzso changes with clinical zzso
