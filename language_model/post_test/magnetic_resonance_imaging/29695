In the human brain, little is known about the functional anatomy and response properties of zzso zzso containing visual maps such as the lateral zzso nucleus zzso and the zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 3 zzso zzso collective responses of neural populations in the zzso were measured as a function of stimulus contrast and flicker reversal rate and compared with those obtained in visual zzso zzso zzso stimuli presented in zzso to the right and left zzso reliably activated the zzso The peak of the zzso zzso was found to be on average within zzso zzso of the anatomical location of the zzso as identified on high-resolution structural zzso In all visual areas except the middle zzso zzso zzso responses increased zzso with stimulus zzso In the zzso the dynamic response range of the contrast function was larger and contrast gain was lower than in the zzso zzso sensitivity was lowest in the zzso and zzso and increased gradually in zzso zzso In area zzso responses were saturated at zzso zzso Response zzso by changes in flicker rate was similar in the zzso and zzso and occurred mainly in the frequency range between zzso and zzso zzso in contrast, in zzso areas zzso zzso and zzso responses were modulated mainly in the frequency range between zzso and 20 zzso In the human zzso no zzso were obtained with the experimental designs used to probe response properties of the zzso However, regions in the zzso right and left zzso were found to be consistently activated by zzso presented zzso zzso zzso when subjects attended to the zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso at 3 T can be used effectively to study zzso circuits in the human zzso
