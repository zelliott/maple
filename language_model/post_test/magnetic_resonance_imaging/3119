zzso zzso is a cause of diffuse enhancement of the zzso with zzso which often is associated with zzso fluid zzso We reviewed the results of zzso biopsy in six patients with zzso zzso and diffuse zzso enhancement to correlate the zzso findings with zzso observations and to explain the abnormalities seen on zzso zzso the zzso mater was unremarkable in all patients, as were the zzso except for one patient with prolonged (18 zzso zzso zzso in whom the zzso was thickened and zzso zzso the zzso mater was entirely normal on its zzso zzso however, a fairly thin zone of zzso and zzso small blood vessels in an zzso zzso was noted on the zzso zzso In the patient with longstanding symptoms, diffuse benign zzso cell proliferation was also noted, probably a reaction triggered by longstanding changes in the zzso area, as noted in the five other zzso There was no evidence of zzso infection, or zzso zzso These findings suggest that in zzso zzso the zzso abnormalities probably represent zzso secondary phenomena, likely related to zzso changes in the zzso and not a primary zzso zzso
