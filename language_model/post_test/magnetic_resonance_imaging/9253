To assess the impact of using zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso and dynamic zzso on the dose to the penile bulb zzso 

Eight patients diagnosed with prostate cancer entered a treatment protocol including CT and zzso zzso The prostate zzso was defined on both zzso and zzso Treatment plans zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso were elaborated on both zzso and CT zzso A dose of zzso zzso was zzso it was requested that zzso be covered by zzso zzso zzso The mean dose and zzso of zzso were zzso 

zzso plans reduced zzso mean dose and zzso compared to zzso zzso This improvement, zzso also from the treatment zzso was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso considering zzso Conventional plans resulted in a significantly higher mean zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The comparison between conventional and zzso techniques showed a still larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mean dose reduction with zzso compared to zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso This gain remained significant even when comparing zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso with respect to zzso zzso gain zzso zzso whereas it resulted to be zzso considering zzso zzso vs zzso possibly due to the zzso delivery of zzso however, in a patient where the distance zzso zzso zzso provided better zzso sparing than zzso zzso vs zzso 

zzso allowed efficient sparing of zzso irrespective of the treatment zzso zzso was shown to further reduce the dose to the bulb compared to zzso and zzso
