The regions of the zzso network that controls urinary zzso behavior are well known, but little is known about their zzso We tested the feasibility of using zzso interaction to explore the effective connections of the network and to seek zzso differences in zzso This was a secondary analysis of zzso data obtained from women aged zzso years, 11 with urge urinary zzso and 10 with normal zzso zzso In each subject, zzso zzso images were obtained during a period with full zzso and strong zzso sensation (without zzso zzso while repeatedly zzso and withdrawing a small amount of liquid in and out of the zzso zzso of interest included right zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso both consistently involved in zzso zzso Other regions effectively connected to them were identified by significant correlation between their zzso signal and the interaction zzso Among normal subjects, many regions involved in zzso control were effectively connected with zzso including zzso and zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sign of the correlation with zzso was zzso positive, perhaps suggesting mainly zzso zzso Among zzso subjects, the effective connectivity was shifted to a zzso complex, while the sign of the correlation was predominantly negative, perhaps consistent with zzso zzso of accessory pathways in an attempt to maintain zzso zzso Thus, zzso interaction yields potentially important information about the connectivity of the zzso control network and its changes in zzso
