zzso zzso dislocation is a rare zzso It is usually due to direct trauma in zzso direction or to indirect trauma related to violent zzso muscle zzso The clinical diagnosis of transient forms is usually rather difficult because the associated signs zzso and pain at the joint and/or at the zzso zzso zzso are not zzso Conventional zzso and CT are very accurate in bone studies, but exhibit major limitations in the detection of zzso injuries with zzso and/or zzso bone zzso We investigated MR diagnostic reliability in the study of the injuries caused by transient zzso zzso 526 MR examinations of the knee were reviewed zzso zzso of them were positive for transient zzso zzso We used a zzso T zzso MR unit with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso spin zzso zzso zzso echo and zzso STIR images were zzso The following criteria were considered specific for the diagnosis of former lateral zzso zzso zzso changes; zzso zzso signal intensity changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso joint zzso cartilage and zzso bone zzso All the patients with transient zzso dislocation had zzso with inner zzso zzso The zzso joint was incongruous in 115 zzso zzso zzso was external in zzso patients and lateral in the remaining 3 zzso zzso bruises were found in zzso cases and cartilage injuries in zzso Finally, other joint zzso such as the zzso horn of the zzso zzso or the anterior cruciate ligament were involved in zzso zzso zzso was performed in 6 patients with associated injuries and confirmed all MR findings zzso zzso To zzso in our experience zzso was a very reliable tool to study the injuries due to transient zzso dislocation because it showed specific changes and possible associated zzso which helps choose the most suitable zzso
