zzso aging is associated with a decline in pulmonary function and efficiency of gas exchange, although the effects on the spatial distribution of pulmonary zzso are poorly zzso We hypothesized that spatial pulmonary zzso zzso would increase with increasing zzso zzso healthy, zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging with zzso spin labeling zzso using a Vision zzso whole body scanner zzso Medical Systems, zzso zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso maps where signal intensity is zzso to regional pulmonary zzso The spatial zzso of pulmonary blood flow was zzso by the relative zzso zzso zzso zzso a global index of zzso of signal intensity for zzso within the right lung and by the zzso dimension zzso There were no significant sex differences for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso when age was considered as a zzso zzso increased significantly with increasing age by approximately zzso until age zzso zzso and there was a significant positive relationship between zzso and age (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and height (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not body mass index (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso Age and height combined in a multiple zzso were significantly related to zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant relationship between zzso and zzso or zzso oxygen zzso zzso was not related to age, zzso zzso or zzso oxygen zzso The lack of relationship between age and zzso argues against an intrinsic zzso in the pulmonary vascular branching with age as being responsible for the observed increase in global spatial zzso zzso measured by the zzso
