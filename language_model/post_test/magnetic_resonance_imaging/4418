zzso of zzso strains is essential for understanding cardiac zzso Previous techniques for assessing regional zzso strains have been mainly limited to invasive zzso A technique by which tagging can be added to magnetic resonance images zzso has recently been introduced and allows for zzso measurement of zzso zzso We have applied zzso tagging to two sets of zzso planes and have obtained three zzso zzso reconstructions of 24 zzso zzso at zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso finite strain analysis to these zzso we were able to study the zzso distribution of the zzso and zzso principal strains zzso in the normal canine zzso In addition we have calculated the zzso distribution of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso Our results show similarity in the zzso distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results imply that zzso strains are determined not only by zzso fiber zzso but mainly by geometrical zzso through zzso zzso
