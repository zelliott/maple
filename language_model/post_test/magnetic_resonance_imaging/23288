zzso statistical zzso is commonly used to identify significant experimental effects or group differences in both functional and structural studies of the living zzso Tests based on the size of zzso extended clusters of zzso zzso zzso are also widely used due to their typically increased statistical zzso In zzso zzso such tests are used to identify regions of the brain that are associated with genetic zzso However, concerns have been raised about the adequate control of rejection rates in studies of this zzso A previous study tested the effect of a set of zzso zzso on brain structure and function, and found that false positive rates were zzso However, no similar analysis of false positive rates in an imaging genetic study using cluster size zzso has yet been zzso We measured false positive rates in an investigation of the effect of 700 zzso zzso zzso on zzso matter volume using zzso zzso zzso As zzso data exhibit zzso zzso we used both zzso and stationary cluster size tests in our zzso Image and zzso data on 181 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso At a nominal significance level of zzso false positive rates were found to be zzso zzso using a relatively high zzso zzso zzso on images smoothed with a 12 zzso zzso zzso Tests were however zzso at lower zzso thresholds zzso zzso and for images smoothed using a zzso zzso zzso Here false positive rates ranged from zzso to zzso In a further analysis, false positive rates using simulated data were observed to be zzso across a wide range of zzso While motivated by imaging zzso our findings apply to any zzso study, and suggest that zzso cluster size zzso should only be used with high zzso thresholds and zzso We would advocate the use of zzso methods in other zzso
