zzso increases survival in breast cancer zzso zzso cerebral zzso have recently become a significant clinical problem, with an zzso of zzso among breast zzso zzso As this phenomenon cannot be studied zzso in humans, models which mimic brain zzso are needed to investigate its zzso Such models may later be used in experimental therapeutic zzso 

We report a model in which zzso of the animals zzso zzso nude zzso developed zzso abnormal masses in the brain zzso within a 20 to zzso time window post zzso injection of zzso human zzso The masses detected in zzso were either single (7 zzso or multiple (2 zzso zzso MR zzso studies and zzso zzso data were zzso revealing a total zzso of experimental brain zzso of zzso in the cases studied zzso zzso zzso maps perfectly differentiated zzso and/or zzso areas from zzso zzso MRS data also revealed additional features: decrease in zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso marker of zzso growth in the brain zzso zzso compounds zzso rose and zzso zzso levels decreased as these zzso evolved, with mobile lipids and zzso also becoming zzso Furthermore, MRS pattern zzso analysis suggested that this approach may help to discriminate different growth zzso 

This study zzso the way for further in zzso studies oriented towards detection of different tumor progression states and for improving treatment zzso
