zzso cardiac muscle cells named zzso are densely packed in an zzso collagen zzso and are aligned to zzso segments in a manner which zzso pumping via alternate contraction and zzso zzso the geometrical variation of their groupings as cardiac fibers is central to our understanding of normal heart zzso zzso by a recent abstraction by zzso et zzso of heart wall fibers into generalized zzso minimal surfaces, this paper develops an extension based on differential zzso The key idea is to use zzso method of moving frames to study the zzso of a frame field attached to the local fiber zzso This approach provides a new set of parameters that are complimentary to those of zzso et zzso and offers a framework for developing new models of the cardiac fiber zzso This framework is used to zzso the generalized zzso parameters directly, without the need to formulate an zzso zzso The framework admits a straightforward zzso zzso that provides statistical zzso consistent with those previously zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrate that one such zzso the zzso zzso fibers to lie locally within zzso shells and yields improved fits in the zzso the dog and the human to those obtained using generalized zzso
