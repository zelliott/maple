This study examined the neural zzso of the theory of mind network by zzso self-referential processing during an idea of reference zzso situation in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso was conducted on 14 schizophrenic zzso with the idea of reference and 15 healthy participants while viewing video vignettes of zzso conversations, zzso conversations or no conversations between two people, which were filmed at varying distances of 1, 5 or 10 zzso 

The patient group did not show normal patterns of superior zzso zzso zzso to conversational context, and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso to zzso conversational zzso Instead, the patient group showed overall greater zzso prefrontal activities across different conversational contexts and inverse correlation between superior zzso zzso activity and delusional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pole and its zzso extension to varying distances were observed in the control group but not in the patient zzso 

The present study demonstrates that theory of zzso responses of the zzso zzso zzso network are attenuated during the self-referential processing in patients with schizophrenia and that these abnormalities may be related to the formation of their zzso or zzso zzso
