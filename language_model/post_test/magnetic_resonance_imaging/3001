To demonstrate the high sensitivity of high definition zzso and particularly zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso in depicting zzso conflicts in the zzso angle zzso zzso imaging and high definition zzso weighed zzso zzso contrast enhanced imaging were used to investigate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with abnormal zzso (5 zzso The study was zzso with zzso MR in 25 zzso The results were compared with findings in a control group of 200 patients, and with the surgical observations in 57 operated zzso In zzso spasm, the zzso of the zzso conflict was determined, as well as the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso nerve 9; both 15 zzso and the vessel involved zzso 25 zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso 10 zzso VA and zzso 8 zzso VA and zzso 3 zzso lateral zzso vein 1 zzso In zzso (5 zzso the zzso was involved in every case in the zzso Among 57 operated cases, only one false negative was zzso In the zzso control group, a zzso conflict was observed in 3, zzso of the cases zzso 

zzso imaging is the single most efficient technique, but the combined used of the 3 types of imaging brings the highest diagnostic efficiency, for identifying a zzso conflict in the zzso zzso
