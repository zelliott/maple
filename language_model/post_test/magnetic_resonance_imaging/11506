Although it has been hypothesized that zzso zzso in depressed patients leads to zzso zzso in the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso to date have produced mixed zzso 

In our zzso study, zzso volumes were measured in 25 depressed patients (13 with zzso and 12 without zzso and 15 control zzso 

No significant differences in zzso volumes were found between any of the subject groups, although within subjects right zzso volumes were found to be significantly larger than left zzso zzso Additionally, right and total zzso + right) zzso volumes in control and depressed subjects were found to be positively correlated with trait anxiety as measured by the zzso anxiety zzso 

Because our subject group is younger than those in studies reporting zzso zzso we conclude that zzso studies will be necessary for investigation of the lifelong course of zzso zzso
