Respiratory ordered phase zzso is often employed in zzso studies to reduce image artifacts due to breathing zzso The purpose of this work was to evaluate error caused by the use of respiratory ordering of phase zzso in MR zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso when the flow rate is sensitive to zzso It was hypothesized that this effect is due to the systematic zzso of a zzso phase zzso function in zzso A theoretical model for the effects of zzso was developed and then tested in flow phantom studies and in normal volunteer zzso In phantom experiments, the use of respiratory ordering induced an error of as much as zzso in zzso zzso flow zzso In preliminary volunteer studies, error was as high as zzso in superior zzso zzso flow zzso versus less than zzso error in the ascending zzso It is concluded that a potential for error exists in zzso zzso flow zzso obtained with the use of respiratory ordering zzso Volunteer studies with larger numbers are zzso Clinical applications in which this effect may be important include flow zzso in vessels subject to variations in flow due to zzso such as the zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and portal zzso
