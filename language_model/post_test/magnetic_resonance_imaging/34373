We evaluated the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso operating at zzso zzso with a zzso pelvic surface zzso to predict the pathological stage of prostate zzso zzso diagnosis was based on fast zzso zzso zzso images with and without frequency selective zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirty-one consecutive patients zzso age 61 years, range 49 to 71 zzso underwent pelvic zzso before radical zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the surgical specimens showed that the zzso were correctly localized in all but one prostate zzso in which the zzso could not be seen on pelvic zzso The zzso diameter of the visible zzso at pelvic zzso appeared to represent an approximate estimate of the true zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso of the surgical zzso 22 of 31 patients zzso had zzso extending beyond the confines of the zzso zzso The specificity for zzso to predict zzso penetration and seminal zzso invasion was relatively high zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity was acceptable for zzso penetration zzso but poor for seminal zzso invasion zzso
