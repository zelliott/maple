To investigate the zzso of zzso fields at higher field strengths that can interfere with established zzso methods, in particular for the determination of visceral zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso A zzso interactive sparse sampling zzso method is proposed to determine zzso zzso and also total body volume zzso 

zzso is based on a separation of major components by zzso lines, followed by a sparse sampling algorithm, and eventually a quick manual zzso zzso whole body scans of 24 subjects were evaluated (12 at zzso 12 at zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso class correlation zzso zzso determined within 3 zzso (24 subjects) showed high consistency for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison with an established zzso method revealed good agreement zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso comparison of weights calculated from zzso with values measured on a scale resulted in an even better accuracy for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso than for the reference method zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso in particular within the same zzso accurate as compared with established methods, and robust against low contrast and zzso zzso
