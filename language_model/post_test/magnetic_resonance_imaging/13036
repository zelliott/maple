There are few data concerning possible long-term effects of physical activity on cartilage change in the zzso zzso We examined the effect of participation in vigorous physical activity on changes to zzso cartilage over 2 zzso 

A total of 297 healthy adults ages zzso years with no history of knee injury or symptoms were recruited from an existing zzso Physical activity data were obtained by questionnaire at baseline zzso zzso cartilage volume and defects were determined by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline zzso and followup zzso 

Participation in vigorous physical activity at baseline was associated with a reduced rate of zzso cartilage volume loss zzso zzso per zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a trend toward less risk of worsening zzso cartilage defects zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over the subsequent 2 zzso In the zzso with no significant zzso cartilage defects at baseline zzso zzso zzso participation in vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced annual rate of zzso cartilage volume loss zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a trend for fewer new zzso cartilage defects zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No significant relationships were found between vigorous physical activity and cartilage volume change or zzso progression in the zzso with prevalent zzso cartilage defects at zzso 

These observations suggest that vigorous physical activity is beneficial to zzso zzso for people without zzso cartilage zzso zzso vigorous physical activity might, therefore, be useful in the prevention of zzso zzso
