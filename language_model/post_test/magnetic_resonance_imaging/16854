zzso anomalies of the brain frequently zzso to zzso base anomalies, and a detailed description of zzso and individual variations in the developing zzso base is of clinical importance for diagnosing zzso Development of the human zzso base has been studied using zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging, each of which has advantages and zzso We here examined development of the normal human fetal zzso base using bone zzso which allows for direct observation of the zzso centers and precise three-dimensional zzso We observed zzso red zzso zzso and zzso of 22 normal zzso human fetuses with zzso lengths zzso of zzso zzso We defined landmarks and measured zzso and zzso using a fine zzso Growth patterns of these zzso bones were zzso and we found similarities and differences among the growth zzso We also observed individual variations in the zzso patterns, in particular, zzso or zzso center patterns for the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso and ratios of the zzso to the total zzso base zzso were significantly different between the two pattern groups, whereas the other zzso and their ratios to the total zzso base did not differ between the zzso We measured the zzso and zzso in different sets of 22 human fetuses with zzso of zzso zzso and found close relationships with the development of corresponding parts of the zzso zzso The results contribute to the quantitative and qualitative information about the growth patterns and variations during human fetal zzso base zzso
