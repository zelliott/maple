Few studies have examined the relationship between local zzso thickness of the zzso and the zzso signals arising from zzso Using structural and functional zzso we examined whether a relationship exists between cortical thickness and brain zzso zzso participants were asked to perform the zzso response zzso task known to activate the anterior zzso and the prefrontal zzso zzso data of the same regions were simultaneously zzso We hypothesized that cortical thickness in these brain regions would positively correlate with brain zzso Data from the structural zzso were aligned with those of functional zzso zzso There was a positive linear correlation between cortical thickness and zzso during response zzso in the right anterior zzso zzso zzso Area zzso No significant zzso correlations were found in the prefrontal zzso zzso between cortical thickness and zzso may occur only in certain brain zzso
