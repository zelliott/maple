The purpose of this study was to assess MR imaging findings of zzso zzso with emphasis on zzso zzso zzso 

MR images with a zzso unit obtained in 17 consecutive patients (age range, zzso years; mean age, 58 zzso with 17 zzso proven zzso zzso were zzso reviewed for the size, zzso signal intensity of solid zzso and presence of zzso zzso and zzso within zzso zzso number, and location of zzso zzso were also zzso 

The maximum diameter of tumors ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso tumors were zzso On zzso images, solid components of tumors were zzso mixed zzso and zzso in 16 zzso zzso Nine zzso tumors demonstrated zzso and 16 zzso demonstrated zzso within zzso The maximum diameter of the largest zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso per tumor ranged from 1 to 60 zzso zzso Of the nine tumors with zzso formation, the zzso location of the zzso was peripheral in five zzso zzso in two zzso central zzso in one, and diffuse in one zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso formation may be characteristic MR imaging features with zzso zzso
