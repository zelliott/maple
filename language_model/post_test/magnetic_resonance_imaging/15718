zzso and zzso variations in oxygen partial pressure zzso during zzso can be exploited to obtain important regional parameters of lung zzso In the course of zzso the oxygen concentration is known to zzso zzso zzso the initial zzso zzso can be used to represent local zzso and the oxygen depletion time constant can characterize zzso The zzso based on a zzso model of zzso zzso was validated in six healthy zzso zzso maps of zzso and oxygen depletion time constant were obtained for pure zzso and zzso zzso The mean measured values of zzso were 77 zzso 9 zzso for the pure zzso zzso and 107 zzso 5 zzso for zzso mixture, in agreement with the zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso 15 zzso and 123 zzso 15 zzso zzso The mean measured oxygen depletion time zzso were zzso zzso zzso s for pure zzso and zzso zzso zzso s for the zzso mixture, in agreement with zzso
