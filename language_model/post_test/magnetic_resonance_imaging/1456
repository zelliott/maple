To determine the clinical significance and specificity of suspected zzso zzso in zzso zzso we reviewed the clinical presentations, CT results, and findings at surgery in 12 patients who had zzso signal within zzso and zzso masses on short zzso zzso MR pulse zzso Eight of the cases were confirmed at zzso In seven of the operated cases, zzso was found within zzso zzso and in the eight case there was zzso but no identifiable zzso zzso Nine of the 12 patients had CT zzso three had focal areas of increased zzso four had focal areas of decreased zzso and two had uniform zzso All nine of these CT abnormalities correlated with areas of zzso on zzso Three patients had clinical zzso in two there was increased zzso on CT and in one it was zzso We found that zzso zzso may be seen without clinical evidence of zzso zzso and that the areas of zzso can appear as low zzso on zzso CT may be better for visualizing zzso zzso within the first few days, but MR is more sensitive in detecting and following the zzso in the zzso zzso
