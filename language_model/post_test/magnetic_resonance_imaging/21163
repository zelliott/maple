This study evaluated the feasibility of magnetic resonance zzso zzso using a zzso data set zzso and compared it with conventional zzso zzso zzso in patients affected by zzso cancer treated with zzso therapy zzso 

Fourteen patients with a biopsy diagnosis of zzso cancer underwent MR examination before and after zzso zzso images were used to extrapolate zzso A zzso zzso sequence was acquired zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso with a zzso of 800 zzso and volume zzso was calculated by semiautomatic zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso independently assessed volumes and zzso data in order to establish zzso agreement and compare and correlate volumes to zzso zzso grade zzso as zzso at pathological examination of the surgical zzso 

zzso agreement was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso between zzso and zzso before and after zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso and zzso was, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso seems to be a promising tool for assessing response to zzso in zzso zzso Further studies on large series of patients are needed to refine the technique and evaluate its potential zzso zzso
