zzso regions within the zzso visual zzso show neural specialization for zzso and living stimuli zzso tools, houses versus animals, zzso The causes of these category preferences are widely zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that the same regions of the zzso stream that show category preferences for zzso stimuli and animals in sighted adults show the same category preferences in adults who are blind since zzso Both blind and sighted participants had larger blood zzso dependent zzso responses in the zzso zzso zzso for zzso stimuli compared to animal stimuli and differential zzso responses in lateral zzso zzso for animal stimuli compared to zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso bias by conceptual domain in the zzso visual zzso does not require visual experience in order to develop and suggest the operation of innately determined zzso constraints on the organization of object zzso
