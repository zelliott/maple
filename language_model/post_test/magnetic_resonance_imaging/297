The zzso inclination of the zzso zzso which is referred to as zzso zzso zzso is determined routinely on lateral zzso However, zzso it is not always possible to reliably recognize the lateral zzso making a separate assessment of the zzso and lateral zzso zzso We propose a technique to measure the zzso separately by defining a zzso zzso axis on a conventional zzso The zzso plateau zzso zzso slope obtained from zzso was compared with MR images in 100 consecutive patients with knee pain when ligament or zzso injury was zzso The zzso zzso slope on zzso correlated with those on zzso The mean zzso zzso slope was zzso degrees smaller on zzso compared with zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees versus zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees , zzso The zzso was slightly better on zzso than zzso zzso zzso degrees versus zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso of the 100 cases had more than a 5 degrees difference zzso zzso degrees to zzso degrees ) between the zzso and lateral zzso The proposed technique allows measurement of the zzso zzso slope of the zzso and lateral zzso on a standard knee zzso By using this novel measurement technique, a reliable assessment of the zzso and lateral zzso zzso is zzso
