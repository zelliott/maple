The zzso operation causes an acute decrease of volume overload of the zzso heart followed by changes in zzso zzso The zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso may alter zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso whether the increase in zzso and changes of the zzso geometry have an effect on the decrease of the exercise capacity in patients with zzso zzso 

We examined the zzso function of 24 patients with functional single zzso and zzso operation zzso zzso zzso years after surgery zzso zzso 14, w zzso 10, age: zzso zzso zzso zzso using a bicycle zzso exercise zzso The parameters of exercise capacity and zzso function were correlated with zzso zzso Imaging zzso parameters such as the zzso zzso zzso muscle mass zzso und zzso volume zzso 

The exercise capacity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso There was a positive correlation of exercise capacity and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but none with the zzso 

zzso zzso may influence the zzso performance of the zzso heart and thereby the physical performance in children and adults with zzso zzso
