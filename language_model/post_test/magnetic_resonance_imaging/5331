The aim of the study is to assess the zzso power of zzso zzso parameters during treatment of breast cancer, for zzso zzso and overall survival zzso 

zzso women (age range, zzso years; mean, zzso zzso with breast cancer underwent dynamic contrast enhancement zzso at zzso imaging, using zzso zzso zzso Time intensity zzso zzso were obtained from the regions showing zzso enhancement in zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso relative enhancement within the first minute, E zzso zzso relative enhancement of the entire study, zzso zzso slope of the contrast enhancement zzso and time to peak zzso derived from the zzso zzso These parameters were then compared with presence of recurrence or zzso zzso and zzso by using Cox zzso zzso hazards zzso analysis, linear zzso zzso 

The results from of the 49 patients enrolled into the survival analysis demonstrated that traditional zzso parameters zzso size and zzso zzso and zzso parameters zzso and zzso slope) demonstrated significant differences in survival intervals zzso Further Cox zzso zzso hazards zzso survival analysis revealed that zzso parameters contributed the greatest prediction of both zzso zzso in the resulting models (for zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso for zzso zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso 

This study shows that zzso has utility predicting survival analysis with breast cancer zzso
