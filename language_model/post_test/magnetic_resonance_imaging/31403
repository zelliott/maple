zzso sleep zzso zzso syndrome is a disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction that occur during zzso Associated features include loud zzso fragmented sleep, repetitive zzso daytime zzso and cardiovascular zzso The prevalence of zzso is zzso and zzso in middle-aged women and men, zzso The prevalence of zzso among obese patients exceeds zzso reaching as high as zzso in the zzso obese zzso zzso is probably the most important risk factor for the development of zzso Some zzso of adults with zzso are overweight, and the relative risk of zzso in obesity zzso zzso zzso is zzso Numerous studies have shown the development or worsening of zzso with increasing weight, as opposed to substantial improvement with weight zzso There are several mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of zzso with zzso These include reduced zzso zzso size due to fatty tissue within the airway or in its lateral walls, decreased upper airway muscle protective force due to fatty deposits in the muscle, and reduced upper airway size secondary to mass effect of the large abdomen on the chest wall and zzso zzso These mechanisms emphasize the great importance of fat accumulated in the abdomen and neck regions compared with the peripheral zzso It is the abdomen much more than the zzso that affect the upper airway size and zzso zzso obesity is associated with increased upper airway zzso (even in zzso zzso with dramatic improvement after weight zzso zzso zzso may itself zzso individuals to worsening obesity because of sleep zzso daytime zzso and disrupted zzso zzso is associated with increased sympathetic zzso sleep zzso ineffective sleep, and insulin resistance, potentially leading to diabetes and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso may be associated with changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased appetite and caloric zzso and again zzso zzso Thus, it appears that obesity and zzso form a vicious cycle where each results in worsening of the zzso
