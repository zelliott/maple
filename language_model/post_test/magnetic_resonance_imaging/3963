zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify cortical regions activated by a working memory task involving letter zzso Twenty four normal subjects were scanned with a conventional zzso magnet while performing one of two tasks: In the zzso task, subjects responded by pressing a button whenever any presented letter was the same as the second last in the zzso In the control condition, subjects had to respond to a single zzso letter without memory update zzso The zzso task and the control condition were identical with regard to zzso input and motor zzso They were different only regarding the task zzso Movement artifacts were minimized in a two way strategy and eight subjects were excluded from further zzso zzso MR data from the remaining 16 subjects were analyzed on the basis of anatomical zzso which were manually defined in each zzso The engagement of working memory produced significant zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso areas 9, 10, 46, and zzso in both zzso zzso demonstrate the zzso of the paradigm within a clinical zzso setup and corroborate previous findings of zzso zzso prefrontal zzso during continuous context updating and active zzso
