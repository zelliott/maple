The zzso zzso lobe zzso and surrounding zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso long been known to be critical for long-term memory for zzso Recent functional zzso and zzso data in humans performing zzso tasks suggest that the zzso also contributes to performance even when retention intervals are brief, and zzso data in zzso reveal zzso zzso delay activity in the zzso during zzso zzso The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the relationship between zzso in human zzso zzso and performance during a zzso task with repeated zzso zzso On critical trials, the presentation of two faces was followed by a 30 s delay period, after which participants performed zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant delay period activity in anterior zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso over the 30 s retention zzso with the magnitude of activity being significantly higher on subsequently correct compared with subsequently incorrect zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso activity zzso increased across the 30 s zzso suggesting an anticipatory response, and activity in zzso zzso and zzso was greater during the probe period on correct compared with incorrect zzso These results indicate that at least two patterns of zzso delay period zzso and zzso present during performance of zzso recognition memory tasks, providing novel evidence that multiple processes govern task zzso zzso for understanding the role of the zzso and surrounding zzso cortical areas in recognition memory after short delays are zzso
