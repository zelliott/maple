Since the only three cases of zzso zzso among patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso seen at our institution during the last 12 years were each associated with the zzso zzso zzso we sought to determine if this association is specific and more frequent than previously zzso 

We report three patients with zzso and zzso who developed zzso zzso and review the world zzso 

Between 1980 and 1992, 53 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified at our zzso Eight zzso patients had zzso Three of these eight patients zzso developed zzso zzso All three of our patients received conventional intensive zzso chemotherapy yet had short zzso survival zzso Several series of patients with zzso report that zzso zzso occur in approximately zzso of this population, which is four times the expected zzso in zzso zzso cases have been previously zzso Although zzso analyses were not reported in many cases of zzso zzso in the literature, the vast majority of abnormal zzso in patients with zzso involved zzso Recent work with a cell line derived from a patient with zzso indicates that such cells are unusually adherent to culture bottles and are zzso 

Our data suggest that this association is more common than generally recognized and may be zzso Patients with zzso should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of zzso zzso These patients may have a less favorable prognosis than other patients with zzso Cooperative zzso groups should zzso identify patients with zzso and zzso who had a poor outcome to determine if they had a disproportionate zzso of zzso zzso If so, aggressive therapy such as bone zzso transplantation may be warranted early in the therapeutic zzso
