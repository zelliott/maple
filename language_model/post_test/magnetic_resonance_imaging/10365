The aim of the study was differential evaluation of new and classical zzso features of benign zzso zzso and zzso cancer with three-dimensional zzso zzso and evaluation of the effectiveness of the zzso surface rendered images in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso evaluated with zzso smooth surface zzso shape in the zzso zzso to the zzso and evaluation of zzso margins and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the level of agreement in readers' interpretation and between zzso techniques was performed using the zzso zzso Surface rendering permitted zzso of the shape of the zzso in the zzso in all cases, in contrast to only up to zzso of cases in zzso zzso zzso zzso shape in the zzso was zzso sensitive and zzso specific in diagnosis of zzso Surface rendered images showed more zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso The level of agreement between the observers in the evaluation of features of zzso zzso and the agreement between features of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso images showed at least moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso surface rendering zzso appears to be a feasible and effective method for zzso zzso zzso
