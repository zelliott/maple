To present recent evidence on organ and tissue zzso rates in humans to explain the zzso in resting energy expenditure zzso 

In humans, present knowledge on specific zzso activities zzso zzso refers to seven zzso and zzso - brain, heart, liver, zzso skeletal muscle, zzso tissue and residual mass - with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso and zzso provided by zzso in zzso zzso body composition data, as derived from whole body zzso together with zzso of whole body zzso were used to validate zzso in zzso healthy and middle-aged zzso There is no sex difference, but minor, that is 2 and zzso zzso are found for age above 55 years and zzso zzso By contrast, in zzso differences of about zzso or zzso of measured zzso were zzso There is first evidence for changes in zzso with either weight loss or weight regain after weight zzso zzso these data suggest that in adolescence and at age above 55 years, in the obese and with weight change, organ and tissue masses differ in zzso and/or their specific zzso zzso zzso direct assessment of specific organ and tissue zzso rates in humans by either zzso zzso or zzso together with detailed body composition analysis, has not been performed zzso 

We need to become more skilled in methods and models used for detailed body composition analysis together with detailed assessment of energy expenditure in zzso
