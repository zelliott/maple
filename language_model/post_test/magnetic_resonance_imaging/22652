To evaluate the zzso characteristics of zzso and cerebral current sources during voluntary zzso 

zzso zzso zzso recordings were acquired during voluntary blinking in eight healthy adults and zzso using synthetic zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso sensors showed a large slow wave lasting approximately 400 zzso and a small burst of activity with zzso above 30 zzso at the initiation of the zzso Group maps of zzso zzso activity at zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed increased activity in and around the orbits during the 400 zzso following zzso zzso Increased zzso activity occurred in zzso regions 200 zzso after zzso onset at zzso between 18 and 64 zzso 

zzso zzso signals are recorded in the regions of the eyes and in the zzso zzso The anterior zzso is likely a combination of muscle contraction and zzso zzso zzso zzso likely represents neural processes concerned with zzso the visual image after transient zzso zzso 

The possibility of zzso fields should be considered when interpreting frontal and zzso source activities during SAM zzso
