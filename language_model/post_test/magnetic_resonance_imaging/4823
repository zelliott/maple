To examine the effects of zzso zzso on major brain fiber tracts in zzso 

zzso study performed in zzso 

Institutional zzso 

Fifteen younger zzso years old) carriers, 11 older zzso years old) unaffected carriers, and 15 older carriers with fragile zzso zzso syndrome, together with 19 younger and 15 older controls matched by age and educational zzso 

zzso zzso imaging was performed on all study zzso Eleven fiber tracts important for zzso social, zzso and cognitive functions were reconstructed and zzso zzso zzso spatial statistical analyses were performed in core white zzso 

In the younger carriers, zzso status was associated with a greater age-related connectivity decline in the extreme zzso Among older carriers, unaffected individuals did not display structural zzso whereas the affected carriers showed connectivity loss in 5 fiber tracts and exhibited greater age-related connectivity decline in all 11 tracts compared with the zzso In addition, 9 fiber tracts showed significantly higher zzso relative to the controls, and symptom severity explained the zzso in 6 zzso from the superior zzso zzso corpus zzso and zzso 

The findings revealed widespread zzso in structural connectivity associated with fragile zzso zzso syndrome and preserved or subtle changes in structural connectivity in unaffected zzso zzso zzso imaging is sensitive to zzso changes in the white matter associated with this neurodegenerative zzso Wang et al examine the effects of zzso zzso on major brain fiber tracts in zzso who are at risk of developing fragile zzso zzso syndrome and may manifest subtle zzso social, and emotional disturbances before clinical zzso
