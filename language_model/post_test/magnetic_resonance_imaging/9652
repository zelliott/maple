Recently, we developed zzso zzso as an in zzso cell proliferation zzso The present study was performed to determine the safety, distribution, radiation zzso and initial brain tumor imaging of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso and radiation zzso of zzso were assessed in 3 healthy humans, who underwent zzso zzso PET zzso zzso zzso was estimated from the residence times of source zzso using the zzso zzso Six brain tumor patients underwent dynamic zzso scans with zzso blood zzso These patients were also evaluated with zzso PET on the same day zzso zzso 4) as, or 3 zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso PET zzso zzso in plasma and urine samples were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso zzso of the zzso barrier in tumor tissue was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso 

There were no serious adverse events in any subjects at any time during the study zzso zzso PET demonstrated selective zzso in the bone zzso which has a high rate of zzso In addition, high-level zzso was also seen in the zzso The highest absorbed organ dose was in the urinary zzso wall zzso zzso The estimated effective dose for zzso was zzso zzso zzso showed little zzso in normal brain zzso resulting in low background activity for imaging of brain zzso In contrast, zzso PET demonstrated rapid zzso in aggressive tumor masses, whereas no signal of zzso was seen in clinically stable disease in which zzso zzso was zzso The distribution pattern of zzso in tumor regions was not always identical to that of zzso Analysis of plasma samples by zzso liquid zzso indicated that more than zzso of the zzso was present as unchanged zzso at 20 zzso 

The initial findings of the present study in a small group of patients indicated that zzso PET is feasible for imaging of brain zzso zzso and zzso safety were acceptable at the dose required for adequate PET zzso
