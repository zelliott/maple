Previous evidence suggests that zzso zzso can not only cause shifts in attention, but also can change the perception of objects located in the direction of gaze and how these objects will be manipulated by an zzso These findings zzso differences in the neural networks zzso action control driven by social cues as compared with zzso zzso Here, we sought to explore this hypothesis by using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a zzso zzso paradigm in which participants were asked to generate zzso zzso or zzso motor responses to both social and zzso zzso Data analysis revealed recruitment of a zzso zzso network and the locus zzso for the generation of zzso motor responses, areas previously implicated in controlling zzso As a correlate for the effect of zzso zzso on action control, an interaction effect was observed for zzso responses to social stimuli in zzso structures, anterior zzso and inferior frontal zzso Our results, therefore, suggest that performing actions in zzso zzso context significantly changes the neural zzso of action control and recruits brain regions previously implicated in action monitoring, the zzso of attention and social zzso
