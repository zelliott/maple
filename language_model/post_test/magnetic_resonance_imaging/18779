To use magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate the knees of older zzso years zzso competitive zzso zzso to determine the prevalence of abnormal zzso 

The knees of 29 zzso zzso (20 men, 9 zzso age range, zzso years old) were studied by zzso The findings were analyzed collectively and zzso into group I (N zzso zzso subjects without prior knee injuries and symptoms, and group II (N zzso zzso subjects with prior knee injuries and/or current zzso 

Ten percent of the knees had zzso zzso but the prevalence was not statistically different comparing group I to group zzso Fifty-five percent had abnormal zzso The overall prevalence of abnormal zzso was significantly higher in group II zzso than in group I zzso P zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were found in zzso of the zzso with a higher prevalence in group II zzso than in group I zzso P zzso zzso zzso percent zzso of the knees had bone zzso with a higher prevalence in group II zzso than in group I zzso P zzso zzso 

In general, the spectrum of abnormal zzso findings of the knee was no greater than age-related changes previously reported for other athletic populations and zzso These results have important implications for the diagnostic use of zzso of the knee in this zzso athletic zzso
