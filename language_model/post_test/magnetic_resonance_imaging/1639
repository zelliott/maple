zzso syndrome zzso is zzso by male zzso slowly progressing zzso and frequent development of zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso plays an important role in the development of the zzso system and the zzso A zzso zzso in zzso 9 of the zzso gene was recently described in patients with zzso We zzso the zzso gene of a Japanese patient with male zzso steroid zzso and zzso by the zzso chain reaction and direct sequencing and detected a zzso point zzso in zzso zzso 

analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene in a patient with zzso syndrome by the zzso chain reaction and direct sequencing detected a + zzso zzso transition at a position of the second alternative zzso region of zzso 9, important for predicting the risk of the occurrence of zzso zzso
