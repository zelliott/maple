A primary goal of investigations into the organization of human cerebral zzso is to determine the functional specificity of zzso zzso This includes the correlation of zzso deficits with zzso data for clinical diagnosis and treatment, and the identification of active brain regions using functional neural imaging techniques, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso source zzso zzso and direct cortical zzso Currently, the zzso zzso of a cortical region identified by these methods is zzso from the comparison of its cerebral zzso position to zzso brain zzso However, substantial zzso zzso in the position of zzso regions with respect to cerebral zzso landmarks may lead to errors in this zzso An alternative method is presented here, which uses magnetic resonance zzso imaging to identify zzso regions of zzso directly by zzso the relative concentration of zzso within cortical zzso This high-resolution MR protocol is used to identify zzso zzso zzso area 17) and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of MR signal intensity with zzso data from a zzso brain confirms this zzso As MR imaging technology zzso this zzso method has the potential to identify and discriminate among at least 50 cortical regions in the living human zzso
