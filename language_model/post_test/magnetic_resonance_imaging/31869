In trauma practice, zzso skull fracture is an extremely common finding while zzso zzso zzso zzso is generally considered quite a rare zzso During evaluation of cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso we identified five patients in just three months with unexpected zzso zzso zzso obstruction zzso to a zzso skull zzso This number represented a surprisingly high percentage of our zzso trauma consults for the study period zzso Three of the five patients were found to have zzso zzso two with right zzso zzso zzso experienced significant neurological deficits and prolonged hospital courses even with zzso zzso one patient with a left zzso zzso zzso had a good outcome with zzso zzso The other two of the five patients had zzso zzso likely from focal zzso bleeding and zzso zzso one patient with partial obstruction in the right zzso zzso due to zzso zzso experienced a difficult zzso one patient with a right zzso zzso obstruction presented and remained zzso and experienced a benign hospital zzso Two of the five patients had a zzso zzso zzso area zzso to the affected zzso suggesting that this finding may have represented zzso zzso zzso rather than traumatic zzso We propose that a zzso skull fracture in the region of zzso or zzso bone should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of zzso zzso zzso obstruction and may be an zzso and zzso cause of increased zzso zzso Failure to detect this complication may explain, in part, unexpected clinical zzso
