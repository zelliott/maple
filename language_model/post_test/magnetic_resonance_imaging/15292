The zzso Research zzso of Canada zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso spinal inflammation index has been developed to zzso measure inflammation in zzso zzso zzso and to assess change in response to therapeutic zzso zzso of the entire spine limits feasibility and a scoring method that records inflammation in only the more severely affected spinal segments may improve feasibility without sacrificing zzso 

zzso films of 68 patients with AS were assessed in random order by 2 blinded zzso zzso reliability was assessed by zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso films of 29 patients zzso to zzso or zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso therapy were read by readers blinded to chronology, and responsiveness was assessed by effect size and standardized response zzso The performance of scores based on 6, 8, 10, and all 23 spinal zzso units zzso was zzso 

The median number of affected spinal levels per patient was zzso and zzso of all affected levels were included when analysis was limited to only the 6 most severely affected levels per zzso zzso of zzso scores that were limited to only the more severely affected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with scores for all 23 spinal zzso showed excellent zzso reliability for status and change scores zzso correlation zzso as well as similar construct zzso zzso to zzso therapy was greater when the more limited scoring methods were used and was greatest with the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso spinal inflammation index performs better when analysis is limited to a maximum of 6 most severely affected levels compared with assessment of the entire zzso This should improve its feasibility in clinical trials and zzso
