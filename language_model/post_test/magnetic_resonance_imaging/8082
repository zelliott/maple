This study explored the neural basis of the processing of anomalous information (the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Twenty healthy undergraduate students were scanned while they performed a zzso zzso Relative to matched numbers, zzso numbers zzso significantly greater zzso at left inferior and superior zzso cortex, left inferior frontal zzso and left zzso and zzso zzso Combining these results and those of previous studies on semantic anomaly, we proposed that the zzso region is the source of the zzso zzso component and the left inferior frontal zzso is involved in zzso processing of anomalous zzso
