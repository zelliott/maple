zzso of locations and low-level features increases activity in zzso visual areas even in the absence of a zzso but it is unclear whether or how expectation of zzso stimulus properties affects visual zzso Here, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to test whether category expectation affects baseline and zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso visual zzso Word cues indicating an image category zzso or zzso were followed by a zzso then a briefly presented image of a face or a zzso On most trials, the cue correctly predicted the upcoming zzso zzso activity in regions within the zzso face area zzso and zzso place area zzso was modulated such that activity was higher during expectation of the preferred zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses reflected an initial bias zzso overall zzso followed by increased selectivity zzso difference between activity to a preferred zzso zzso zzso after expectation of the preferred zzso zzso zzso zzso with the putative role of a zzso network in zzso zzso of activity in sensory cortex, zzso activity in several frontal and zzso areas correlated with the magnitude of baseline shifts in the zzso and zzso across zzso Furthermore, zzso activity in lateral prefrontal zzso also correlated with the magnitude of zzso increases in stimulus selectivity in IT zzso These findings demonstrate that category expectation influences both baseline and zzso activity in zzso zzso visual areas, and that these zzso may be driven by a zzso zzso control zzso
