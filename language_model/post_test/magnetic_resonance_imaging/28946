To evaluate a new magnetic resonance imaging protocol for dynamic study of the zzso zzso system and to use this protocol to search for problems in patients with an assumed permeable zzso system who develop zzso 

A prospective study of nine patients, including 2 zzso controls was zzso The magnetic resonance protocol included, zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso thick images passing through the zzso zzso dynamic acquisition after zzso zzso for timing dye progression through the zzso zzso 

Similar results were obtained for the two control subjects with zzso transit time of a median 100 zzso Three distinct events were individualized zzso arrival in the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso duct zzso and the zzso of the zzso portion of the duct zzso Patients with an assumed permeable zzso system who had zzso show results zzso between passed dye and total zzso of the dye within the zzso zzso 

The study of the zzso zzso system using this new magnetic resonance imaging protocol contributes to the zzso study of tear zzso and could be useful for quantitative assessment of zzso zzso particularly interesting for therapeutic zzso
