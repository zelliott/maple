Seven human fetuses of zzso length corresponding to zzso ages ranging from the 12th to the 16th week were studied using a paradigm based on three-dimensional reconstruction of the brain obtained by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate brain zzso in zzso and to describe zzso dynamics during an important period of fetal zzso zzso zzso showed the increasing degree of maturation of the zzso zzso distance, zzso distance and zzso angle were examined in all the zzso The data were interpreted by correlation with the internal structure as zzso using zzso zzso acquired using a zzso field intensity magnet with a zzso power of 20 G zzso The spatial resolution was sufficient for a detailed detection of five zzso and the contrast was zzso using sequences with different degrees of zzso and zzso zzso Using the latter, it was possible to zzso the zzso and marginal zzso The cortical thickness was mapped on to the zzso surface, describing the thickness zzso from the insular zzso to the periphery of the zzso The study demonstrates the utility of zzso for studying brain zzso The method provides a quantitative profiling of the brain, which allows the calculation of important zzso zzso and it provides zzso regarding transient features of the developing zzso
