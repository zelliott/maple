To determine the effects of intravenous zzso and intramuscular zzso zzso zzso on the volume of zzso zzso zzso and normal appearing brain tissue zzso undergoing zzso zzso increases in zzso transfer ratio zzso suggestive of zzso in patients with zzso multiple zzso 

This zzso zzso zzso study enrolled patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso secondary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso as well as a group of zzso healthy controls zzso Patients with multiple sclerosis were assigned to receive zzso zzso zzso zzso or intramuscular zzso zzso as either zzso zzso or combined with zzso zzso zzso as needed zzso The primary zzso was the two-year change in volume of zzso zzso by zzso the number of zzso that increased zzso zzso or decreased zzso zzso in their zzso zzso 

The volume of tissue undergoing increases in zzso was significantly larger in zzso compared with zzso patients zzso 1: zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso year zzso zzso in zzso and compared with healthy control subjects zzso 1: zzso and year zzso zzso in zzso The larger volume within zzso undergoing decreases in zzso was detected in multiple sclerosis patients compared with healthy controls zzso and in the zzso group compared with the zzso group zzso 1: zzso year zzso zzso One patient on zzso died from progressive zzso zzso eight months after completing the zzso 

zzso may promote zzso and stabilize zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso multiple zzso compared with intramuscular zzso
