The purpose of our study was to determine the types of imaging procedures performed by diagnostic zzso practices and the patterns and differences related to practice zzso 

The American College of zzso zzso surveyed 970 practices by mail, using a zzso zzso in zzso A response rate of zzso was zzso zzso was used to make responses representative of all zzso practices in the United zzso Trends were explored by making comparisons with data from a zzso zzso zzso 

Among the types of procedures zzso the highest percentage of zzso zzso practices performed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso conventional zzso and zzso were not zzso The lowest percentage of these practices performed zzso procedures zzso and zzso zzso Solo practices showed less diversity in types of procedures performed than did zzso practices and were a good deal less likely to perform each type of procedure except zzso and zzso Generally, higher percentages of practices in zzso cities or towns and rural practices performed various types of procedures than practices in metropolitan zzso zzso size, types of settings served zzso or zzso and practice type also influenced the number of types of procedures performed by a zzso The fraction of practices performing CT decreased from zzso to zzso between zzso and zzso zzso for other types of procedures were generally stable over zzso 

Certain practice characteristics play a role in determining the types of imaging procedures a diagnostic zzso practice zzso The decline in the percentage of practices providing CT and the failure during the 1990s of percentages for zzso and zzso zzso to increase from a relatively low base is zzso Future analyses based on a subsequent zzso survey will provide further insights into zzso
