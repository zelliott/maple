To develop and validate a digital dissection zzso measuring the zzso area of blood vessels in zzso sections of tumors routinely stained with zzso and zzso 

The procedure was first validated in four experimental tumors in rats by comparing the results of the digital dissection technique to functional estimates of the blood volume in the tumors as measured by zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso The method was then tested on a variety of experimental and human zzso 

The digital dissection technique yielded results that exactly matched the functional zzso of blood volume zzso experimental zzso Digital dissection of 40 additional tumors in rats showed that 21 zzso zzso zzso had significantly greater zzso density zzso than 19 benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In 10 human breast zzso the zzso was consistently greater than the measurement of blood vessel density as identified by zzso zzso for factor zzso The zzso zzso of variation for the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 5) for a human breast cancer and zzso zzso zzso zzso an experimental rat zzso 

The digital dissection technique is a zzso objective and accurate method of measuring zzso in sections of tumors that are routinely stained with zzso and zzso
