zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso using blood zzso contrast has rapidly spread into many application zzso In this paper, a new statistical model is used to evaluate the reliability of zzso zzso in a finger opposition motor paradigm for both zzso and zzso data and in a working memory paradigm for zzso zzso A slice prescription procedure for zzso zzso is zzso Estimates are made for the probabilities of correctly and falsely zzso zzso as active or inactive and receiver operator characteristic zzso are zzso In the motor zzso estimated zzso reliability was found to be somewhat reduced relative to zzso zzso however, this includes additional sources of variation and may not reflect zzso lower zzso After matching zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability was found to be nearly identical for both motor and cognitive zzso zzso
