zzso white matter zzso zzso have been described in stroke patients with zzso hypertension, zzso episodes, or increased nocturnal fall of blood pressure zzso As a result of these mixed factors, the relationship between zzso and zzso remains zzso and the appropriate management of zzso zzso in stroke patients with zzso is zzso 

To clarify the relationship between zzso zzso zzso and cerebral zzso 

zzso study followed up 6 months after index zzso 

zzso zzso 

In 41 consecutive patients with zzso zzso zzso the extent of zzso detected on brain magnetic resonance images was zzso Six months after stroke, zzso values were monitored during a 24-hour period and zzso zzso examinations were performed at rest and following the administration of zzso 

zzso of cerebral zzso and zzso values with the extent of zzso 

The severity of zzso varied substantially among patients, suggesting that zzso and zzso zzso could be due to several different zzso Older age, elevated awake zzso zzso increased cerebrovascular tone, and the interaction between history of heart disease and the lowest heart rate were the strongest independent zzso of the severity of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso capacity of the resistance vessels did not predict the severity of zzso 

Overall, zzso are markers of zzso damage in older zzso stroke patients with stiffer zzso In addition, zzso failure may be relevant in patients with zzso heart zzso
