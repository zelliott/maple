zzso zzso zzso is the greatest single zzso problem occurring in an unpredictable zzso of all zzso and accounting for zzso of all zzso zzso zzso cervical softening is used clinically as an important indicator of cervical dysfunction but the zzso nature of present clinical assessment methods prevents reliable prediction of zzso zzso This paper reports the finding of a pilot investigation concerned with obtaining quantitative zzso of the in zzso electrical zzso of the zzso using a zzso zzso zzso measurement zzso zzso measurement obtained from six samples of cervical tissue taken from different subjects of zzso section were fitted to the Cole equation and parameters derived to describe the ratio of zzso versus zzso zzso and the characteristic zzso zzso at term display a lower zzso versus zzso zzso ratio than the zzso zzso This appears consistent with the expected increase in the zzso of the zzso approaching term and the resulting decrease in the zzso zzso Further studies are required to determine if zzso electrical zzso zzso could be used as a zzso screening test for zzso zzso
