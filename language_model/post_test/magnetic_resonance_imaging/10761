zzso from loved ones commonly leads to grief zzso In some individuals, grief can evolve into a major depressive zzso The brain regions involved in grief have not been specifically zzso The authors studied brain activity in women actively grieving a recent romantic relationship zzso It was hypothesized that while remembering their zzso subjects would have altered brain activity in regions identified in sadness imaging zzso the zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso anterior cingulate, and prefrontal zzso 

Nine right-handed women whose romantic relationship ended within the preceding 4 months were zzso zzso were scanned using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging while they zzso between recalling a sad, zzso thought about their loved one zzso zzso and a neutral thought about a different person they knew an equally long zzso 

Acute grief zzso minus neutral zzso was associated with increased group activity in zzso brain regions, including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso activity was more prominent zzso and on the left and included the anterior zzso thalamus, zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso When a more zzso statistical threshold for regions of interest was used, additional increases were found in the lateral zzso cortex, zzso anterior zzso prefrontal cortex, and right zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, all of which were adjacent to zzso more prominent zzso In nearly all brain regions showing brain activity decreases with acute grief, activity decreases were greater in women reporting higher grief levels over the past 2 zzso 

During acute grief, subjects showed brain activity changes in the zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex, consistent with the zzso zzso with greater baseline grief showed greater decreases in all these regions except for the zzso Further imaging studies are needed to understand the relationship between normal sadness, grief, and zzso
