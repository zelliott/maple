The purpose of this study was to assess the potential role of MR imaging with zzso enhancement in the early detection of acute zzso zzso zzso in a rat zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso in 12 rats, zzso fast zzso MR images were acquired, followed by zzso images before and after IV administration of zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity of the zzso zzso did not differ significantly from that of the normal zzso before the administration of the contrast zzso No zzso or zzso zzso or zzso was found in the zzso zzso at zzso zzso After the administration of zzso the zzso zzso lacked enhancement and its signal intensity was significantly lower than that of the normal zzso MR imaging with zzso enhancement can detect acute zzso zzso of the rat zzso at an early zzso
