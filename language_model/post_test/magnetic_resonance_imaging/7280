In current zzso systems, the data acquisition paradigm is based on a zzso examination, imaging the patient from hip to zzso This strategy has potential limitations, especially in terms of zzso and PET acquisition zzso In this work, the technical zzso of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition with continuous table motion zzso is zzso PET and MR data acquired with zzso are evaluated in terms of image quality with respect to table motion zzso 

zzso zzso and patient data were acquired on an integrated zzso zzso zzso Phantom experiments were used to systematically zzso image quality parameters including zzso ratio, geometric zzso and artifacts in PET and MR scans as a function of different table zzso Volunteer scans zzso zzso 4) allowed evaluation of zzso MR protocols in a realistic setting, and patient scans zzso zzso 3) were obtained to validate the technique in a clinical zzso 

In zzso PET image quality, zzso ratio, zzso and artifact behavior were found not to be influenced by continuous table motion over the evaluated table motion speeds from zzso to zzso zzso This also holds true for PET patient data where acquisitions were performed with varying table speeds of up to 46 zzso For zzso in most scans image quality of zzso scans was found to be comparable to the identical sequence acquired in zzso zzso however, some sequence features zzso signal intensity zzso with impact on MR contrast are currently missing for zzso MR zzso 

Data acquisition with continuous table motion in the zzso versus zzso acquisition scheme provides data of comparable quality in both PET and zzso This new acquisition paradigm potentially can provide a higher flexibility in simultaneous PET and MR zzso data acquisition and facilitate examination planning and zzso hybrid imaging zzso
