Brain zzso are valuable tools which assist zzso during the planning of an zzso Since a printed zzso book has several zzso them the difficulty to map the information onto a patient's individual zzso have developed a digital version of the well-established zzso brain zzso of zzso and zzso Our zzso system is mainly dedicated to assist zzso planning, and its benefits are: zzso a three-dimensional zzso representation of most brain structures contained in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso matching capability which zzso the standard zzso anatomy to an individual brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso in a few minutes and which is able to take zzso due to tumors into zzso zzso the integration of several sources of zzso knowledge; zzso an interface to a navigation system which allows zzso of zzso information zzso In this paper we outline the zzso we have developed to achieve zzso surface models of the brain zzso Moreover, we describe the zzso matching method which consists of two tasks: zzso point zzso between the zzso and the patient are established in an automatic fashion, and zzso these displacement zzso are zzso using a zzso basis function approach to form a continuous transformation zzso To generate appropriate target structures for the first of these tasks, we implemented a quick zzso tool which is capable to segment the zzso and zzso in less than 5 zzso An evaluation shows that our zzso approach is more precise than the conventional zzso linear matching, though it should be further improved for the region around the deep zzso zzso zzso we developed a zzso program which permits the convenient and fast application of standardized anatomy to individual brains which potentially contain zzso
