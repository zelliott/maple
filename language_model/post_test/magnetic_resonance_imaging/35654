Controlled laboratory study 

To determine the effects of pulse duration and stimulation duration on the evoked zzso after controlling for the activated area by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso electrical stimulation zzso is commonly used in the clinic without considering the zzso implications of its zzso 

Seven zzso college students zzso zzso zzso age, 28 zzso 4 zzso participated in this zzso Two zzso protocols were applied to the knee zzso muscle group in a random zzso zzso A applied zzso zzso zzso for 5 minutes in a zzso zzso duty zzso zzso B applied zzso zzso zzso for 5 minutes in a zzso zzso duty zzso The zzso of the current was similar in both zzso zzso zzso time zzso and zzso zzso for the knee zzso were measured for both zzso zzso scans were taken prior to, and immediately after, each protocol to measure the zzso area of the zzso zzso 

The skeletal muscle zzso areas activated after both protocols were zzso The longer pulse duration in protocol A zzso zzso greater zzso output than that of protocol B zzso After considering the activated area in both zzso the zzso zzso with protocol A was 38% greater than that with protocol B zzso zzso time integral was zzso greater with protocol A zzso zzso zzso zzso B failed to maintain zzso at the start and the end of the zzso zzso 

zzso pulse zzso but not stimulation zzso resulted in a greater evoked and zzso zzso compared to the shorter pulse zzso even after controlling for the activated muscular zzso areas with both zzso
