To investigate frequency of zzso zzso zzso in elderly hip zzso and to determine sensitivity and specificity of MR zzso zzso for the detection of these zzso 

Twenty zzso hip zzso were examined by zzso For zzso 15 zzso of a solution of zzso contrast solution zzso zzso and zzso zzso were injected under zzso zzso MR imaging was performed on a zzso T MR scanner zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso 256 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image reconstructions were done perpendicular to the zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso specimens were examined zzso 

In zzso hips zzso a zzso zzso was found on zzso zzso In 7 zzso the zzso was partially or completely detached in the zzso superior zzso One zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso in 4 hip zzso the zzso was zzso (one zzso zzso zzso findings were confirmed by zzso in zzso specimens zzso zzso All zzso zzso were correctly diagnosed on zzso Three small zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso as being zzso There were no false positive findings zzso zzso The accuracy was zzso zzso zzso were seen in zzso and in zzso of hips with and without zzso zzso 

zzso is well suited to delineate the zzso zzso and to diagnose zzso zzso zzso of small zzso zzso and zzso zzso is difficult and requires some zzso zzso zzso are correlated to zzso of the hip, but may be frequently seen in the elderly without underlying zzso
