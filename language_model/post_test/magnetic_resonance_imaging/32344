In this study, MR zzso imaging is employed to zzso verify the zzso of zzso simulations of electromagnetic field patterns in human zzso zzso and zzso simulations of the zzso field induced by a 3 T MR body zzso in a human corpse were zzso It was found that MR zzso imaging is a sensitive method to measure the zzso zzso magnetic field inside a human anatomy with a precision of approximately zzso A good correlation was found between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The measured zzso pattern for a human pelvis consisted of a zzso diagonal zzso pattern plus local zzso zzso It is believed that these local zzso field variations are the result of zzso in the induced electric zzso which could not be resolved by the zzso simulations on a 5 zzso simulation zzso The findings from this study demonstrate that zzso imaging is a valuable experimental technique to gain more knowledge about the zzso interaction of zzso fields with the human zzso
