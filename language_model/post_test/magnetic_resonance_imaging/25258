We describe a case of severe zzso and retrograde zzso resulting from zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed pathological changes in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso part of the zzso zzso and zzso The patient showed severe zzso for autobiographical episodic memory in relation to events that had occurred throughout her life, but temporally graded zzso for autobiographical semantic memory, and severe zzso without a zzso zzso for public events and famous zzso However, using a zzso method, she showed a high level of accuracy when choosing zzso related to public or personal events, although this did not prompt her recollection of the zzso An important indication of these results is that, even with severe retrograde zzso memories of past events are not completely zzso We propose that an event may be stored in a fragmented form, consisting of many zzso and that normal recall of an event may require zzso or reconstruction of these zzso
