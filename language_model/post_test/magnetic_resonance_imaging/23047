Severe capacity limits, closely associated with fluid intelligence, arise in learning and use of new task zzso We used zzso to investigate these limits in a series of zzso tasks involving different zzso rules, and response zzso Data were analyzed both during presentation of instructions and during later task zzso Between tasks, we manipulated the number of rules specified in task zzso and within tasks, we manipulated the number of rules operative in each trial zzso zzso previous results, rule failures were strongly predicted by fluid intelligence and increased with the number of operative zzso In zzso data, analyses of the instruction period showed that the bilateral inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso motor area were zzso active with presentation of each new zzso In a broader range of frontal and zzso regions, baseline activity gradually increased as successive rules were zzso During task performance, we observed contrasting zzso patterns of sustained zzso and transient zzso zzso Block, but not trial, activity showed effects of task zzso We suggest that, as a new task is learned, a zzso representation of relevant rules and facts is assembled for future control of zzso zzso limits in learning and executing new rules, and their association with fluid intelligence, may be zzso by this zzso zzso zzso
