zzso for referral of chronic zzso zzso zzso patients for zzso valve replacement zzso suggest that surgery can be delayed until symptoms or reduction in left zzso zzso zzso function zzso The frequent occurrence of reduced zzso zzso function after zzso for chronic zzso suggests that new zzso metrics for surgical referral are zzso 

In 16 chronic zzso patients, cardiac zzso zzso images were analyzed before and zzso zzso zzso months after zzso to calculate zzso zzso zzso Average zzso of three strain parameters were obtained for each of 72 zzso regions, zzso using a normal human strain database zzso zzso zzso and combined into a composite index zzso strain zzso score zzso representing standard zzso from the normal regional zzso 

zzso global zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso global zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso global zzso also predicts improvement of impaired regions (N zzso zzso regions from 14 zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso is also zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Although global zzso zzso had a significantly higher correlation than zzso zzso with improvement of injured regions zzso zzso zzso both measures convey the same zzso 

Global zzso zzso zzso strain predicts global strain zzso as well as improvement of regions zzso zzso 72 per zzso with impaired zzso zzso Global zzso function is an important correlate with improvement in regionally impaired zzso function, perhaps reflecting total zzso zzso burden zzso of zzso
