The present study was undertaken to characterize the formation of zzso brain zzso using zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging in a rat model of focal zzso The extent of zzso formation was measured from zzso zzso and zzso zzso images acquired at various times after zzso The zzso relaxation time zzso and the apparent diffusion zzso in normal and zzso tissue were also zzso The results show that on the zzso images the zzso was clearly visible at 30 minutes after zzso while on the zzso images it became increasingly evident after 2-3 zzso On both types of images the zzso area increased in size over the first 48 zzso After 1 week the zzso on the zzso images rapidly disappeared and evolved as a zzso zzso in the chronic zzso These results confirm the high sensitivity of zzso zzso for the detection of early zzso The zzso course of the zzso observed on zzso is in agreement with the reported increase of total water content occurring in this zzso The increase of the zzso observed on the zzso images during the first 2 days points to an zzso of zzso zzso that parallels the changes in free water shown by the zzso zzso It is shown that the highly elevated zzso of the zzso area several days after zzso can substantially contaminate the zzso zzso
