To analyze a putative relationship between white matter zzso zzso risk factors for zzso and zzso disease zzso as measured with the surrogate marker zzso zzso 

The authors analyzed effects of acquired risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and zzso on zzso as measured with an intermediate marker, zzso zzso A total of zzso consecutive patients with zzso memory impairment zzso age 66 years; 57 zzso investigated at a zzso memory clinic had brain zzso zzso zzso were rated on a 12-point scale with a zzso zzso They used path analysis with established and possible risk factors for zzso and for reduced zzso zzso zzso hypertension, zzso zzso zzso as zzso 

The zzso score was zzso points higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso than in zzso patients and zzso points higher zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso than in those with normal homocysteine zzso zzso increased the probability of low zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso For each point increase in zzso score, the probability of low zzso zzso levels increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso and white matter zzso may contribute to low zzso zzso by independent zzso
