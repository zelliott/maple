zzso zzso plaques are the zzso hallmark of active multiple sclerosis and often zzso clinical zzso zzso early detection of active plaques would thus be crucial in establishing zzso diagnosis and could lead to early preventive treatment zzso Using zzso experimental zzso zzso as a model of multiple zzso we demonstrate that a zzso zzso zzso zzso sensor can detect and confirm more, smaller, and earlier active inflammatory zzso in living mice by in zzso zzso We show that zzso expression corresponded with areas of inflammatory cell zzso and zzso and higher zzso activity as detected by zzso imaging, zzso zzso and zzso analyses correlated with increased clinical disease zzso Our findings present a potential new zzso approach for specific zzso inflammatory plaque zzso This approach could be used in zzso studies to identify active zzso plaques as well as to more accurately track disease course following treatment in clinical zzso
