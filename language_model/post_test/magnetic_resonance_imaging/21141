zzso memory impairment is a common but zzso phenomenon in multiple sclerosis zzso We aim to establish the relative contributions of reduced integrity of components of the extended zzso system to memory performance in zzso patients using quantitative zzso 

34 patients with zzso zzso and 24 healthy zzso controls underwent 3 T zzso including diffusion zzso imaging and 3-D zzso volume zzso Manual zzso zzso were used to derive zzso fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body and zzso volumes were derived by manual zzso zzso subjects underwent visual recall, verbal recall, verbal recognition and verbal zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso patients and controls were found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso means adjusted for age and zzso volume, zzso and zzso body volumes zzso means zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso and zzso bodies as predictor of visual recall zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume as zzso of verbal recall zzso zzso No zzso measures predicted verbal recognition or verbal zzso 

These findings indicate that structural and zzso zzso in zzso zzso components beyond the zzso predict performance of episodic recall in zzso patients with mild memory zzso
