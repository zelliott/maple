The goal of this study was to evaluate the MR zzso of the zzso zzso SP cochlear implant by performing in zzso and in zzso zzso All tests were performed on zzso T zzso zzso and force were measured to observe a potential displacement of the internal zzso zzso of the internal magnet was monitored inside the zzso scanner and outside the zzso scanner (in the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso was measured in zzso performing the usual MR zzso zzso around the internal receiver was measured after the same MR zzso Following in zzso tests, in zzso MR imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed to evaluate the induced signal void and geometrical zzso In zzso test was performed with one volunteer who had a cochlear implant device fixed to the surface of the skin with a zzso All the in zzso tests were in compliance with standard zzso zzso relating to zzso zzso In zzso zzso scans demonstrated an image distortion for spin echo sequences of 7 zzso maximum around the internal zzso zzso resonance imaging with the zzso zzso SP cochlear implant is possible with no measurable adverse effects for either the patient or the zzso Image zzso around the internal zzso however, is zzso
