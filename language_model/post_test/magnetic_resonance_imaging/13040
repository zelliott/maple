zzso structural and functional zzso have been demonstrated in a range of zzso zzso including bipolar disorder, but no study has examined regional zzso thickness in this zzso The aim of the present study was therefore to examine zzso size and shape in a zzso group of bipolar affective disorder patients and zzso 

The participants included 24 patients with zzso bipolar I disorder and 24 matched healthy zzso The corpus zzso was extracted from zzso images from zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans on all participants, and zzso area, zzso zzso angle and regional zzso thickness measures were zzso from these zzso 

The zzso was thinner in the bipolar group overall, with a disproportionately reduced thickness in the zzso zzso and zzso patients did not zzso although patients without a family history of mood disorders had a thinner zzso 

zzso reductions are present in established bipolar disorder, and affect zzso regions more than anterior zzso This may reflect a primary zzso to zzso or a secondary effect of zzso matter zzso
