To determine whether the amount of joint cartilage in healthy zzso women is stable or changes over time, and whether zzso replacement therapy zzso influences zzso 

A cohort study in healthy zzso women without knee pain, initially selected on the basis of having either used zzso long term (more than five zzso or never having used zzso 

81 women zzso taking zzso and 39 zzso had baseline knee zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso on the dominant zzso 57 of these zzso were followed with repeat zzso approximately zzso years zzso zzso cartilage volume was measured at baseline and at follow zzso zzso factors assessed at zzso including zzso use, were tested for their association with change in knee cartilage volume over zzso 

29 subjects who were initially taking zzso and 28 zzso at baseline completed the zzso Total zzso zzso cartilage zzso on average, by zzso zzso zzso zzso per year zzso confidence zzso for mean, zzso to zzso Average annual reduction in zzso and lateral zzso cartilage was zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso No association between zzso and the rate of reduction in cartilage volume was zzso 

Mean zzso cartilage volume loss in healthy zzso women is between zzso and zzso a zzso Whether this rate of change is similar throughout adult life or in men will require further zzso
