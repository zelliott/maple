A new series of zzso complexes based on zzso zzso was zzso and zzso They possess side chains with different structures which determine their varying binding properties and response towards zzso metal zzso measured by changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits the highest selectivity toward zzso in comparison to the other complexes, with up to a zzso increase of the zzso zzso and zzso also respond to different zzso concentration zzso however with a lower selectivity since the zzso changes are also observed in the presence of other zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso Assessment of the zzso number zzso via zzso lifetime zzso confirmed that the change in zzso is responsible for the zzso response for all the zzso
