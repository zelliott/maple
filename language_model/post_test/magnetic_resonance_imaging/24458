To evaluate the zzso seizure burden in zzso with hypoxic zzso zzso zzso treated with or without therapeutic zzso and zzso results by severity of zzso and severity of injury as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Between 2007 and 2011, zzso zzso monitoring was initiated in zzso with moderate to severe zzso zzso burden (in zzso was zzso and brain zzso scans were zzso zzso Data were analyzed by zzso the Student zzso test, and the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with moderate or severe zzso were zzso zzso including 51 who received therapeutic zzso and 18 who did zzso The mean duration of zzso monitoring was longer in the therapeutic zzso group zzso zzso 34 hours vs 48 zzso 34 hours; P zzso zzso The therapeutic zzso group had a lower zzso seizure burden zzso zzso after controlling for injury, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A reduction in seizure burden was seen in zzso with moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in those with severe zzso zzso zzso zzso Among zzso with injury assessed by zzso seizure burden was lower in those with mild zzso zzso zzso and moderate zzso zzso zzso injury, but not in those with severe injury zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso seizure burden in zzso zzso This effect was detected on zzso in infants with moderate zzso but not in those with severe zzso When zzso by injury as assessed by zzso therapeutic zzso was associated with a reduced seizure burden in infants with mild and moderate injury, but not in those with severe zzso
