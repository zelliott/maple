To assist in the development of a model for the zzso of emotions, the present study sought to identify the neural circuits associated with the evaluation of visual stimuli for emotional zzso 

zzso healthy individuals were shown three sets of emotionally laden pictures carrying pleasant, zzso and neutral zzso While subjects evaluated the picture set for emotional zzso regional cerebral blood flow was measured with the use of zzso water zzso zzso zzso zzso ratings of the emotional zzso of the picture sets were zzso Data were analyzed by comparing the images acquired during the neutral condition with the unpleasant and pleasant image sets and the unpleasant and pleasant conditions with each zzso 

zzso of pleasant stimuli was associated with increased blood flow in the zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso relative to the unpleasant condition and in the cingulate, zzso and visual zzso relative to the neutral zzso zzso of unpleasant stimuli activated the amygdala, visual cortex, and zzso relative to the pleasant condition and the nucleus zzso zzso and visual zzso relative to the neutral zzso 

Observing and assigning emotional value to unpleasant stimuli produced zzso in zzso zzso regions, whereas evaluation of pleasant stimuli produced zzso in cortical zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the notion of a zzso and archaic danger recognition system and a system detecting zzso in events and situations that is zzso younger, involving primarily the prefrontal zzso
