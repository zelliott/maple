zzso zzso is a typically diffuse zzso disease, which often affects the zzso and zzso We report a rare case of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso affecting only the left zzso zzso mater and adjacent inferior zzso zzso 

A 46-year-old woman, with no history of disease, suddenly had a generalized zzso A zzso zzso magnetic resonance image showed zzso stained zzso extending to the cortical zzso with marked zzso zzso The thickened zzso was zzso as a zzso area on a zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

The patient underwent successful en bloc zzso of the mass involving the zzso mater and adjacent brain zzso zzso examination of the zzso mater revealed large numbers of chronic and acute inflammatory zzso These cells were also present in the zzso and zzso spaces and part of the brain zzso in the zzso zzso After the operation, the patient experienced no neurological deficits or zzso mass for 10 zzso 

Early diagnosis of zzso using magnetic resonance imaging is important for the treatment of zzso because diffuse involvement of the zzso mater and brain zzso can make en bloc zzso zzso
