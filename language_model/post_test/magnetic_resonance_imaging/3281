In this study, we investigated the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso administration of zzso magnetic zzso to detect the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso scans were acquired following subcutaneous injection of zzso magnetic zzso into the zzso wall of zzso The zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso was calculated to assess whether the zzso could be detected by zzso In a second experiment, after injecting zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso 36, zzso 42, zzso 55, and zzso into the zzso of the zzso of rats, the injection sites, the zzso and the distant zzso zzso were zzso and examined zzso in order to determine which zzso if any, were specifically retained in the zzso 

zzso showed that the zzso ratio of zzso zzso was significantly lower 24 h after injection of zzso 42 than on the zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation revealed that zzso 36 zzso at body temperature and did not migrate to the zzso zzso 42, on the other hand, zzso and the particles became large enough to be retained in the zzso zzso 55 and zzso did not aggregate, and they both migrated to the zzso and the distant zzso zzso 

The results of this study showed that zzso magnetic zzso could be targeted to the zzso by adjusting the temperature at which they aggregate, and that they could be used as a contrast agent for zzso mapping by zzso
