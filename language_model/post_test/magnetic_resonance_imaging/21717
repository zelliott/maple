zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso is a common first manifestation of multiple sclerosis zzso in which increased numbers of zzso T and B cells, recognizing different zzso zzso including zzso basic protein zzso and its zzso have been implicated in a hypothetical zzso Using an zzso zzso to detect specific zzso zzso by individual cells, we analyzed the zzso repertoire to zzso and its zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in blood and zzso from patients with ON and zzso and from zzso There were cells zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the four peptides in blood at mean numbers of zzso to zzso per zzso zzso cells, without differences between the three patient zzso Mostly, more than zzso more B cells with these zzso per zzso cells were found in zzso from the patients with ON and zzso without differences between these two groups but with many fewer in zzso from zzso None of the four included zzso peptides represented an zzso zzso zzso in either ON or zzso and the zzso response was not more restricted in ON than in zzso The autonomy of the zzso zzso response in zzso was further supported by the pronounced zzso of the repertoire to the four zzso peptides in zzso compared with blood in individual zzso The large numbers of zzso and zzso zzso B cells in zzso in early zzso as zzso by zzso could play a major role in the zzso and perpetuation of zzso zzso they could represent zzso breakdown or zzso
