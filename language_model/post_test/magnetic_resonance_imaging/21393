zzso compliance is mainly determined by the elasticity of zzso zzso arteries of which the zzso is the largest zzso Compliance forms an important part of the cardiac load and plays a role in organ (especially zzso zzso To follow local changes in zzso compliance, as in aging, zzso determination of compliance distribution would be of great zzso Our goal is to determine regional zzso compliance zzso in the zzso In seven healthy individuals at six locations, zzso blood flow and zzso area zzso was measured with zzso zzso zzso pulse pressure zzso was measured with standard zzso With a transfer function we derived zzso at the same zzso locations as the zzso zzso Regional zzso compliance was calculated with two approaches, the pulse pressure method, and local area compliance zzso times segment zzso called area compliance zzso For comparison, pulse wave zzso zzso from local flows at two locations was determined, and compliance was derived from zzso Both approaches show that compliance is largest in the zzso zzso and decreases toward the zzso zzso Similar results were found with zzso zzso Of total zzso compliance, ascending to zzso arch zzso zzso contributes zzso (of which zzso is in head and zzso descending zzso zzso 4 and 5) zzso and zzso pelvic and leg zzso zzso Pulse pressure method includes compliance of side branches and is therefore larger than the area compliance zzso Regional zzso compliance can be obtained zzso zzso this technique allows following changes in local compliance with age and cardiovascular zzso
