In this paper, a novel sensitivity mapping method is proposed for the image domain parallel zzso zzso zzso Instead of refining raw sensitivity maps by means of conventional image processing operations such as zzso fitting, the presented method determines zzso sensitivity profiles through an zzso zzso zzso During the zzso zzso the zzso cost function is defined as the difference between the raw sensitivity profile and the desired zzso The zzso is governed by the physics of zzso electromagnetic and zzso zzso The performance of the method was theoretically investigated and compared with that of a traditional zzso fitting, against a range of system noise zzso It was found that, the new method produces zzso sensitivity profiles with noise zzso measured as root mean square zzso an order of magnitude less than that of the zzso fitting zzso Using the sensitivity profiles generated by our method, zzso zzso zzso reconstructions produce significantly less image zzso than conventional zzso The successful zzso of this method has far-reaching implications that accurate sensitivity mapping is not only important for parallel zzso but also essential for its transmission zzso such as zzso zzso
