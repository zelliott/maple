The zzso imaging of zzso receptors zzso could provide insight into their role in different diseases and lead to novel zzso zzso The main objective of this study was to assess the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso monkey imaging and human zzso zzso studies were performed to gain information about the potential of zzso for eventual clinical zzso 

The distribution and stability of zzso in rats were assessed via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso monkey brain was conducted along with zzso assessment of zzso stability in monkey plasma and human zzso 

zzso studies showed that zzso accumulated in zzso rat zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with known zzso compounds, haloperidol, or zzso before zzso administration, significantly attenuated zzso zzso in all rat brain regions by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso specificity for zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso results demonstrated zzso of zzso in rat brain regions known to contain zzso and that this zzso could be blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso in the brain showed that only intact zzso was present at 15, 30, and 60 zzso whereas rapid metabolism of residual zzso was observed in rat zzso zzso monkey zzso studies demonstrated specific zzso of zzso in the brain zzso in cortical structures, zzso and zzso that could be attenuated by zzso with zzso zzso of monkey plasma suggested zzso zzso whereas zzso appeared to be stable in human zzso Finally, liver zzso studies revealed that zzso has a longer zzso in human zzso compared with zzso 

Together, these results indicate that zzso is a promising tool for visualizing zzso in zzso studies and that it has potential for mapping these sites in the human zzso
