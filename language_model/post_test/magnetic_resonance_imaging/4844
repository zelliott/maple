zzso refers to the ability to thrive despite adversity and is defined as a zzso phenomenon, spanning internal locus of control, sense of meaning, social problem-solving skills, and zzso We aimed to investigate the zzso value of resilience for the development of zzso stress disorder zzso and to examine the neural zzso zzso the relationship between resilience and recovery from a traumatic event in acutely traumatized zzso We hypothesized that resilience would mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and zzso zzso 

We conducted a prospective study with 70 acutely traumatized subjects with zzso zzso recruited at the emergency department, assessing zzso symptom severity at 3 time points within the first 3 months zzso Scores for childhood trauma as assessed with the Childhood zzso zzso and trait resilience as assessed with the zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso of symptom zzso A zzso of 12 subjects additionally underwent a functional 4 zzso magnetic resonance imaging scan 2 to 4 months zzso We employed the traumatic zzso imagery paradigm to assess the correlations between trait resilience and blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso The study was conducted from 2003 to zzso 

zzso predicted zzso symptom severity at 5 to 6 weeks zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as at 3 months zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso better than childhood zzso zzso essentially zzso the relationship between childhood trauma and zzso zzso zzso scores were positively correlated with zzso signal strength in the right zzso as well as the inferior and middle frontal zzso zzso area zzso 

This pilot investigation revealed a significant relationship between resilience and emotion regulation areas during trauma recall in an acutely traumatized zzso zzso was established as a significant predictor of zzso symptom severity and zzso the influence of childhood trauma on zzso zzso
