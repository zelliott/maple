Combined zzso recordings offer a promising opportunity to detect brain areas with altered zzso signal during zzso zzso zzso zzso These areas are likely to represent the zzso zone, which is itself a reflection of the zzso zzso This paper reports on the imaging findings using independent component analysis zzso to continuously zzso zzso activity in simultaneously acquired zzso and zzso Using zzso derived factors coding for the zzso activity takes into account that zzso activity is continuously fluctuating with each spike differing in zzso duration and maybe topography, including zzso zzso activity besides clear zzso and may thus increase the sensitivity and statistical power of combined zzso in zzso Twenty patients with different types of focal and generalized zzso syndromes were zzso zzso separated zzso activity from normal zzso brain activity and zzso In zzso patients, zzso zzso of zzso activity matched the zzso sources, the clinical zzso and, if present, the structural zzso In clinically zzso cases, the zzso zzso aided to attribute proper diagnosis of the underlying zzso zzso Furthermore, in one patient with zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso of rhythmic delta activity could be employed to delineate the affected zzso Compared to zzso zzso of manually identified zzso the sensitivity was improved from 50% zzso to zzso The zzso zzso approach is a safe, zzso and easily zzso technique, which can be used to identify regions with altered zzso effects related to zzso as well as intermittent rhythmic zzso in different types of zzso
