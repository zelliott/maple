In this paper we propose a segmented magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso maximum penalized likelihood zzso technique for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The model assumes the existence of activity classes that behave like a hidden zzso random field zzso driven by the segmented zzso We zzso a mean field approximation to zzso the likelihood of the zzso We tested our method on both simulated and clinical data zzso zzso and compared our results with PET images corrected with the zzso Van zzso zzso algorithm, the simplified zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated our zzso zzso the VC zzso and zzso zzso and zzso corrections when the segmented zzso is inconsistent zzso zzso zzso zzso with the PET zzso
