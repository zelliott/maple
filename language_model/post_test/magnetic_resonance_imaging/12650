A zzso approach to the management of brain zzso has been claimed to increase diagnostic zzso Among the proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso and to identify early response or resistance to zzso Major drawbacks of zzso that is, poor zzso resolution and the sites of zzso zzso could be overcome by zzso integrated zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the real usefulness of zzso zzso zzso zzso and to establish a zzso zzso 

Charts from 33 consecutive patients selected for surgery, who underwent zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso zzso were confirmed zzso after the surgery in all patients and classified according to WHO zzso zzso indexes were obtained on images zzso likelihood expectation zzso zzso with and without zzso correction and visual analysis of zzso versus zzso was zzso 

A significant statistical difference was shown between zzso and zzso in terms of the zzso of zzso shift, zzso and the ability to distinguish zzso from the zzso complex and zzso With regard to zzso indexes, a ratio obtained comparing zzso derived from a region of interest in the zzso area with mirrored region of interest in the zzso site revealed a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso in discriminating WHO grade 4 zzso from a lower zzso 

zzso can distinguish zzso from the skull and other sites of zzso zzso better than zzso alone (as confirmed by zzso in all zzso and zzso a zzso zzso The proposed zzso index also seems promising in identifying zzso zzso zzso thus seems a useful additional tool in brain zzso management, especially when zzso is not feasible or zzso is not zzso
