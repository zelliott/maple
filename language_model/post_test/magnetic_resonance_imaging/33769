The recent advance in zzso methods of zzso such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been lead to give us much zzso about the structural changes with high resolution, the iron distribution in the brain, the regional zzso and the zzso mapping zzso These new methods have been also applied to the movement zzso For example, in Parkinson's disease, zzso revealed the narrowed zzso image of zzso zzso of zzso without zzso zzso Also PET in this disease demonstrated normal regional cerebral blood flow, normal regional zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso reduced zzso of zzso and normal D1 and zzso receptors in the zzso These zzso zzso and molecular zzso information has not only zzso the zzso but has also helped us to understand normal brain zzso
