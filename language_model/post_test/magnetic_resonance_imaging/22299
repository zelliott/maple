In the past few years, zzso zzso have been paid increasing attention to because of their recently increasing zzso We reviewed the MR images of 17 patients with zzso proved primary zzso lymphoma, all of them zzso at zzso We studied the site, number and shape of the zzso the presence and grade of zzso and possible zzso zzso The exams were performed with zzso T and zzso T MR units, using zzso sequences on the zzso zzso and zzso planes, before and after zzso zzso The most typical zzso signs which may suggest the diagnosis of zzso zzso are deep or zzso zzso site, diffuse and marked contrast enhancement, poorly defined borders, moderate zzso surrounding the mass and a tendency to zzso zzso zzso demonstrated 35 zzso in 17 zzso The zzso was zzso in 9 cases zzso and 7 zzso were localized in zzso zzso zzso size did not exceed 2 zzso in zzso of cases, ranged 2-4 zzso in zzso and exceeded 4 zzso in zzso of cases zzso These zzso and zzso to zzso on zzso images zzso and their signal intensity varies on zzso images, with mainly zzso patterns zzso All zzso enhanced after zzso administration, zzso of them markedly and zzso zzso enhancement was mostly homogeneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso yields some useful information for the diagnosis of primary zzso lymphoma, but the clinical and zzso signs of this zzso may exhibit zzso signal features, meaning that no correct diagnosis can be made even in zzso zzso
