To assess the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to identify zzso and functional abnormalities associated with zzso anterior and inferior zzso zzso 18 patients with anterior zzso zzso and 11 patients with inferior zzso zzso confirmed by zzso and zzso underwent zzso zzso of zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso of corresponding imaging planes was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was defined as zzso wall thickness zzso zzso below corresponding normal values of a healthy control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as a zzso zzso less than zzso zzso below mean values of a healthy control group zzso zzso zzso By zzso 231 segments contained normal tissue and 161 contained scarred zzso In zzso zzso segments zzso based on zzso wall thickness and zzso zzso were zzso zzso wall thickness was significantly higher in normal than in scarred zzso segments zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 2 zzso p less than zzso Additionally, normal segments by zzso showed significantly higher zzso wall zzso than zzso segments zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso assessed zzso size was r zzso zzso for anterior and r zzso zzso for inferior zzso zzso The agreement between zzso zzso zzso size and regions with reduced zzso wall thickness on zzso zzso was significantly better for anterior zzso zzso than for inferior zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
