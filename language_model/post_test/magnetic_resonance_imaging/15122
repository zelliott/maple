zzso study of zzso cohort of patients with neck zzso 

To determine the association between joint zzso and zzso disc zzso in young zzso 

Joint zzso is known to be closely related with orthopedic injuries and zzso however, studies about the relationship between spinal disorder and joint zzso are zzso 

Patients aged 30 to 40 years, seen at the zzso clinic of our hospital for the evaluation of neck pain, who had magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with routine inclusion of zzso zzso plane of the whole spine were included in the zzso The zzso and zzso criteria was used for the assessment of joint zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratio for zzso disc zzso in patients with joint zzso and other variables including age, sex, body mass index, physical zzso neck pain zzso analogue scale zzso and related disability zzso disability index zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of 101 patients were enrolled in the zzso 34 patients with joint zzso and 67 patients without joint zzso There were no differences in age, body mass index, physical zzso neck pain zzso analogue scale zzso and neck disability index score between the 2 groups, but there was a significant difference in sex ratio zzso zzso zzso Patients with joint zzso showed increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso slope zzso zzso zzso but without significant difference in pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, presence of joint zzso zzso score zzso as well as positive results of thumb zzso zzso zzso and elbow zzso zzso zzso tests were significantly associated with decreased risk for zzso disc zzso zzso of joint zzso remained significant after zzso adjustment for sex and zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Increased joint zzso was closely associated with lower prevalence of zzso disc zzso in young adults, and the increased zzso zzso associated with joint zzso might explain the decreased risk of zzso disc zzso
