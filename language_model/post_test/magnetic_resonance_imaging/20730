Previous studies on the zzso dynamics of cortical pain processing using zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso recordings point towards a high degree of zzso zzso parallel instead of sequential zzso of primary and secondary zzso areas or simultaneous zzso of zzso areas and the zzso zzso However, because of the inverse problem, zzso and zzso provide only limited spatial resolution and certainty about the generators of cortical zzso electromagnetic activity, especially when multiple sources are simultaneously zzso On the other hand, zzso recordings are invasive and do not provide zzso zzso In this study, we thought to investigate the zzso dynamics of cortical pain processing in 10 healthy subjects using simultaneous zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of 20 zzso segments of the zzso root mean square (a zzso largely zzso measure of zzso zzso zzso in a time window zzso zzso zzso were used to model zzso fluctuations in the zzso blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso explained additional zzso in the zzso signal from 140 zzso zzso zzso According to this analysis, the zzso zzso zzso was the first cortical area to become activated upon painful laser zzso The zzso pattern in zzso analyses informed by subsequent zzso windows suggests largely parallel signal processing in the bilateral zzso and zzso zzso In that regard, our data are in line with previous zzso However, the approach presented here is zzso and zzso the inverse problem using only zzso information from the zzso
