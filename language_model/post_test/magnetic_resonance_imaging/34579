The primary issues addressed in this study were: zzso determination of the significance of the zzso zzso zzso utilizing the zzso zzso zzso zzso in children at least 1 year after brain zzso zzso detection of residual zzso of brain zzso in these children upon follow up zzso zzso and zzso detection of relationships between zzso test performance and zzso zzso zzso criteria included children zzso years of age at the time of testing who received an initial CT scan at the time of their head injury and who had been injured at least 12 months prior to the follow up zzso Only children who did not demonstrate neurological disability at the time of follow up examination were zzso The children showed a status of zzso zzso as defined by the zzso Neurological examination, zzso tests and an zzso were zzso The test results of 59 patients were compared to those of a matched control zzso Children, after receiving head injuries, showed significantly poorer results with respect to zzso motor and fine motor zzso Of all zzso zzso revealed pathological zzso zzso zzso were detected on zzso in zzso of zzso zzso injuries were detected in zzso and, deep white matter zzso in zzso Furthermore, corpus zzso damage was observed in zzso of zzso zzso zzso findings were also observed in children with mild head zzso All of the children with normal zzso findings showed abilities comparable to those of children in the control zzso Patients with cortical zzso exhibited only motor deficits, whereas motor and cognitive deficits were seen in patients with deep white matter zzso Children with multiple zzso demonstrated test results in all variables 1 to 2 standard zzso below those of the control zzso 

Children suffering a brain injury who 1 year later are classified within the zzso zzso group according to the zzso zzso zzso often have significant zzso and functional brain zzso
