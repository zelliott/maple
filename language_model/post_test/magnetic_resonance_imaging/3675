zzso occurs in various diseases, including cancer, zzso and acute and chronic vascular zzso Here we describe the design and synthesis of the first zzso zzso contrast agents, zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso change associated with zzso zzso of the nitrogen atom of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso There was a correlation between the zzso of the zzso zzso change and the sum of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the aromatic zzso Among the zzso compounds, zzso was selectively reduced to the zzso by rat liver zzso under hypoxic conditions, resulting in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the change in zzso of the zzso zzso This enhancement of the zzso zzso could be clearly detected in zzso MR zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso contrast agent for the detection of zzso under zzso zzso
