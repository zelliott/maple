The aims were to determine agreement between staging of zzso cancer made by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso examination and the influence of zzso on choice of zzso zzso and surgical zzso 

In this retrospective zzso zzso zzso was performed on 91 patients who underwent zzso zzso with zzso having total zzso zzso zzso stage according to mural zzso zzso status and zzso zzso margin zzso involvement was assessed and compared with zzso 

Five zzso interpreted the zzso zzso agreement between zzso and zzso for T stage was zzso The greatest difficulty was in distinguishing between zzso zzso and minimal zzso zzso The accuracy for zzso zzso was zzso zzso an zzso variation between zzso and zzso In the 13 cases with no agreement between zzso and zzso zzso seven had long-term zzso and nine en bloc zzso indicating that the margins initially were involved with an even higher accuracy for zzso zzso short-term zzso was routine, but based on zzso findings, choice of zzso was affected in 29 cases zzso 17 patients had no zzso and 12 long-term zzso The surgical procedure was affected in 17 cases zzso with planned zzso en bloc zzso in zzso zzso was involved zzso or zzso 1 zzso in zzso of the 34 cases in which zzso had an effect upon choice of zzso and/or surgery compared with zzso of the remaining 57 cases where it had no zzso 

zzso resonance imaging predicted zzso with high accuracy in zzso zzso zzso could be used as a clinical guidance with high reliability as indicated by the low figures of zzso involved zzso
