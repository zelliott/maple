The zzso has been strongly implicated in the processing of zzso information in specific zzso However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether the zzso may also be engaged outside of conscious stimulus zzso Furthermore, considering that sustained vigilance for threat constitutes a crucial characteristic of specific phobias, we hypothesized a possible role of this symptom in modulating zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso Using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined responses of the zzso to subliminal and zzso zzso stimuli in zzso subjects and whether these responses might be specifically associated with zzso zzso 

zzso female zzso subjects and 18 healthy female control subjects were exposed to pictures of zzso and zzso objects, presented briefly during two zzso conditions used to manipulate stimulus zzso Brain zzso data were analyzed as a function of subjects' zzso performance on each single trial and were tested for correlations with different components of the zzso symptomatology, such as vigilance, as assessed by self-report zzso 

Compared with control subjects, zzso participants showed stronger responses of both zzso to consciously perceived zzso versus zzso targets, whereas during unconscious stimulus processing, enhanced zzso was only apparent in the right zzso Moreover, the intensity of zzso vigilance was positively correlated with right zzso zzso specifically during the subliminal zzso 

These findings provide evidence for unconscious threat processing in specific zzso with the magnitude of zzso responses specifically zzso by sustained zzso for zzso zzso in this vigilance system may be critically involved in anxiety zzso
