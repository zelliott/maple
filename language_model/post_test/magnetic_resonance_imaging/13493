zzso resonance imaging zzso at microscopic resolution was done on a live rat that had chemically induced zzso zzso Beginning at the anterior aspect of the liver, 16 zzso zzso slices (each zzso zzso zzso were produced using three-dimensional zzso transform zzso The rat had been treated with zzso zzso zzso at 70 days of age, and, zzso received periodic implants of zzso for 60 zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso time zzso 2,000 and echo time zzso 20, 40, 60, 80 zzso were done to give quantitative measures of zzso relaxation times zzso zzso curve fitting from these multiple images yielded calculated zzso zzso zzso evaluation of three abnormal areas in the liver revealed solid and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso were evident in zzso images of the zzso zzso they were more apparent in the zzso zzso This was consistent with longer zzso relaxation times for the zzso The zzso of dimensions zzso zzso 230 zzso 1,250 zzso permitted resolution of volume elements less than zzso zzso This in turn permitted clear zzso of focal zzso less than 3 zzso in zzso The potential for zzso at microscopic resolution in zzso research is clearly zzso
