In social situations, we encounter information transferred in firsthand zzso and secondhand zzso communication zzso However, the mechanism by which an individual zzso whether a past interaction occurred in an zzso versus zzso situation is poorly zzso This study examined the neural bases for zzso memories of social interactions through zzso manipulating the communication zzso During zzso data zzso participants watched video clips of an actor speaking and gesturing directly toward them zzso zzso or toward an unseen third person zzso zzso After zzso a recognition task zzso zzso ability to recognize the sentences they had just seen and to recall the context in which the sentences had been zzso We found no differences between the recognition of sentences spoken in zzso and zzso zzso However, when asked about the communication context zzso the actor directly spoken to zzso participants tended to believe falsely that the actor had directly spoken to them during zzso zzso Greater activity in the zzso was related to correct context memory, whereas the zzso zzso was activated for subsequent inaccurate context zzso For the interaction between zzso context and context memory, we observed increased zzso for zzso remembered items in the bilateral and zzso frontal cortex, the zzso and the left zzso and zzso zzso Our data indicate that memories of social interactions are biased to be remembered zzso zzso zzso processes reflected in increased frontal zzso and decreased zzso zzso might be the basis of correct item but false context memory of social zzso
