To investigate the efficacy and zzso changes after anterior zzso zzso zzso in patients followed for at least 10 years after the zzso 

The theoretical idea of zzso is to remove an zzso zzso mass while preserving disc zzso To our knowledge, no report has been published on the long-term outcome of this zzso 

Twenty patients underwent single-level zzso at our institution between 1989 and zzso Clinical outcome was evaluated by visual analog scale for neck and arm pain according to Japanese zzso Association zzso score, and range of motion zzso of the cervical zzso zzso outcome was evaluated by measuring disc height and range of zzso motion of the site on plain zzso We also evaluated the operated and the adjacent segments by magnetic resonance imaging zzso for degenerative zzso 

Fifteen of the 20 patients were zzso One patient required additional surgery, 3 patients were lost to zzso and 1 patient had died by the time of the zzso zzso we evaluated the clinical outcome of 15 zzso Both the plain zzso and zzso were available from 10 patients, and for 3 patients only the plain zzso were zzso Two patients refused zzso examination at the final zzso Regarding clinical outcome, no patient had suffered from neck pain or arm zzso The average visual analog scale was zzso zzso for neck pain, and zzso zzso for arm zzso zzso scores improved and remained at a good zzso The improvement rate was zzso The average zzso of the cervical spine was zzso degrees in zzso zzso degrees in extension, zzso degrees in zzso zzso and zzso degrees in lateral zzso Although zzso in zzso rotation and lateral zzso was zzso the range was smaller than that in the healthy zzso On plain zzso although the disc height in the operated segment was not significantly decreased compared with the other zzso loss of zzso motion was noticed on the follow-up zzso in most zzso Only 2 patients had mobility of the operated zzso levels zzso zzso There was no collapse of the drilled zzso body in any zzso Four of the 10 patients who underwent zzso showed zzso of zzso discs, including those adjacent to the affected zzso No recurrence of disk zzso at the involved level was seen on the follow-up zzso 

In conclusion, zzso provided a good clinical outcome that was maintained for a long zzso Although zzso motion at the operated level decreased to some extent, degenerative changes at the adjacent levels were not zzso
