To examine the pattern of immediate enhancement with zzso zzso on dynamic magnetic resonance zzso images of the zzso this study was divided into two zzso In the first part, the authors zzso reviewed the dynamic MR images obtained with a fast zzso shot zzso sequence in the abdomen immediately after injection of zzso zzso in 137 zzso In the second part, dynamic zzso zzso images were zzso compared with contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso scans in 17 patients with focal zzso zzso discovered on CT zzso In the first part, 108 patients zzso had an zzso pattern of contrast zzso 22 patients zzso a uniform pattern of high signal zzso and seven patients zzso a uniform pattern of low signal zzso Most patients had zzso enhancement of the zzso uniform enhancement occurred in some patients with underlying zzso or inflammatory zzso In the second part, all focal zzso seen on CT scans were seen on dynamic MR images (75 zzso significantly more than were seen on zzso images (15 zzso zzso zzso zzso
