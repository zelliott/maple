The zzso is believed to be associated with zzso zzso In this work, functional zzso was applied to investigate the network model of zzso function when 20 normal subjects received tactile stimulation over zzso zzso Data analysis was performed with zzso and Conn zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were consistently revealed for all stimulation areas, with the overlap located in area zzso The area zzso was then used as the seed to estimate the zzso zzso The right zzso left superior zzso zzso left superior zzso zzso and left inferior zzso zzso showed significant functional connectivity with the seed region for all stimulation zzso zzso maps of most stimulation conditions were mainly distributed in the bilateral zzso inferior zzso cortex, and secondary zzso zzso Post hoc zzso analysis and graph theoretical analysis showed that there were higher correlations between the left zzso and the right zzso left inferior zzso zzso and right zzso for all networks and that the global efficiency was more sensitive than the local efficiency to detect differences between notes in a zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso serves as a hub to functionally connect other regions in the detected network and may integrate information from these zzso
