zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso are central to the initiation and the regulation of immune processes in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso is a humanized zzso zzso approved for the treatment of zzso that acts by blocking expression of zzso zzso on the surface of zzso We determined the proportions of circulating DC zzso and analyzed expression of zzso expression in 6 zzso zzso patients treated with zzso for 1 zzso zzso expression levels on zzso and zzso decreased significantly during zzso In zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso with different doses of zzso in healthy controls zzso and zzso patients showed zzso zzso of zzso expression levels in both zzso patients and zzso and reduced functional ability to stimulate zzso zzso zzso The biological impact of zzso may in part be attributable to zzso of zzso of circulating zzso into the central nervous system, but also to functional impairment of interactions between T cells and zzso
