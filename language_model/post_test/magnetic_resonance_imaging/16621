zzso acute zzso zzso on brain magnetic resonance imaging have recently been described in spontaneous zzso zzso and may be important to understand zzso and guide zzso The underlying mechanisms are zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso are related to magnetic resonance imaging markers of the severity and type of zzso disease zzso zzso or cerebral zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We studied consecutive patients with zzso zzso from four specialist stroke zzso and zzso stroke service referrals without zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso were assessed on magnetic resonance imaging zzso months after zzso zzso using zzso zzso White matter changes and cerebral zzso were rated with validated zzso We investigated associations between zzso imaging zzso clinical and zzso zzso We included 114 patients with zzso zzso zzso with clinically probable cerebral zzso zzso and 47 zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso imaging zzso was zzso zzso in probable cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso in the remaining patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso imaging zzso were found in zzso zzso imaging zzso were mainly cortical and were associated with mean white matter change score zzso ratio zzso per unit increase, zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the presence of strictly zzso cerebral zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso are frequent but previously underestimated after zzso zzso and are three times more common in cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso than in other zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso are associated with white matter changes and cerebral zzso suggesting that they result from an zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso contribute to the overall burden of zzso brain damage in zzso zzso and may be a useful surrogate marker of ongoing zzso injury from zzso zzso
