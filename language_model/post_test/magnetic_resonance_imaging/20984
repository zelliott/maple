We examined resting state brain activity in the depressive phase of bipolar disorder zzso by measuring the zzso of zzso fluctuations zzso in the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Unlike functional zzso the zzso approach reflects local properties in specific regions and provides direct information about impaired zzso Groups of 26 patients with BD depression and 26 zzso zzso and zzso healthy subjects participated in zzso zzso We examined group differences in zzso findings as well as correlations between clinical zzso and zzso in the regions showing significant group zzso Our results showed that patients with BD depression had significantly increased zzso in the left zzso the right zzso nucleus, the zzso zzso the bilateral inferior frontal zzso and the zzso lobe of the zzso They also had decreased zzso in the left zzso zzso the left zzso zzso and the zzso zzso negative correlations were found between the Hamilton Depression zzso zzso score and zzso in the left insular zzso in the patient zzso These results support a model of BD that involves dysfunction in the zzso networks and associated zzso zzso We also demonstrated the feasibility of zzso as a technique to investigate persistent cerebral dysfunction in zzso
