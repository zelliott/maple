We performed zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in 9 patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso undergoing evaluation for possible zzso zzso Seven patients had unilateral and 2 had bilateral zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso investigation including zzso zzso zzso and PET with zzso zzso zzso is an irreversible inhibitor of zzso zzso type B zzso with a very high affinity for the zzso In the brain, zzso is zzso located in zzso and a previous in zzso study showed increased binding of the zzso in sclerotic zzso zzso acquired zzso distribution in PET images were analyzed zzso and the focus regions were assessed visually on the PET zzso In addition, the zzso rate and distribution volume of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso were measured in standardized zzso zzso regions by zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly increased in the zzso zzso zzso both apparently and zzso By calculating mean zzso ratios, we identified the zzso lobe containing the zzso focus in six unilateral zzso One case was ambiguous but was not falsely zzso The two bilateral cases were correctly identified as zzso Our results suggest that PET with zzso might be a useful method for identification of zzso zzso zzso
