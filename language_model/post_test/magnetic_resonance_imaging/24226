zzso tumors are rare and their prognosis is zzso Long term survival can be expected only after a surgical zzso the treatment of zzso The aim of this study is to report our single zzso experience and, by literature analysis, to define the role of surgery in the treatment of zzso zzso 

Between 1990 and 1998, 27 patients affected by zzso tumor were zzso Eight women and seven men zzso age 59 zzso underwent surgical zzso Thirteen patients zzso had zzso zzso (7 zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso combined with partial zzso zzso and 2 zzso + zzso with portal vein zzso Two patients zzso had zzso zzso zzso and surgical zzso 

One zzso death was recorded after a right zzso with portal vein zzso zzso zzso morbidity rate was zzso Patients were regularly followed up to date or to zzso Ten patients died and 5 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso survival rate after zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso The median survival was zzso zzso zzso zzso involvement did not show a statistically significant difference on median survival between the positive group and the negative group zzso vs zzso zzso nor did zzso invasion, because of the small number of zzso The zzso zzso 3- and zzso survival rate after isolated zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso Four out of 6 patients who underwent zzso zzso combined with partial zzso are still alive 1, 23, 29, 38 months after zzso zzso increased mortality zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and surgical drainage were successfully performed in 2 patients with satisfactory zzso 

zzso surgical treatment of zzso tumors can improve patients' zzso zzso zzso management has to be carried out by a multidisciplinary approach including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso lobe is often performed in order to obtain microscopic zzso margins and zzso zzso zzso zzso drainage and treatment of zzso is mandatory before surgery in order to improve surgical zzso zzso treatment is characterized by high technical difficulties and better results can be achieved by zzso surgical zzso
