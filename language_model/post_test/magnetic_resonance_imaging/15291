To investigate the zzso nature of features termed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of zzso affected by zzso arthritis zzso 

zzso patients scheduled for joint replacement surgery zzso or zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso on the day before zzso The presence and zzso of bone zzso and bone zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso were documented in each joint zzso zzso After surgery, sequential sections from throughout the whole joint were analyzed zzso for bone zzso changes, and these results were correlated with the zzso zzso 

zzso bone erosion was recorded based on bone zzso inflammation adjacent to a site of cortical bone zzso zzso was recorded based on either invading zzso tissue zzso formation of zzso zzso or increased zzso zzso bone zzso was replaced by inflammatory zzso increasing water content, which appears as bright signal enhancement on STIR zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso was recorded based on the finding of inflammatory zzso which were less dense than those of zzso bone zzso and localized more centrally in the zzso These zzso were either isolated or found in contact with zzso bone zzso 

zzso bone zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso are due to the formation of inflammatory infiltrates in the bone zzso of patients with zzso This emphasizes the value of zzso in sensitively detecting inflammatory tissue in the bone zzso and demonstrates that the inflammatory process extends to the bone zzso zzso which is an additional target structure for zzso zzso
