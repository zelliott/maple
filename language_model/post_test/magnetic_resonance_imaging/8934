The increasing number of mouse models of human disease used in biomedical research applications has led to an enhanced interest in zzso imaging of mice, zzso using zzso for zzso However, zzso of small zzso puts high demands on the sensitivity of data zzso This requirement can be addressed by using zzso zzso zzso detection zzso The aim of this work was to investigate the in zzso performance of a 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso probe zzso designed for zzso of the mouse zzso To characterize this novel probe, MR data sets were acquired with both the zzso and a matched conventional zzso surface zzso operating at room temperature zzso using conventional acquisition protocols zzso and spin zzso with identical zzso zzso zzso comparisons in phantom and in zzso experiments revealed gains in the zzso ratio zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The increased sensitivity of the zzso was invested to enhance the image quality of high resolution structural images acquired in scan times compatible with routine operation zzso 45 zzso In high resolution (30 zzso 30 zzso 300 zzso structural images of the mouse zzso anatomical details such as zzso cell and molecular layers could be zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso 60 zzso imaging of mouse cortical and zzso areas revealed anatomical structures smaller than 100 zzso Finally, zzso MR zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso 80 zzso of the brain zzso enabled the detailed reconstruction of zzso vessels zzso and middle cerebral zzso In conclusion, this low temperature detection device represents an attractive option to increase the performance of small animal MR systems operating at zzso zzso
