The snapshot zzso sequence uses a zzso scan time and a small flip angle in conjunction with zzso acquisition to produce zzso images with minimum motion zzso The zzso zzso towards an equilibrium state in the course of a scan and it is the form of this approach to equilibrium which determines the contrast and zzso ratio zzso zzso The contrast obtained is strongly dependent on the phase zzso scheme zzso If the flip angle is increased, and the resulting zzso zzso zzso then the zzso is improved while the contrast is little zzso
