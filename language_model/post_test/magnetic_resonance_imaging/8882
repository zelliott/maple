Prior research indicates that successful weight-loss zzso zzso work harder than people of normal weight to maintain their weight loss, including greater dietary restriction of fat and higher physical activity zzso However, little work to date has examined how zzso differ biologically from zzso zzso and obese zzso 

The objective was to compare the brain responses of zzso to food pictures with those of zzso and obese zzso 

Blood oxygen zzso responses to zzso and low-energy food pictures were measured in 18 zzso controls, 16 obese controls, and 17 zzso 

Group differences were identified in 4 regions, which indicated significant change in zzso in response to the food zzso zzso showed greater zzso in the left superior frontal region and right middle zzso region than did zzso and obese zzso pattern of results confirmed in exploratory zzso zzso zzso controls also showed greater zzso in a bilateral zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso show greater zzso in frontal regions and primary and secondary visual zzso pattern consistent with greater zzso control in response to food cues and greater visual attention to the food zzso A greater engagement of zzso control regions in response to food cues as well as a greater monitoring of foods may promote control of food intake and successful weight-loss zzso
