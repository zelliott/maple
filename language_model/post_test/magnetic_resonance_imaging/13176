White matter zzso zzso and brain zzso are often found on zzso in the zzso Shared vascular risk factors may be an explanation for their zzso However, disturbances of white matter integrity could also be involved in the zzso of brain zzso Our objective was to systematically review studies that investigated the relation between zzso and brain zzso on zzso and to investigate whether there is sufficient evidence to indicate that this relation is independent of shared risk zzso 

We searched zzso for studies published in English between 1980 and October 2007, combining search terms for zzso and brain zzso Articles that studied the relation between zzso and brain zzso were included if they met the following criteria: zzso original study, zzso zzso used for imaging, zzso assessment methods for zzso and brain zzso zzso and zzso a sample size of at least 20 zzso We recorded type and age of the study population, type and assessment of zzso and brain zzso and variables for which adjustments were made in the zzso 

We identified 48 studies that met our inclusion zzso A significant relation between zzso and brain zzso was found in 37 out of 48 zzso The source of the study population zzso clinic or population zzso did not affect this zzso However, only 10 studies adjusted for shared risk factors, of which 9 found an zzso 

The majority of studies found an association between zzso and brain zzso but it is not yet clear if this association is independent of shared risk zzso
