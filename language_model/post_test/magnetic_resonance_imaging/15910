To estimate a new technique for zzso regional lung motion using zzso in healthy volunteers and to apply the technique in patients with zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso lung motion during a whole breathing cycle was zzso in 30 healthy volunteers using zzso zzso zzso zzso low angle zzso zzso TRICKS zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso and quantitative zzso color maps and cumulative zzso were performed using an introduced semiautomatic zzso An analysis of lung motion was performed and correlated with an established zzso technique for zzso As a proof of concept, the technique was applied in five patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso and 5 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The correlation between zzso lung motion of the zzso lung parts and the zzso technique was significant zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Also, the zzso color maps zzso illustrated regional lung motion in all healthy zzso No differences were observed between both zzso which was verified by cumulative zzso The patients with zzso showed a local lack of lung motion in the area of the zzso In the patients with zzso there was global diminished motion of the tumor bearing zzso which improved significantly after chemotherapy zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using global zzso an improvement could also be shown zzso capacity zzso zzso zzso versus zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso but this improvement was not zzso 

A zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso lung zzso Local and global zzso zzso can be precisely located and might be a new tool used to zzso even slight changes in lung motion zzso in therapy monitoring, follow-up studies or even benign lung zzso
