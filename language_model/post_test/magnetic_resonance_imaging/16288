zzso zzso studies on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia have suggested regional brain zzso changes in the zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso However, less is known about the functional zzso of these areas during cognitive zzso In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging, a verbal working memory zzso task and zzso statistical techniques to investigate the functional zzso of temporally zzso neural networks during cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia zzso compared to healthy controls zzso Independent component analysis identified 18 independent components zzso among which two zzso were selected for further zzso These zzso included temporally zzso networks which were most highly associated with the delay period of the task in both healthy controls and patients with zzso zzso network abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia were detected within a zzso lateral zzso network, where increased functional connectivity was found in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso In addition, zzso functional zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with schizophrenia was detected within a zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso functional connectivity zzso in the left zzso prefrontal zzso and the right zzso zzso were positively correlated with accuracy during the zzso task, while the connectivity strength in the right zzso prefrontal zzso was zzso correlated with measures of symptom zzso These data suggest that within two temporally zzso network states, patients with schizophrenia exhibit increased and persistent zzso prefrontal and zzso connectivity during zzso zzso
