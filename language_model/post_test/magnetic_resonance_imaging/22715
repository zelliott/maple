Bone zzso cell transplantation has been proposed as a novel therapeutic option for patients with coronary artery zzso This study investigated whether zzso bone zzso zzso cell injection into the zzso zzso of patients with severe angina zzso could safely reduce zzso symptoms, improve zzso zzso and increase left zzso zzso zzso In a total of 20 patients zzso zzso 10 years old; 16 zzso with angina pectoris, zzso segments with zzso zzso as assessed by gated zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected with 30 to 100 million zzso zzso zzso symptoms, Canadian zzso Society class, and quality of life were assessed at 3 and 6 months of zzso At baseline and 3 months of zzso an exercise test, gated zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to assess exercise capacity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso bone zzso zzso cells was zzso The Canadian zzso Society class improved from zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso after 3 months zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after 6 months zzso zzso The zzso score improved from 52 zzso zzso to 71 zzso zzso at 3 months zzso zzso to 73 zzso zzso at 6 months zzso zzso The exercise capacity increased from 79 zzso zzso to 84 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed an increased zzso ejection fraction from 51 zzso zzso to 54 zzso zzso zzso zzso and a reduced zzso zzso volume from 97 zzso 50 to 88 zzso 42 zzso zzso zzso The wall motion score index improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of segments with zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso bone zzso zzso cell injection in patients with zzso is safe, reduces zzso symptoms, improves zzso zzso and increases zzso zzso
