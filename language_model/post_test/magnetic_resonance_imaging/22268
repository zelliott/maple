Because short-term limb zzso produces selective adaptations in the zzso system that probably interact with the zzso expression of muscle fatigue, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of limb zzso on the ability of human subjects to sustain zzso zzso at low and moderate zzso zzso Four weeks of elbow joint zzso caused a substantial decrease in the daily activity of biceps zzso during zzso a significant reduction in the zzso area and volume of the elbow zzso muscles as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and a decline in the maximum voluntary contraction zzso zzso and force of the elbow zzso zzso zzso had a zzso effect on muscle fatigue with a substantially increased endurance time zzso zzso at a low force zzso zzso and no statistical effect at a moderate force zzso zzso Despite zzso of the elbow zzso muscles due to the zzso the zzso force zzso in biceps zzso by electrical stimulation was greater after zzso The selective improvement of fatigue resistance for the zzso contraction and the absence of a change in the time course of the zzso suggests that the zzso adaptations included an improved efficacy of some zzso processes and underscored the major role of these mechanisms in determining the endurance time for zzso zzso zzso
