In the present study we measured brain zzso with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during the execution of a covert semantic categorization zzso This involves zzso of working memory and internal concept zzso Previous brain imaging studies of covert verbal zzso have shown widespread zzso in the frontal and zzso zzso and anterior zzso However, most of these studies have employed simple stimulus tasks with repetition of words zzso beginning with a certain letter of the zzso Moreover, the subject is typically cued zzso visually or zzso every zzso zzso In the present study we used a zzso instruction at the beginning of each zzso period where the subject was instructed to internally generate category specific names related to: zzso in the zzso zzso Soccer zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso The three zzso periods were compared to three baseline periods in which the subject was instructed to imagine mentally zzso on a beach and looking at the zzso zzso zzso was performed with a zzso zzso Vision zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning of anatomy was done, and thereafter, serial imaging with 60 zzso sensitive echo zzso whole brain zzso were done during the active and passive zzso Main zzso areas were found in the left middle frontal zzso partially overlapping with zzso area zzso This is in agreement with previous studies of increased zzso in the left frontal zzso and may indicate a left frontal neural network for zzso the mental zzso
