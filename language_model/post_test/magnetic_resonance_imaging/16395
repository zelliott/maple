To zzso the zzso relationships of the upper cervical zzso 

To our knowledge, few reports have described the zzso relationships of the upper cervical spine in patients with general age-related cervical zzso 

We performed zzso magnetic resonance imaging for 295 consecutive patients experiencing neck pain without zzso zzso zzso with zzso arthritis, traumatic history, and severe degenerative changes in the upper cervical spine were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso angle in 3 different postures were measured, and the variations in each value between zzso and neutral zzso neutral and extension zzso and zzso and extension zzso were zzso The subjects were classified into 3 groups according to the space available for the zzso values zzso zzso zzso B: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significantly increased from extension to zzso posture, however, no significant differences were observed in every posture among the zzso zzso variation in zzso showed no significant differences among the zzso however, zzso variation between Groups A and C and between Groups B and C and zzso variation between Groups A and C showed significant zzso The zzso angle significantly increased from zzso to extension posture, however, no significant differences were observed in every posture among the zzso zzso variations among the groups showed no significant differences, except for zzso angle variation between Groups B and zzso None of the variations in zzso and the zzso angle were significantly zzso 

Our results suggest that only the zzso of the zzso movement, especially the zzso movement, was greatly affected by the narrowing of space available for the zzso The central zzso joint may be closely related to the mechanisms for protecting the spinal zzso by restriction of the zzso zzso
