The outcome of children and adolescents with Ewing zzso is impacted by many zzso factors and often measured by estimates of: zzso zzso zzso or overall zzso However, the preferred assessment following radiation therapy is local zzso 

A review of large group experiences over the past several decades was undertaken to assess the optimal radiation dose and volume for patients with zzso zzso Ewing zzso New approaches and techniques to improve local control were also zzso 

With multidisciplinary therapy, zzso overall local control rates range from 58 to zzso Following definitive zzso they are zzso zzso radiation therapy doses are zzso zzso In the zzso setting, gross disease requires zzso zzso microscopic disease requires 45 zzso zzso zzso schemes have not improved local zzso The appropriate zzso volume is an involved field to the zzso tumor volume plus zzso zzso margin, followed by a boost to the zzso chemotherapy tumor volume with zzso Good radiation quality control with central review improves local zzso Use of an involved radiation field requires accuracy in defining tumor zzso zzso to improve local control include zzso multidisciplinary therapy, zzso boost radiation, and high radiation doses as delivered by zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated and zzso beam zzso may offer an advantage at special zzso 

Innovative uses of radiation in the multidisciplinary setting will continue to provide excellent local control, improved function, and quality of life for young patients with localized Ewing zzso of zzso
