The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various zzso zzso parameters of the magnetic resonance zzso examination of the zzso compared to conventional coronary zzso 

Twenty patients with suspicion of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary zzso were examined by MR imaging within 14 days before or after coronary zzso A zzso examination during zzso application zzso zzso and at rest was performed using a zzso recovery zzso zzso The zzso parameters maximum signal intensity zzso zzso zzso area under the curve zzso and zzso zzso were determined using dedicated software zzso Signal zzso zzso zzso Medical zzso for the evaluation of the zzso zzso In addition, the ratio of these parameters zzso zzso zzso reserve zzso were determined by dividing the values of the stress examination by the values of the rest zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the evaluation of the stress zzso zzso for the zzso of the zzso parameters was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso und zzso zzso 

A combined zzso evaluation of the zzso values using the ratio of the zzso values of the stress and rest examination was shown to be the most accurate zzso zzso zzso is superior to an evaluation of the stress examination zzso
