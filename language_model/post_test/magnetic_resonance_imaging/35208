This article describes a method for reducing the acquisition time in three-dimensional zzso zzso electron zzso resonance zzso zzso To zzso zzso spin zzso which have a short lifetime in living organisms, the acquisition time for a data set of spectral projections should be shorter than the lifetime of the spin zzso To decrease the total time required for data zzso the duration of magnetic field scanning was reduced to zzso Moreover, the number of projections was decreased by using the concept of a uniform zzso To demonstrate this faster data zzso two kinds of zzso zzso with different zzso rates were measured in zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso in mouse head was successfully carried zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso spin zzso with a zzso of a few minutes was achieved for the first time in live zzso
