zzso zzso registered in water zzso zzso gel zzso were used to measure the output factors and zzso profiles of the zzso zzso beams employed for zzso zzso zzso zzso were also performed using a zzso silicon zzso commonly employed for zzso zzso the zzso zzso chamber, and zzso zzso films, for reasons of zzso zzso gel results of this work for the output factors of the 5, zzso and 10 zzso diameter beams are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gel and zzso zzso shows that the latter overestimate output factors of the two small beams zzso for the 5 zzso beam and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso This is attributed to the zzso zzso of the high atomic number silicon material of the zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso chamber is found to underestimate output factors up to zzso for the 5 zzso beam due to volume averaging zzso zzso gel and zzso film output factor results are found in close agreement for all beam sizes, emphasizing the importance of water zzso and fine detector sensitive volume for small field zzso Relative zzso profile results are in good agreement for all zzso used in this work, with noticeable differences observed only in the zzso estimate of the zzso zzso zzso which is relatively zzso
