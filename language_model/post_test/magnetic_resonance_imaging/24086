The zzso exchange zzso of zzso were studied in 49 zzso and benign zzso zzso Signal enhancement was monitored simultaneously in the zzso and in tumor for zzso minutes after the beginning of a 1 minute zzso infusion of the contrast medium zzso zzso analysis was based on a model with two compartments for systemic zzso and up to three zzso distinct compartments for zzso zzso zzso zzso two or more compartments with different exchange rate zzso in a given zzso was found in zzso of zzso 38% of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso average of CM exchange rates was zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The area under the signal zzso curve of the zzso varied zzso between zzso It is concluded that individual CM zzso in zzso blood should be taken into account when CM exchange rates between blood and tumor are to be determined and that a kinetic model for potentially zzso tumors should allow for kinetic zzso
