The aims of the present study were as zzso zzso to perform the first zzso zzso in live rats with focal zzso zzso and zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso from the brain in this model is quantifiable in individual animals by zzso zzso zzso substitution zzso zzso preloaded with dietary zzso zzso in zzso + zzso replacement ratios of zzso in the zzso were subjected to permanent zzso of the middle cerebral artery, and zzso zzso was implemented with zzso zzso resolution using a dedicated zzso zzso and a spiral zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso core was localized by apparent diffusion zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and by changes in surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined independently in the zzso samples by zzso flame zzso Both techniques were generally in agreement in the zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso + zzso drop in zzso brain was less pronounced zzso zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus 10 zzso 1 zzso by flame zzso p zzso zzso The use of higher field zzso for better spatial resolution, and hence more accurate zzso is zzso
