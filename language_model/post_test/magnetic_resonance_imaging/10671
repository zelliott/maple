Recently, zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso have been reported to cause zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of zzso zzso among zzso dominant zzso Parkinson's disease zzso 

We screened 113 zzso zzso and 200 sporadic zzso cases by quantitative zzso chain reaction and confirmed zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and comparative zzso zzso zzso 

Two families zzso patients from Family A and one from Family zzso with zzso zzso were identified among zzso zzso Even though they had the same zzso duplication, one patient had zzso Because there was exactly the same difference between the regions originated from each patient, the finding suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso may be also influenced by the range of zzso zzso We also detected zzso carriers in the families of both zzso Interestingly, the zzso ratio was zzso zzso in one zzso indicating that the ratio was very much lower than zzso 

These two newly identified Japanese patients with zzso zzso and the five previously identified American and European families with zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso may be more frequent than previously zzso
