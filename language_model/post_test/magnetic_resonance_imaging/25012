Conventional methods such as duplex ultrasound scanning do not provide accurate information about zzso extension of pelvic vein zzso We evaluated zzso extent of zzso toward pelvic veins with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with suspected deep vein zzso zzso zzso to the zzso ligament on the basis of duplex ultrasound zzso In addition, frequency of pulmonary embolism zzso and early (4 weeks) clinical outcome were zzso 

Two hundred twelve patients with acute symptomatic zzso zzso to the zzso zzso diagnosed at duplex ultrasound zzso were enrolled in this prospective zzso All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the abdominal and pelvic zzso as well as lung zzso to detect the presence of pulmonary zzso 

In 24 of 212 patients zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso zzso The zzso extended into zzso veins in 142 patients zzso and into the inferior zzso zzso in 46 patients zzso The frequency of zzso was not associated with the most zzso extension of zzso zzso zzso No patients died as a consequence of zzso zzso 

Extension of zzso into the inferior zzso zzso occurs relatively zzso In our patients this finding was not associated with higher risk for zzso compared with zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso
