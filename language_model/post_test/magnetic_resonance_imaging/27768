To assess the growth characteristics of small- to zzso zzso zzso in patients undergoing watch, wait, and zzso zzso 

zzso study using zzso collected size and tumor zzso zzso 

zzso referral center for zzso base zzso 

Three hundred zzso patients with sporadic unilateral zzso zzso and 2 or more magnetic resonance scans were zzso Linear zzso were used to assess tumor zzso The point of growth and pattern of growth progression were zzso zzso influencing growth were zzso 

zzso zzso of tumors demonstrated significant zzso Mean size at presentation was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For growing tumors, mean size at final review was zzso zzso zzso zzso This was a statistically significant increase in size zzso zzso zzso Mean annual change in size for growing tumors was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of growing tumors showed zzso zzso first growth within 18 months of zzso zzso zzso of tumors showed zzso zzso first growth after 5 years of zzso There were no demographic or zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso growth is usually slow and is most likely to occur within the first 3 years of zzso Growth may occur after five years of zzso A protocol for the scanning of patients is suggested based on the findings of the zzso
