Within the zzso zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso are frequently targeted by researchers and clinicians for zzso analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, different data acquisition techniques, analysis software and anatomical boundaries have in the past made it difficult to compare results of zzso studies from different zzso In order to reduce these differences, a zzso protocol was established with 40 healthy normal control subjects recently scanned in our zzso Data acquisition was performed with a three-dimensional zzso echo technique, and scans were corrected for zzso and registered into standard zzso space prior to zzso zzso analysis was performed manually using three-dimensional software that allows simultaneous analysis of zzso zzso and horizontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded correlation zzso comparable with other zzso The zzso volume was larger in the right zzso zzso versus zzso zzso while no zzso differences for the zzso zzso versus zzso zzso could be zzso Most importantly, results from recent zzso protocols for zzso and zzso seem to approach each other with regard to mean volumes and zzso zzso This indicates that the advances in scanning technique, volume preparation and zzso protocols allow a more precise definition of zzso zzso lobe structures with zzso and that results for mean volumes for zzso and zzso from different laboratories will eventually become zzso
