There is no validated zzso marker for zzso brain zzso We sought to test whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso metrics would reliably change during the early zzso period in a manner consistent with zzso and whether they would correlate with relevant clinical zzso 

zzso zzso studies from patients in the zzso Imaging zzso zzso Trial with initial zzso imaging zzso zzso volume zzso zzso were zzso Two independent readers outlined the zzso and lateral zzso on the involved side and calculated respective volumes at baseline and days 3 to zzso We assessed zzso agreement, volume change between scans, and the association of volume change with early zzso deterioration (National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score worsening of zzso 4 points), a zzso modified Rankin scale zzso score of 0 to 4, and zzso 

Of 12 patients who met study criteria, average baseline and follow-up zzso zzso size was 138 zzso and 234 zzso zzso The mean time to follow-up zzso was 62 zzso zzso correlation zzso between readers were zzso for both zzso and zzso volume zzso Mean percent zzso volume increase was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean percent zzso volume decrease was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth predicted early zzso deterioration zzso under the curve zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 0 to 4 zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In this exploratory analysis of severe zzso stroke patients, statistically significant changes in zzso and zzso volumes within the first week are consistent with expected changes of cerebral zzso zzso analysis of zzso growth appears to be a suitable zzso for zzso zzso
