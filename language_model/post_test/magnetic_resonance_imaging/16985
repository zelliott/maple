To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of various magnetic resonance imaging zzso features in zzso zzso zzso fractures caused by zzso zzso and zzso 

35 men and 45 women aged 40 to 78 zzso zzso years underwent zzso to assess the underlying pathology of already diagnosed zzso zzso fractures zzso The zzso from presentation to imaging ranged from 7 to 95 zzso zzso zzso zzso features of each zzso zzso fracture were zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for each of the zzso features were zzso Association between each zzso feature and various underlying zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso fractures was zzso 

Regarding these 80 patients, the zzso diagnosis was correct in 78 and zzso in 2 with zzso zzso features suggestive of zzso fractures were a convex zzso border of the zzso body, zzso involvement, zzso neural element involvement, an zzso mass, a zzso mass, and other spinal zzso zzso features suggestive of zzso fractures were zzso low signal intensity band, spared normal zzso signal intensity, and the fluid zzso zzso features suggestive of zzso fractures were zzso zzso involvement, end plate zzso disc involvement, and zzso and zzso zzso 

Combination of several zzso features can provide clues to differentiate between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
