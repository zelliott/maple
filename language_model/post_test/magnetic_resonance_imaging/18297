The purpose of this study was to zzso assess the reliability of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the diagnosis of acute and zzso zzso zzso dissection and associated clinical zzso 67 patients were subjected to zzso the diagnostic results were compared with zzso zzso 25 patients had type A, 12 patients type B zzso In 30 cases a dissection was zzso 17 patients with zzso dissection had acute onset of symptoms, 10 patients had zzso onset of zzso 17 patients revealed zzso of the false zzso which was found in the descending zzso in 59% of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was most often associated with type A dissection zzso zzso Three patients were studied while on mechanical zzso zzso time for zzso ranged from 15 to 71 minutes with an average of 46 zzso 18 zzso In this series no deleterious events were encountered related to zzso zzso In contrast to previously published data using other zzso techniques the sensitivity of zzso was zzso for detecting a dissection in the ascending segment of the zzso zzso Moreover, the specificity of zzso for a dissection was zzso and thus higher than previously published data using zzso zzso zzso and specificity for detection and correct zzso of type B dissection was zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso In addition, zzso proved to be sensitive in detecting the formation of zzso material in the false zzso of the ascending zzso zzso the zzso arch zzso and the descending segment zzso zzso for exclusion of suspected zzso material even proved to be slightly higher with zzso in the ascending and descending zzso and zzso in the zzso arch zzso zzso The site of entry to a dissection was detected in zzso with a sensitivity of zzso in the ascending and zzso in the descending zzso The involvement of side branches in the zzso process was identified in zzso There were no false positive findings concerning side branch zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in zzso and zzso respectively zzso 1 and zzso zzso performed even in acute cases proved to be a zzso safe and highly sensitive method to identify and zzso acute and zzso zzso of the entire zzso zzso Limited patient access was not associated with an increased risk and mechanical ventilation did not interfere with zzso These results may establish zzso as a valid and promising zzso technique to establish the diagnosis in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
