We aimed to test the hypothesis that the zzso form of zzso oxide zzso zzso contributes to the development of an early zzso retinal zzso response in zzso models of diabetic zzso In zzso zzso Sprague zzso rats or zzso mice, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to zzso measure the change in retinal oxygen tension zzso zzso during a zzso zzso In the rat experiments, the retinal Delta zzso of the following groups were zzso control rats zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetic rats zzso zzso zzso and zzso diabetic rats treated orally with zzso zzso zzso a zzso of an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the retinal Delta zzso of the following mouse groups were zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso 10), zzso diabetic mice zzso zzso zzso and zzso diabetic knockout mice zzso zzso zzso Only the Delta zzso of the superior zzso of the diabetic rat and mice groups were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso The superior Delta zzso of the diabetic rats treated with the zzso was not significantly zzso zzso zzso different from their respective normal zzso In the mice experiments, the superior retinal Delta zzso of the zzso zzso mice was not statistically different zzso zzso zzso from that of normal control zzso zzso is required for the development of an early zzso Delta zzso in experimental diabetic zzso
