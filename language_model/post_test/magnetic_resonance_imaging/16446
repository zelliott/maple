To determine whether zzso very low birth weight zzso or term born small for zzso age zzso adolescents have reduced regional brain zzso We also asked which zzso factors are related to reduced brain volume in zzso zzso which regional brain volumes are associated with cognitive and zzso zzso and if these differ between the zzso 

Fifty adolescent zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and 49 term zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso were compared with 57 zzso term zzso An automated zzso zzso technique was zzso zzso and zzso functions were evaluated by zzso and Visual Motor zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso group had reduced volumes for zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso The zzso group had smaller total zzso and zzso smaller regional brain zzso zzso white matter in the zzso zzso in the zzso and cerebral cortical in the control group were volumes that significantly predicted cognitive and zzso zzso 

We speculate that white matter injury may explain the impaired cognitive and zzso functioning in the prematurely born, whereas zzso injury may be related to cognitive dysfunction in term zzso zzso
