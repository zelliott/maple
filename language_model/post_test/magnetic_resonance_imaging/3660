Patients with frontal lobe syndrome can exhibit two types of abnormal zzso when asked to place a banana and an orange in a single zzso some patients categorize them at a concrete level zzso zzso have zzso while others continue to look for differences between these objects zzso zzso is yellow, the other is zzso These observations raise the question of whether abstraction and similarity detection are distinct processes involved in abstract zzso and that depend on separate areas of the prefrontal zzso zzso We designed an original experimental paradigm for a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study involving healthy subjects, confirming the existence of two distinct processes relying on different prefrontal areas, and thus explaining the zzso zzso in frontal zzso zzso We showed that: 1) zzso detection involves the anterior zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso the right anterior zzso zzso is only engaged in detecting physical zzso 2) zzso per zzso activates the left zzso zzso
