Although the lateral segment zzso from the zzso of a deceased donor or a live donor can increase the organ pool of pediatric patients awaiting liver zzso the shortage of organ donation in Asia countries is still serious and results in high death rates of pediatric zzso The zzso segment zzso of the liver is sacrificed during the standard technique of splitting a whole liver into an zzso and an extended right liver because the cutting sites of portal zzso zzso artery and zzso duct are all in the zzso of the liver zzso to have adequate length of vascular and zzso zzso for easier zzso However, the surgical techniques of vascular and zzso reconstructions for liver zzso particularly from the experiences of living donor liver zzso have been much improved in the last zzso Therefore it may be possible for an additional zzso of the liver to be an isolated graft for a small recipient on the premise that zzso of right lobe zzso and zzso are minimally zzso In light of detailed reviews of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso portal veins and zzso zzso the dissection and reconstruction of vessels and zzso ducts for the zzso can possibly be performed if the zzso length of the artery to the zzso is long zzso As the artery for the zzso middle zzso artery zzso usually derives from a branch of the left zzso artery and often in the liver zzso the length is usually too short to be zzso If the zzso for the zzso is isolated and its zzso length is more than zzso triple liver zzso from a deceased whole liver, consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso may be zzso The zzso of the zzso artery in abdominal zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso for live liver donors in our institution were zzso zzso The results showed that three types of zzso zzso zzso could be considered for possible recovery of triple segments: type I is an accessory left gastric artery to feed the lateral zzso type II is an isolated zzso type III is an early zzso of the left zzso artery and zzso
