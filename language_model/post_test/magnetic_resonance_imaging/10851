We used zzso zzso zzso studies to zzso examine the relationship between zzso and zzso metabolism in the zzso white matter zzso acutely after traumatic brain injury zzso The objective was to determine the nature, extent, and degree of zzso abnormalities in zzso brain regions remote from zzso zzso 

Sixteen normal volunteers and 10 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso score, zzso age, zzso zzso 6 with focal and 4 with diffuse zzso were zzso Each subject underwent dynamic zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus a magnetic resonance imaging scan acutely after zzso zzso images of the zzso rate of oxygen and zzso rate of zzso were generated, and a zzso zzso zzso ratio was zzso Data from gray matter and zzso remote from zzso zzso plus whole brain, were zzso 

There was a significant reduction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio after zzso compared with normal values zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas the mean cortical gray matter and zzso values remained zzso zzso zzso changes, which were diffuse throughout the zzso were characterized by a reduction in the zzso rate of oxygen without a zzso drop in the zzso rate of zzso 

The extent and degree of zzso zzso zzso abnormalities after moderate and severe zzso suggest that diffuse zzso injury is a general phenomenon after such zzso This pervasive finding may indicate that the concept of focal traumatic injury, although valid from a zzso zzso imaging standpoint, may be misleading when considering zzso zzso associated with zzso
