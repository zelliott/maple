zzso has zzso and zzso activities in zzso and in an animal model of multiple sclerosis zzso We have previously reported that zzso decreased zzso activity over six months in a small trial of patients with active zzso zzso zzso Here we report the impact of oral zzso on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso outcomes and serum immune molecules in this cohort over 24 months of zzso zzso zzso Despite a moderately high zzso annualized zzso rate zzso zzso zzso during a three-month baseline zzso prior to treatment, no relapses occurred between months 6 and zzso Also, despite very active zzso activity zzso zzso scans had zzso activity during a three-month zzso the only patient with zzso zzso on zzso at 12 and 24 months was on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which at high levels might antagonize the zzso zzso zzso were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso was decreased by zzso Thus, clinical and zzso outcomes are supported by systemic zzso changes and call for further investigation of zzso in zzso
