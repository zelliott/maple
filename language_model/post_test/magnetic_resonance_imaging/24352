Dynamic zzso zzso zzso is a functional zzso method where zzso zzso MR images are acquired zzso after zzso injection of a contrast zzso The data can be interpreted in terms of zzso tissue characteristics by applying the principles of zzso zzso In the brain, zzso enables measurement of cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso zzso barrier zzso zzso area product zzso and the volume of the zzso zzso zzso These parameters can be combined to form others such as the zzso constant zzso , the extraction fraction E and the zzso mean transit times through the zzso and zzso zzso A first generation of zzso models for zzso was developed in the early 1990s and has become a standard in many zzso zzso improvements in zzso data quality have driven the development of a second generation of more complex zzso They are increasingly used, but it is not always clear how they relate to the models of the first generation or to the zzso zzso methods for zzso with intact zzso This lack of understanding is leading to increasing confusion on when to use which model and how to interpret the zzso The purpose of this review is to clarify the relation between models of the first and second generations and between zzso and zzso zzso All quantities are defined using a generic zzso to ensure the zzso possible scope and to reveal the link between applications in the brain and in other zzso
