When two zzso colors alternate at zzso of 25 zzso or higher, observers perceive only one fused zzso zzso flicker beyond the fusion frequency zzso flicker adaptation in human observers and stimulates monkey zzso zzso Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to show that many human visual cortical areas, with the exception of zzso can distinguish between fused chromatic flicker and its matched zzso zzso This result supports the existence of significant zzso zzso filtering of zzso chromatic zzso The result also suggests that a considerable difference in cortical zzso in many visual cortical areas does not necessarily lead to different conscious zzso
