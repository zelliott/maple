This study sought to 1) compare the distribution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso contrast agents in zzso zzso zzso and 2) investigate the effect of injury severity on these distribution zzso 

zzso distribution of low and high molecular weight contrast agents depends on vascular zzso zzso transport within the zzso and accessibility of the zzso compartment zzso zzso 

To vary the severity of zzso injury, 72 rats were subjected to 20, 30, 45 or 75 zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso of coronary artery zzso After 2 h of zzso the animals received either zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24), zzso zzso zzso 24) or saline zzso group, zzso zzso zzso Three minutes after injection, the hearts were excised and zzso zzso imaging zzso repetition time 300 zzso echo time 8 zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso for zzso detection and zzso 

zzso and MR zzso size zzso as percent of slice zzso correlated well: r zzso zzso for zzso r zzso zzso for zzso On zzso images, zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso The ratio of signal intensity of zzso normal zzso increased with increasing duration of zzso zzso p zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicating an increase in the distribution volume of zzso in zzso zzso On zzso images, zzso zzso consisted of a bright border zone and a less enhanced central zzso The extent of the core increased with increasing duration of zzso zzso p value zzso zzso zzso 

At 2 h of zzso the distribution of MR contrast agents in zzso zzso is 1) specific for zzso and zzso agents, and 2) modulated by the duration of zzso
