Patients with zzso or progressive low grade zzso survive for a decade or more following diagnosis, and may be at a higher risk for zzso zzso such as cognitive impairment from zzso 

The aim of the present study was to determine in patients with progressive or zzso low grade zzso the response rate and toxicity incurred by a continued schedule of zzso chemotherapy administered before radiation therapy, and to explore correlations between response and survival with zzso deletions and zzso promoter zzso zzso 

Progressive radio and chemotherapy zzso low grade zzso patients with zzso zzso promoter status evaluation were considered zzso zzso cycles consisted of zzso 75 zzso for 21 days every 28 days for 12 zzso 

A total of 30 patients zzso age 45 zzso zzso zzso with a median zzso of 90 zzso zzso were zzso The overall response rate was zzso (9 partial zzso 17 patients zzso had disease zzso 

The prolonged zzso schedule considered in the present study is followed by a high response zzso toxicity is zzso Further zzso trials should therefore be conducted to confirm the efficacy of this regimen as zzso therapy in patients with progressive low grade zzso
