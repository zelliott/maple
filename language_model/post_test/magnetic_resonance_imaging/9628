zzso nerve zzso are more common in patients with cervical zzso zzso and a zzso zzso along an zzso might zzso that nerve to injury at zzso zzso To evaluate this hypothesis, the frequency of median nerve zzso at the wrist and the frequency of zzso nerve zzso at the elbow were investigated in 80 patients with zzso zzso 

The symptomatic and zzso zzso were compared for the zzso parameters of zzso and median nerve zzso zzso The patients were divided into three diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso nerve zzso studies were compared between symptomatic and zzso zzso in each zzso 

zzso the median and zzso nerves are mainly derived from zzso roots, we did not observe an increased frequency of zzso nerve involvement at the elbow zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso while increased median nerve involvement was present at the wrist zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso data and the frequency of zzso and median nerve zzso did not support an zzso association between zzso and zzso zzso 

the association between zzso and peripheral zzso is zzso rather than zzso
