Core needle biopsy has proven advantages for wire zzso and zzso however, zzso core biopsy has been limited by less satisfactory sampling efficiency and less availability of zzso biopsy zzso We evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic yield of zzso biopsy using zzso stainless steel core biopsy needles and zzso zzso zzso in a closed zzso zzso 

Thirty-five consecutive breast zzso performed in 29 women between March 2001 and August 2002 were zzso zzso For each zzso an zzso sheath was placed under zzso guidance using a dedicated breast zzso and biopsy guidance zzso With the patient out of the zzso a zzso steel core biopsy needle was used to obtain multiple zzso zzso zzso including size, zzso and enhancement, were zzso zzso of all the zzso was zzso and zzso imaging, or clinical follow-up was zzso 

zzso masses and enhancing zzso ranged from 3 to 17 zzso Regional enhancement ranged from 14 to 70 zzso Thirty-four of the 35 zzso were technically zzso zzso revealed zzso in eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in five zzso zzso and benign entities in 21 zzso zzso Surgery confirmed all eight core zzso with zzso zzso Two of five zzso with zzso zzso zzso were upgraded to zzso after zzso 

This new method of zzso breast biopsy with a zzso stainless steel core biopsy needle and a closed zzso zzso scanner is zzso safe, and effective and produces satisfactory diagnostic zzso This method offers an alternative to zzso wire zzso and to zzso core biopsy with zzso zzso
