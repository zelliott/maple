The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of filling zzso zzso zzso in magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso we assessed zzso examinations of 45 patients with zzso zzso dysfunction (21 men, 24 zzso mean age 35 years, age range zzso zzso The zzso was performed 30 zzso after intramuscular injection of 20 zzso zzso using heavily zzso zzso techniques zzso thick zzso zzso zzso maximum intensity projection zzso zzso with fat zzso The images were reviewed by two observers to determine the presence of filling defects and zzso of zzso system and zzso The filling defects were classified into central, eccentric and zzso Clinical course and plain films were reviewed to determine significance of the detected filling zzso True filling defects were observed in 5 patients zzso and all due to stones seen on the plain zzso of the zzso Filling defects zzso zzso were seen in 23 patients zzso 17 zzso system, 17 upper third of zzso 7 mid zzso and 1 zzso zzso No stones were seen on the plain zzso of these patients and they had a zzso clinical course for over 24 zzso The true filling defects were large in size, eccentric in position and seen in more than one sequence of the zzso examination zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Four zzso of the patients with true defects and 21 zzso of those with zzso had zzso of the zzso system and zzso The zzso were small in size, centrally placed zzso and always seen in zzso images, rarely in slab images (2 zzso and not seen in zzso zzso zzso filling defects can be seen in zzso zzso The cause of the zzso is not fully explained and could be secondary to turbulent and fast flow of the zzso Some of the zzso seen in the zzso could be due to the tips of the zzso Awareness of such defects zzso zzso and prevents unnecessary further investigations or zzso
