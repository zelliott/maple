To accurately characterize the zzso and zzso activity of zzso we studied cerebral blood flow and metabolism using zzso zzso zzso zzso in five patients with this zzso Regional cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso oxygen extraction fraction zzso and cerebral zzso rates of oxygen zzso and of zzso zzso were zzso measured in tumor zzso and the zzso gray matter, zzso was analyzed based on both kinetic and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were lower than in the zzso gray matter in all preoperatively examined zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso and zzso was consistently reduced in the tumor zzso zzso zzso gray matter, determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than the gray matter zzso in both kinetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso zzso but was lower than the gray matter value in all zzso zzso tumor zzso which ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso was also reduced in all tumors but one; the remaining zzso which had a relatively high value of zzso zzso zzso to gray matter zzso infiltrated the zzso zzso through the corpus zzso and was characterized by high cellular zzso In one patient who suffered from tumor recurrence 8 years and 10 months after initial treatment, zzso constant zzso and kinetic zzso of the recurring tumor were higher than those of the original zzso No other tumors have zzso or recurred during the zzso follow-up zzso which ranged from 22 to 130 months zzso zzso 101 zzso Circulation and metabolism measured by PET provide in zzso biological zzso including zzso activity, in zzso
