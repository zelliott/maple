zzso minimally invasive zzso zzso techniques are playing an increasing role in the treatment of adult degenerative zzso However, there is a paucity of data in determining the ideal candidate for a lateral versus a traditional approach, and versus a hybrid zzso The objective of this study is to present a method for utilizing the lateral minimally invasive surgery zzso approach for adult spinal zzso provide clinical outcomes to validate our experience, and determine the limitations of lateral zzso for adult degenerative zzso zzso 

zzso and clinical data were collected for patients who underwent surgical correction of adult degenerative zzso between 2007 and zzso Patients were zzso classified by degree of zzso based on zzso Cobb angle, central zzso vertical line zzso pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vertical axis zzso pelvic tilt zzso presence of zzso bone quality, and curve zzso Patients were placed into 1 of 3 groups according to the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Clinical outcomes were determined by a visual analog scale zzso and the zzso zzso Index zzso 

Of 256 patients with adult degenerative zzso 174 underwent a zzso of the lateral zzso Of these 174 patients, 27 fit the strict zzso criteria zzso zzso 9 in each of the 3 zzso Surgery in 17 patients was dictated by their category, and 10 were treated with surgery outside of their zzso The average age was 61 years old and the mean follow-up duration was 17 zzso The green and yellow groups experienced a reduction in zzso Cobb angle zzso and zzso respectively), and slight changes in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso In the green group, the zzso and zzso improved by 35 and 17 points, respectively, while in the yellow group they improved by 36 and 33 points, zzso The red zzso showed a zzso decrease in zzso Cobb angle, zzso increase in zzso and slight changes in zzso and zzso Three patients placed in the yellow zzso had zzso surgery, and experienced a zzso Cobb angle and zzso decrease by zzso and zzso respectively, and an zzso and zzso increase by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Seven patients placed in the red group who underwent zzso or zzso surgery had a reduction in zzso Cobb angle of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of 28 points, and zzso of 12 points; zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso complications included 1 wound infection, transient zzso thigh zzso in 2 cases, and transient groin pain in 1 zzso 

zzso patient selection is important for the application of lateral minimally invasive techniques for adult degenerative zzso zzso lateral zzso fusion with or without zzso is suitable for patients with preserved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with pelvic zzso may be addressed with advanced derivatives of the lateral approach, such as releasing the anterior zzso zzso For patients with severe zzso the lateral approach may be used for anterior column support and to augment zzso
