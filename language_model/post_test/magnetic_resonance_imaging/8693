The application of functional imaging to study visceral sensation has generated considerable interest regarding insight into the function of the zzso zzso Brain zzso in normal control subjects during visceral sensation includes the zzso zzso cortex, which is involved in affective processing and has direct connections to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso pain rarely activates the zzso zzso This difference in brain zzso is highly zzso because visceral stimuli are experienced as more unpleasant than zzso zzso Clinical studies are suggestive of functional changes that may be a consequence or cause of conditions such as irritable zzso syndrome, but the findings are not consistent and are not as obviously zzso as the differences observed when contrasting visceral and zzso zzso Although this is partly because brain imaging is still a relatively new technique, it also reflects weaknesses inherent to the understanding of chronic visceral pain as a zzso zzso The zzso concept is very broad and rarely provides for precise predictions or mechanisms that can be directly tested using brain zzso Future use of brain imaging to examine chronic visceral pain and other pain disorders will be more likely to succeed by describing clear theoretical and clinical zzso
