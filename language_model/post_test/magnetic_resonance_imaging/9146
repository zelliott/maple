zzso zzso studies carried out on healthy volunteers while performing different zzso tasks have shown a common pattern of bilateral zzso zzso especially of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Our objective was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare the pattern of brain zzso while performing two similar zzso tasks which differed in their presentation zzso Thirteen healthy volunteers completed a verbal zzso task presenting auditory zzso and a similar zzso task presenting visual zzso A conjunction analysis showed bilateral zzso of zzso areas including the zzso The left zzso and the superior zzso zzso showed a greater zzso in the auditory than in the visual condition, whereas zzso brain regions and the anterior zzso showed a greater zzso during the visual than during the auditory zzso Thus, brain areas involved in the visual and auditory versions of the zzso task showed an important overlap between them, reflecting the zzso characteristics of working zzso However, the differences found between the two zzso should be considered in order to select the most appropriate task for future clinical zzso
