The processing of dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso requires an extraction of the first zzso passage of the injected contrast zzso zzso methods employ the fit of a gamma zzso function to the measured zzso The use of a gamma zzso function is motivated by its shape similarity to the expected relaxation rate zzso during the first zzso zzso However, the quality of this result is strongly influenced by the amount of overlap of the first and second zzso zzso In this work we present an alternative, zzso method for the extraction of the first zzso passage from a measured relaxation zzso 

By using prior knowledge of the injection function, the measured zzso can be transformed to zzso that would occur at a shorter injection duration where the two zzso passages have less zzso This zzso is found by zzso zzso zzso of the measured zzso with an injection function that bases on the measurement zzso A minimum search yields the zzso point at which the first zzso can be zzso to zzso The gamma zzso fit is performed using zzso zzso The proposed approach is compared to the gamma zzso fit approach using simulations and an exemplary zzso from one healthy zzso 

The new method performs comparably stable as the gamma zzso function fit approach in zzso Both methods are superior to a simple exponential zzso zzso zzso to volunteer data, the new method performs much faster than the gamma zzso fit zzso The results obtained from both methods zzso zzso 

The new method offers a conceptual understanding of the first zzso passage and yields similar results to the gamma zzso function fit approach but performs much zzso
