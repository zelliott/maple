Previous research by our group demonstrated a zzso change in zzso volume for symptomatic subjects with zzso disease zzso and suggested that volume of the zzso may be a useful outcome measure for therapeutic studies in symptomatic zzso The current study was designed to determine whether zzso change in zzso zzso could be documented in zzso carriers of the HD gene zzso and to compare rate of change in these subjects with rate of change in mildly and moderately affected symptomatic zzso We measured zzso volumes on serial magnetic resonance image scans from 30 patients at three stages of zzso 10 zzso 10 with mild symptoms, as indicated by scores on the zzso Neurological zzso zzso zzso or zzso and 10 with moderate symptoms zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso was 36 zzso When analyzed zzso both symptomatic groups and the zzso group demonstrated a significant change in zzso volume over zzso zzso of change over time did not differ significantly among the three zzso We conclude that change in zzso volume may be a useful outcome measure for assessing treatment effectiveness in both zzso and symptomatic zzso
