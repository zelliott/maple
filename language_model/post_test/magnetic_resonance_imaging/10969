The design and construction of a 4 T zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso head zzso and a zzso phased array zzso zzso system are zzso To enable both high-resolution imaging of the entire brain and high-resolution zzso imaging, active zzso zzso decoupling was used in both the zzso zzso and each surface zzso in the zzso This zzso allows for both transmission and reception from the volume zzso as well as reception from the phased zzso The surface coils were zzso by overlapping the coils and using zzso zzso Since at high zzso construction of a lumped element matching quarter wavelength zzso an important component of the zzso zzso becomes difficult, a transmission line approach was zzso The system was tested and compared to a zzso volume zzso head zzso A zzso to zzso improvement in zzso ratio from the sensitive volume of the array was zzso
