It is well recognized that the zzso of zzso language zzso is increased in patients with focal zzso The hypothesis that shifts in language dominance are particularly likely when zzso zzso are located in close vicinity to the so-called zzso areas rather than in more remote brain regions such as the zzso has been challenged by recent zzso This study was undertaken to assess the effect of zzso in different parts of the left hemisphere, zzso present during language zzso on language zzso We investigated 84 adult patients with drug-resistant focal zzso with structural zzso and 45 healthy control subjects with an established functional zzso language zzso Out of the 84 patients 43 had left zzso zzso 13 a left frontal lobe zzso and 28 a left zzso zzso All these zzso were likely to have been present during the first years of life during language zzso To assess the zzso of cerebral language representation globally as well as zzso we calculated zzso zzso derived from zzso in four regions of interest zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and remaining zzso Patients with left zzso sclerosis showed less left zzso language representations than all other groups of subjects zzso zzso zzso This effect was independent of the factor of region, indicating that language zzso was generally affected by a left zzso zzso Patients with left frontal lobe or zzso zzso displayed the same left zzso of zzso zzso as the control zzso Thus, the zzso seems to play an important role in the establishment of language zzso zzso underlying mechanisms are zzso
