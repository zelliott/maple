The aim of this study was to obtain an zzso zzso zzso of diffuse zzso zzso able to integrate the zzso data in the grading of such zzso We studied zzso MR images of 91 patients with a zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A score ranging from 1 to 3 was assigned by two independent readers to each of the following MR features: zzso mass effect, contrast enhancement, borders, signal zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso analysis showed significant differences in the mean zzso scores between the three zzso zzso zzso enhancement was found to be the best predictor of the zzso grade followed by zzso signal zzso and border zzso This zzso represents a simple and zzso means of carefully evaluating some zzso characteristics of these zzso It could be used to integrate zzso data especially in cases in which tissue sampling defects may affect the zzso of this zzso
