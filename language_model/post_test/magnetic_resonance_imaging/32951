To demonstrate the usefulness of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso including zzso imaging zzso diffusion weighted imaging zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso recalled echo zzso and zzso weighted imaging zzso in diagnosing brain zzso 

zzso resonance imaging findings for 10 patients with clinically verified brain death zzso I) and seven patients with comatose or zzso mentality who did not meet the clinical criteria of brain death zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and loss of zzso flow signal voids zzso on zzso were highly sensitive and specific findings for the diagnosis of brain death zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings were statistically different between the two groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, cortical high signal zzso in zzso and zzso findings were not statistically different between the two group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso imaging, zzso and zzso using zzso zzso may be useful for diagnosing brain zzso However, zzso findings are not specific due to high false positive zzso
