zzso is the most common zzso error of zzso Adult patients often zzso dietary treatment and can subsequently develop serious brain zzso Some of them, however, do not present any symptoms, despite long-term zzso to high blood zzso zzso As the extent of brain toxicity of zzso is not clear in adults, new diagnostic methods are needed to assess brain effects of zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance zzso and of computerized zzso tests for measurement of brain zzso concentration and for early detection of zzso brain zzso Assessment of sustained attention, working memory and zzso control was performed in a group of 50 adults with zzso by means of computerized zzso zzso Additionally, in 40 patients, measurement of brain zzso signal was done by means of magnetic resonance zzso The results were correlated with plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso efficiency as well as increase of brain zzso concentration correlated with high levels of plasma zzso Interestingly, in two cases, despite high plasma zzso zzso low brain zzso concentration was observed accompanied by good results of zzso zzso This finding suggests presence of mechanisms limiting brain toxicity of zzso in some zzso It should be stressed, however, that such situation can be expected rarely, and is probably restricted to cases with moderate zzso Combination of computerized zzso zzso tests and of magnetic resonance zzso is a useful diagnostic method which could allow for careful zzso of dietary recommendations in selected patients with zzso
