This zzso imaging study evaluated the safety and feasibility of zzso zzso as an agent for zzso characterizing zzso in tumor metabolism for patients with prostate zzso Imaging living systems with zzso agents can result in more than zzso enhancement in signal relative to conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso When combined with the rapid acquisition of in zzso zzso MR data, it is possible to evaluate the distribution of agents such as zzso and its zzso products zzso zzso and zzso in a matter of zzso zzso studies in cancer models have detected elevated levels of zzso zzso in zzso with the ratio of zzso being increased in high-grade tumors and decreased after successful zzso zzso of this technology into humans was achieved by zzso the instrument that generates the zzso agent, constructing specialized radio frequency coils to detect zzso zzso and developing new pulse sequences to efficiently capture the zzso The study population comprised patients with zzso prostate cancer, with 31 subjects being injected with zzso zzso The median time to deliver the agent was 66 zzso and zzso was observed about 20 s after zzso No zzso zzso were observed, and the highest dose zzso zzso of 230 zzso zzso gave the best zzso ratio for zzso zzso The results were extremely promising in not only confirming the safety of the agent but also showing elevated zzso in regions of zzso zzso These findings will be valuable for zzso cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring in future clinical zzso
