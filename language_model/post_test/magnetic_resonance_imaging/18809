It is controversial whether zzso laser zzso zzso improves zzso zzso zzso we assessed zzso zzso before and after zzso with quantitative magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso in an animal zzso 

One week after partial zzso of the left zzso artery zzso in 12 zzso resting zzso zzso zzso reserve zzso with zzso regional wall zzso zzso cardiac output zzso were zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso six animals were treated with zzso of the lateral left zzso zzso Six animals were left zzso A final MR was performed 8 weeks zzso zzso data were compared to zzso blood flow and % zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed with zzso in 12 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was preserved after zzso zzso and decreased without zzso zzso zzso There was a significant difference zzso between the zzso treated and zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso wall was not different after zzso but reduced zzso without zzso zzso was not different between zzso zzso and zzso zzso group but was reduced zzso compared to zzso of zzso zzso zzso data and zzso zzso were significantly correlated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso improved zzso after zzso CO decreased zzso and zzso indicated more zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso preserves regional zzso zzso and improves function as shown with zzso
