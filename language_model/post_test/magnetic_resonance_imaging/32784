Fetal magnetic resonance imaging zzso has become an established clinical adjunct for the zzso evaluation of human brain zzso zzso fetal brain maturation can be studied with zzso from the 18th week of gestation to term and relies primarily on zzso zzso Recently zzso sequences have gained importance in the structural assessment of the fetal zzso zzso imaging provides quantitative information about water motion and tissue zzso and has applications for both zzso and destructive brain zzso Advanced magnetic resonance techniques, such as zzso might be used to demonstrate zzso that are involved in brain zzso though their development is still in the early zzso Using fetal zzso in addition to prenatal zzso zzso zzso and functional assessment of the fetus can be zzso The latter is not only based on observation of fetal movements as an indirect sign of activity of the fetal brain but also on direct zzso of fetal brain activity, adding a new component to fetal zzso This article provides an overview of the zzso methods used for fetal zzso zzso focusing on normal and abnormal early brain zzso
