The aim of the study was to present a case report demonstrating that zzso evoked zzso zzso originate from the zzso zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

zzso evoked zzso zzso are shown before and after operation in a patient with a surgically confirmed superior zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso auditory zzso response, caloric test, zzso evoked zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso On zzso zzso slight zzso hearing loss with normal auditory zzso response could be zzso zzso tests showed a reduced response of the right zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso were zzso The tumor was removed via a combined zzso and partial zzso approach with the removal of the zzso semicircular zzso The zzso zzso and inferior semicircular nerves were zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed preservation of hearing and zzso evoked zzso zzso caloric responses were now zzso 

The combined zzso and partial zzso approach represents an ideal condition to study the influence of the zzso nerve on the origin of the zzso evoked zzso zzso The maintenance of the zzso evoked zzso potential responses in our patient supports the concept that the zzso evoked zzso potential originates in the zzso and is transmitted in the zzso zzso
