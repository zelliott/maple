The intensity of the taste of a food is affected mostly by the amount of zzso zzso and zzso or salt it zzso To season zzso foods mainly table salt zzso is used and to sweeten foods, zzso like zzso are zzso Foods with highly intense tastes are consumed in smaller zzso The optimal taste intensity of a food is the intensity at which it is perceived as most zzso When taste intensity decreases or increases from zzso the zzso of a food zzso Here, we investigated the brain representation of sweet and salty taste intensity using functional magnetic resonance zzso Fifteen subjects visited twice and tasted a range of 4 watery solutions zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso Middle zzso zzso increased with increasing concentration for both zzso and zzso Despite similar zzso intensity ratings, anterior zzso zzso by zzso increased more with concentration than that by zzso zzso zzso increased with increasing zzso concentration but not zzso zzso In conclusion, sweet and salty taste intensity are represented in the middle zzso zzso zzso is only modulated by zzso Further research will need to extrapolate these results from simple solutions to real zzso
