zzso flow signal in the cavernous zzso and inferior zzso zzso has been shown on MR zzso in patients with carotid cavernous zzso zzso zzso however, identified flow signal in some patients without symptoms and signs of zzso This review was performed to determine the frequency of such normal zzso flow depiction at MR zzso 

Twenty-five zzso zzso zzso MR zzso obtained on two different imaging units zzso A and zzso were reviewed with attention to presence of zzso flow signal in the cavernous zzso or inferior zzso zzso or zzso Twenty-five additional MR zzso were reviewed in patients who had also had cerebral zzso to document absence of zzso where zzso MR zzso signal was zzso as well as to gain insight into zzso flow patterns that might contribute to MR zzso zzso flow zzso zzso in scanning technique parameters were zzso 

Nine zzso of the 25 MR zzso obtained on scanner A but only one zzso of the 25 obtained on scanner B showed flow signal in the cavernous or inferior zzso zzso or both in the absence of signs of zzso On review of 25 patients who had both MR zzso and zzso three patients with zzso signal at MR zzso failed to exhibit zzso at zzso 

Identification of normal cavernous zzso or inferior zzso zzso zzso signal on zzso zzso MR zzso may occur zzso and is probably dependent on technical factors that vary among zzso The exact factors most responsible, however, were not zzso by this preliminary zzso
