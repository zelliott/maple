We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the zzso zzso of phonetic zzso and the generation of zzso codes from zzso zzso Our focus was on the role of the left inferior frontal zzso zzso and in particular whether the zzso plays a role in zzso zzso processing such as zzso or whether it is directly involved in phonetic zzso and the generation of zzso zzso To answer this question, we contrasted the brain zzso patterns zzso by zzso with zzso or zzso frequency zzso which we expected would reveal areas related to the generation of zzso codes but not areas related to zzso zzso We found significant zzso of a zzso network consisting of the zzso zzso zzso the inferior frontal zzso zzso and the supplementary motor area for low- versus zzso frequency zzso Based on our hypothesis, we concluded that these areas and in particular the zzso are involved in phonetic and not zzso zzso We further discuss our findings with respect to the mechanisms of phonetic zzso and provide evidence in support of a functional segregation of the zzso part of zzso area, the zzso zzso
