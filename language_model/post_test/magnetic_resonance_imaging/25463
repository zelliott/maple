zzso reorganization can occur after zzso due to loss of a zzso but the nature of the cortical reorganization after spinal zzso injury zzso is still in zzso 

Using a zzso zzso we scanned zzso and zzso participants during hand movement and palm zzso to determine whether zzso zzso would show different patterns of cortical activity from the zzso zzso 

The zzso group showed stronger zzso in areas zzso rather than superior, to the areas activated by zzso zzso the zzso showed stronger zzso in more anterior zzso The signal at each zzso zzso significant zzso had a greater zzso for the zzso group than for the zzso in response to zzso 

In this study of sensory and motor representations within the same subjects, the authors show for the first time the increase in the zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso The authors do not find evidence of expansion of the hand representation into nearby cortical areas, and they corroborate previous zzso studies indicating a zzso shift for hand motor representation after zzso while showing that the sensory representation does not undergo a zzso shift of similar zzso The difference between the reorganization found here and the reorganization typically found following amputations suggests a rationale for the differences in zzso pain symptoms following a spinal zzso injury or zzso
