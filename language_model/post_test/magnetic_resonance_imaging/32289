Typically, human zzso cancer is widely zzso at the time of diagnosis and shows extremely poor zzso Experimental animal models that mimic human zzso cancer are often incomplete when compared to the full spectrum of the human disease with regard to its zzso hallmarks such as the spread of zzso its ability to seed the zzso cavity and formation of zzso We have established and characterized a new animal model for human zzso cancer in nude zzso 

A new cell line zzso was injected zzso in nude zzso Mice were divided in two groups A and B, which received 1 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound were used to analyze zzso 

All mice had tumors within 18 days and zzso they resembled poorly differentiated human zzso with bloody zzso Mean survival of the mice was zzso and zzso days in groups A and B, zzso zzso resonance imaging and ultrasound were used to confirm the presence of tumors and to monitor their growth without sacrificing the zzso 

This new zzso model accompanied by zzso imaging is highly zzso and likely to be very useful in testing new treatment strategies for zzso zzso
