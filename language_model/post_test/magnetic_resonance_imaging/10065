In this study, a well established expectancy manipulation model was combined with a novel zzso intervention, a validated sham acupuncture needle, to investigate the brain network involved in zzso zzso Sixteen subjects completed the zzso We found that after zzso acupuncture treatment, zzso pain rating reduction zzso minus zzso on the zzso side was significantly greater than on the control zzso When we calculated the contrast that zzso the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal difference between zzso and zzso during pain application on zzso side from the same difference on control side zzso zzso zzso - zzso - control zzso - zzso significant differences were observed in the bilateral zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso lateral prefrontal cortex, right anterior zzso zzso zzso and left inferior zzso zzso The simple zzso zzso analysis between each zzso zzso signal difference of zzso and zzso difference on zzso and control side and the corresponding zzso pain rating difference showed that significant negative correlation was observed in the bilateral zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso right zzso zzso and zzso These results are different from a previous study that found decreased activity in zzso regions such as the thalamus, zzso and zzso when comparing the response to noxious stimuli applied to control and zzso zzso areas of the zzso Our results suggest that zzso analgesia may be configured through multiple brain pathways and zzso
