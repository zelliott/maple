The purpose of this study was to determine the magnetic resonance zzso safety aspects and artifacts for three different heart valve zzso and two different zzso rings that have not been evaluated previously in association with the zzso MR zzso zzso zzso testing was performed using previously described techniques for the evaluation of magnetic field interactions zzso angle and zzso heating zzso phantom and zzso zzso 15 zzso of MR imaging at a whole zzso specific zzso rate of zzso zzso and artifacts zzso zzso spin zzso and zzso echo pulse zzso One heart valve zzso and one zzso ring showed no magnetic field zzso Two heart valve zzso and one zzso ring displayed relatively minor magnetic field interactions zzso zzso angle zzso or zzso 6 degrees, torque, zzso zzso was zzso or zzso zzso degrees C for the five different zzso zzso varied depending on the amount and type of metal used to make the zzso For the three heart valve zzso and two zzso rings, the lack of substantial magnetic field interactions and relatively minor hearing indicated that MR procedures may be conducted zzso in patients with these implants using MR systems operating with zzso zzso of zzso T or zzso zzso these findings essentially apply to 54 different heart valve zzso and 37 different zzso rings zzso based on the various models and sizes available for these zzso
