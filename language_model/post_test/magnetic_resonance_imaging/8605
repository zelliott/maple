Blood zzso dependent changes in the cerebral zzso were measured using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging in participants while they performed zzso zzso zzso To explore the role of zzso prefrontal zzso in the manipulation of the contents of working memory, the sequence of zzso targets in the zzso task was either constant or was manipulated using zzso zzso The zzso prefrontal zzso was significantly activated only during the period when participants had to zzso the locations of the zzso targets and not during the maintenance of spatial zzso This finding suggests that zzso prefrontal zzso is primarily involved in the zzso and to a lesser extent, in the maintenance of the contents of working zzso
