The objective of this study is to construct a zzso zzso predicting zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

Between 2009 and 2012, 493 zzso cancer patients received zzso and zzso zzso Patients who were diagnosed during zzso were assigned to a zzso cohort zzso and the others were assigned to a validation cohort zzso A zzso zzso model was created from zzso zzso data, from which a zzso was developed and zzso A predicted probability of zzso was defined as low zzso 

Age, zzso size assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso of zzso zzso The zzso incorporating these three zzso demonstrated good discrimination and zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso In the validation zzso the discrimination accuracy was zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of them were classified as low risk and negative zzso value zzso was zzso In the validation zzso 38% were identified as low risk and zzso was zzso zzso the zzso and validation zzso negative likelihood ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A robust zzso predicting zzso in early cervical cancer was zzso This model may improve clinical trial design and help physicians to decide whether zzso should be zzso
