A zzso model is proposed for analyzing magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data to derive clinically useful parameters such as zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso plasma flow zzso The model fits the zzso of the measured input and the zzso impulse retention functions to the measured tissue zzso A zzso study of 10 patients showed that relative root mean square errors by the model were significantly lower than errors for a previously reported zzso model zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso estimates correlated well with reference values by zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and for zzso r zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso Carlo simulation indicated that model parameters could be reliably zzso When the model was applied to zzso in five zzso expected increases in zzso and zzso due to zzso were detected with greater consistency than with the previous zzso These results support the reliability and zzso of the new model in computing zzso zzso and zzso mean transit times from MR and CT zzso
