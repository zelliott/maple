We have used zzso data analysis, more specifically zzso partial least squares to zzso structures zzso analysis, to discriminate between Alzheimer's disease zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and elderly control subjects combining both regional and global magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso In this study, 117 zzso patients, 122 zzso patients and 112 control subjects (from the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired from each zzso zzso regional zzso and manual outlining of the zzso were performed for each zzso zzso this yielded volumes of 24 different zzso defined structures which were used for zzso zzso 17 randomly selected zzso patients, 12 randomly selected control subjects and the 22 zzso subjects who converted to zzso at zzso follow up were excluded from the initial zzso analysis to provide a small external test set for model zzso Comparing zzso with controls we found a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso using zzso measures zzso Combining both global and regional measures resulted in a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso This increase in sensitivity and specificity resulted in an increase of the positive likelihood ratio from 9 to zzso From the external test set, the model predicted zzso of the zzso patients and zzso of the control subjects zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso subjects which converted to zzso at 1 year follow-up were shown to resemble zzso patients more closely than zzso This method shows potential for distinguishing between different patient zzso Combining the different zzso measures together resulted in a significantly better zzso than using them zzso zzso also shows potential for predicting conversion from zzso to zzso
