zzso composite zzso oxide zzso of different sizes zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by a zzso organization of zzso iron oxide zzso The zzso were obtained by the treatment of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The average lengths of zzso zzso and zzso are approximately 400, zzso and 1000 zzso zzso zzso transmission electron zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso and zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso were employed to characterize the zzso and the zzso contents of the zzso As an example of their potential applications, these zzso were explored as the zzso agents for magnetic resonance imaging zzso The magnetic contrast properties of the zzso were characterized by a zzso T zzso whole body MR zzso 10 zzso of the zzso caused substantial negative zzso After in zzso zzso the zzso could be effectively incorporated into the cells of a zzso cell line zzso These zzso viability and proliferation potential were not affected when the labeling concentration was less than 50 zzso
