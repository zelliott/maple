The effect of zzso zzso interruptions in the zzso zzso repeats of the zzso gene on the age at onset of zzso zzso type 1 zzso was zzso The number of zzso repeats in zzso was determined by zzso chain reaction zzso analysis, and the presence of zzso interruptions was assessed on the basis of the sensitivity of the zzso products to the restriction zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso Only one in 17 expanded zzso zzso from 17 zzso patients was interrupted by zzso The zzso sensitive zzso zzso from this single patient contained 58 zzso repeats, which would predict an age at onset of zzso of zzso years, in contrast to the actual 50 zzso In addition, the brain stem zzso of this patient was mild compared with that of a patient with 52 uninterrupted zzso zzso A sequence analysis showed that the repeat portion of the patient contained zzso zzso From these results, we suggest that the age at onset of zzso is not determined by the total number of zzso repeats (58) but by the number of uninterrupted zzso zzso
