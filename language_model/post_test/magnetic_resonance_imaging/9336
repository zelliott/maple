To determine whether economic costs associated with a conservative management strategy for unilateral acoustic zzso offer an economic advantage over active management zzso 

Cost and sensitivity analysis on a prospective zzso 

Single zzso study within a zzso referral zzso in Toronto, zzso 

72 patients (32 zzso 40 zzso aged 36 to 78 years with unilateral acoustic zzso were assigned initially to a conservative management zzso zzso criteria were small zzso size (less than 15 zzso in the zzso zzso patient preference and/or significant zzso 

zzso scanning was performed every 6 months for the first year, annually subsequently and then every 2-3 years as zzso Clinical review occurred every 6 zzso Failure of conservative management led to active zzso 

Cost analysis was performed to determine the mean total cost per patient for continued conservative management over the follow up period compared to the mean upfront total cost per patient undergoing active zzso 

Cost analysis within the Canadian health care system determined the mean total cost per patient for zzso removal at zzso zzso pounds; zzso zzso for gamma knife zzso at zzso zzso pounds; zzso zzso for zzso zzso at zzso pounds; zzso euros) and for conservative management at zzso zzso zzso euros) over the follow-up zzso 

An economic advantage can be demonstrated for the conservative management of acoustic zzso compared to zzso removal and gamma knife zzso on the zzso that no increase in active treatment complications arose from continued zzso growth during the period of zzso
