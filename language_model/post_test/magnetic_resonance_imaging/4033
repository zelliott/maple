This prospective study compares the zzso of zzso zzso findings in zzso cardiac surgery patients presenting with and without coronary zzso 

This zzso study was conducted at a zzso care zzso 

After Review Board approval and obtaining written informed zzso 11 patients undergoing zzso heart surgery, 9 patients undergoing similar zzso procedures with zzso coronary artery bypass surgery, and 4 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery alone were zzso zzso all patients underwent a structured zzso assessment, and the latter four additionally had zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

The patients, 9 of 24 of whom were female, were aged 46 to 78 years and, other than zzso heart disease, had medical histories that were similar between groups, with the exception of one patient having zzso None of the patients had a clinical history of zzso or cerebrovascular zzso Nine percent (1 of zzso of the zzso patients showed subtle zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso of the valve patients having zzso coronary surgery and zzso (four of four) of coronary artery zzso zzso Additionally, brain imaging scans of all four coronary bypass patients showed zzso changes reported as scattered zzso areas of high signal less than 3 to 4 zzso in zzso 

This survey shows that both subtle neurological abnormalities and magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be found in a high percentage of patients with coronary zzso Furthermore, this study indicates that without a standardized zzso neurological examination, zzso zzso dysfunction cannot necessarily be ascribed to zzso zzso
