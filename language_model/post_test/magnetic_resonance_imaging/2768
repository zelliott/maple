A zzso zzso pulse sequence zzso fat and water signals for a zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso was developed and implemented on a zzso T MR zzso Data processing was performed using a previously developed two-dimensional zzso zzso algorithm, adapted to use zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fat suppression images were obtained from six volunteers using the new fat suppression zzso The images were compared with corresponding images obtained using zzso zzso fat suppression zzso and a zzso zzso method zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso sequence shortens the imaging time by one-third compared with the zzso method, without loss in image zzso The data also show that a zzso zzso zzso effectively unwraps the phase of zzso data sets, and that results of zzso fat signal suppression are consistently better than those obtained using a standard zzso zzso The authors conclude that the zzso sequence provides zzso zzso and zzso images that appear to be promising for routine clinical zzso
