We present the typical zzso findings in three patients with zzso in comparison with a review of zzso and zzso findings described in the zzso 

In three male patients aged zzso years with zzso disease and neurological symptoms zzso CT and zzso studies were carried zzso zzso were monitored over a period of zzso zzso Additionally, cerebral and zzso zzso were performed in two zzso 

In two patients we found acute inflammatory zzso located in the zzso and the zzso white matter, some of which were associated with an acute inflammatory disruption of the zzso zzso zzso decreased in size under treatment, but complete resolution was not consistently zzso In the third patient we found a zzso of the superior zzso zzso but no other zzso zzso 

Our findings agree with those described in the literature as being typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso most commonly occur in the brain zzso followed by the zzso zzso and the zzso and white matter of both the zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cortical or zzso zzso white matter zzso have little diagnostic value, irrespective of their zzso The definitive diagnosis of zzso disease is made on the basis of clinical zzso
