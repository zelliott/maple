To determine whether equivalent zzso rate zzso imaging is a feasible method for demonstrating breast zzso 

Fifteen breast cancer patients underwent both zzso imaging, with zzso zzso zzso at frequency zzso of 7 and 19 zzso zzso and zzso zzso from water zzso and zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso The mean tumor size was zzso zzso The tumor outlines defined by their shape and margin on zzso images were compared with the zzso images produced by the dynamic study, and the distribution of zzso areas and their shapes on zzso images were zzso All patients had surgery and pathological findings were compared to zzso zzso 

The tumor outline of zzso zzso tumors on zzso images was nearly identical to that on zzso zzso zzso images demonstrated the location and degree of zzso The tumor outline of the other two tumors was less clear on zzso images, and internal zzso on zzso images reflected zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging findings allowed identification of four distinct tumor types that reflected the tumor growth patterns and their internal structures associated with zzso 

zzso imaging is a feasible imaging technique for demonstrating breast zzso
