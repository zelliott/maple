zzso attention is pivotal for cognitive zzso and individual differences in zzso functions are likely related to variations in structural properties of the zzso Attention is supported by separate zzso and models of the relationship between attention and brain structure must take this into zzso The Attention Network Test zzso yields behavioral measures of 3 independent zzso zzso executive control zzso zzso and zzso zzso relates to resolving cognitive zzso alerting refers to continuous maintenance of a vigilant state, and zzso to selection of and zzso toward sensory zzso Evidence from functional zzso studies suggests that the zzso components recruit different cortical zzso However, the structural zzso are not zzso zzso zzso scores were correlated with cortical thickness across the brain surface in 268 healthy adults spanning zzso years of zzso zzso correlations were found between cortical thickness and zzso and alerting in regions implicated by functional zzso and zzso studies, including anterior cingulate, lateral zzso and right inferior frontal zzso for zzso and zzso areas for zzso The zzso correlations were relatively stable across adulthood, indicating that factors influencing cortical maturation rather than zzso zzso specifically were instrumental in shaping the structural foundation for zzso attention in zzso
