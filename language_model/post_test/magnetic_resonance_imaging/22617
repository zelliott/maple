The objective of our study was to investigate outcome zzso of zzso and zzso therapeutic efficacy of facet joint zzso 

zzso patients with chronic lower back pain who were undergoing facet joint blocks at one zzso zzso 29) or two zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso All patients underwent zzso or CT of the zzso spine within 5 months before the facet joint zzso The facet joint blocks were performed under zzso zzso A small amount zzso zzso zzso of zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso of local zzso and zzso zzso of steroids, were zzso The initial pain response was zzso assessed using a visual analogue zzso Additional data, including short-term effect zzso 1 week) and zzso effect zzso 3 zzso were collected by a structured telephone zzso CT and zzso were reviewed with regard to the extent of facet joint zzso Multiple zzso zzso analyses were conducted to identify outcome predictor for efficacy of facet joint zzso 

A positive immediate effect was seen in 31 patients zzso A positive zzso effect was found in 14 patients zzso zzso alleviated by motion zzso zzso zzso and the absence of zzso sensation zzso zzso zzso predicted pain zzso However, the extent of facet joint zzso on zzso and CT was not a significant predictor for outcome zzso zzso zzso 

zzso joint blocks appear to have a beneficial zzso effect in one third of patients with chronic lower back pain and may therefore be a reasonable adjunct to zzso zzso However, outcome appears to depend on clinical, not on zzso imaging zzso
