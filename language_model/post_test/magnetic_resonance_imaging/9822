Almost all published zzso studies of zzso agents include a measurement of area at risk, zzso size, and thus allow determination of zzso salvage as an indicator of therapeutic zzso Until recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging with injection of zzso prior to intervention was the only clinical method suitable for making similar assessments in zzso Over the past 5 years, a large number of articles have documented that magnetic resonance imaging zzso can zzso determine area at risk, zzso size, and zzso zzso While zzso imaging has been the method used most commonly, zzso zzso images and early zzso enhancement zzso images can also determine the size of the area at zzso All 3 of these zzso methods detect the area at risk based on zzso zzso resulting from zzso Late zzso enhancement zzso images provide a zzso reference standard for zzso size in all of those zzso Finally, zzso images can also provide a single zzso measure of zzso salvage based on the zzso zzso of zzso injury associated with the progressively more severe damage associated with acute zzso zzso zzso Essentially, the zzso images can provide an zzso snap shot of zzso size and salvaged zzso is estimated as the viable zzso within the zzso extent of the zzso Thus, the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of how zzso can determine the area at risk, zzso size, and thus measure zzso zzso
