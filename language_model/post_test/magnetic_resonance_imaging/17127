The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of zzso imaging, dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso for detecting prostate cancer in patients with total serum zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso which is referred to as the zzso zzso 

Fifty patients with zzso zzso levels underwent zzso before zzso According to the sites of zzso the prostate was divided into eight regions on zzso zzso These regions were evaluated individually for the following features: zzso of prostate cancer on zzso and zzso zzso and relationship between tumor size and positive or negative zzso findings for tumor zzso 

On a zzso basis, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor detection were zzso and zzso for zzso imaging, zzso and zzso for zzso 38% and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for the combined method of zzso zzso The sensitivity of combined zzso to detect tumor was significantly higher than those of the individual methods zzso zzso zzso to p zzso zzso zzso size was significantly larger in regions with positive zzso findings than in regions with negative zzso findings zzso zzso zzso On a zzso basis, sensitivity and specificity of combined zzso to detect prostate cancer were zzso and zzso zzso 

Combined zzso imaging, zzso and zzso findings appear to be potentially useful for detecting and managing prostate cancer, even when performed for patients with zzso zzso zzso
