The purpose of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging to observe the changes of the position of the zzso zzso muscle relative to the zzso neck after zzso zzso 

Women with zzso stress zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed 1 week before surgery and 1 year after the zzso The zzso zzso muscle and the zzso neck were zzso in the zzso and zzso planes, zzso and their position was measured in relation to the zzso zzso The zzso of these measures was zzso Changes that occurred to zzso zzso muscle anatomy after the operation were correlated to surgical zzso zzso outcome was assessed zzso at 1 year with zzso zzso 

Of the 73 women who were zzso only 28 women were included in the study because the zzso edge of the zzso zzso was visible clearly on a zzso magnetic resonance zzso At the zzso zzso the objective cure rate was zzso zzso of zzso neck and zzso zzso position in relation to the zzso line were found to be zzso zzso zzso produces a significant zzso of the zzso zzso with a reduced distance between the zzso neck and the zzso zzso zzso zzso success was associated significantly with a shorter distance between zzso neck and zzso zzso zzso 

The anatomy of the zzso zzso muscle is changed by zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso muscle to the zzso neck may play a role in the restoration of zzso
