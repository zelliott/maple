To investigate the utility of functional and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the extent of brain injury in a zzso zzso zzso model and further to validate that the desired zzso injury was successfully zzso 

zzso was performed at zzso T in zzso zzso (N zzso 10, age zzso zzso zzso Relative cerebral blood flow zzso zzso zzso contrast, and apparent diffusion zzso zzso were estimated at different time points zzso zzso and zzso The effect following bilateral clamping of the carotid arteries was assessed by zzso MR zzso zzso and phase contrast MR zzso zzso (N zzso zzso 

A linear correlation was observed between relative cerebral zzso reduction and cerebral zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso reduction during 30 minutes of zzso and cerebral zzso after 30 or 150 minutes of zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and functional zzso and zzso zzso enabled consistent assessment of both the presence and absence of complete zzso as well as the functional significance of the zzso
