zzso cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso from blood zzso zzso zzso signals involves a zzso zzso zzso reflecting total cerebral blood volume changes, and a zzso constant zzso Traditionally, the former is assumed a fixed value and the latter is measured under zzso in fixed inspired fractional zzso of carbon zzso We recently reported on reductions in zzso via precise control of zzso pressures of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In light of these findings, our aim was to apply the improved zzso alternatives to zzso zzso making use of their distinct zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso Nine healthy volunteers were zzso at zzso while simultaneously measuring zzso and zzso zzso signals during controlled, zzso zzso and zzso followed by visual zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of low zzso and zzso the comparison of these zzso alternatives accurately highlighted a reduced zzso zzso relationship zzso with zzso and zzso as appropriate for zzso zzso
