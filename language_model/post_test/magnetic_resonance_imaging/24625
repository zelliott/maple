In patients with zzso altered brain zzso and motor activity levels are central features, reflecting cognitive zzso and negative symptoms, zzso Newer studies using zzso methods have addressed the severe disturbances in zzso functioning that is regarded as one of the core features of zzso Our aim was to compare brain zzso and motor activity in a patient during pharmacological treatment that was switched from a zzso to a second-generation antipsychotic zzso We zzso that this change of medication would increase level of responding in both zzso 

We present the case of a zzso male with onset of severe mental illness in adolescence, zzso diagnosed as schizophrenia of paranoid type, chronic zzso We compared brain zzso and motor activity in this patient during pharmacological treatment with a first-generation zzso and later switched to a second-generation zzso antipsychotic zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure brain zzso and wrist worn zzso to measure motor zzso 

Our study showed that brain zzso decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning in this patient, when changing from a first to a second generation antipsychotic zzso However the mean motor activity level was zzso although zzso reduced zzso particularly short-term zzso from minute to zzso Compared to the results from previous studies, the present findings indicate that changing to a second-generation antipsychotic alters zzso measures towards that seen in a control group, but with reduced brain zzso which was an unexpected zzso
