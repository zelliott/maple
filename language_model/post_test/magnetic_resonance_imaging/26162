Early assignment of disease progression among patients with zzso zzso zzso is critical for the appropriate selection of effective zzso We evaluated the association between contrast enhancement on zzso zzso MR images and disease zzso 

Clinical charts of patients with zzso zzso were reviewed for age, availability of MR images of the brain, severity of zzso zzso and duration and number of follow-up zzso zzso male patients with zzso zzso had undergone multiple MR imaging examinations of the brain that consisted of at least zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The MR images were reviewed for the presence of contrast zzso In addition, global disease burden, as shown by the zzso zzso images, was assessed using a visual scoring method zzso zzso 

Enhancement was seen on the initial zzso zzso MR images of 21 zzso zzso 18 zzso of the 21 patients had disease progression revealed by the follow-up evaluations based on MR imaging zzso and zzso zzso No enhancement was seen on the initial zzso zzso MR images of 22 zzso zzso for 18 zzso of the 22 patients, no evidence of disease progression was revealed by the follow-up zzso 

There is a very strong association between the presence of contrast enhancement on zzso MR images and zzso zzso progression based on clinical evaluation and MR zzso
