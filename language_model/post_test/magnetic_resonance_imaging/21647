The progress of zzso in the zzso was evaluated by visual inspection, and magnetic resonance zzso imaging and the zzso relaxation time zzso was calculated from double echo zzso zzso pediatric cases, who did not show zzso organic changes on MR examination, were zzso The zzso values in the corpus zzso zzso frontal deep white matter zzso zzso deep white matter zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the changes in these values with age were zzso During the first year of life, a rapid decrease in the zzso value was seen, followed by a more gradual zzso The zzso value seemed to reach the adult level between 2 and 3 years of life in all areas zzso The zzso values between 2 and 16 years in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values in patients with clinically diagnosed zzso disease zzso and late onset zzso disease were also zzso In zzso zzso zzso of the zzso value was observed in all zzso In late onset zzso disease, on the other hand, progressive zzso of the zzso values was mainly demonstrated in zzso and the zzso part of zzso These results suggest that the zzso value in the cerebral white matter allows more objective zzso than visual inspection, and makes it possible to clarify the mechanism underlying abnormal zzso zzso progressive or zzso
