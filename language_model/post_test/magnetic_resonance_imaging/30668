zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso with high levels of human zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso are rare and zzso The goal of this study was to report our 3 cases of zzso with zzso and to review the literature to zzso the clinical problems and zzso factors and to discuss the therapeutic zzso of this rare zzso 

Survival was analyzed in 66 previously reported zzso with zzso including our 3 cases, of which the clinical results have been described in the literature since zzso In the 66 cases zzso age: zzso years; zzso zzso 35 were verified zzso as pure zzso 23 were as mixed zzso with zzso element, and 8 were not verified as including zzso element zzso but with very high zzso zzso zzso of the differences among survival zzso concerning each zzso zzso sex, tumor location, serum zzso level, precocious zzso extent of surgery, zzso chemotherapy, mixture of other zzso zzso elements and zzso zzso was tested using zzso and zzso zzso 

The median survival time and the zzso and zzso survival rates were 22 months, zzso and zzso zzso In zzso analysis, male, zzso removal or more, zzso and chemotherapy were revealed to be significantly good zzso zzso However, zzso region and tumor zzso were poor zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that extent of surgery, zzso and chemotherapy were independent zzso zzso 

zzso we should mind the limitations of this study design because of case selection bias, different treatment protocols and incomplete follow-up of patients, this study led the following results and suggestive zzso zzso zzso and progressive zzso and zzso fluid zzso were characteristic clinical problems of zzso with zzso In the cases with extremely elevated levels of zzso biopsy for zzso diagnosis may be no longer zzso zzso biopsy and zzso may lead to tumor zzso To prevent tumor zzso gross tumor removal followed by zzso and chemotherapy should be aimed zzso A few courses of chemotherapy before surgery may prevent zzso zzso zzso and high dose chemotherapy may be promising options for zzso
