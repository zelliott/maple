To assess the performance of a zzso zzso element model on predicting zzso bone yield and zzso behavior based on high-resolution in zzso magnetic resonance images via the serial zzso 

The zzso model captures material zzso by zzso adjusting zzso zzso based on zzso effective zzso It enables simulations of zzso bone yield and zzso behavior from zzso magnetic resonance images at in zzso resolution by solving a series of zzso systems via an zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso of mechanical competence zzso zzso ultimate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were estimated at the zzso radius of zzso and zzso women (N zzso 20, age range zzso in whom zzso fractures typically zzso Each subject underwent three scans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated via zzso of variation zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso 

zzso simulations were completed in an average of 14 minutes per three-dimensional image data set involving analysis of 61 strain zzso The predicted yield zzso ultimate zzso zzso of zzso and toughness had a mean value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, covering a substantial range by a factor of up to zzso zzso correlation zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso with yield strain and toughness having the lowest and highest zzso values, zzso 

The data suggest that the yield and zzso parameters have adequate zzso to evaluate treatment effects in zzso studies within short follow-up zzso
