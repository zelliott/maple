Visual and auditory zzso traditionally have been considered to be zzso Thus, their activity has been thought to be unchanged by information in other sensory zzso However, using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso the present experiments revealed that ongoing activity in the visual zzso could be modulated by auditory information and ongoing activity in the auditory zzso could be modulated by visual zzso In both cases, this zzso zzso of activity took the form of zzso Yet, the zzso response was not evident in either cortical area during the paired presentation of visual and auditory zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso processes operate within traditional zzso zzso and that these processes can be switched on or off in different zzso
