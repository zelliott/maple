zzso imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play an increasingly important role in the diagnostic zzso and treatment of zzso zzso In this context, a distinct trend can be observed towards the development of contrast agents and zzso that open up perspectives on a zzso imaging approach, involving all three aforementioned zzso To promote insight into the zzso of such an approach, we prepared an overview of the strengths and limitations of the various imaging techniques, in particular with regard to their capability to zzso the spatial distribution of a zzso diagnostic zzso To accomplish this task, we used a zzso zzso In the first step, we examined the situation for a particular therapeutic zzso agent with zzso imaging opportunities, zzso zzso zzso zzso Physical phantom experiments were performed to enable a comparative evaluation of the three zzso assuming the use of standard equipment, standard clinical scan zzso and zzso zzso These phantom data were then analyzed so as to obtain first order estimates of the sensitivity and detection limits of zzso CT and zzso for zzso In the second step, the results for zzso were taken as a starting point for a discussion of the factors affecting the sensitivity and detection limits of zzso CT and zzso for zzso agents in zzso In this, emphasis was put on the factors that must be taken into account when zzso the findings for zzso to other diagnostic tasks, other contrast agents, other experimental conditions, and other scan zzso
