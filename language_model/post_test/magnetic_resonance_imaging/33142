zzso stimuli are often used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the integration and segregation of motion zzso Considering the zzso importance of such mechanisms, only a very limited number of visual brain areas have been found to be specifically involved in motion zzso These are the human zzso complex, area zzso and the zzso The zzso complex can be functionally subdivided into two separate areas, middle zzso area zzso and zzso superior zzso area zzso however, it is currently unclear whether these distinct zzso have different responses to plaid zzso To address this issue we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to zzso the relative response of zzso and zzso to component and pattern zzso Participants viewed plaid stimuli that were constrained to result in the perception of either component motion zzso of motion zzso or pattern motion zzso of motion zzso zzso segregation was achieved using a moving dot stimulus that allowed stimulation of each visual zzso either in unison or zzso We found pattern motion selective responses in both zzso and zzso zzso with previous reports, activity indicative of pattern motion selectivity was also found in the zzso as well as in other zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso and the zzso are involved in the complex motion integration mechanisms that are triggered by plaid zzso This reinforces the concept that zzso zzso take place in a distributed zzso circuit both in cortical and zzso zzso
