zzso zzso tumor zzso is a rare brain zzso Although the tumor pathology is relatively well zzso its full zzso spectrum is still discussed, and zzso data on it are very zzso Here, the authors describe detailed zzso pathology of 7 cases of zzso Each tumor consisted of 3 major zzso zzso cells zzso cells, zzso zzso processes forming zzso structure, and expanded zzso zzso space, the latter giving an impression of cellular elements floating within zzso zzso cells had round, oval, or zzso zzso no discernible zzso and a relatively narrow rim of zzso Some zzso were irregular and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso penetrated into zzso nuclear zzso were zzso Part of the zzso zzso within zzso often appeared zzso with large zzso and zzso zzso and some of these zzso in turn, semicircular profiles of unknown zzso zzso was clustered below the nuclear zzso The zzso contained a few zzso round rather than zzso a few stacks of rough zzso zzso and zzso zzso and clear zzso The second element consisted of innumerable cellular zzso Some of these were zzso and formed stacks connected by zzso or zzso adhesive plaque zzso Others had shorter zzso containing zzso extending into bulbous zzso zzso zzso were occasionally observed, both in the zzso of zzso cells and within zzso In one cell, zzso zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso of a few cells, unusual inclusions reminiscent of zzso resembled zzso zzso with zzso zzso At higher power, walls of the zzso resolved into layered structures composed of several zzso between these, zzso structures were zzso The authors conclude that zzso exhibit clear-cut characteristics of zzso cells and not true zzso
