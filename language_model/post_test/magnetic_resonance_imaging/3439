Using the database of the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative, we examined the value of zzso assessment, structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso and zzso scanning with respect to prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment zzso to Alzheimer's disease zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso and zzso would lose zzso value when applied in patients older than 75 years, whereas zzso and zzso testing would zzso At baseline 175 patients had zzso mostly zzso They were followed during a mean of zzso years, and 81 patients converted to zzso after a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso assessment and zzso variables predicted conversion with 63 to zzso zzso success both in patients younger and older than 75 years, while zzso zzso attained this success rate only in patients younger than 75 zzso For zzso this rate was 57% in the total zzso We conclude that the diagnostic yield of different techniques in predicting conversion from zzso to zzso is moderate, and that it is affected by age of the subject under zzso zzso and zzso assessment remain zzso in patients older than 75 years, unlike zzso zzso
