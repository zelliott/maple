The aim of this study was to evaluate whether zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso when compared with triple dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were included in the zzso Group I zzso zzso 10) patients with acute zzso Group II zzso zzso zzso patients presenting with a current zzso who had the history of ON in the previous zzso Group III zzso zzso zzso patients presenting with a current zzso but with no history of zzso zzso zzso zzso investigation and zzso zzso with triple dose zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out for zzso zzso was found to be zzso sensitive and zzso specific to the acute zzso whereas zzso zzso with triple dose zzso was zzso sensitive and zzso zzso In chronic zzso the sensitivity of zzso zzso is zzso whereas the zzso is still zzso sensitive to chronic zzso nerve involvement and can distinguish the pathology zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso with triple dose zzso is not more sensitive than zzso in determining the acute zzso nerve zzso but it is a zzso specific zzso The results suggest that zzso is superior to the zzso zzso in determining the chronic zzso nerve zzso
