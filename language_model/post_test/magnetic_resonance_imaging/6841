zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging was zzso evaluated for direct imaging of zzso zzso strain and compared with zzso delayed contrast zzso MR imaging in five healthy volunteers and nine patients with zzso Local zzso performance was decreased in zzso zzso versus that in remote and adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso and in adjacent versus remote zzso zzso zzso zzso The extent of dysfunctional zzso as assessed with zzso MR imaging, was greater than that of zzso as assessed with delayed zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso values obtained with zzso MR imaging were strongly correlated with those obtained with three-dimensional zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso MR imaging provides zzso resolved zzso zzso zzso imaging and measurement of zzso strain in humans without the need for zzso which may improve routine comprehensive evaluation of zzso zzso
