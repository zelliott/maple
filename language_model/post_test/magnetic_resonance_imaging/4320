We evaluated four potential secondary magnetic resonance imaging signs to aid in clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Seventy-one zzso zzso zzso tears and 46 zzso were evaluated for the following secondary zzso zzso zzso sheath fluid, zzso a zzso zzso spur located just anterior to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two musculoskeletal zzso rated their confidence using a scale and were compared for level of zzso The presence of zzso sheath fluid had modest specificity and fair to moderate zzso zzso spurring and zzso of the zzso had excellent specificity and fair zzso Bone zzso zzso were commonly seen in cases and zzso zzso of divergence of opinion between the two zzso revealed pitfalls in interpretation of zzso sheath fluid and bone zzso zzso which were commonly the result of adjacent vessels and zzso fat zzso zzso We conclude that secondary signs of zzso tears with high zzso include zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso sheath zzso
