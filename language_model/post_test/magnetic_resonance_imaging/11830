To evaluate and compare the capacity of zzso bands zzso and three sets of MR imaging criteria to predict the conversion of clinically isolated syndromes zzso to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis zzso 

One hundred and twelve patients with zzso were zzso studied with MR imaging and determination of zzso Based on the clinical follow-up zzso or not conversion to zzso we calculated the sensitivity, specificity zzso positive and negative zzso value of the zzso and MR imaging criteria proposed by zzso et zzso zzso et al and zzso et zzso 

zzso developed in 26 zzso patients after a mean follow-up of 31 months zzso zzso zzso were positive in 70 zzso patients and were associated with a higher risk of developing zzso zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso accuracy of zzso positive zzso value zzso of zzso and negative zzso value zzso of zzso zzso and zzso criteria showed the same results with a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso accuracy of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of zzso zzso criteria showed a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso accuracy of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The greatest accuracy was achieved when patients with positive zzso and three or four zzso criteria were zzso 

We observed a high prevalence of zzso in zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso and zzso zzso have high zzso zzso criteria have a higher zzso Both zzso and MR imaging criteria have a high negative zzso zzso
