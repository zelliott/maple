zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging has been advocated as the imaging zzso of choice for evaluating zzso in the cervical zzso zzso zzso images of the zzso spine in 50 patients were compared with similar images obtained using zzso zzso technique on a zzso T MR zzso The zzso images were superior to zzso images in the evaluation of the neural zzso zzso fat, and disk zzso The zzso images obtained were inadequate for zzso spine imaging due to an unacceptable level of chemical shift zzso The zzso technique does provide the advantages of rapid acquisition of zzso images and decreased motion zzso zzso zzso images may play an increasingly important role in zzso spine imaging with continued changes in software and improvements in zzso
