Patients with type II diabetes are at increased risk of cognitive zzso The retinal and zzso complications of diabetes follow zzso damage permitting small zzso to zzso hence the cerebral damage might also follow loss of zzso barrier zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso brain imaging with intravenous zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was used to identify increased zzso zzso 

Ten well controlled type II diabetic patients aged zzso years and 10 controls underwent MR brain imaging with fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso imaging before; and zzso zzso imaging at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after intravenous zzso The zzso image before zzso was zzso from the images at each time point after zzso Net signal intensity was plotted against time for different brain zzso White matter zzso were scored from the zzso zzso 

The signal zzso zzso showed that brain signal intensity increased more in the diabetic group than controls during the first 15 minutes after zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso Signal intensity in controls peaked at five minutes and diabetics at 15 zzso zzso with more white matter zzso had greater signal increase after zzso whether diabetic or not zzso 

Increased zzso zzso with MR imaging was detected in patients with type II diabetes or white matter zzso Increased zzso of the zzso might account for some of the cerebral effects of type II diabetes, and so possibly also for the effect of other conditions that affect the zzso (like zzso on the zzso
