zzso I disorder is defined by the occurrence of zzso The presence of mania, coupled with a course of illness characterized by zzso and waning of affective symptoms, suggests that bipolar disorder arises from dysfunction of neural systems that maintain emotional zzso and zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to study manic bipolar subjects as they performed a cognitive task designed to examine the zzso prefrontal emotional zzso zzso 

We used zzso to study regional brain zzso in 40 zzso manic bipolar I patients and 36 healthy subjects while they performed a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed to test the primary zzso zzso analyses were also zzso 

Compared with healthy subjects, the manic subjects exhibited blunted zzso to emotional and neutral images, but not targets, across most of the zzso regions of zzso Several additional brain regions identified in the zzso analysis also exhibited similar differences between groups, including right zzso right zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to these primary findings, the manic subjects also exhibited increased zzso in response to targets in a number of brain regions that were primarily associated with managing affective zzso Group differences did not appear to be secondary to medication exposure or other zzso 

zzso manic subjects exhibit blunted brain zzso response to emotional cues throughout the zzso prefrontal emotional zzso zzso zzso of this emotional network may contribute to the mood zzso of bipolar zzso
