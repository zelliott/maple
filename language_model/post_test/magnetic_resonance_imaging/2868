zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso contrast was used to detect focal changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism in a patient with focal zzso The patient presented with frequent partial motor zzso involving his right lower face that spread to produce speech arrest and occasionally right arm zzso zzso was never impaired during these zzso A zzso zzso technique was used to acquire 16 zzso zzso slices every 4 seconds for 11 zzso Although no overt zzso were observed or reported by the patient during the zzso a time series analysis of the functional data revealed focal zzso changes in the zzso left frontal zzso which correlated well both in duration and spatial zzso with zzso activity subsequently recorded by invasive zzso zzso The spatial zzso of zzso was more accurate than zzso recorded from a zzso grid in predicting the site of successful surgical zzso These results illustrate the potential of functional zzso for zzso seizure zzso with high spatial and zzso zzso Such studies can be readily combined with high-resolution anatomical imaging, zzso studies, and other magnetic resonance zzso
