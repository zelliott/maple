The purpose of this study was to zzso the natural history of branch duct type pancreatic zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso by evaluating serial changes in the magnetic resonance zzso zzso findings of patients diagnosed with pancreatic zzso of branch duct zzso 

Thirty-five patients had branch duct type zzso including 9 patients with separate zzso and underwent initial and follow-up zzso over a period of more than 12 zzso The maximum diameter of the zzso zzso the presence of associated main pancreatic duct zzso zzso and the presence of a filling zzso were zzso zzso changes in these findings were zzso 

zzso enlargement on follow-up zzso was observed in 7 zzso Of the 29 branch duct zzso without associated zzso zzso or a filling zzso identified on initial zzso only 1 showed gradual tumor zzso In 4 cases, the zzso size decreased on follow-up zzso 

Branch duct type zzso grow slowly and can be monitored without operation provided that the tumor shows no associated zzso zzso or filling zzso
