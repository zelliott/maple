Although significant insights into the neural basis of zzso and mathematical processing have been made, the neural processes that enable abstract symbols to become zzso remain largely unexplored in zzso In the present study, adult participants were trained to associate novel symbols with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the neural zzso of zzso comparison versus recognition of the novel symbols after each of two training zzso A zzso zzso network, including the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso prefrontal cortex, was more active during zzso comparison than during zzso zzso In contrast, a network including bilateral zzso regions was more active during recognition than zzso A zzso three-way interaction revealed that those individuals who had higher scores on a zzso zzso task zzso their understanding of the global zzso organization of the novel zzso exhibited increasing segregation between the two tasks in the bilateral zzso zzso as a function of increased zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso analysis showed that activity in the left zzso zzso was systematically related to the effect of zzso distance on zzso These data provide zzso evidence that zzso and left prefrontal zzso are involved in learning to map zzso quantities onto visual zzso Only the zzso cortex, however, appeared systematically related to the degree to which individuals learned to associate novel symbols with their zzso zzso We conclude that the left zzso cortex, in particular, may play a central role in zzso visual symbols with zzso zzso
