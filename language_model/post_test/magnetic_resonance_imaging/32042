To examine the neural basis of cognitive complaints in healthy older adults in the absence of memory impairment and to determine whether there are zzso zzso lobe zzso gray matter zzso changes as reported in zzso disease zzso and zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso 

Participants were 40 zzso individuals with cognitive complaints zzso who had normal zzso test zzso The authors compared their structural brain zzso scans to those of 40 patients with zzso zzso and 40 healthy controls zzso using zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso 

The zzso and zzso groups showed similar patterns of decreased zzso relative to the HC group on whole brain analysis, with differences evident in the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The degree of zzso loss was associated with extent of both memory complaints and performance zzso zzso segmented zzso volumes, adjusted for age and zzso volume, were significantly reduced only in the zzso group, with the zzso group showing an intermediate zzso 

zzso complaints in older adults may indicate underlying neurodegenerative changes even when unaccompanied by deficits on formal zzso The cognitive complaint group may represent a zzso cognitive impairment stage and may provide an earlier therapeutic opportunity than mild cognitive zzso zzso analysis approaches incorporating signal intensity may have greater sensitivity in early zzso stages than zzso zzso
