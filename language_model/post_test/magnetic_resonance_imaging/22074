Although MR imaging evaluation of the rotator cuff is usually done with zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques, interest also exists in zzso zzso echo zzso The shorter scan times of zzso sequences can be used to increase the number of signal averages and thus improve the zzso zzso Our purpose in this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso zzso MR image interpretations with conventional zzso zzso MR image interpretations when diagnosing rotator cuff zzso 

zzso consecutive patients who underwent both MR imaging and shoulder zzso were included in this zzso The MR examination included both a 7 zzso 20 zzso acquisition time zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence and a 7 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso images were evaluated by two of the authors zzso who were unaware of the zzso zzso Each of the two observers graded each cuff as being intact, having a zzso zzso or having a zzso zzso After a zzso zzso each of the two observers then interpreted the zzso zzso zzso MR images in the same zzso zzso and specificity for the two sets of interpretations were calculated in terms of the ability of the observers to use the two sequences to distinguish an intact cuff from a rotator cuff tear and to distinguish a zzso cuff tear from an intact cuff or zzso zzso The results were then compared using zzso zzso test zzso 

For distinguishing an intact cuff from a torn zzso the sensitivity of the zzso interpretations was lower for the zzso images than for the conventional zzso zzso zzso The specificity also decreased with interpretation of the zzso images for one observer and was unchanged for the second zzso For distinguishing a zzso cuff tear from a zzso cuff tear zzso or zzso zzso the sensitivity and specificity of both observers decreased with interpretations of the zzso images when compared with the conventional zzso zzso zzso The results did not reach statistical zzso 

In this small study evaluating the ability of observers to diagnose rotator cuff tears on zzso zzso MR images only, interpretations of zzso images tended to be less sensitive and specific than interpretations of standard zzso zzso zzso
