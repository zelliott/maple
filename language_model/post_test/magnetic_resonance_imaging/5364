Brain derived zzso factor zzso seems to be involved in regulation of synaptic plasticity and zzso zzso plasma and serum levels have been associated with depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other psychiatric and neurodegenerative zzso In a community sample, drawn from the Baltimore zzso Study of Aging zzso we examined whether zzso plasma concentration was associated with rates of age-related change in cognitive performance zzso and regional brain volume zzso Plasma zzso levels, which were significantly higher in females zzso were not associated with either concurrent cognitive performance or rates of age-related change in performance across cognitive zzso zzso Sex differences in the relationship between zzso and the zzso of regional brain volume changes were observed for the whole brain and frontal white matter volumes zzso zzso lower plasma zzso was associated with steeper volume decline in females but not zzso Together, our findings contribute to zzso the understanding of the relationships between plasma zzso structural brain integrity and zzso Potential mechanisms zzso these relationships merit further zzso
