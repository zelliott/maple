A zzso study is zzso 

To investigate the association of zzso zzso gene zzso with adolescent idiopathic zzso zzso zzso 

Previous studies have shown that genetic factors are important in the zzso of idiopathic zzso Only 1 publication suggested that zzso site zzso was associated with curve severity of idiopathic zzso However, to our knowledge, the relationship of zzso zzso gene zzso and the individual zzso to idiopathic zzso has not been zzso 

This study included 202 patients with zzso and 174 healthy zzso zzso zzso status, curve pattern, Cobb angle, and zzso sign in female patients were zzso There were 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso analyzed by restriction zzso length zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso was significantly higher in patients than that in controls zzso zzso zzso The X zzso appeared to be overrepresented in patients compared with controls zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso in female patients whose height was zzso or zzso 160 zzso and Cobb angle zzso or zzso 40 degrees were higher than those whose height was zzso zzso and Cobb angle zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso site zzso of zzso zzso gene may be associated with a risk of zzso
