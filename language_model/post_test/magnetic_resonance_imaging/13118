This study investigates the zzso mechanisms employed to monitor and resolve conflicts between competing zzso representations during sentence zzso Participants took part in a sentence comprehension task as well as the zzso and the zzso zzso tasks while their brain activities were scanned with zzso zzso superior frontal zzso zzso left inferior frontal zzso zzso and left angular zzso zzso zzso zzso were more activated for implausible sentences, in which zzso processes and semantic strategies give rise to incompatible zzso zzso as compared with plausible sentences, in which zzso processes and semantic strategies point to coherent zzso Among them, zzso zzso left zzso and left zzso constantly responded to the zzso in sentence comprehension and the zzso in the two zzso tasks, while anterior zzso and left AG were specifically sensitive to the sentence zzso These results suggest that the zzso mechanisms of executive control are recruited to deal with conflicts between representations of linguistic zzso
