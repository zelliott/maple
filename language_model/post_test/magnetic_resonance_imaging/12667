We developed a modeling procedure using CT scans or zzso data for exploring the zzso and zzso canals of zzso zzso We submitted zzso patients with instability and spatial zzso to this zzso Out of the zzso patients, 95 had zzso some of them, because zzso were suspected also had zzso modeling and functional zzso We focused on a never zzso abnormal connection between the zzso lateral and zzso canal zzso with a frequency of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the frequency was zzso zzso Three zzso patients had CT zzso For each of them, the modeling revealed that zzso was present on the zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso no zzso vertigo but frequent instability, transport sickness head tilt on the side of the anomaly, and spatial zzso in new zzso We evaluated the functional impact of zzso by testing the zzso zzso zzso in horizontal and vertical planes and found zzso abnormal zzso in the case of left zzso during a zzso horizontal rotation or a post zzso horizontal zzso added to the expected horizontal zzso we found an unexpected upbeat zzso induced by the zzso displacement of the fluid in the zzso zzso As zzso was found in CT scans and zzso modeling for a same subject, we suggest that it could be a zzso abnormal process of zzso of the zzso The responses to the zzso tests highlighting constant unexpected zzso underline the potential functional consequences of zzso on zzso perception and zzso
