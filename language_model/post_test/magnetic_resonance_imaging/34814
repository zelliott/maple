The participation of zzso zzso structures in memory performance was examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging of local blood zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured during zzso into memory complex scenes or line drawings and during retrieval from memory of previously studied line drawings or zzso zzso tasks yielded increased signals for unfamiliar information in a zzso zzso region that were focused in the zzso zzso zzso tasks yielded increased signals for successfully remembered information in an anterior zzso region that were focused in the zzso These results indicate that separate components of the human zzso zzso memory system are active during distinct memory zzso
