To compare zzso right zzso zzso zzso volume zzso and the ratio of RV volume to left zzso zzso volume zzso zzso in prediction of significant pulmonary zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso repair and to assess sex differences in the zzso zzso 

The ethics committee approved this retrospective zzso study, and patients or their parents or zzso signed written informed zzso zzso zzso ratio, and zzso were measured with the use of magnetic resonance imaging in 155 consecutive patients with repaired zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso 98 zzso male and 57 zzso female zzso zzso fraction of zzso or greater was considered zzso The capability of the zzso and that of the zzso ratio for prediction of significant zzso were compared by using zzso zzso analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

zzso was significantly higher in male zzso zzso than in female zzso zzso patients zzso zzso the zzso ratio was similar in both sexes zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso both in the entire cohort and after excluding patients with significant zzso zzso zzso RV zzso tract zzso and/or other residual zzso abnormalities zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis revealed better discrimination of significant zzso from insignificant zzso zzso with the use of the zzso ratio than with zzso zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, the only independent predictor of zzso fraction was the zzso zzso 

The zzso ratio is more accurate than the zzso in differentiation of significant from insignificant zzso After zzso repair, female and male patients have similar zzso ratios despite significant differences in zzso between the zzso
