zzso spin zzso zzso is an zzso technique for measuring zzso at the brain tissue zzso The aim of the study was to investigate cerebrovascular zzso zzso at zzso level in patients with an internal carotid artery zzso zzso by combining zzso with a vascular challenge, and determine whether the zzso varies within the zzso territory of the zzso zzso 

Sixteen patients with a symptomatic zzso zzso and 16 zzso healthy control subjects underwent zzso and zzso selective zzso before and after zzso zzso zzso was assessed throughout the brain in the zzso matter supplied by the unaffected zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso blood flow increased zzso in all zzso territories after zzso in the patients and zzso In the tissue supplied by the unaffected zzso zzso zzso was lower in the tissue supplied by the unaffected zzso zzso in the patients when compared with the controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso mean difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Within the zzso territory of the unaffected zzso the zzso was lower in the brain tissue on the side of the zzso zzso than on the side of the unaffected zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso paired mean difference zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso can assess impaired cerebrovascular zzso at the zzso level in patients with a symptomatic zzso zzso Assessment of zzso with zzso may help to identify the tissue most at risk for future stroke and as such may guide medical zzso
