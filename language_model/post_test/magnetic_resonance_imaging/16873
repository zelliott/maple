zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can evaluate small amounts of fat, and is widely used for imaging abdominal zzso zzso fat has recently been revealed as having an important role in the development of heart disease, but zzso has not been widely applied in this field, probably because of cardiac motion zzso 

To demonstrate the feasibility of zzso with zzso zzso for evaluation of zzso fat in the normal human heart, compared to zzso zzso imaging zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers were zzso zzso fat volume was zzso evaluated on zzso zzso images and zzso zzso 

zzso fat was clearly zzso on the zzso images as zzso areas that corresponded to regions identified as zzso fat on the zzso zzso zzso fat volume correlated well between the two methods zzso zzso zzso P zzso and tended to be larger on the zzso images than on the zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso may be a useful alternative method to zzso zzso for evaluation of zzso zzso
