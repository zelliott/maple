To determine the magnetic attraction of 10 currently available lower zzso external zzso in the zzso suite and to test zzso with minimal or no magnetic attraction for the presence of temperature zzso during a 30-minute zzso zzso 

zzso testing of selected zzso external fixation models in an identical zzso 

Level 1 trauma zzso zzso Ten commercially available external zzso used for lower zzso injuries applied to saw bone zzso 

External zzso suspended in testing apparatus were placed at three locations in the zzso suite for magnetic zzso zzso with minimal attraction were scanned for 30 zzso 

zzso attraction was measured with a digital scale, and temperature zzso were obtained with a digital thermometer and zzso 

The zzso with carbon fiber rings, Richards zzso and Large zzso External zzso had zzso zzso of magnetic attraction at all three zzso No component of these zzso experienced zzso degrees of temperature zzso after a 30-minute zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso along with the Hoffman II, Hoffman II zzso zzso with stainless steel rings, and zzso zzso had zzso zzso of magnetic attraction at all three zzso 

Many commercially available external zzso have components and spring zzso that have significant magnetic attraction to the zzso zzso zzso that have zzso zzso of attraction do not experience significant heating during zzso
