zzso of brain tumors has been shown to increase patient zzso The extent of the possible zzso however, depends on whether the tumor has invaded brain regions important for zzso zzso or cognitive processes and whether the brain tissue surrounding the tumor maintains its functional zzso The goal of the present study was to develop new zzso and zzso tools to specifically assess the function of the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in 4 patients with brain tumors close to this zzso 

Using functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging and a task developed to assess accurate selection between competing responses based on conditional rules, the authors preoperatively assessed the function of the zzso in 4 patients with brain tumors close to this zzso In 1 patient, the authors developed an zzso procedure to assess performance on the task during the tumor zzso 

zzso zzso imaging data showed specific activity increases in the vicinity of the tumors, that is, in the zzso As confirmed by zzso structural MR imaging, the extent of the tumor zzso was optimal and the functional region within the zzso was zzso Furthermore, patients exhibited no zzso deficits during task performance, demonstrating that the function was zzso zzso behavioral results demonstrated that the cognitive processes underlying performance on the task remained intact throughout the tumor zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso imaging, together with zzso behavioral zzso may be a useful paradigm to assist zzso in preserving cognitive function in patients with brain zzso
