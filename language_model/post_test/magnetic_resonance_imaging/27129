This study describes a method of utilizing zzso zzso effects to characterize and zzso collagen fiber tracks using magnetic resonance zzso The technique yields information about fiber structure with some similarities to what can be obtained in brain using diffusion zzso imaging, but relies on a completely different physical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The method is probably only appropriate for highly ordered collagen rich zzso A goat knee zzso was embedded in a zzso zzso ball and the magnetic resonance signal intensity was examined as a function of sample orientation to a zzso zzso field using a three-dimensional zzso echo zzso zzso zzso interactions caused a zzso signal variation with zzso After correction for zzso sensitivity and registration of the images, a principal zzso direction was zzso for each zzso The data were analyzed and viewed as zzso direction and standard zzso zzso zzso zzso fibers within the zzso were zzso as fiber tracks grown using diffusion zzso imaging zzso The zzso zzso zzso fiber imaging is proposed for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2010 zzso zzso
