Recent studies suggest that stimuli with directional meaning can trigger lateral shifts of zzso attention when centrally presented as zzso zzso We investigated covert zzso in healthy participants and in a group of 17 right zzso patients (9 with zzso zzso comparing arrows, eye zzso and digits as central zzso cues in a detection zzso zzso effects zzso by zzso and eye gaze were overall consistent in healthy participants and in right zzso patients, whereas zzso cues were zzso Moreover, patients with neglect zzso at the shortest delay between cue and target, a disengage deficit for zzso zzso whose magnitude was predicted by neglect zzso We conclude that the peculiar form of zzso zzso triggered by the directional meaning of zzso cues presents some features previously thought to characterize only the zzso zzso zzso to zzso peripheral zzso
