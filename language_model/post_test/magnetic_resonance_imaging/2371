A method is proposed to estimate zzso ratio zzso values in phased array magnitude images, based on a zzso zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso can be found by correcting the measured signal intensity for the noise bias effects and by evaluating the noise zzso as the mean square value of all the zzso zzso in a chosen background zzso divided by twice the number of receivers zzso zzso zzso values are shown to vary zzso within a bound of zzso with respect to the true zzso values as a result of noise correlations between zzso
