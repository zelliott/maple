The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of additional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament zzso tear and evaluation of zzso remnant zzso 

We zzso reviewed the records of 54 zzso Three independent readers evaluated the MR images by the use of three zzso zzso zzso images only zzso zzso zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso images zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso images zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for the diagnosis of an zzso tear and the detection of the condition of the zzso remnant tissue by the use of each method were calculated in comparison with zzso findings as the reference zzso 

The zzso records revealed 27 knees with intact zzso and 27 with torn zzso Among the 27 knees with torn zzso 9 did not have continuous remnant tissue and 18 had certain remnant tissue attached to the zzso or the zzso cruciate zzso The zzso and zzso of methods B and C for diagnosing an zzso tear were higher than those for method zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of method C for the detection of zzso remnant tissue were higher than those for method A and zzso 

Additional use of zzso zzso improved the accuracy of diagnosis of zzso tear and showed a reasonable level of efficacy in detecting zzso remnant zzso 

Level IV zzso zzso
