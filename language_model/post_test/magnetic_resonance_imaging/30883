This study evaluated the long-term follow-up results of balloon zzso zzso in adolescent and adult patients with discrete zzso of the zzso 

Although the immediate and intermediate term results of BA for patients with zzso zzso zzso have been encouraging, there is a paucity of data on long-term follow-up zzso 

This basis of this study was follow-up of 49 patients zzso age, 22 zzso 7 zzso undergoing BA for discrete zzso at median zzso of zzso years, including cardiac zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso 

No early or late deaths zzso zzso zzso produced a reduction in peak zzso zzso from 66 zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 months later revealed a residual zzso of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Four patients zzso with zzso initial outcome with peak zzso zzso zzso zzso had successful repeat zzso zzso developed at the site of zzso in four patients zzso zzso resonance imaging follow-up results revealed no new aneurysm or appreciable changes in the size of pre-existing zzso and no zzso was zzso Also, no appreciable changes in the zzso zzso across the zzso site were zzso The blood pressure had zzso without medication in 31 zzso of the 49 zzso 

zzso results of BA for discrete zzso are excellent and should be considered as first option for treatment of this zzso
