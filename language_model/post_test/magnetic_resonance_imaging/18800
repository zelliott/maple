In subjects with mood disorders, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso has shown prefrontal cortical metabolism deficits, including in a zzso region in subjects with familial zzso The authors applied a zzso challenge method to study zzso response in this region to zzso challenge in familial major zzso 

The study group consisted of 19 depressed subjects with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, all of whom had at least one first-degree relative with history of major depression, and 10 healthy volunteers with similar age and gender zzso PET images were acquired under zzso and challenge conditions, and zzso zzso scans were also zzso Group comparisons of zzso and zzso data were zzso Ratings of acute mood change during zzso challenge were compared with the imaging zzso 

Within zzso area 32, a zzso metabolism deficit in the depressed subjects on zzso day was observed by zzso analysis, but no zzso deficit was found in the zzso regions zzso Under challenge, both groups suppressed metabolism zzso Within the patient group, the correlation between acute mood improvement during challenge and greater zzso suppression approached zzso 

In familial mood disorders, a zzso prefrontal cortical deficit in baseline metabolism is not due to altered structural volume, and the response to zzso challenge appears zzso of acute mood zzso The potential to predict treatment response can be tested by a combined challenge and treatment zzso
