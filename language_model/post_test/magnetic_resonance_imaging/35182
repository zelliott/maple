zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments determining the zzso structure of visual zzso have commonly been performed on young adults, who are assumed to be able to maintain steady fixation throughout the trial zzso The authors zzso the effects of age and fixation stability on the quality of zzso maps of primary visual zzso 

With the use of a zzso zzso zzso the authors measured cortical activity in six older and six younger normally sighted participants observing an expanding zzso zzso stimulus of 30 degrees zzso The area of flattened primary visual zzso zzso showing any blood oxygen zzso zzso activity to the visual stimulus and the area responding to the central zzso degrees of the stimulus zzso to the central ring of our zzso were zzso zzso stability was measured while participants observed the same stimuli outside the scanner using an infrared zzso 

There were no age-related changes in the area of zzso However, the proportion of zzso active to our visual stimulus was lower for the older observers than for the younger observers zzso activity: zzso of zzso area for older observers, zzso for younger zzso P zzso zzso This effect was more pronounced for the central zzso degrees of the target zzso subjects, zzso younger subjects, zzso P zzso zzso No significant relationship existed between fixation stability and age or the magnitude of activity in the primary visual zzso 

Although the cortical area remains zzso healthy older persons show less zzso activity in zzso than do younger zzso zzso variations in fixation stability do not have a significant effect on the accuracy of experiments to determine the zzso structure of the visual zzso
