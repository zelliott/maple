An imaging method is presented to measure the zzso zzso The sequence zzso uses the simultaneous acquisition of a spin echo and several zzso echoes with the same intensity except for diffusion zzso The optimal number of zzso echoes was calculated to minimize the diffusion zzso error zzso D values obtained in zzso and in zzso were in good agreement with those from the zzso sequence zzso zzso Motion zzso zzso The total acquisition time is half that of the classic zzso zzso
