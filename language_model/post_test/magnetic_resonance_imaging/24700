Chemical zzso zzso separation method zzso zzso resonance frequency difference to decompose signals into water and fat partitions in magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a zzso zzso It provides an effective way to measure fat zzso or to suppress fat signal which might obscure underlying zzso zzso zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and zzso zzso zzso with zzso fat spectral zzso has been zzso Recent studies have discussed the performance of this zzso assuming that the zzso and relative zzso of fat zzso are constant among all zzso However, the fat zzso vary in different zzso thus a zzso method which estimates the fat spectrum directly from the data provides more accurate zzso In this work, we zzso the performance of zzso zzso zzso with zzso fat spectrum by theoretical zzso zzso and experiments, and find optimal echo time increments which provide reliable zzso zzso
