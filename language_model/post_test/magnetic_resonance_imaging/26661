zzso reports of intended behavior are commonly used to draw conclusions about real zzso A fundamental question in decision zzso is whether the same type of valuation and choice zzso are performed in hypothetical and real zzso We investigated this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects made real and hypothetical choices about purchases of consumer zzso We found that activity in common areas of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso correlated with behavioral measures of the stimulus value of the goods in both types of zzso Furthermore, we found that activity in these regions was stronger in response to the stimulus value signals in the real choice zzso The findings suggest that the difference between real and hypothetical choice is primarily attributable to variations in the value zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and not attributable to the use of different valuation systems, or to the zzso of stronger stimulus value signals in the hypothetical zzso
