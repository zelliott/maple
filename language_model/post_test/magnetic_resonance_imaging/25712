To study the changes in zzso during long-term zzso therapy by means of serial MR imaging, and to correlate the findings to the serum zzso zzso zzso 

Thirteen patients with zzso were studied before and during zzso zzso six to 11 MR examinations were performed with a duration of follow-up of 22 to 74 zzso zzso size, extension, relationship to adjacent structures, and signal intensity patterns were zzso Signal intensity ratios and zzso values were calculated in areas of apparently solid tumor zzso 

zzso effectively reduced the size of all zzso the size reduction was already significant at 1 week, but often continued for several zzso zzso during therapy was seen in three zzso The development of zzso zzso parallel to increasing zzso zzso into the zzso was a common finding, but was not correlated to visual zzso Signal intensity patterns corresponding to zzso zzso or necrosis were frequently observed, and transitions from one pattern to another were zzso zzso occurred mainly in tumors corresponding to high initial serum zzso zzso After 1 year of therapy, there was a significant increase in zzso values, indicating an increased water content in residual solid tumor zzso 

MR is valuable for follow-up in zzso therapy of zzso and provides new information on the tumor size changes, the inner structure of the tumors, and the zzso zzso
