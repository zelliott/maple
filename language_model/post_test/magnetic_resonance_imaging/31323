To zzso investigate zzso changes in the zzso white matter zzso of patients presenting with clinically isolated syndromes zzso suggestive of multiple sclerosis zzso and to correlate these changes to conventional MR imaging findings in terms of MR imaging zzso 

zzso MR imaging of the brain and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were performed in 31 patients presenting with zzso and in 20 controls using a zzso 0 T MR zzso MR imaging criteria and International Panel criteria were assessed based on imaging, clinical and zzso zzso zzso ratios and absolute zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso were correlated with the fulfilled MR imaging zzso 

In comparison to the control group, the zzso group showed significantly decreased mean zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso changes could not be detected regarding zzso zzso and zzso No significant correlations between absolute zzso zzso and MR imaging criteria were zzso Patients with and without a zzso dissemination in space showed no significant differences of their zzso zzso 

As assessed by zzso a significant zzso damage already occurs during the first zzso episode in patients with zzso Conventional MR imaging in terms of diagnostic imaging criteria does not significantly reflect zzso disease activity in terms of zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso
