The first objective was to investigate the correlations between anthropometrical zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso in two zzso differing in age using magnetic resonance imaging zzso as zzso A second objective was to investigate the potential usage of abdominal diameters in practical zzso of zzso tissue compartments using these zzso 

zzso of body mass index, waist zzso zzso abdominal diameter zzso zzso and zzso abdominal diameter zzso zzso were obtained from 336 volunteers of age zzso zzso Manual zzso of zzso and SAT from single slice zzso at the zzso level were used as zzso The abdominal diameters were measured from the MR zzso Linear correlations between the anthropometrical zzso and the reference were zzso 

zzso zzso showed the strongest correlation to zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to give information about the amount of SAT zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso spanned by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was strongly correlated to the total amount of zzso tissue zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Strong correlations were found between zzso and zzso abdominal zzso assessed using zzso and zzso and SAT, zzso These results suggest the use of abdominal diameters in practical zzso of zzso and SAT zzso
