Adolescent idiopathic zzso zzso is a spinal zzso with unknown zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso zzso abnormalities are associated with zzso The objective of this prospective study was to characterize systematically zzso changes in patients with left zzso zzso vs right zzso zzso and healthy control subjects by using zzso zzso 

Our current study involved 9 girls with left zzso zzso and 20 girls with right zzso zzso vs 11 and 17 matched female control subjects, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to analyze the MR images aligned with a specific brain template of local adolescent zzso The statistical zzso test was used in zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso test was applied in zzso 

Using zzso we found statistically significant differences zzso zzso zzso in the white matter zzso of the zzso of the corpus zzso and left internal capsule zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso In contrast, no significant differences were observed between patients with right zzso zzso and control zzso 

White matter zzso in the corpus zzso and left internal zzso responsible for zzso communication and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso respectively, were found to be significantly lower in left zzso zzso compared with control zzso however, this was not the case in right zzso zzso Confirmation of the findings is required in future research, which needs to evaluate the relationship of white matter zzso to curve zzso zzso and prognosis in patients with zzso with zzso significance and possible therapeutic zzso
