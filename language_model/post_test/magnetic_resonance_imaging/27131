The specific zzso rate zzso is an important safety zzso limiting many MR protocols with respect to the achievable contrast and scan zzso Parallel transmission enables control of the zzso field in space and time and hence allows for zzso zzso However, a zzso exists between zzso pulse performance and zzso zzso To overcome this problem, in this work, parallel transmit zzso zzso are adapted to the position in sampling zzso In the central zzso highly homogeneous but zzso zzso zzso settings are used to achieve optimal performance and zzso In the outer zzso the zzso requirement is relaxed to reduce the average zzso of the zzso The approach was zzso verified on zzso and volunteers using field echo and spin echo zzso A reduction of the zzso by zzso was achieved without compromising image zzso
