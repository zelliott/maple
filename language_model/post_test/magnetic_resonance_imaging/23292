Reversal learning refers to the ability to inhibit or switch responding to an object when the zzso contingency zzso zzso in this process are related to social zzso zzso and a number of psychiatric zzso A range of neural regions play a role in this process, including zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso However, determining the specific functional contribution of each region has proved difficult, in part because reversal learning involves multiple cognitive zzso such as error zzso zzso responding to formerly rewarded zzso and overcoming avoidance of previously punished zzso We used zzso and an experimental task adapted from a recent zzso study in zzso to parse neural responding to zzso of reversal learning during choice and feedback trial zzso zzso processing was associated with increased activity in zzso zzso and zzso whether participants were overcoming zzso zzso zzso or performing classic response zzso zzso activity in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso was associated with zzso processing for response zzso but not overcoming zzso zzso there was significantly greater activity in anterior zzso during zzso processing in overcoming avoidance compared to response zzso A conjunction analysis confirmed that a striking overlap in activity was observed across the three conditions in zzso zzso and zzso The results are consistent with zzso of zzso function that emphasize modulating zzso maps rather than purely response zzso The approach has implications for models of prefrontal function and zzso perspectives on a range of zzso abnormalities associated with zzso in decision zzso
