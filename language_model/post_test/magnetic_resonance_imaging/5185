Use of zzso zzso imaging zzso is an important tool in diagnosing and predicting the course of multiple sclerosis zzso Application of zzso imaging strategies has the potential to increase detection of magnetic resonance imaging zzso disease zzso This study investigated the superiority of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso standardized protocols in detecting zzso enhancing zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

A standard protocol was defined as a zzso scan with a zzso of zzso and a zzso scanning delay after zzso An zzso protocol was defined as a zzso zzso zzso using a triple dose of zzso 20 zzso scan zzso and using an zzso saturated zzso transfer pulse to reduce the background zzso Fourteen zzso zzso patients and 3 healthy controls zzso were scanned with zzso standardized and a zzso zzso protocols in random order over 72 zzso 

There were 47 zzso zzso in the zzso patients on zzso zzso and 34 on zzso standard zzso a zzso zzso There was a significant increase in zzso zzso volume zzso detected with the zzso protocol zzso zzso with zzso of the mean zzso zzso detected only on the zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso were detected in HC on either zzso 

The zzso zzso protocol is a useful technique for increasing sensitivity of zzso to detect zzso zzso
