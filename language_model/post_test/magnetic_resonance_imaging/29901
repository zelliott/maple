The aim of this study was to create an experimental model of disc zzso that closely zzso human disc zzso In six domestic zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus zzso was zzso Three months zzso zzso testing was performed on the zzso motion zzso and zzso pressure was measured in the intervening zzso zzso and zzso examinations were made on the excised zzso and adjacent zzso A significant reduction in water content was observed in the outer anterior zzso of the zzso zzso In the nucleus, the zzso content was significantly reduced, as well as the zzso although not zzso The nucleus lost its zzso structure and was zzso and there was zzso of zzso zzso zzso pressure in the nucleus was significantly lower in the zzso zzso In conclusion, experimental zzso of the zzso disc induced by zzso penetration resembled human disc zzso as exemplified by zzso and structural zzso
