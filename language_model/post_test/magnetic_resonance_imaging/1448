Five cases of adrenal cortical zzso examined with magnetic resonance zzso are zzso Clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso scans, and final zzso findings were reviewed in each zzso All masses were zzso compared to the liver on zzso images and became zzso compared to the liver on zzso zzso Signal intensity of adrenal masses, fat, and liver were zzso zzso and zzso signal intensity ratios were then zzso All the masses were readily identified with zzso The MR also demonstrated displacement or invasion of adjacent zzso as well as liver zzso The inferior zzso zzso was also identified in each zzso Even though there were no consistent MR findings to diagnose adrenal cortical zzso accurately, superior blood vessel identification and zzso capabilities may make MR the imaging zzso of choice in evaluating the extent of disease and in planning surgical zzso
