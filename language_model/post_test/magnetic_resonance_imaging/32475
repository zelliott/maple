zzso involvement in zzso syndrome is mainly characterized by progressive zzso of the zzso zzso Whether left zzso dysfunction is present in these patients is not clear at zzso 

zzso left zzso function in patients with zzso syndrome, free of significant zzso heart disease, using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso 

A total of 26 zzso patients zzso zzso 12 zzso without significant zzso heart disease, and 26 zzso and zzso controls were zzso Left zzso volumes and ejection fraction were measured with magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso function parameters were assessed using conventional zzso and zzso When compared to controls, zzso patients showed impairment of left zzso zzso function as expressed by a reduced ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso an increased zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced peak zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and lateral zzso wall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function was impaired with an increased zzso time of the E wave zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peak early zzso zzso at the zzso valve zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data provide evidence for mild, but significant impairment of left zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso patients, not related to zzso heart zzso
