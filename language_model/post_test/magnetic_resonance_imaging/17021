A new automatic zzso zzso scheme that combines level set shape modeling and active appearance modeling zzso is zzso Since different MR image contrasts can yield complementary information, zzso images can be incorporated into the active appearance modeling to improve zzso zzso During active appearance zzso the weighting of each contrast is zzso to account for the potentially varying contribution of each image while zzso the model parameters that zzso to the shape and appearance zzso in order to minimize the difference between the zzso test images and the ones zzso from the shape and appearance zzso As zzso modeling techniques are dependent on the initial alignment of training data, we compare zzso linear alignment of whole brain, zzso linear alignment of a local volume of interest and zzso zzso alignment of a local volume of zzso The proposed zzso scheme can be used to segment human zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have weak intensity contrast with their background in zzso The experiments demonstrate that zzso alignment of training data yields the best results and that zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso images yields better zzso results than any single zzso In a zzso cross validation with zzso young normal subjects, the method yields a mean zzso zzso of zzso with zzso correlation zzso zzso of zzso for HC and a mean zzso zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso for AG between manual and automatic zzso
