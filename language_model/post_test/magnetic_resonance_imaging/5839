To estimate magnetic field variations induced from zzso interface geometry and remove their effects from zzso imaging zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso field zzso method is used to calculate the field zzso arising from zzso interface zzso This is accomplished by manually drawing or automatically detecting the zzso the zzso zzso and the head zzso The difference in zzso zzso between brain tissue and air spaces is then calculated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso data are corrected by zzso the predicted phase from the original phase zzso zzso phase images are then used to perform the zzso zzso 

zzso improvement in the zzso zzso data is demonstrated, most notably in the frontal and zzso regions and to a lesser extent at the boundary of the zzso Specifically, there is much less dropout of signal after phase correction near zzso zzso making it possible to see vessels and structures that were often incorrectly removed by the conventional zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso field zzso method is a powerful zzso background phase removal method for improving zzso images, providing clearer images of the zzso and the zzso zzso
