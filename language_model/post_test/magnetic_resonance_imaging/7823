zzso zzso zzso is critical for motivational zzso We assessed whether disruption of zzso synthesis in healthy controls using an zzso zzso devoid of zzso precursors zzso depletion zzso would blunt recruitment of the nucleus zzso zzso by zzso Sixteen controls zzso each of a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso control zzso in two laboratory zzso Five hours after consumption of each drink, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed anticipatory cues to respond to a target to either win money or avoid losing zzso zzso did not exert main effects on mood or on task behavior, but affected brain zzso In right zzso zzso blunted zzso by anticipation of high zzso In left zzso recruitment anticipating high rewards was modulated by individual differences in mood change across the zzso drink day, where subjects whose mood worsened following zzso zzso to zzso mood change under zzso zzso also showed lower zzso under zzso conditions relative to zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso blunted the zzso spatial extent of zzso zzso by reward zzso Finally, loss outcomes activated anterior zzso under zzso conditions but not under zzso zzso These data indicate that: zzso dietary depletion of zzso precursors will blunt zzso zzso activity, and zzso in controls, synthetic pathways of this zzso maintain sufficient zzso capacity to resist an effect on motivated zzso Additional studies are needed to determine if clinical populations would show similar resistance to behavioral effects of zzso
