Modern zzso safely and reliably diagnoses stroke and provides information for outcome zzso However, some patients with clinical stroke have no zzso zzso on zzso and other patients are not fit for such zzso zzso we evaluated the potential of plasma DNA and serum zzso protein zzso to predict zzso mortality and morbidity in patients with negative zzso zzso Patients with zzso symptoms but negative zzso results were zzso Both plasma and serum were collected from each patient for plasma DNA and serum zzso zzso The primary outcome measures were zzso mortality and morbidity using the zzso modified Rankin score zzso zzso patients were recruited to the zzso zzso zzso patients were classified as zzso zzso grades zzso The median plasma DNA concentration of this group of patients was significantly higher than that of patients with zzso zzso grades zzso Median serum zzso protein zzso did not show significant differences between the two zzso Plasma DNA zzso zzso 800 zzso have a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for predicting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an area under the receiver operator characteristic zzso curve of zzso By comparison, serum zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso have a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for predicting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the area under the curve is zzso Plasma DNA concentration predicts zzso morbidity and mortality in patients with negative zzso and may be more effective than zzso protein zzso
