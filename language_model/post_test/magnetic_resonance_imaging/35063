The objective of our study was to assess the negative zzso value zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and to determine the role of zzso in screening for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We zzso included 160 zzso scans done as zzso investigations in 119 patients with zzso over a zzso zzso Two zzso independently classified the zzso scans as strongly suggesting zzso zzso zzso showing benign zzso zzso zzso zzso showing no zzso zzso Group) or zzso they assigned a diagnostic confidence score zzso using a zzso zzso The reference standard was zzso or results of follow-up zzso Mean follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso 

The zzso disagreed for two scans zzso zzso zzso Of 112 scans zzso zzso Group zzso zzso zzso and zzso Group zzso zzso zzso 11 were excluded (3 patients lost to follow-up and 8 who died with no known zzso while a zzso was detected during follow-up in 8 patients, yielding a zzso of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The zzso was in the 4-6 range zzso zzso for only 6 zzso zzso 

zzso is reliable and zzso Its high zzso suggests a role as a zzso investigation after zzso for zzso zzso
