This study compared brain white matter integrity in two groups of patients with zzso anxiety zzso 

zzso patients with zzso stress disorder zzso 20 with generalized anxiety disorder zzso and 28 healthy controls were assessed on diffusion zzso zzso 

As compared to healthy controls, increased fractional zzso zzso in left superior frontal zzso in zzso patients, and increased zzso in right zzso zzso in zzso subjects were zzso Furthermore, patients with zzso showed reduced zzso in right anterior zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso However, there was no significant correlation between the zzso value of any altered region and the severity of zzso or zzso 

The sample studied can be considered zzso Gender and educational level were not zzso among the zzso 

We tentatively speculate that abnormal white matter integrity of right anterior zzso zzso is an important zzso marker of zzso that zzso it from other anxiety disorders such as zzso
