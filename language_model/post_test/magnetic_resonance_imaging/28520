This paper describes a zzso procedure for creating a surface model on the basis of pattern recognition in images produced by nuclear spin zzso A local search zzso that recognizes the entire profile of the relevant object starting from a point determined zzso by the user is zzso The pattern zzso thus recognized is zzso by a mathematical zzso By including the adjacent zzso a surface model can be zzso The main focus is on the rapid identification of the pattern and the prior preparation of the data used as input for the surface zzso The human shoulder serves as an example to verify the zzso
