Conventional CT or zzso has low accuracy in assessing chest wall invasion in patients with peripheral lung zzso For zzso evaluation of chest wall invasion by peripheral lung cancer, respiratory dynamic zzso zzso was carried out in 98 patients in whom conventional CT scan showed that the zzso was abutting the zzso surface, but there was no evidence of zzso zzso zzso We used zzso MR zzso zzso MR images were acquired by snapshot fast field echo sequence zzso time zzso 8, echo time zzso 3, flip angle zzso zzso and 25 consecutive images were taken while the patient took deep zzso These images were evaluated in zzso mode to assess zzso movement along the chest zzso zzso patients underwent surgical zzso of the zzso and zzso MR findings were compared with those in pathological zzso zzso MR showed free zzso movement along the chest wall in 34 zzso At pathological examination, the zzso MR findings were proved correct in all zzso zzso 20 patients had chest wall invasion and their zzso MR was positive zzso zzso There were seven zzso results among the 41 patients without chest wall invasion zzso zzso zzso MR may improve the accuracy of conventional CT scan or zzso in the prediction of chest wall invasion of lung cancer, especially in patients in whom the results of conventional CT scan or zzso appear zzso in the presence of a peripheral mass abutting the chest wall surface without obvious chest wall zzso
