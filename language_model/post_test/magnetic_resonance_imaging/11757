As prior studies zzso zzso factors for various zzso spinal zzso in mixed spinal regions, age groups or zzso their zzso and conclusions were zzso The objective of this study was to determine zzso factors for worsened cervical or zzso spinal zzso alignment following zzso or zzso for primary zzso spinal zzso zzso in zzso 

In this retrospective study, patients treated between 1980 and 1998 were zzso Changes in spinal alignment at the last follow-up compared to the zzso state were zzso zzso zzso were age, zzso spinal zzso procedure types zzso or zzso number of zzso zzso surgery of C2 or zzso zzso zzso grade, presence of zzso neurological deficit and zzso zzso 

There were 27 zzso The mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso and the mean duration of follow-up was zzso years zzso zzso zzso In the zzso surgical group zzso zzso zzso alignment worsened zzso in 3 zzso The number of zzso operated upon had a statistically significant impact on the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso surgical group zzso zzso zzso alignment worsened in 9 zzso zzso types were statistically significantly different, with zzso associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All 5 patients who had spinal fusion for worsened zzso alignment were in the zzso zzso no patients in the zzso group required spinal fusion zzso zzso zzso Other zzso factors did not reach statistical significance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso spinal zzso alignment following zzso or zzso and the need for spinal fusion is more common in the zzso region than in the zzso zzso In the zzso region, operation on a greater number of zzso tends to increase the risk of worsened zzso In the zzso region, zzso is associated with worsened zzso while zzso reduces this zzso also, zzso zzso zzso tends to increase the risk of worsened alignment zzso
