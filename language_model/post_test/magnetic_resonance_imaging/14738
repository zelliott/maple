To introduce zzso for effective zzso of teeth zzso zzso 

To construct zzso zzso process based on zzso zzso zzso zzso a level set method was used to segment the initial boundary from the region determined by user in the reference zzso zzso both crown and root of the tooth were segmented by the improved level set method which took the information of the former zzso result as constraint zzso Finally, the improved level set based on the information of the former and later zzso results was executed for the second time to improve the accuracy of zzso in which, the zzso of the overlapping ratio was zzso 

The accuracy was zzso for the zzso and was increased to zzso for the zzso Compared to the two other methods, the accuracy of the zzso provided was improved significantly zzso zzso zzso 

The proposed zzso can effectively achieve the zzso of teeth zzso image and has a great improvement on zzso
