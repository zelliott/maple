The hypothesis that the failing heart may be zzso is supported in part by observations of reduced rates of zzso zzso zzso synthesis through the zzso zzso zzso reaction, the primary zzso energy zzso in patients with heart failure zzso Although zzso models have been used to probe zzso zzso it has not been possible to zzso measure the rate of zzso synthesis through zzso in the in zzso mouse zzso The purpose of this work was to exploit zzso zzso localized magnetic resonance zzso techniques to measure zzso flux through zzso in in zzso mouse hearts and determine the extent of any reductions in zzso zzso 

The Triple zzso Time zzso Transfer zzso magnetic resonance zzso method of measuring zzso zzso was first validated in skeletal muscle, rendering similar results to conventional zzso transfer magnetic resonance zzso In normal mouse hearts, the in zzso zzso zzso constant, zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the rate of zzso synthesis through zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis through zzso by 51% zzso zzso zzso values analogous to those in failing human zzso 

Despite the small size and high zzso heart rate, the zzso synthesis rate through zzso is similar in zzso in zzso and human hearts and comparably reduced in zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso shares fundamental energetic similarities with human zzso this model and new magnetic resonance zzso approach promise a powerful means to zzso probe altered zzso in zzso
