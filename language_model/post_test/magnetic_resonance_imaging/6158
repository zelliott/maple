The vascular effects of zzso treatment may pose problems for evaluating brain tumor response based on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso We used serial dynamic zzso zzso at 12 T to assess vascular responses to zzso versus steroid zzso zzso rats with zzso zzso human zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso with zzso a solely zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso followed by zzso dynamic zzso zzso to measure vascular zzso zzso were zzso before and after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with the zzso agent zzso or the zzso zzso zzso agent zzso was seen rapidly after zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the blood volume and decreased zzso in tumors as determined by increased zzso zzso A single dose of 45 zzso zzso resulted in changes analogous to zzso given in an extremely high dose (12 zzso per zzso and was significantly more effective than zzso at 2 zzso per zzso We conclude that dynamic zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to assess cerebral blood volume, along with dynamic zzso MR to assess vascular zzso hold promise in more accurately detecting therapeutic responses to zzso zzso
