zzso imaging studies in humans and monkeys have shown zzso regions in the zzso cortex, in particular for faces and zzso Although the zzso regions have been well studied in humans, little is understood about the functional properties of such regions in zzso To address this, we first mapped zzso zzso in the visual zzso of four zzso monkeys in a block design zzso study and identified two regions in the middle and anterior Superior zzso zzso zzso that were more strongly activated by monkey bodies compared to zzso manmade zzso These two regions partially overlapped with regions that were more activated by faces than manmade zzso zzso using an zzso single image zzso design we measured the zzso to 200 images of 10 stimulus classes zzso bodies, human bodies, zzso birds, monkey faces, human faces, zzso sculptures, zzso and two sets of control zzso zzso analyses showed that both zzso regions primarily distinguished faces from other inanimate and animate objects, including zzso Another distinction was present between inanimate objects and bodies in the middle zzso body zzso The zzso zzso was less pronounced in the anterior compared to the middle zzso zzso zzso In addition, both zzso regions showed further selectivity for different zzso of the broad body category such as zzso human, zzso and zzso Overall, these data indicate strong spatial zzso of animate categories in the zzso zzso with a surprisingly marked distinction between faces and bodies within zzso regions which was stronger than between manmade objects and zzso
