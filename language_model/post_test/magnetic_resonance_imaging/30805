Recent innovations in the pharmaceutical drug discovery environment have generated new chemical entities with the potential to become disease zzso drugs for zzso zzso Regulatory agencies acknowledge that such compounds may be granted a zzso indication, providing they demonstrate that they can slow down disease zzso progression would be zzso by a surrogate for structural change, by measuring joint space narrowing zzso on plain zzso with the zzso that this delayed zzso translate into a clinical benefit for the zzso Recently, new technology has been developed to detect a structural change of the zzso joint earlier than conventional zzso 

The Group for the zzso of Ethics and Excellence in Science zzso organized a working party to assess whether these new technologies may be used as surrogates to plain zzso for assessment of zzso 

zzso includes academic scientists, members of regulatory authorities and representatives from the pharmaceutical zzso After an extensive search of the international literature, from 1980 to 2002, two experts meetings were organized to prepare a resource document for regulatory zzso This document includes recommendations for a possible update of guidelines for the registration of new chemical entities in zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso is now used to measure parameters of cartilage zzso and integrity in zzso zzso While some data are encouraging, correlation between short-term changes in cartilage structure observed with zzso and long-term zzso or clinical changes are zzso zzso the zzso suggests that zzso maybe used as an outcome in phase II studies, but that further data is needed before accepting zzso as a primary zzso in phase III clinical zzso zzso markers of bone and cartilage zzso are being tested to predict zzso and measure disease zzso Recently published data are promising but validation as surrogate zzso for zzso disease progression requires additional zzso The zzso suggests that zzso markers remain limited to zzso of zzso studies or as secondary zzso in phase II and III clinical zzso However, the zzso emphasizes the importance of acquiring additional information on zzso markers in order to help better understand the mode of action of drugs to be used in zzso Regulatory agencies consider that evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes is critical for approval of zzso Time to total joint replacement surgery is probably the most relevant clinical zzso for the evaluation of efficacy of a zzso However, at this time, time to surgery can not be used in clinical trials because of bias by non zzso factors like patient willingness for surgery or economic zzso At this stage, it appears that zzso should demonstrate a significant difference compared to zzso Benefit should be measured by 3 zzso zzso zzso pain and zzso Secondary zzso should include the percentage of patients who are zzso (or zzso The definition of a zzso patient would be someone with progression of zzso over a period of 2-3 years or who has a significant worsening in pain and/or function, based on validated zzso zzso The definition of the clinically relevant zzso points for pain and function must be based on data evaluating the natural history of the disease zzso zzso or zzso groups from long-term zzso These zzso points should reflect a high zzso for an individual patient, to later require joint zzso 

zzso has outlined a set of guidelines for the development of a zzso for zzso Although these guidelines are subject to change as new information becomes available, the information above is based on the present knowledge in the field with the addition of expert zzso
