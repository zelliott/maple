zzso affective disorder zzso can have its onset during childhood, but the diagnosis may be difficult to establish on the basis of clinical findings zzso Our purpose was to determine whether zzso MR zzso can be used to identify abnormalities in the brain of children with zzso 

Ten children, ages 6 to 12 years, underwent clinical testing to establish the diagnosis of zzso After a drug zzso period, all patients underwent MR zzso in which a TE of 135 was used along with a zzso placement in both frontal and zzso zzso during a single zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lipids were zzso with respect to the zzso zzso peak to obtain ratios of values of peak zzso These data were compared with those obtained in 10 zzso control zzso To corroborate our data, five children with zzso also underwent zzso MR zzso studies of the frontal zzso with parameters similar to those used in the zzso zzso 

All children with zzso had elevated levels of zzso in both frontal zzso and zzso zzso relative to the control zzso Children with zzso had elevated zzso levels in the frontal zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were similar for all locations in both zzso zzso MR zzso studies in five children with zzso confirmed the presence of elevated lipids in the frontal zzso 

Our preliminary observations suggest that MR zzso may show abnormalities in children with zzso not found in unaffected control zzso It remains to be established whether these abnormalities are a signature of the disease and can be used as a screening zzso
