White matter zzso zzso declines have been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease and zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso However, the pattern of zzso zzso changes in zzso after controlling for zzso zzso is zzso Here, we address this issue through joint consideration of zzso zzso in fractional zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso volume in zzso and gray matter zzso Participants were 18 individuals with zzso and 24 healthy zzso zzso analyses of diffusion zzso imaging data was carried out using zzso spatial statistics zzso and zzso analyses of high-resolution structural data was conducted using zzso based zzso After controlling for zzso zzso the main pattern of zzso findings indicated reduced fractional zzso with only small zzso in mean zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso declines bordered and/or were connected to gray matter structures showing zzso zzso However, none of the potential relationships between zzso integrity and volume in connected gray matter structures was zzso and adding fractional zzso information improved the zzso accuracy of zzso compared to the use of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso declines provide unique information not captured by zzso measures that may aid the magnetic resonance imaging contribution to zzso zzso
