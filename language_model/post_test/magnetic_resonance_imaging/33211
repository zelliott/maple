Blood oxygen zzso zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been shown to be able to detect zzso zzso zzso However, validation of zzso zzso against fractional flow reserve zzso is zzso The aim of our study was to analyze the potential diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso in comparison to zzso measured zzso which served as gold standard for a zzso significant coronary zzso 

zzso image was performed at rest and during zzso infusion in a zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were analyzed for relative zzso signal intensity increase according to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in the 3 major coronary arteries during zzso infusion in all zzso An zzso was regarded to indicate a significant coronary zzso Relative zzso signal intensity increase was significantly lower in zzso segments supplied by coronary arteries with an zzso compared with segments with an zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and specificity yielded zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging reliably detects zzso significant coronary artery disease and is, thus, an alternative to zzso zzso zzso
