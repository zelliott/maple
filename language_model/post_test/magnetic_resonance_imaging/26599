Previous zzso investigations of major depressive disorder zzso have reported abnormalities in gray matter in several regions, although the results have been inconsistent across zzso Some discrepancies in the results across studies may reflect design limitations such as small sample sizes, whereas others may reflect biological zzso that potentially zzso as differences in clinical zzso For example, it remains unclear whether the abnormalities found in persistently depressed zzso subjects extend to or persist in patients who experience prolonged zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate gray matter zzso differences in zzso zzso participants zzso and zzso zzso zzso participants with zzso compared to healthy controls zzso The zzso density and volume were compared across groups using zzso zzso a quantitative zzso technique, and high-resolution zzso images from 107 zzso 58 zzso and 27 zzso zzso Relative to the HC group the zzso group had reduced zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Relative to the zzso group the zzso group showed reduced zzso in the zzso the zzso the anterior zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the inferior zzso zzso No regions were identified in which the zzso group showed significantly lower zzso compared to the HC group after zzso were corrected for the number of comparisons zzso In zzso patients in the depressed phase of zzso we found evidence of zzso abnormalities in zzso and in zzso prefrontal cortical regions belonging to the zzso zzso These findings, along with the absence of zzso abnormalities in the zzso sample imply a possible link between greater zzso tissue and better clinical zzso zzso with other zzso and zzso zzso studies of zzso we also found evidence of decreased white matter in patients with zzso and zzso
