A magnetic resonance zzso signal shows an inverse correlation with bone zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the possibility of zzso the degree of bone zzso zzso by means of this zzso zzso 

In 25 patients with different zzso disorders and homogeneous bone zzso distribution, the percentage of bone zzso zzso was compared to the MR signal of four zzso zzso in zzso zzso As internal control, the MR signal of the zzso spinal zzso region was zzso The results were expressed as the MR signal ratio zzso mean MR signal of four zzso signal of the spinal zzso 

The correlation zzso zzso between both parameters was zzso zzso zzso zzso All observed values fell within the zzso limits of predicted zzso The mean difference between observed and predicted bone zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso 

The measurement of the MR signal is not easy to zzso since it depends to a large degree on the control zzso The spinal zzso proved to be a satisfactory internal control of the MR zzso Within defined conditions, MR can be useful for a rough estimate of bone zzso zzso in several clinical situations, such as analysis of tumor burden for prognosis of some zzso and the evaluation of response to therapy in both zzso and zzso zzso
