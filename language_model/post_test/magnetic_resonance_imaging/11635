High resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging is uniquely suited for cardiovascular zzso characterization in transgenic zzso Experimental MR scanners with the high magnetic field strength are commonly built with a vertical bore zzso The zzso consequences of a prolonged upright body position in zzso mice are, however, zzso Thus, the purpose of this work was to investigate the influence of a vertical body position on zzso systemic blood pressure and left zzso zzso zzso over zzso We studied six zzso mice at zzso weeks of age zzso weight, zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso on a 37 degrees C warming pad, a zzso zzso was advanced via the right carotid artery into the left zzso Continuous registration of zzso zzso was performed at rest and after tilting of the table to a 90-degree vertical zzso After zzso there was a transient decrease of zzso zzso pressure to zzso of initial values immediately after tilting with return to baseline level within 6 zzso zzso to vertical position had no influence on zzso zzso pressure, heart rate, zzso rate of left zzso pressure increase, and zzso rate of left zzso pressure zzso Over a follow-up period of 60 zzso in vertical position, there were no significant changes in zzso zzso An acute change of body position is fully compensated by a normal zzso response in zzso zzso zzso upright body position exerts no significant changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso high resolution MR studies for cardiovascular zzso characterization in transgenic mice performed on vertical bore MR scanners allow zzso under zzso zzso
