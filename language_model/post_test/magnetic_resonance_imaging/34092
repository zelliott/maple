zzso ultrasound surgery zzso is being developed clinically for the zzso treatment of soft tissue zzso of the zzso zzso liver, zzso muscle and zzso In the work described in this paper, the application of zzso is extended to investigate the potential to induce vascular zzso with the aim of applying the technique to problems in fetal medicine and zzso 

In this feasibility study the zzso of zzso blood flow in zzso is demonstrated using an array of multiple single zzso of zzso zzso focused zzso These were placed in two rows of four zzso at a focal depth of 5 zzso The zzso zzso zzso field spatial peak zzso zzso zzso were placed 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using a zzso Vision zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging scanner with an zzso zzso and intravenous zzso contrast zzso zzso and zzso MR sequences were used to obtain full zzso data sets providing information on soft tissue damage and zzso 

Total vascular zzso was achieved in four of nine cases and significant vascular disruption in five of nine zzso zzso of the zzso technique and long-term studies are now indicated prior to initial clinical application in fetal zzso
