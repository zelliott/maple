zzso cells play an important role in normal brain function and emerging evidence would suggest that their dysfunction may be responsible for some zzso disease zzso zzso of zzso cells is desirable, but there are no clear methods to assess neither their function nor zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is now part of a standardized zzso imaging protocol to assess zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging changes can assist in making a positive diagnosis in a majority of zzso The zzso reported in structural and zzso imaging is predominantly thought to reflect early zzso loss followed by zzso zzso MR zzso for zzso is a being pursued to identify zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso weighted imaging zzso is ideal for acute zzso events, but is not sensitive to either zzso cells or zzso long-term changes found in zzso However, zzso zzso such as diffusion zzso imaging or zzso imaging may shed additional light on zzso zzso function in the zzso The sensitivity and specificity of PET zzso including those targeting zzso cells zzso zzso hold promise in being able to image zzso zzso As the role of zzso zzso in zzso becomes more apparent zzso methods will evolve to assist the zzso and researcher in visualizing their location and zzso
