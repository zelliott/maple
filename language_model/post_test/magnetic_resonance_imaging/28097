Using a zzso T MR imaging unit, zzso and zzso images were obtained before and after zzso administration of zzso zzso iron zzso zzso in order to differentiate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was made from the zzso contrast to noise ratio zzso and visual evaluation of the zzso with reference to signal intensity relative to that of the surrounding zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was on zzso images significantly decreased after zzso administration zzso zzso zzso On zzso images, there was no significant difference in zzso after zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso zzso was significantly increased after zzso administration on both zzso and zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso reflects zzso zzso cellular functions, and is therefore useful in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso without zzso
