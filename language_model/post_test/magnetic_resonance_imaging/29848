In the surrounding of focal zzso brain zzso dysfunctional zzso zones emerge often resulting in pathological zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we recorded brain activity during rest in 23 patients with zzso cortical zzso to find out whether we can zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We measured patients at different times after stroke and partly in a follow-up approach to determine the time course of zzso zzso Using the analysis tool Dynamic Imaging of zzso Sources we zzso zzso maps of zzso power in the zzso zzso zzso Fifteen of 23 patients with cortical strokes showed zzso which was zzso in an area not more than 2 zzso away from the zzso We found this zzso zzso activity in the acute as well as in the chronic stage of zzso zzso zzso of individual patients revealed persistence of zzso zzso activity for months and even zzso No consistent relation between zzso activity and clinical symptoms was zzso Our results indicate that zzso delta activity is common after zzso cortical zzso However, the functional significance remains to be zzso
