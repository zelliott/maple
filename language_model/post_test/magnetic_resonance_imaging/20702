The purpose of this study was primarily to assess the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting zzso cartilage injuries in patients with zzso zzso A secondary purpose was to assess the diagnostic performance of zzso for detection of zzso and zzso zzso 

A cohort of 87 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic zzso and shoulder zzso for instability from 1997 to 2006 were zzso Fifty-five patients zzso underwent zzso with zzso contrast medium and 32 patients zzso underwent zzso without contrast zzso MR images were reviewed by two zzso and interpreted by consensus for the presence of zzso cartilage zzso (including zzso and zzso zzso which were then confirmed by reviewing the operative report and images recorded at zzso 

Mean patient age was zzso years with a mean clinical and zzso follow-up of 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso injuries were detected zzso in 55 patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified zzso in 66 patients zzso and 55 patients zzso zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of zzso zzso cartilage zzso by zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso in detecting zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso in detecting zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was found between zzso examinations with and without zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of zzso cartilage injuries in patients with zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso contrast medium in this study were equally reliable as a zzso method for assessment of zzso cartilage damage of the zzso joint prior to diagnostic zzso
