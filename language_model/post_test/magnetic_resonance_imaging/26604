There is growing evidence that cognitive and motor functions are interrelated and may rely on the development of the same cortical and zzso neural zzso However, no study to date has examined the relationships between brain volume, cognitive ability, and motor ability in typically developing zzso The zzso zzso Study of zzso Brain Development consists of a large, zzso database of structural zzso and performance measures from a battery of zzso assessments from typically developing zzso This zzso provides a unique opportunity to examine relationships between the brain and zzso zzso A secondary analysis was conducted on data from zzso children between the ages of 6 to 13 years with up to 2 measurement occasions zzso testing and zzso zzso Linear mixed effects modeling was employed to account for age and gender effects on the development of specific cortical and zzso volumes as well as behavioral performance measures of zzso Above and beyond the effects of age and zzso significant relationships were found between general cognitive ability zzso and the volume of zzso brain structures zzso and zzso as well as spatial working memory and the zzso In addition, zzso was found to be related to global and frontal gray matter volume as well as zzso gray and white zzso At the behavioral level, general cognitive ability was also found to be related to zzso ability zzso and executive function zzso working zzso These results support the notion that zzso and motor skills may be fundamentally interrelated at both the levels of behavior and brain zzso
