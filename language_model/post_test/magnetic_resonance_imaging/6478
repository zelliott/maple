The zzso skeleton is a target for both zzso and zzso zzso While conventional zzso allows the clear documentation of the late stages of inflammatory changes, magnetic resonance imaging zzso is sensitive enough to depict early inflammatory zzso It is, therefore, of particular importance for zzso and clinicians to know the zzso appearances of inflammatory changes of the zzso skeleton in zzso zzso Typical zzso in zzso zzso and related conditions comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arthritis of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fractures of the zzso zzso spine zzso type of zzso zzso zzso is associated with chronic changes such as zzso zzso zzso bone bridges, zzso zzso of fatty tissue and zzso In addition, acute findings include zzso zzso zzso and the enhancement of the joint space after contrast medium zzso Another important sign of zzso is zzso which affects the zzso and zzso ligaments of the zzso spine and the zzso ligaments in the zzso space of the zzso zzso The main site of manifestation of spinal involvement in zzso arthritis is the cervical zzso Typical changes are the destruction of the zzso complex by zzso tissue with subsequent zzso zzso zzso impression and erosion of the zzso zzso Changes in the lower segments of the cervical spine are destruction of the zzso zzso resulting in the so-called stepladder zzso Because of the uniform response of the zzso complex to different zzso a number of different conditions must be distinguished on the basis of the patient's clinical findings and history in combination with their imaging zzso These conditions comprise degenerative disc disease, septic zzso zzso disease, zzso disease and diffuse idiopathic skeletal zzso zzso
