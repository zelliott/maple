The ability to attend to relevant events and to ignore irrelevant stimuli is crucial to zzso zzso disagree on whether this ability is dependent solely on increased neural zzso for relevant items or whether active ignoring can also play a zzso The authors examined the active ignoring of stimuli using a preview search zzso where irrelevant faces appeared prior to relevant house zzso They found increased zzso in brain regions associated with spatial memory and in zzso zzso areas when participants ignored the irrelevant zzso zzso arose even on trials when only previewed faces appeared, and the magnitude of these differences predicted how well faces were ignored in zzso zzso associated with active ignoring decreased when a secondary task was imposed during the zzso The data reveal a neural marker for the process of actively ignoring the content and locations of irrelevant zzso
