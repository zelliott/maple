To compare water and a zzso zzso zzso preparation as potential oral contrast media for magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the small zzso 

Twenty-two healthy volunteers underwent separate zzso examinations after drinking up to two zzso of water or zzso zzso Small zzso images were obtained every 10 minutes for at least two hours using zzso single shot zzso imaging, including both thick section projection and thin section zzso zzso were evaluated by two zzso in consensus, blinded to the volunteer and contrast details, for arrival at the terminal zzso transit time, and demonstration of small zzso zzso 

The zzso preparation was significantly better than water at reaching the terminal zzso zzso zzso volunteers zzso water zzso volunteers zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the mean transit time zzso 51 zzso 48 minutes, zzso zzso zzso 22 minutes) or in the demonstration of the stomach, zzso and zzso but the zzso preparation was significantly better at demonstrating the zzso zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso preparation is significantly better than water as an oral contrast medium for demonstrating the zzso small zzso during zzso zzso zzso
