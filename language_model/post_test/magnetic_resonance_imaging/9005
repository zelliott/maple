A zzso imaging study of young zzso 

To investigate the prevalence of disc zzso zzso and zzso zzso tears, and zzso changes in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso among young zzso 

Although low back pain in young adulthood is common, the prevalence of spinal zzso findings at this age remains virtually zzso 

The study population was a zzso of the Northern Finland Birth zzso zzso zzso living within 100 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were invited to participate in zzso zzso at 20 to 22 years of age zzso zzso zzso Degree of zzso type of zzso changes, and presence of disc zzso zzso high intensity zone zzso zzso and zzso tears at all zzso levels were zzso 

Three hundred zzso women and 233 men zzso zzso zzso attended the MR zzso zzso was significantly more frequent in men zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as was multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso of disc zzso and zzso tears were zzso and zzso respectively, without gender zzso zzso zzso were more common among women than men zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas zzso were significantly more common among men zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Only 2 disc zzso were observed, one in each zzso All degenerative disc findings were more common at the zzso level except zzso zzso which were most likely at zzso The prevalence of the zzso changes was zzso without gender difference, type I being more common than type zzso Typically, zzso changes were located adjacent to a zzso Grade 4 disc and at the 2 lowest zzso 

Almost half of young Finnish adult aged 21 years had at least one zzso disc, and a quarter had a bulging zzso zzso changes and disc zzso were, however, relatively zzso
