Signal detection in the analysis of blood oxygen zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso may be greatly hindered by cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid movement, and tissue deformation are all associated with the cardiac cycle and all can produce zzso signal zzso Most cognitive zzso studies do not zzso a method of zzso noise reduction, in part because of the lack of information on the regional significance and magnitude of zzso signal zzso in the zzso In this paper we present a topographical description of the regions showing significant contributions of zzso signal zzso The results are highly consistent across subjects and suggest that reduced sensitivity due to zzso noise in the zzso signal is systematically greater in specific areas, typically near major blood zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso were found on average in zzso zzso zzso of zzso Strong influences were found along the zzso zzso system near the zzso areas of the brain, along the middle cerebral artery near the anterior zzso zzso and in the zzso and along the anterior cerebral artery in the anterior zzso zzso in the zzso frontal zzso zzso effects were also observed in the zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso These results identify regions in which zzso will have reduced sensitivity due to increased signal variation produced by cardiac zzso
