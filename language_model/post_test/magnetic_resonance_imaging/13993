zzso processes have been implicated in the zzso of brain damage after zzso In zzso stroke models, focal zzso zzso several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso The individual contribution to zzso tissue damage, however, is largely zzso To address this question, the authors subjected zzso mice zzso to permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso of zzso blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, and blood volume revealed no differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso led to similar cerebral zzso deficits in zzso and zzso mice, excluding differences in the zzso supply territory and zzso However, compared with zzso mice, the mean zzso volume was zzso smaller in zzso mice 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a reduction of zzso zzso zzso within zzso and the zzso border in zzso mice 2 weeks after zzso At the same time point, the authors found an zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso border and zzso in zzso zzso However, these effects on zzso and zzso in zzso mice occurred too late to suggest a protective role in acute zzso zzso Of note: at 6 hours after zzso zzso mice produced significantly less zzso in zzso zzso this might be related to tissue zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso of zzso signaling could be a new acute treatment approach to limit zzso size after zzso
