The zzso and cerebral zzso are connected via zzso zzso zzso connections, which hold a key function in segregating internally and zzso directed awareness zzso Previous zzso studies have revealed altered activities of the zzso after total sleep deprivation zzso However, it is still unclear how zzso impacts on the communication between the zzso and cerebral zzso In this study, we examined changes of zzso functional connectivity after 36 hours of total sleep deprivation by using resting state function zzso zzso 

Fourteen healthy volunteers were recruited and performed zzso scans before and after 36 hours of zzso zzso functional connectivity analysis was employed and differences of zzso functional connectivity were tested between the rested zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We found that the right zzso showed decreased functional connectivity with the right zzso zzso right middle zzso zzso and right superior frontal zzso in the resting brain after zzso when compared with that after normal zzso As to the left thalamus, decreased connectivity was found with the right zzso frontal zzso bilateral middle zzso zzso and left superior frontal zzso 

These findings suggest disruptive changes of the zzso functional connectivity after zzso which may lead to the decline of the zzso level and information integration, and zzso influence the human cognitive zzso
