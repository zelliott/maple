zzso liver transplantation zzso using extended right zzso is associated with complications related to zzso of zzso segment 4 zzso and these complications are associated with poor zzso We zzso analyzed 36 zzso recipients so that we could assess the association of zzso zzso and clinical features with zzso zzso The overall survival rates were zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 3, and 5 years, zzso The recipients were mostly male zzso or zzso and had a median age of 52 years zzso zzso zzso zzso a median body mass index of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ), and a median zzso weight ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complications were diagnosed in zzso of the patients zzso with a median delay of 22 days zzso zzso zzso zzso Secondary zzso complications were seen in 3 of these patients and led to significantly decreased graft survival in comparison with the graft survival of patients without complications zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso Patients developing zzso complications had significantly elevated zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso on zzso day zzso 1 and elevated zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso on zzso 7 and 10 zzso zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso zzso a significantly high risk of developing these complications zzso ratio zzso 42, zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso volume of zzso was extremely variable zzso and did not correlate with zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso complications are risk factors for worse graft survival, and the development of these complications can be anticipated by the early identification of a specific biological profile and a routine zzso zzso
