The aims of this study were to investigate and categorize zzso fiber tract zzso while considering changes in metabolism and integrity of fiber structures using zzso zzso is, PET with zzso and diffusion zzso imaging evaluated by fiber density zzso to correlate categories of fiber zzso with zzso zzso deficits and zzso zzso 

We examined 26 patients with cerebral zzso zzso density data were used to segment zzso fiber structures and were zzso to zzso MR images and PET zzso zzso density and zzso zzso values were evaluated as zzso zzso Four zzso categories were defined on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso normal brain zzso and tissue with attenuated zzso acid zzso zzso density values were grouped in 3 categories for structural zzso zzso normal, and attenuated zzso 

We evaluated and classified 103 zzso fiber structures with 10 patterns of fiber tract zzso zzso structures in zzso zzso and normal brain tissue showed compressed zzso displaced zzso and zzso destroyed zzso zzso zzso zzso acid metabolism was associated only with attenuated fiber zzso Thirteen patients showed white zzso zzso deficits zzso zzso zzso or zzso as initial zzso Three patients showed tumor zzso in the corresponding fiber zzso all the others had zzso or normal brain zzso zzso structures were compressed or attenuated but not zzso The 3 patients with tumor zzso in the corresponding fiber tracts and 1 with compressed fibers in normal brain showed no improvements or worsening of the deficits in the zzso zzso Eight patients with the corresponding fiber tracts in zzso or normal brain areas showed improvement of zzso One patient underwent biopsy zzso 

Our zzso zzso approach provides complementary information and more detailed understanding of zzso fiber tract zzso in zzso which are more complex as described so zzso We presented a zzso model for systematic assessment of these zzso that may be helpful for treatment planning and prediction of patients' zzso
