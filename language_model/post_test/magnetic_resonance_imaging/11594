The objective of this work was to determine the ability of magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso zzso iron oxide zzso particles to provide quantitative measures of inflammation in zzso zzso Mice were injected zzso or zzso with zzso followed by magnetic resonance and zzso assessment of the knee zzso Comparisons were made between MR zzso and zzso in zzso mice and mice with zzso zzso intravenous administration, zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso Administration of zzso zzso resulted in signal loss in the zzso The MR signal intensity could be zzso and correlated with iron zzso in the zzso zzso A marked increase in zzso zzso and a corresponding decrease in signal intensity were observed in zzso compared to zzso zzso Areas of focal signal loss corresponded to zzso of iron zzso by zzso These studies may provide a basis for the clinical application of zzso in arthritis for assessing disease severity and monitoring response to zzso
