We have developed a zzso potent technique for imaging cells in culture and in zzso by expressing a metabolically zzso zzso zzso and visualizing it with labeled zzso zzso The zzso reporter zzso which incorporates a zzso zzso zzso zzso between an zzso signal sequence and a zzso domain, zzso was efficiently zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells with the zzso displayed on the cell zzso zzso expressing the zzso have high sensitivity for magnetic resonance and zzso zzso imaging in zzso after zzso injection of zzso zzso to magnetic zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso agent further increased and prolonged the magnetic resonance zzso This zzso allows zzso real-time imaging of any cell type zzso to express this reporter protein in culture or in zzso
