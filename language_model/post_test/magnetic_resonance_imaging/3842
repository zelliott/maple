zzso zzso and high-resolution imaging of zzso partial pressure of oxygen zzso is a potentially valuable tool in the early diagnosis of pulmonary zzso Several techniques have been proposed for regional measurement of zzso based on the increased zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we explore one such technique by applying a zzso zzso zzso scheme that uses zzso ordering to zzso zzso zzso more zzso This approach addresses the low spatial resolution and long zzso requirements of earlier techniques, allowing zzso zzso to be made over the entire human lung in zzso s with a typical resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a glass syringe phantom were in agreement with independent gas analysis within zzso zzso zzso (R zzso zzso The technique is demonstrated in four human subjects zzso zzso healthy former smoker, healthy smoker, and patient with zzso each zzso six times on 3 different days during a zzso zzso Two independent zzso were performed in each session, consisting of 12 zzso zzso The overall zzso mean across all subjects was zzso zzso zzso zzso and correlated well with zzso zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso rate was consistent with the expected range of 1-2 zzso zzso visual features were observed in zzso maps over different days, as were characteristic differences among the subjects and zzso zzso
