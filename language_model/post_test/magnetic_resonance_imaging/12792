To determine zzso if qualitative and quantitative diffusion zzso imaging zzso metrics of white matter integrity are better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso metrics for discriminating zzso zzso 

Conventional zzso images from 31 consecutive patients with zzso and 12 controls were interpreted by a zzso given only a clinical indication of zzso An expert zzso blinded to zzso findings, determined the clinical diagnosis, as well as zzso severity and asymmetry for each zzso For qualitative analysis, a comparison of the zzso white matter in zzso zzso control patients was made by visual inspection of zzso zzso color zzso zzso For quantitative analysis, zzso of the zzso white matter in the inferior, middle, and superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was attempted using three zzso a region of interest method, a deterministic zzso zzso zzso method, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A statistical comparison of the average fractional zzso zzso in these tracts was made between subject groups, and correlated to clinical diagnosis, severity, and zzso 

Of the 31 consecutive patients with zzso the two largest zzso had a clinical diagnosis of multiple system zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Conventional zzso features, such as degree of zzso zzso correlated with zzso severity, but were neither sensitive nor specific for the zzso zzso zzso was the most accurate and least variable method of the three methods used for determining zzso especially in the zzso Average zzso in all zzso patients was significantly decreased in the zzso SCP and zzso and this decrease correlated to disease zzso zzso zzso correlated to zzso larger zzso zzso zzso and SCP zzso zzso zzso zzso and SCP zzso difference values formed distinct clusters that distinguished zzso from zzso and other zzso zzso 

zzso and quantitative reductions in zzso metrics of white matter integrity in the zzso zzso correlated better to clinical features of patients with sporadic and zzso zzso than conventional structural zzso measures of zzso zzso
