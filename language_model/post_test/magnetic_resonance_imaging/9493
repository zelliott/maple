zzso studies confirm that the zzso B zzso zzso blocks zzso release in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal cortex, and consequently, blocks drug motivated zzso Its mechanism in humans is zzso Here, we used continuous zzso spin labeled zzso zzso zzso to examine zzso effects on blood flow in the human zzso 

zzso subjects (all smokers, 12 zzso were zzso to receive either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A five minute quantitative zzso zzso resting baseline zzso scan was acquired at two time points; prior to the dosing regimen zzso 1) and on the last day of 21 days of drug administration zzso zzso zzso was employed to compare changes in RB from Time 1 to zzso 

zzso diminished cerebral blood flow zzso in the VS and zzso and increased it in the lateral zzso a region involved in suppressing previously rewarded zzso zzso in bilateral zzso was also blunted by zzso zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso at zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso at Time 2 was unchanged in zzso zzso There were no differences between groups in side effects or cigarettes smoked per day (at either time zzso 

zzso zzso actions on regions involved in motivated behavior in humans are reflected in the resting state and provide insight into the underlying mechanism behind its potential to block zzso behavior, in zzso studies, and its putative effectiveness as an zzso agent in zzso
