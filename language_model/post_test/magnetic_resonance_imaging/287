To assess the impairment in daily living activities in older people with age related changes in white matter according to the severity of these zzso 

zzso data collection and follow-up of a cohort of older people undergoing brain magnetic resonance imaging after zzso zzso 

11 European zzso 

zzso zzso older patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in whom brain magnetic resonance imaging showed mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging assessment also included cerebral zzso and zzso 

Transition from no disability zzso as a score of 0 or 1 on the instrumental activities of daily living zzso to disability zzso zzso or death over three year zzso Secondary outcomes were incident zzso and zzso 

Over a mean follow-up period of zzso years zzso zzso median zzso zzso information on the main outcome was available for zzso zzso The annual rate of transition or death was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for patients with mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter zzso log rank test zzso In a Cox model comparing severe with mild changes and adjusted for clinical factors of functional decline, the risk of transition to disability or death was more than twofold higher zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso The other zzso were age group, history of zzso zzso and complaint of gait zzso The effect of severe changes remained significant independently of baseline degree of zzso and number of zzso zzso stroke and zzso only slightly modified this zzso 

The three year results of the zzso study suggest that in older adults who seek medical attention for zzso complaints, severe age related changes in white matter independently and strongly predict rapid global functional zzso
