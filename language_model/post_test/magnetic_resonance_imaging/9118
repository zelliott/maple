The aim was to investigate the relationship between the appearance of double contours on the zzso zzso and changes in zzso disc position after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images of 82 zzso in 41 patients taken before and after treatment were zzso The number of cases showing a double zzso after treatment was compared between the 2 groups with and without disc displacement before treatment, and between the 2 groups with and without reduction in the displacement zzso a comparison was also made among age groups and among 3 groups showing improvement, zzso or no change in displacement after zzso 

All zzso showing a double zzso after treatment showed zzso disc displacement before zzso No double contours were observed after treatment on zzso without zzso disc displacement before zzso All zzso showing a double zzso showed improvement in disc zzso 

The results indicate that a double zzso on the zzso zzso is the result of repositioning of, or zzso improvement in, a displaced zzso zzso
