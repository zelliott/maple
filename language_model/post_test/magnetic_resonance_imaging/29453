We describe the magnetic resonance zzso imaging appearance of the knee zzso and zzso zzso after bilateral zzso zzso transfer and hamstring lengthening surgery in five patients (10 zzso with cerebral zzso zzso models of the path of the transferred zzso were constructed in all zzso MR images of the transferred and zzso zzso were examined and compared with images from ten zzso zzso The models showed that the path of the transferred zzso zzso zzso had a marked angular zzso near the transfer site in all zzso MR imaging demonstrated irregular areas of low signal intensity near the transferred zzso zzso and around the zzso in all zzso Eight of the ten zzso limbs showed evidence of fluid near or around the transferred or zzso zzso This was not observed in the zzso zzso Thus, MR imaging of patients with cerebral zzso after zzso zzso transfer and zzso surgery shows evidence of signal intensity and zzso changes, even several years after zzso
