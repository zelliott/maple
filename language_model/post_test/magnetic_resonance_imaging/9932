zzso in the left primary visual zzso zzso representing the zzso field during text reading has been interpreted as zzso zzso in the process of deciding zzso target for reading zzso zzso words serve the main cue to decide the goal of zzso in zzso We aimed to determine the exact location of this zzso in the zzso and to determine whether the area of the zzso changes according to the location where the next zzso word appears or it is fixed on a certain region in zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we determined the area in zzso representing each zzso on the horizontal zzso of the visual field for each zzso Then we investigated brain zzso while they were reading two sets of Japanese texts that zzso zzso as the zzso In set 1, the distance between the heads of adjacent zzso words was about zzso In set 2, the distance was about zzso From the results of these experiments, we obtained zzso zzso of the area corresponding to each zzso We recorded eye movements simultaneously with the acquisition of zzso zzso The maximum peak of the zzso was found in the region representing about zzso of zzso on the horizontal zzso in the left zzso for each zzso The zzso pattern did not essentially differ between the two text conditions, although the location of the zzso made for reading next section of the text zzso to the head of the next zzso zzso The zzso zzso during reading Japanese texts occurs in the zzso zzso of the left zzso The zzso zzso did not change with the distance to the next goal of zzso but was fixed on the area representing about zzso of zzso
