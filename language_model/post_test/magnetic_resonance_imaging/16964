zzso dysfunction has been found in patients with zzso stress disorder zzso suggesting that the zzso may be implicated in the zzso of zzso However, no studies have explored the functional connectivity between the zzso and other brain regions during zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the zzso functional connectivity of the zzso in recent onset zzso zzso zzso who went through an earthquake in the zzso province of zzso 

zzso participants with zzso and zzso age and gender matched traumatized controls without zzso recruited from the 2008 zzso earthquake were scanned by zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in resting zzso Region of interest zzso functional connectivity analysis was employed to identify the potential differences in the functional connectivity of the zzso between the two zzso 

In the zzso group, the zzso showed decreased positive functional connectivity to particular brain regions including right zzso frontal zzso and left anterior zzso zzso zzso we also found increased positive functional connectivity of zzso with bilateral inferior frontal and left middle frontal zzso left inferior zzso zzso as well as right zzso in the zzso participants when compared to traumatized controls without zzso 

The results provide evidence that abnormal resting state functional connections linking the zzso to cortical regions may be involved in the underlying pathology in zzso
