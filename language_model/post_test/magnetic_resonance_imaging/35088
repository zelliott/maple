zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides a powerful tool to study zzso circuits in zzso and thereby to link information about neural structure and function within individual zzso Making the best use of zzso in monkeys requires minimizing zzso zzso maintaining sensitivity to zzso signal changes and mapping transport throughout the brain without a zzso anatomical zzso Here, we performed zzso injections of zzso zzso comparisons of zzso and zzso scans, and zzso statistical zzso zzso zzso did not cause cell death at the injection site, damage to downstream targets of zzso zzso behavioral deficits, or changes in zzso zzso We detected and mapped zzso transport throughout zzso circuits by using zzso statistical comparisons of at least 10 zzso and two zzso zzso We were able to differentiate between focal and diffuse projection fields and to distinguish between the topography of zzso projections from zzso and anterior zzso zzso in a single zzso This zzso approach provides a basis for combining zzso anatomical analyses with simultaneous zzso recordings and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging in individual zzso Such studies will enhance our interpretations of functional data and our understanding of how zzso activity is transformed as it zzso through a zzso
