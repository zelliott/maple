Patent zzso zzso zzso closure is reported to result in fewer episodes of clinically manifest zzso cerebral zzso than medical zzso We evaluated by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso whether silent cerebral zzso episodes are also decreased by zzso zzso Seventy-one patients with zzso were selected for zzso closure of zzso at our zzso All had zzso with large zzso shunt documented by zzso zzso ultrasound and zzso zzso zzso or zzso previous stroke or transient zzso attack with zzso documentation at the index event, and no alternative cause for cerebral zzso zzso studies were performed in all patients 24 hours before the procedure and at zzso follow-up (or before in the case of a suspected new zzso zzso Eight patients zzso had zzso clinical event before the zzso Comparing the 2 zzso studies before the zzso silent zzso zzso were observed in 14 other patients zzso Thus, considering clinical and silent events together, zzso event was present at baseline in 22 patients zzso After zzso closure zzso 16 zzso 7 zzso 1 zzso zzso event occurred zzso p zzso zzso vs zzso clinical zzso however, urgent brain zzso results were zzso Moreover, only 1 patient showed 1 new silent zzso at brain zzso at follow-up zzso p zzso vs zzso silent brain zzso Considering clinical and silent events, relapses occurred in 2 patients only zzso zzso vs before zzso zzso events were limited to those with incomplete zzso closure at zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso closure results in few clinical or silent events after zzso zzso especially when complete zzso closure is successfully zzso
