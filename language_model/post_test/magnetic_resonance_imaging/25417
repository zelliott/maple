To determine the association between the rates of advanced spinal imaging and spine surgery across geographic zzso 

The rates of spine surgery in the United States have increased along with a concurrent rise in the use of advanced spinal zzso CT and zzso zzso surgery rates vary zzso across geographic areas of the United zzso zzso in patient populations and health care supply have explained only about zzso of this zzso 

We used a random zzso sample of Medicare's National zzso History Part B files for 1996 and 1997 to determine procedure rates across zzso Hospital zzso zzso We analyzed the association between spinal imaging and spine surgery using linear zzso Main outcome measures were rates of procedures and zzso of determination zzso 

The rates of advanced spinal imaging zzso and zzso zzso varied zzso across geographic zzso Areas with higher rates of zzso had higher rates of spine surgery overall zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso surgery specifically zzso zzso zzso The rates of advanced spinal imaging accounted for zzso of the zzso in overall spine surgery rates zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso surgery rates zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A simulation model showed that zzso obtained in the patients undergoing surgery accounted for only a small part of the correlation between zzso and total spine surgery zzso 

A significant proportion of the variation in rates of spine surgery can be explained by differences in the rates of advanced spinal zzso The indications for advanced spinal imaging are not firmly agreed on, and the appropriateness of many of these imaging studies has been zzso zzso consensus on the use and interpretation of advanced spinal imaging studies could have an important effect on variation in spine surgery zzso
