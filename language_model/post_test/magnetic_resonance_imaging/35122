Although it is well established that zzso zzso may lead to profound zzso the precise contribution of zzso zzso to memory remains zzso In an influential article zzso and Brown proposed that recognition memory depends on two processes supported by distinct zzso and cortical zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso nucleus and the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the anterior zzso nucleus zzso the zzso tract zzso and the zzso The authors also suggested that the lateral zzso nucleus zzso may contribute to the zzso system, thereby zzso that the zzso may play a role in zzso Given the finding that material specific zzso can occur following zzso zzso we tested an extension of the zzso and Brown zzso We predicted that patients with bilateral zzso with a bias to the left or right MD or zzso may exhibit impaired familiarity or recollection on verbal or zzso zzso We report two patients with highly focal zzso zzso and profound memory zzso affecting verbal and zzso zzso For the first time, zzso imaging was employed to perform zzso of the zzso along with high-resolution anatomical zzso and detailed assessments of verbal and zzso zzso Our data support only some aspects of the zzso and Brown zzso Both patients had left MD nucleus and zzso zzso and performed poorly on familiarity and recall for verbal zzso just as predicted by the zzso However, both patients' performance for zzso memoranda zzso faces and zzso is more difficult to reconcile with the zzso Patient 1 had damage to the right zzso with sparing of the zzso familiarity should therefore have been preserved but was zzso Patient 2 had damage to the right MD with sparing of zzso recollection should have been preserved but was zzso This finding raises the possibility that zzso of familiarity and recollection to separate zzso zzso may not fully capture the role of zzso zzso in memory zzso
