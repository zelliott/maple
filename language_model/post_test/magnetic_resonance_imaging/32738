zzso pathology is considered a major zzso of disability in zzso but the comprehension of its origin and progression rate is limited by the uncertainty of dating the zzso disease zzso Thus, we planned a zzso study aimed at analyzing and comparing cortical pathology in pediatric and adult zzso patients at clinical zzso 

Within 12 months from clinical zzso 35 patients with zzso and 57 with zzso were included in a zzso zzso At zzso zzso and zzso number and volume were zzso zzso of zzso and number of new zzso were assessed every year for 3 years zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constituted the reference zzso 

At zzso zzso did not differ between zzso and NC zzso zzso zzso while it was lower in patients with zzso compared with both zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of patients with zzso as well as zzso number and volume, were higher in patients with zzso than in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso was higher in both patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso whereas no difference was observed between patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly correlated with increased zzso volume zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and with the appearance of new zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that focal zzso and diffuse zzso zzso damage are strictly associated with the zzso onset of zzso and proceed zzso and partly independently of zzso zzso
