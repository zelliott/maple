This prospective study was performed to investigate whether zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides an accurate assessment of the zzso cartilage in clinical zzso 

Forty patients with persistent knee pain and suspected cartilage zzso underwent zzso zzso shortly before zzso with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo with spectral fat suppression, zzso zzso zzso zzso echo with selective water zzso and zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso Philips Medical Systems, Best, The zzso zzso cartilage surfaces were divided into 6 zzso zzso detected on zzso were classified into stages I to IV and compared with the zzso zzso 

For the 240 cartilage surfaces zzso the sensitivities, zzso positive zzso values, and negative zzso values of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for the detection of grade IV zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for grade III zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for grade II zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for grade I zzso 

In these preliminary clinical studies zzso zzso provided convincing zzso of the zzso cartilage with comparatively good diagnostic zzso Nonetheless, it must be pointed out that the positive zzso values were low for all grades of zzso Thus, when zzso zzso suggests a cartilage zzso the probability that the zzso finding zzso exactly to the zzso result is between zzso and zzso zzso the value of zzso for a detailed assessment and grading of a cartilage disorder with regard to definitive planning of a therapeutic procedure cannot be replaced by zzso zzso 

Level I, testing of previously developed diagnostic criteria in a series of consecutive patients with universally applied gold zzso
