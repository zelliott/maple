To make an objective assessment of the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of zzso damage and zzso cruciate ligament disease in the canine stifle by comparing magnetic resonance imaging findings with surgical zzso 

zzso resonance images of 18 zzso from 18 dogs which had undergone magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of stifle disease were zzso For every zzso the zzso and zzso cruciate ligaments were assessed according to predetermined zzso The magnetic resonance imaging findings were compared with the reported surgical findings and the sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values zzso and zzso were calculated using the surgical findings as the gold zzso Kappa analysis was used as an objective measure of agreement between surgical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso For 11 zzso zzso evaluation by three different observers was used to measure zzso agreement using Kappa zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was demonstrated to be an accurate technique in the detection of zzso injury zzso with excellent zzso agreement zzso to zzso zzso of zzso cruciate ligament continuity and an increase in ligament intensity were found to be useful criteria in the diagnosis of zzso cruciate ligament zzso 

zzso resonance imaging offers a zzso alternative to exploratory surgery in the evaluation of zzso cruciate ligament and zzso zzso
