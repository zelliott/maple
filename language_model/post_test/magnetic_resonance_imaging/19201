Studies of a range of higher cognitive functions consistently activate a region of anterior zzso zzso zzso typically zzso to the zzso and superior to the corpus zzso In particular, this zzso region appears to be active in task situations where there is a need to override a zzso response zzso when responding is zzso and when errors are zzso We have hypothesized that the function of this zzso region is to monitor for the presence of zzso or competition between incompatible zzso In prior work, we provided initial support for this hypothesis, demonstrating zzso activity in the same region both during error trials and during correct trials in task conditions designed to elicit greater response zzso In the present study, we extend our testing of this hypothesis to task situations involving zzso zzso Specifically, 14 healthy control subjects performed a zzso task during zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the zzso acquisition of overt verbal zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso and only the zzso was more active in a series of task conditions that zzso competition among alternative zzso These conditions included a greater zzso response to: zzso zzso zzso as low zzso high constraint zzso during a zzso study, multiple zzso were produced with equal frequency zzso a single verb that produced much more frequently than any zzso zzso the production of zzso that were weak associates, rather than, strong associates of particular zzso and zzso the production of zzso that were weak associates for nouns zzso as high zzso We discuss the implication of these results for understanding the role that the zzso plays in human zzso
