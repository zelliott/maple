To examine zzso stem cell zzso labeling with zzso iron oxide particles zzso for magnetic resonance imaging zzso tracking and its application to monitoring zzso cartilage zzso 

zzso zzso were labeled using commercial zzso In zzso zzso was performed with zzso echo zzso and spin echo zzso sequences at zzso and zzso characterized using line profile and region of interest zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso implanted within a bovine knee was performed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso labeling efficiency, and zzso of zzso cells were also zzso 

zzso labeling results in efficient contrast zzso and signal loss that can be zzso and zzso characterized via zzso zzso imaging of implanted cells results in ex zzso detection within native zzso and zzso imaging is unaffected by the presence of labeled cells immediately following zzso zzso labeling does not affect quantitative zzso production during zzso but iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso may result from excess unincorporated particles following labeling and is an issue that zzso further zzso 

This study demonstrates the promise of zzso labeling for monitoring cartilage zzso and highlights its potential in the development of zzso tissue engineering zzso
