It has been previously shown that zzso in the rotating frame zzso is a very sensitive and early marker of cerebral zzso and that, interestingly, it can provide zzso information about the degree of subsequent zzso zzso In the present study the authors have zzso zzso together with the rate and other variables of zzso transfer zzso associated with spin interactions between the bulk and zzso zzso pools by means of Z zzso to examine the possible overlap of mechanisms affecting these magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso of cerebral zzso was observed minutes after induction of zzso this change progressing in a zzso zzso zzso Z zzso zzso zzso minus zzso brain zzso showed a significant positive reminder in the time points from zzso to 3 hours after induction of zzso the polarity of this change reversing by 24 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso variables showed that the initial Z spectral changes were due to concerted increase in the zzso zzso zzso and amount of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso rates derived either from the entire frequency range of Z zzso or the time constant for the zzso forward exchange zzso were unchanged at this time, these variables reducing only one day after induction of zzso The authors conclude that zzso changes in the acute phase of zzso coincide with both elevated zzso zzso and amount of zzso These changes occur independent of the overall zzso rate and in the absence of net water gain to the zzso whereas in the consolidating zzso the decrease in the rate and amount of zzso as well as the extensive zzso of zzso are associated with water zzso
