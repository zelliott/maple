zzso reconstruction suffers from an zzso problem, which increasingly lowers the zzso ratio zzso as the reduction factor zzso zzso also degrades the convergence behavior of zzso zzso zzso reconstructions for arbitrary zzso zzso techniques are often used to alleviate the zzso zzso Based on maximum a zzso statistical zzso with a zzso zzso random field zzso this study presents a new method for zzso zzso using the image and noise zzso The zzso zzso zzso addresses the blurry edges in zzso zzso and the zzso effects in total variation zzso zzso Phantom and in zzso experiments demonstrate improved image quality and convergence speed over both the zzso zzso zzso method and zzso zzso method, at no increase in total zzso zzso
