The nature of changes in rapidly acquired magnetic resonance images of the brain was studied by using a zzso method and spectral techniques zzso suited to short time zzso It was found that the stimulus related changes have a complex zzso structure even for simple visual zzso Apart from a low frequency window, the zzso changes were found to zzso in detail to either breathing or zzso although these two sources show different patterns of spatial zzso in the zzso At low zzso zzso with zzso around zzso zzso were observed, also with zzso zzso structure, which are likely to be zzso in zzso
