The human cortical system for face perception is comprised of a network of connected regions including the middle zzso zzso zzso face zzso or zzso the inferior zzso zzso zzso face zzso or zzso and the superior zzso zzso The traditional zzso zzso model of visual processing suggests information flows from early visual zzso to the zzso for initial face feature analysis to higher order regions including the zzso for identity zzso However, patient data suggest an alternative zzso Patients with acquired zzso an inability to visually recognize faces, have been documented with zzso to the zzso but who nevertheless show zzso zzso in the zzso Moreover, their ability to categorize faces remains zzso This suggests that the zzso is not solely responsible for face recognition and the network is not strictly zzso but may be organized in a reverse zzso zzso We used zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to temporarily disrupt processing in the zzso in zzso individuals and found zzso ability to categorize intact versus scrambled faces was zzso however face identity discrimination was significantly zzso This suggests that face categorization but not recognition can occur without the zzso zzso being online and indicates that zzso zzso face category processing may be assumed by other intact face network regions such as the zzso These results are consistent with the patient data and support a zzso zzso model with zzso connections between the zzso and other face processing zzso
