The zzso factors for complications resulting from cement leakage were zzso reviewed in 71 patients who underwent zzso zzso 

To explore the zzso factors affecting the complications of zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Over the past decade, zzso zzso has been increasingly used as treatment of choice for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, current literature contains less information about the zzso factors affecting the complications resulted from cement zzso 

In all, 71 patients with zzso zzso zzso fractures who were treated by zzso zzso in the department of spine surgery at our medical center were identified from the registry and were zzso zzso The treatment efficacy was determined by the assessment of change in zzso body zzso Cobb angle, visual analog scale and zzso functional score between zzso zzso and the latest zzso zzso were recorded and associated risk factors were determined and zzso 

All patients had immediate and significant improvement in back pain after being treated with zzso zzso zzso leakage occurred in 17 zzso out of zzso zzso bodies, including 7 zzso zzso 6 leaks into zzso space, 3 leaks into channel of needling zzso and 1 spinal canal zzso Four patients zzso developed pulmonary complications zzso one of them with confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism directly caused by cement zzso During the zzso we found 9 recurrence zzso fractures in 6 patients zzso including 6 adjacent zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant difference in zzso zzso body zzso injected cement volume, and zzso body wall incompetence between the cement leakage group and no cement leakage group zzso In contrast, there is no significant difference in the zzso Cobb angle, freshness of zzso zzso location of operative zzso and operative approach between the 2 groups zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis showed that the injected cement volume and zzso body wall incompetence were the zzso variables associated with the complications resulting from cement zzso The patients who had a history of pulmonary diseases were prone to develop zzso complications after the zzso 

The cement zzso injected cement volume, zzso body wall incompetence, and a history of pulmonary diseases were the factors affecting the complications resulting from cement zzso The recognition of these risk factors is helpful in efforts to improve surgical technique to reduce the risk of complications after being treated by zzso zzso
