To zzso compare zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the early assessment of zzso enhancement and zzso size after acute zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study was zzso zzso and was approved by the institutional review zzso All participants gave written informed zzso zzso patients (18 zzso mean age, 60 years zzso 13 zzso zzso were examined with zzso zzso CT and cardiac MR imaging 5 days or fewer after a first zzso zzso zzso CT was performed during the first pass of contrast material to assess zzso zzso and detect zzso obstruction (no zzso In 15 patients, a second scan was performed 7 minutes later to assess total zzso size by using delayed zzso Early zzso and delayed zzso were compared between zzso CT and cardiac MR imaging with zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso 

Early zzso was recognized on all zzso CT and cardiac MR zzso Delayed zzso was observed with cardiac MR imaging at all examinations and with zzso CT at 11 of 15 zzso While signal intensity differences between zzso and normal zzso were comparable for zzso zzso CT and cardiac MR imaging, cardiac MR imaging had a far better zzso ratio zzso for delayed acquisitions than did CT zzso zzso zzso zzso areas (as a percentage of left zzso zzso at zzso zzso CT zzso zzso 6) correlated well with those at zzso cardiac MR imaging zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso 9) correlated well with zzso cardiac MR imaging zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso zzso of delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso had very good correlation between zzso CT zzso zzso 4) and cardiac MR imaging zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso 

Early and late zzso showed good zzso and correlated well between zzso CT and cardiac MR zzso
