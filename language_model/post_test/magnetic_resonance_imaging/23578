zzso agents for magnetic resonance imaging zzso that exhibit sensitivity toward specific zzso or molecules represent a challenging but attractive direction of zzso Here a zzso complex linked to an zzso group for zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso of this complex decreases during the zzso zzso with zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso upon zzso The zzso is modulated by changes in the zzso number, which was confirmed by determination of the zzso zzso lifetimes of the analogous zzso zzso The initial in zzso characterization of this responsive contrast agent was performed by means of zzso and zzso zzso The investigated complex is fully zzso having no zzso effect on zzso function after administration into the brain zzso or zzso Distribution studies demonstrated that the zzso of this agent is significantly lower compared with that of zzso acid zzso
