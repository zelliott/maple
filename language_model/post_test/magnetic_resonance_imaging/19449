A prospective study was performed to investigate the correlations between zzso transfer ratio zzso and zzso parameters of invasive zzso zzso in human zzso The zzso parameters investigated were the extent of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients with breast zzso were examined using an zzso zzso pulse in conjunction with conventional zzso zzso imaging at frequency zzso of zzso zzso and 1200 zzso from water zzso The values of zzso at frequency offset of 1200 zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Although zzso showed correlation with the extent of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso they did not correlate with the zzso changes of zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, the values of zzso at frequency offset of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated close correlation to zzso changes of zzso and zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the structural characteristics and zzso zzso with the nature of zzso cells with regard to nuclear zzso and zzso zzso
