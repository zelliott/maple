Although stress and drug cue exposure each increase drug craving and contribute to zzso in cocaine zzso no previous research has directly examined the neural zzso of zzso and drug zzso craving in zzso women and men relative to comparison zzso 

zzso zzso was used to assess responses to individualized scripts for stress, zzso cue and zzso conditions in 30 zzso zzso individuals (16 women, 14 zzso and 36 healthy zzso comparison subjects (18 women, 18 zzso 

zzso three-way interactions between diagnostic group, sex, and script condition were observed in multiple brain regions including the zzso zzso and anterior and zzso zzso Within women, zzso interactions were observed involving these regions and were attributable to relatively increased regional zzso in zzso women during the stress and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso Within men, group main effects were observed involving these same regions, with zzso men demonstrating relatively increased zzso across conditions, with the main contributions from the drug and zzso zzso In men and women, zzso drug-induced craving measures correlated positively with zzso zzso 

In cocaine zzso zzso zzso appears to be linked to stress cues in women, drug cues in men, and zzso conditions in zzso These findings suggest that sex should be taken into account in the selection of therapies in the treatment of addiction, particularly those targeting stress zzso
