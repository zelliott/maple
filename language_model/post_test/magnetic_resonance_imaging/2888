To determine disease zzso in the first identical twin with zzso zzso The patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso male twins who were clinically zzso for progressive zzso caused by zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of cerebral zzso rate for zzso 

The affected twin had lower zzso and zzso test scores than did his brother, particularly on tests sensitive to zzso with zzso zzso widespread cerebral zzso worst in right zzso zzso and reduced zzso cerebral zzso rate for zzso worst in right zzso zzso The clinically zzso twin had normal zzso and zzso test scores but performed more poorly on tests sensitive to zzso compared with zzso zzso had no abnormalities on magnetic resonance zzso and had left zzso as well as mild zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may remain clinically zzso in identical twins after 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings suggest the possibility of a zzso stage of zzso zzso There is generalized cortical zzso in patients with zzso zzso in addition to focal zzso
