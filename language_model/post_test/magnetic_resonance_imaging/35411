This study was designed to identify zzso zzso plaque zzso by imaging the tissue zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a positive contrast zzso imaging sequence zzso recovery with zzso water suppression zzso 

The sudden zzso of zzso zzso plaques can trigger the formation of an zzso zzso in coronary vessels, resulting in acute zzso zzso zzso a zzso technique that can identify zzso plaques and thereby assist with risk zzso of patients with zzso would be of great potential clinical zzso 

zzso were conducted on a clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner in 7 zzso zzso and 4 control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso (2 doses of 250 zzso zzso and animals underwent serial zzso before injection of the zzso and serially after 1, 3, and 6 zzso 

After administration of zzso a striking signal enhancement was found in areas of plaque only in zzso zzso The magnitude of enhancement on magnetic resonance images had a high correlation with the number of zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and allowed for the detection of zzso plaque with high accuracy zzso under the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso No significant signal enhancement was measured in remote areas without plaque by zzso and in control rabbits without zzso 

Using zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso is a promising approach for the zzso evaluation of zzso vulnerable zzso
