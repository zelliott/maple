Evaluating cerebral asymmetry in schizophrenia patients potentially leads to understanding the extent to which the disorder involves a zzso zzso We sought to clarify in which brain regions of the patient the normal cerebral asymmetry is disrupted and the extent of zzso 

zzso zzso to evaluate gray matter asymmetry was carried out with magnetic resonance images from a total of 120 right-handed zzso They comprised four groups of 30 subjects zzso male zzso female zzso male control, and female zzso To examine gray matter asymmetry we generated images of the zzso zzso 

The analysis within each of four groups revealed a consistent pattern of gray matter asymmetry over all zzso However group comparison between all patients and all healthy subjects showed significant difference in the cerebral zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso index showed a skew toward rightward asymmetry in the zzso zzso and a reduction in zzso asymmetry in the zzso zzso in patients relative to control zzso 

A zzso of cerebral asymmetry in schizophrenia was suggested to be present in zzso regions, which might reflect a zzso in the zzso process underlying left cerebral dominance for zzso
