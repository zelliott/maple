A major challenge for cellular and molecular zzso is to study interactions between two different cell populations or biological zzso We studied the possibility to simultaneously image contrast agents based on two different zzso contrast zzso chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso Various amounts of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso were mixed with a fixed concentration zzso zzso of the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were then zzso zzso overlay maps demonstrated the feasibility of concurrent dual contrast zzso We found that at zzso lower than 5 zzso both contrast agents can be zzso zzso At higher zzso the zzso agent can be used to zzso zzso the signal arising from the zzso zzso These initial findings are a first step toward using dual zzso contrast imaging for studying multiple cellular or molecular targets simultaneously in zzso
