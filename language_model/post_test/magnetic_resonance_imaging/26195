Since the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso is not yet fully zzso we investigated the potential of dynamic zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging for a better characterization of zzso zzso Twenty-five zzso patients were examined on a zzso T zzso A single dose of zzso zzso contrast agent was injected, and zzso images were acquired every zzso seconds for 1 zzso From the signal zzso curves, the relative cerebral blood volume zzso was evaluated for regions in plaques and in gray and white zzso The zzso calculated for zzso zzso plaques was corrected for the effects of zzso barrier zzso using a new correction zzso Acute plaques had significantly higher blood volumes than zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plaques that appeared zzso on zzso images had lower zzso than zzso plaques zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the acute phase in zzso is accompanied by zzso In later stages of zzso the zzso decreases with increasing zzso zzso Although the zzso technique is less sensitive than conventional MR imaging, the information provided is essentially different from that obtained with any other MR zzso
