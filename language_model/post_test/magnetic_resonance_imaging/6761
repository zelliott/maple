zzso is used to zzso cerebral arteries undergoing zzso from zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cellular zzso in zzso and could cause zzso in zzso 

We studied 5 consecutive patients with cerebral zzso who were treated with zzso zzso preserved with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso inversion recovery and zzso imaging after zzso One patient had zzso analysis of the brain at zzso 

All 5 patients exhibited marked neurological decline immediately after treatment, and this was sustained through hospital zzso In all cases, zzso images showed selective gray zzso signal changes within the vascular territory treated with zzso zzso analysis of 1 case brought to autopsy showed selective injury to islands of zzso with relative sparing of white zzso 

zzso delivery of zzso preserved with zzso into zzso anterior cerebral arteries may result in marked neurological deterioration with selective gray matter changes on zzso zzso This effect is consistent with a permanent toxic effect to human zzso It is unclear whether this toxicity is caused by zzso or zzso and its use in the treatment of cerebral zzso should be reserved for cases without zzso
