zzso retrieval of autobiographical knowledge can provide rich contextual support for episodic recollection of a recent zzso We examined the neural bases of these two processes by performing zzso scanning during a recognition memory test for faces that were zzso famous, or personally zzso The presence of zzso knowledge of a face was incidental to the task, but nonetheless resulted in improved zzso Two distinct networks of zzso were associated with correct recollection of a zzso prior presentation zzso hits zzso correct zzso on one hand, and with zzso knowledge about it zzso or personally known zzso unfamiliar zzso on the zzso The former included zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso The latter included bilateral zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed an interaction between both effects, driven by increased zzso for recollection of unfamiliar zzso When recollecting the presentation of a famous or personally known face, zzso zzso increased with zzso ratings of how well they felt they knew the person zzso zzso prefrontal zzso showed significantly greater zzso for personally known than famous zzso Our results indicate a zzso between the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in memory zzso They also indicate that, during recognition memory experiments, the zzso supports incidental retrieval of zzso knowledge about the stimuli zzso This type of knowledge likely zzso the additional recollection found for prior presentation of well known stimuli compared with novel ones and may link zzso zzso at zzso to subsequent memory performance more zzso
