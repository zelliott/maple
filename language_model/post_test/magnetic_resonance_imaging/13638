The aim of this study was to determine if different types of focal zzso zzso can be differentiated by specific quantitative and qualitative imaging characteristics zzso and zzso zzso zzso administration using a computerized zzso zzso analysis zzso In a zzso trial, 151 patients with focal liver disease were studied at zzso and zzso T using zzso echo zzso and fast zzso zzso images zzso and post zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis could be performed in 141 of 151 of the zzso The variables used in both single variable analysis and zzso included zzso ratios zzso and post zzso presence of rim enhancement, margin, and zzso of a zzso zzso and post zzso The zzso of diagnoses using zzso was compared with a standard of reference zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and other or no zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso long-term follow-up in 51% of the zzso In the differentiation of the various zzso zzso zzso together with the presence of zzso or rim enhancement as variables for zzso gave the highest sensitivity, zzso and accuracy which ranged between 65 and 93, 44 and 83, and 65 and zzso zzso The zzso models based on zzso variables showed better zzso results than the models based on zzso zzso An improvement of accuracy was observed when zzso zzso from zzso zzso groups zzso p zzso or zzso zzso and when zzso zzso from zzso zzso groups zzso p zzso or zzso zzso In all regards there was no difference for zzso images zzso and post zzso By combining quantitative and qualitative zzso zzso proved to be a useful tool in zzso zzso Due to considerable zzso within some of the zzso type groups, the zzso diagnostic impact of zzso cannot be completely established yet, and further investigation is still zzso
