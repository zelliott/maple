This study examined relations of zzso lobe tissue volumes with zzso zzso functions in a sample of patients with first episode zzso Three zzso compartments of the zzso lobe were measured on magnetic resonance images, zzso primarily zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso measures were derived from a comprehensive zzso zzso volume selectively in the anterior zzso formation was associated with lower scores on measures of executive and motor functions usually considered sensitive to the integrity of frontal lobe zzso zzso of other zzso functions, and global intellectual ability, were not related to zzso zzso The findings that zzso abnormalities in the zzso lobe are associated with impairment of frontal lobe functions point to a zzso in an integrated functional system that includes both frontal and zzso zzso The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso defects affecting the zzso of the anterior zzso formation may be manifest later in life as zzso in zzso zzso zzso
