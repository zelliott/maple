The dynamics of the zzso phase transition in zzso was analyzed with magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso imaging, providing complementary information on a zzso as well as on a zzso spatial zzso In zzso zzso the diffusion zzso of zzso is zzso correlated with temperature, independent of the zzso phase zzso In larger zzso samples, the transition from the zzso to the gel state was characterized by a complex position and temperature dependency of both zzso zzso wave patterns and apparent diffusion zzso zzso The position dependency of the temperature was zzso found to be zzso similar to the behavior of the zzso zzso The dynamics of the temperature could be described with a simplified model that described the heat exchange between zzso and gel zzso The experiments supported the approach to derive temperature maps from the zzso maps by a linear zzso The zzso resolved dynamics of the temperature maps were therefore employed to determine the zzso For this reason, experimental zzso data were simulated using a model of coupled harmonic zzso The calculated images agreed well with the zzso observed zzso wave zzso
