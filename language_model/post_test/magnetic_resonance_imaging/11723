zzso in zzso zzso has a prevalence of zzso Mechanical and inflammatory factors are involved in its zzso zzso operation is required when neurological complications or zzso instability zzso Surgery is complicated by the increased fragility of the zzso column, advanced stage of the disease in many patients, and serious pulmonary zzso 

We report two patients who had had zzso zzso for over 20 zzso Both presented complaining of symptoms for several months with zzso pain and signs of spinal zzso zzso There were signs of zzso and destruction of the adjacent zzso bodies at zzso zzso and zzso zzso on imaging investigations of the first and second patient zzso In both cases an anterior approach was used for zzso and zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso Then an zzso rib graft was done, and zzso fixation with plate and screws to the adjacent zzso zzso The patients condition zzso Their pain and previous clinical neurological disorder had disappeared by 5 and 1 year zzso 

The prevalence of patients operated on for zzso in the context of zzso zzso is not zzso zzso pain with inflammatory characteristics of recent onset in patients with chronic zzso zzso should lead to suspicion of zzso Although it may be related to previous zzso zzso is the fundamental zzso MR is the most sensitive imaging zzso There may be marked osteoporosis and zzso of the zzso canal together with marked zzso of all the zzso zzso This zzso the approach to the zzso bodies and their subsequent zzso zzso of the zzso canal using an anterior approach zzso or zzso zzso zzso and anterior spinal fixation is the treatment of choice in cases with neurological involvement or involvement of the anterior and zzso columns of zzso
