The purpose of this study was to identify factors predicting growth and zzso deterioration during follow-up zzso in a wait and scan zzso policy of zzso zzso zzso using a novel zzso measuring zzso So far, only consecutive magnetic resonance imaging zzso is able to show growth zzso and growth, combined with hearing function, generally dictates further zzso Other factors predicting growth or hearing deterioration would be invaluable and might ease clinical decision zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

zzso patients diagnosed with VS at zzso University Medical Center between 2003 and 2008, with zzso data available from 36 zzso 

A zzso policy for unilateral VS with sequential zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso during zzso 

zzso Patient and zzso VS features potentially related to growth and auditory function during a zzso zzso zzso The correlation between increase in VS volume and zzso deterioration during zzso 

zzso zzso on zzso magnetic resonance images and complaints of hearing loss at presentation are zzso of a faster deterioration of hearing zzso zzso zzso Growth during the first zzso year predicts further zzso zzso zzso volume does not correlate with zzso deterioration zzso 

zzso on zzso image of the affected labyrinth will result in a significant faster deterioration of zzso Hearing loss was more profound, and hearing will deteriorate significantly faster in patients presenting with complaints of hearing zzso zzso growth during the first year of zzso predicts further growth during zzso zzso zzso cannot be zzso by zzso examinations solely because increase in VS volume does not correlate with zzso deterioration zzso
