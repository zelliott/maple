zzso zzso zzso has been strongly implicated in the zzso of schizophrenia zzso Recently, zzso zzso of zzso transmission has been shown to have therapeutic zzso We asked whether genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso transmission zzso by slowing the recycling of zzso to zzso would produce a zzso relevant to zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed about a 50% global reduction in zzso activity, and a modest reduction in zzso levels in brain regions relevant to zzso zzso but displayed neither general behavioral abnormalities nor zzso zzso zzso imaging, measuring regional cerebral blood volume, showed zzso zzso mainly in the zzso zzso and zzso the inverse of recent clinical imaging findings in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were less sensitive to the behavioral stimulating effects of zzso showed a reduction in zzso zzso zzso release and in zzso frontal cortical zzso suggesting that zzso zzso mice are resistant to the effects of these zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mice showed zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that reduction in zzso has zzso zzso These observations provide further support for the pivotal role of altered zzso synaptic transmission in the zzso of zzso and suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso through zzso zzso may provide a new direction for the zzso of zzso
