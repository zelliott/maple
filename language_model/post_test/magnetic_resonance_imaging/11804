This review summarizes the main contributions given by magnetic resonance imaging zzso to predict disease evolution in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes zzso suggestive of multiple sclerosis zzso In these patients, the extent of zzso on zzso scans of the brain is a robust predictor of the subsequent development of clinically zzso zzso zzso moderate to severe disability and new zzso zzso The risk of developing zzso in patients with zzso is further increased when some of these zzso are enhancing or when additional zzso are seen on zzso scans of the spinal zzso Recent studies using new zzso techniques have shown that irreversible tissue disruption is an early event in the course of zzso and that subtle zzso white matter changes occur in patients with zzso and are associated with an increased risk of developing zzso These findings are changing our views of how to monitor early zzso evolution and of early zzso treatment zzso
