zzso zzso is a mixed zzso zzso used extensively in psychiatric zzso zzso show blunted neuroendocrine responses to zzso and in some settings zzso can induce craving for alcohol, particularly among early onset zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso to examine the effects of zzso administered zzso zzso zzso on brain zzso zzso in a group of 18 male zzso and 12 healthy male control zzso zzso between two sequential scans (the first followed zzso and the second followed zzso were evaluated statistically with a zzso random zzso zzso Among healthy volunteers zzso significantly increased brain zzso metabolism in the right zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the left nucleus zzso the head of the zzso nucleus zzso the anterior and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the middle frontal zzso the left insular cortex, the left middle zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Among alcoholic subjects zzso significantly increased brain zzso metabolism in larger areas of the zzso and zzso zzso than it did in healthy volunteers, but compared with the healthy volunteers, zzso showed a smaller area of zzso zzso in the thalamus, almost no zzso in the zzso zzso and no zzso at all in the head of the zzso nucleus or the middle frontal zzso These results suggest that a zzso challenge activates zzso zzso circuits involving zzso and prefrontal zzso among healthy volunteers but that the response of these circuits is blunted among zzso
