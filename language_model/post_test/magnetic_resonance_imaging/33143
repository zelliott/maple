A high percentage of patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from depression in addition to their motor zzso However, the zzso of this depression and its relation to Parkinson's disease are zzso Within the framework of the zzso zzso hypothesis of depression, we propose that the zzso and zzso systems are coupled by the lateral zzso and argue that altered zzso zzso activity leads to lateral zzso hyperactivity, which in turn zzso the zzso system, resulting in depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's zzso We tested this hypothesis using the unilateral zzso zzso rat model of Parkinson's zzso zzso was assessed using the novelty suppressed feeding and forced swim tests, and the effective connectivity of the zzso system was estimated by zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso zzso The results show zzso behaviors and reduced zzso connectivity with the lateral zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso rat zzso More importantly, partial restoration of the zzso connectivity and partial zzso of behavior were achieved by zzso replacement therapy zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, nearly complete behavioral zzso was reached after a bilateral electric zzso of the lateral zzso These findings provide a plausible link between Parkinson's disease and depression and open up avenues for new therapeutic interventions in depression and possibly in Parkinson's zzso
