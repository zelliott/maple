zzso imaging by zzso spin labeling zzso can be highly sensitive to the transit time from the labeling site to the zzso We report the results of a study designed to separate the transit time and zzso contributions to zzso in zzso images accompanying motor and visual zzso zzso transit time decreases were found to be comparable to fractional zzso increases and the transit time change was found to be the greatest contributor to zzso signal change in zzso sequences without delayed zzso The implications for zzso imaging with zzso and the zzso control of flow are zzso
