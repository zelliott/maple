The authors compare the spinal zzso zzso transfer ratio zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso patients to healthy volunteers, relate zzso to spinal zzso zzso and relate these and other magnetic resonance zzso imaging parameters to zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34 secondary progressive zzso and 17 primary progressive zzso zzso and 9 healthy volunteers were studied using MR at zzso zzso zzso of the patients was assessed using the expanded disability status scale zzso zzso resonance parameters were upper spinal zzso zzso number of focal spinal zzso presence of diffuse zzso and spinal zzso zzso area zzso zzso were assessed using zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso transfer ratio was higher in the controls zzso zzso range, zzso than in patients with zzso zzso zzso range, zzso p zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso correlated with spinal zzso zzso albeit zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso between zzso and spinal zzso zzso was better zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No correlation was found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Combining zzso with spinal zzso zzso improved correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso suggesting an independent correlation between disability and these 2 MR zzso Expanded disability status scale scores were higher in patients who had diffuse spinal zzso zzso regardless of focal zzso zzso 6; range, zzso than in patients without diffuse abnormalities zzso zzso range, zzso p zzso zzso zzso was lower in patients with diffuse spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso than in patients without diffuse abnormalities zzso zzso range, zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso was slightly lower in patients with diffuse spinal zzso abnormalities zzso 29; range, zzso than in patients without diffuse abnormalities zzso zzso range, zzso zzso p zzso zzso
