The Cox maze procedure is the most effective surgical treatment for zzso zzso however, its complexity has limited its clinical zzso The purpose of this study was to simplify the procedure by using an zzso bipolar zzso zzso device on the beating heart without zzso zzso 

Six domestic pigs underwent median zzso The pulmonary veins were zzso zzso zzso isolation was confirmed by zzso Eight zzso were performed zzso and three zzso were performed through zzso zzso with one of the jaws of the device introduced into the right zzso After 30 days, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess zzso function, pulmonary vein zzso and coronary artery zzso zzso stimulation and burst pacing were administered to induce zzso zzso zzso assessment of the heart was performed after the animal was zzso 

A modified Cox maze procedure was successfully performed with the zzso bipolar zzso device with no zzso In every instance, the pulmonary veins were zzso zzso zzso stimulation with burst pacing failed to produce zzso zzso Imaging studies revealed zzso zzso without evidence of pulmonary vein zzso coronary artery zzso or zzso zzso Total zzso ejection fraction was zzso zzso zzso a significant zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso and there was no evidence of coronary zzso zzso 

zzso on both the right and left zzso can be created successfully on the beating heart with zzso bipolar zzso The great majority of zzso with this device were zzso This device should not be used on zzso zzso
