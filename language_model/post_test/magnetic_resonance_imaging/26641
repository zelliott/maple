After prolonged viewing of a continuous periodic motion stimulus at zzso around 10 zzso observers experience a fleeting impression of reversed zzso the continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso To account for this phenomenon it has been proposed that zzso mechanisms zzso sample motion zzso Alternative accounts argue that the illusion relies on the zzso zzso of motion zzso which under the effect of adaptation could trigger a reversed zzso We investigated the neural zzso of the zzso using zzso zzso zzso viewed a vertically zzso ring containing a zzso grating zzso rotating at 10 zzso they continuously reported the perceived motion direction within each half of the zzso The two halves always rotated in opposite directions, allowing us to separately explore zzso zzso occurring within each zzso Comparing zzso activity during zzso zzso or real zzso periods revealed systematic differences in right zzso regions, in addition to the right motion complex zzso This zzso pattern did not depend on the side on which the illusion occurred, and could not be accounted for by purely zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso regions during other zzso zzso This first characterization of the zzso zzso of the zzso may have implications for the different theoretical explanations of the zzso
