We aimed to test the feasibility of detecting zzso in living brains when the zzso barrier zzso is zzso We designed a novel magnetic resonance zzso probe that contains zzso iron oxide zzso zzso a zzso zzso contrast zzso linked to a short DNA sequence complementary to the cerebral zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso found in zzso and zzso As a control, we also used a sequence complementary to the zzso of zzso Our objectives are to demonstrate that this new probe, zzso could be delivered to the brain when administered by zzso solution to the zzso zzso We induced zzso leakage by puncture zzso global cerebral zzso and cortical spreading depression in zzso zzso 1 day after probe delivery we acquired zzso MR images and zzso zzso zzso zzso maps using a zzso zzso technique in live zzso We found that the zzso probe reported zzso with elevated signal in zzso zzso maps and that these zzso matched areas identified as having extensive zzso network zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, animals administered the control probe exhibited zzso of zzso zzso that matched zzso zzso in the vascular zzso We conclude that our modular MR probe, delivered in an zzso solution, effectively reports zzso associated with acute neurological disorders in living zzso As zzso leakage is often observed in acute neurological disorders, this study also served to validate zzso delivery of MR zzso to the brains of live animals after acute neurological zzso
