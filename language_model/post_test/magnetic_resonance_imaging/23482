Experts of zzso who have the skills of zzso mental calculation zzso are able to manipulate numbers via an imagined abacus in mind and demonstrate extraordinary ability in mental zzso zzso studies indicated that abacus experts zzso visual strategy in solving zzso problems, and zzso studies confirmed the enhanced involvement of zzso neural resources in zzso This study aims to explore the possible changes in brain white matter induced by long-term training of zzso Two matched groups zzso the abacus group consisting of 25 children with over zzso training in abacus calculation and zzso the controls including 25 children without any abacus zzso We found that the abacus group showed higher average fractional zzso zzso in zzso fiber zzso and the regions with increased zzso were found in corpus zzso left zzso junction and right zzso zzso No regions, however, showed decreased zzso in the abacus zzso Further analysis revealed that the differences in zzso values were mainly driven by the zzso of zzso rather than zzso zzso Furthermore, in forward zzso and letter memory span tests, zzso group showed larger zzso memory zzso Interestingly, individual differences in white matter tracts were found positively correlated with the memory zzso indicating that the widespread increase of zzso in the abacus group result possibly from the zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings suggested that long-term zzso training from an early age may improve the memory capacity and enhance the integrity in white matter tracts related to motor and zzso zzso
