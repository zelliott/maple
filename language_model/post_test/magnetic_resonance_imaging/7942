zzso assessment of patients with zzso valve zzso zzso requires a detailed evaluation of zzso valve zzso zzso valve area zzso and pressure zzso and presence zzso valve zzso Our aim was to evaluate zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso in patients with isolated zzso and to compare with zzso zzso zzso to determine the zzso 

Thirty-one patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with isolated zzso who were in a normal zzso rhythm were included in the zzso Patients with ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso valve zzso zzso zzso and zzso of other valves, and previous zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured with zzso and zzso There were strong correlations between zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Assessment of zzso analysis revealed strong agreement on measuring zzso zzso with values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the limits of agreement were zzso to zzso 

zzso is a reliable method in patients with zzso for diagnosis and zzso
