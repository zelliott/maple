To evaluate the diagnostic value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and skeletal zzso in the detection of skeletal zzso in patients with solid zzso 

One hundred and zzso tumor patients were examined with zzso zzso using zzso zzso sequences for the different anatomical zzso zzso zzso was performed with zzso 

In zzso zzso patients, the zzso zzso and skeletal zzso findings were zzso In zzso zzso patients, both imaging zzso excluded skeletal zzso In zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso and skeletal zzso revealed zzso however zzso zzso demonstrated more extensive disease in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cases, skeletal zzso was superior to zzso zzso in detecting more skeletal zzso In zzso zzso cases, the imaging findings were zzso In 15 cases, skeletal zzso was negative, whereas zzso zzso revealed skeletal zzso In 9 cases, skeletal zzso was positive, whereas zzso zzso failed to detect these zzso In zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso revealed additional zzso zzso 

zzso zzso as a new staging method, is superior to skeletal zzso with respect to the detection of skeletal zzso and the extent of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso yields additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be performed as an alternative to skeletal zzso for the assessment of skeletal zzso
