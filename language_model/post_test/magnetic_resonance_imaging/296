zzso zzso coronary intervention zzso is more effective than zzso therapy for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but initial treatment delay to intervention is the main limitation of this zzso 

zzso use of high-dose zzso could reduce zzso zzso size, using analysis of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Patients with zzso within 12 hours after symptom onset were zzso to a facilitated zzso group zzso zzso zzso or to a primary zzso group zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso was zzso zzso size evaluated by the volume of delayed zzso on zzso at 1 month after index zzso 

The baseline clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the 2 zzso Although the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso flow grade 2 to 3 was significantly higher in the facilitated zzso group than in the primary zzso group zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso the achievement of zzso blush grade 2 to 3 or zzso resolution at 30 minutes after procedure was not significantly different between the facilitated zzso and the primary zzso group zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso size on zzso was similar in the facilitated zzso group and the conventional primary zzso group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso At 6 months, the left zzso ejection fraction zzso on zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the facilitated zzso group and zzso zzso zzso in the primary zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

Despite the improvement of initial zzso flow grade, the upstream use of high-dose zzso did not reduce zzso zzso size measured by zzso
