zzso functional connectivity between and within brain regions is a key concern in zzso Due to the noise inherent in zzso data, it is challenging to characterize the properties of individual zzso and current methods are unable to zzso analyze zzso connectivity zzso We propose a new functional connectivity method which incorporates a spatial zzso constraint using zzso zzso enabling the discovery of zzso interactions between brain regions from the small zzso characteristic of zzso zzso We validate our method in two separate experiments, demonstrating that we can learn coherent connectivity maps that are consistent with known zzso First, we examine the functional connectivity between early visual areas zzso and zzso confirming that this connectivity structure preserves zzso zzso Then, we show that two zzso regions in zzso zzso - the zzso Place Area zzso and the zzso Face Area zzso - exhibit an expected peripheral versus zzso bias in their connectivity with visual area zzso These results show that our approach is powerful, widely zzso and capable of uncovering complex connectivity patterns with only a small amount of input zzso
