zzso or itch, is the most prevalent symptom of allergic and inflammatory skin zzso Although it is known that itch zzso zzso of a neural network in the brain, the zzso dynamics of the network as well as the zzso and zzso are not well zzso 

The study aimed to zzso zzso the zzso dynamics of the itch response identified in earlier studies and zzso the relationship between central and zzso responses to zzso 

Using a novel zzso analysis, we performed a zzso zzso randomized, zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of the cerebral processing of zzso itch in healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso by tracking the zzso period following a single skin zzso 

zzso itch compared with saline resulted in significant area under the curve blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal changes in the zzso zzso zzso and right inferior frontal zzso We observed negative zzso zzso signal changes compared with saline in zzso the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso several regions within the zzso We noted a trend significance in the left zzso zzso part of the motor zzso The zzso signal change in several of these regions correlated with perception of itch zzso 

In contrast to other zzso studies we observed a zzso negative zzso An improved understanding of both activated and zzso brain regions during the itch response may in the long term facilitate development of more effective management zzso
