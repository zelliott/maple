zzso zzso factor zzso is used to stimulate zzso cell production and function in children undergoing chemotherapy for zzso We zzso that zzso can cause zzso of zzso from fatty to zzso and that this change can be detected by MR imaging at sites away from the primary zzso This benign effect of treatment should not be confused with tumor zzso 

MR images of zzso of the affected and zzso limbs were zzso reviewed for 16 patients with zzso of the zzso or zzso nine of these patients had received zzso A grade was assigned to zzso signal intensity at sites away from the zzso and findings before and after treatment were zzso The zzso of MR image interpretation was assessed by comparing the signal intensity of zzso with the zzso appearance of zzso at 19 zzso zzso 

Changes consistent with zzso were seen on MR images in seven of nine patients who had received zzso in addition to chemotherapy and in none of seven patients who had received chemotherapy zzso The difference in proportions was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso exact test, two zzso The zzso appearance of zzso at the zzso margins agreed with the interpretation of the zzso inversion recovery sequence in all cases zzso 

The findings suggest that zzso causes changes in the MR imaging appearance of zzso zzso correlation supports the hypothesis that these changes are attributable to zzso from fatty to zzso zzso Awareness of this finding is important to avoid zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso
