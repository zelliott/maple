Using high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging, the normal zzso asymmetry of the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso accurately and reliably in the intact human zzso The following main results have emerged from MR zzso of individual direction and degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso left-handers are less zzso than normal zzso without significant gender zzso This confirms a zzso correlation in cerebral zzso zzso The aforementioned zzso difference in zzso asymmetry is also found in pairs of normal zzso twins zzso for zzso Thus, structural brain asymmetry may not be genetically zzso zzso Whereas right-handed patients with zzso deficits of zzso processing have been reported to show decrease zzso zzso musicians with perfect pitch display exaggerated zzso zzso Thus, increasing zzso asymmetry of zzso zzso covering the zzso may be correlated with the processing capacity for certain auditory zzso Studies of the zzso as a structural marker of cerebral asymmetry will continue to contribute to a better understanding of the zzso and zzso of zzso
