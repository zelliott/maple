zzso of individual faces is an integral part of both interpersonal interactions and successful functioning within a social zzso zzso it is of considerable interest that individuals with zzso and related conditions have selective deficits in face recognition zzso zzso object zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to study face and zzso object perception in 14 zzso individuals with zzso or zzso syndrome (the zzso group), in comparison with 2 groups of matched normal controls zzso control group ] zzso and normal control group 2 zzso zzso zzso 14 for zzso zzso of interest zzso were defined in zzso and then applied in comparisons between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of interest were also defined in zzso and then applied to comparisons between zzso and the zzso group as a replication zzso 

In the first set of zzso we found significant task zzso group interactions for the size of zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso and right inferior zzso zzso zzso Post hoc analyses showed that during face (but not zzso discrimination, the zzso group had significantly greater zzso than controls in the right ITG and less zzso of the right zzso The replication study showed again that the zzso group used the ITG significantly more for processing faces than the control groups, but for these zzso the effect was now on the left zzso Greater ITG zzso was the pattern found in both control groups during object zzso 

zzso with zzso spectrum disorders demonstrate a pattern of brain activity during face discrimination that is consistent with zzso strategies that are more typical of zzso object zzso
