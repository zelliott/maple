To compare the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso at zzso T with zzso zzso in the detection of zzso liver zzso in diffuse fatty zzso of the liver after zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso liver zzso and at moderate to severe zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 64, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients underwent surgical zzso of liver zzso zzso ultrasound zzso was carried out, which served as the standard of reference, together with zzso 

Overall, 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were found at zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso For zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso detected only zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso were detected by zzso seven small zzso by zzso There was no statistically significant difference between the two zzso in the detection of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected all zzso and revealed two zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso T zzso is superior to zzso zzso in detecting zzso liver zzso zzso 1 zzso during zzso staging in patients with liver zzso A combination of zzso and zzso may further improve the outcome of surgical zzso
