We tested the value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the follow-up of patients with zzso zzso zzso after zzso artery zzso zzso provides a zzso zzso of zzso turbulent flow in order to zzso left zzso zzso tract zzso 

We followed 10 patients who were treated with zzso artery zzso for 12 zzso We used zzso echo sequences to document continuous improvement of the zzso tract area and zzso and zzso spin echo sequences to zzso zzso zzso A zzso but not zzso improvement of the zzso tract area occurred after zzso artery zzso during the 12-month follow-up zzso The improvement of the zzso tract area correlated well with the zzso of symptoms zzso 

We conclude that zzso reliably detects the degree of obstruction in patients with zzso zzso zzso This zzso may be especially useful for follow-up after zzso artery zzso
