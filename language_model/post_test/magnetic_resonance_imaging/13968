In multiple zzso the mechanisms underlying the zzso of disability are poorly zzso Recently, it has been suggested that zzso cortical changes may limit the clinical impact of multiple sclerosis zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging and a general search method were used to assess patterns of brain zzso associated with a simple motor task in 14 zzso nondisabled zzso multiple sclerosis patients that were compared to those from 15 zzso zzso and zzso healthy zzso Also investigated were the extent to which the functional magnetic resonance imaging changes correlated with zzso zzso volume and severity of multiple sclerosis pathology in zzso and zzso brain zzso measured using zzso transfer and diffusion zzso magnetic resonance zzso Compared to controls, multiple sclerosis patients showed increased zzso in the zzso primary zzso cortex, zzso in the supplementary motor area, zzso in the zzso motor area, in the zzso ascending bank of the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume was correlated with relative zzso in the zzso supplementary motor area, and in the zzso and zzso zzso motor zzso Average zzso zzso transfer ratio and average zzso water zzso were correlated with relative zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Average zzso zzso transfer ratio was also correlated with relative zzso in the zzso zzso motor zzso Average water zzso and peak height of the zzso brain tissue zzso zzso were both correlated with relative zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This study shows that cortical zzso occurs over a rather distributed zzso network in nondisabled zzso multiple sclerosis zzso It also suggests that increased recruitment of this cortical network contributes to the limitation of the functional impact of white matter multiple sclerosis zzso
