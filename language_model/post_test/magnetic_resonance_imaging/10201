To determine whether the zzso zzso volume zzso zzso with the development of zzso imaging changes suggestive of radiation necrosis in patients treated for zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors with gamma knife zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective zzso review of 129 patients with 198 separate zzso tumors was zzso Patients were followed with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and physical examinations at 3- to zzso zzso Patients who developed zzso zzso changes suggestive of radiation necrosis were labeled as having either symptomatic radiation necrosis zzso if they experienced any decline in zzso examination associated with the imaging changes, or zzso radiation necrosis zzso if they had a stable or improving zzso zzso 

zzso correlated with risk of zzso which was zzso (for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 57% zzso zzso The risk of zzso did not significantly change with zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the following factors were associated with the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso previous zzso zzso zzso and male sex zzso zzso plan zzso did not correlate with the development of zzso 

The risk of zzso but not zzso after zzso for zzso tumors zzso with zzso and increases significantly for zzso zzso
