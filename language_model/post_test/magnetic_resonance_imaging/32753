To determine whether vascular zzso growth factor zzso levels are associated with the presence of cerebral zzso zzso in patients after acute zzso zzso 

A zzso study that used blood samples obtained within 24 hours of symptom onset from patients who experienced acute stroke to measure zzso levels by zzso zzso A validated zzso rating scale was used to analyze acutely acquired magnetic resonance images, with the zzso blind to clinical details and zzso zzso 

zzso and Emergency Department at University College Hospital, London, zzso 

Twenty patients who experienced acute zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and serum level of zzso 

Five of the 20 patients with acute zzso stroke zzso had zzso The median zzso level in the zzso group was significantly higher than that in the group without zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An increase in vascular zzso secondary to a raised zzso level may have a role in the genesis of zzso in patients with acute zzso zzso
