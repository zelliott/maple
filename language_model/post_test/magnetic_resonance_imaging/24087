An zzso dynamic zzso echo sequence with two echoes is used to obtain data that can be analyzed with indicator dilution theory as well as with zzso zzso Taking advantage of the zzso of zzso and zzso information, both theories can be employed and merged to interpret consistently the observed effects of the zzso of a contrast agent zzso zzso into the tissue from first pass zzso The regional cerebral blood volume zzso and the exchange rate of the contrast agent between the vascular and the zzso space through the zzso barrier are analyzed for each zzso in a zzso zzso Two values for zzso are obtained with different weighting for the zzso fraction of the blood zzso Because the analysis, called zzso is capable of separating effects related to zzso (through zzso blood zzso and to leakage in places where the zzso barrier is damaged, it is an appropriate tool for evaluating these parameters in brain tumors, and we show clinical examples of this analysis in brain tumor zzso
