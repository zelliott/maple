The aim of this study was to determine the value of a fat suppressed zzso zzso sequence zzso data set in comparison to a zzso zzso sequence in direct MR zzso of the zzso For this purpose we examined 50 consecutive patients with zzso or chronic disorders of the shoulder using a zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso reconstructed from 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with fat zzso were zzso Visual image analysis of anatomical and pathological structures was performed by two independent zzso A correlation to surgical results was available in 21 zzso zzso zzso sequences were well suited for analysis of the zzso zzso the middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with fat suppression was slightly superior to zzso zzso without fat suppression in the evaluation of the zzso zzso and the middle zzso zzso whereas for cartilage no significant differences were found between both zzso zzso pathological findings, in most of the cases zzso delivered the same results as zzso In conclusion, a zzso zzso zzso data set with fat zzso in zzso orientation may be useful for evaluation of the zzso zzso and the middle zzso zzso However, similar measured slice thickness of 3 zzso if zzso to zzso zzso to a zzso sequence with 4 zzso does not provide significant diagnostic zzso
