To assess the value of zzso in the diagnosis of portal zzso with zzso zzso 

and zzso six patients referred for clinical suspicion of zzso obstruction and portal zzso were explored with zzso all patients were explored using a zzso zzso zzso GE MR unit, with high zzso field strength and torso phased array zzso zzso ducts were explored with zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso thick zzso Then, zzso zzso with shorter TE zzso zzso and delayed zzso sequences were zzso CT scan and zzso examinations of the liver were performed in all zzso Two patients were operated on and 2 underwent zzso retrograde zzso 

Three different types of zzso involvement were zzso in 3 cases findings that mimic zzso spreading along the common zzso duct and in 3 other cases multiple smooth zzso impressions along the common zzso zzso in one patient zzso demonstrated an irregular narrowing of the common zzso duct mimicking chronic zzso In all cases, the zzso duct zzso appeared of low zzso zzso in three cases, zzso was identified on delayed zzso 

zzso and zzso can be proposed as a first imaging study in patients with portal zzso and zzso or zzso duct zzso
