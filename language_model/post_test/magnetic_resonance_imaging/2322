To investigate a method of diagnosing zzso that contains minimal zzso 

In six cases of zzso with minimal fat, the zzso on contrast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images, the zzso on zzso the signal intensity on zzso magnetic resonance zzso images, and the gross zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso In 100 cases of zzso cell zzso the same parameters were zzso and results were compared with those of zzso 

When compared with the surrounding zzso zzso all six zzso showed zzso high zzso on zzso CT images, homogeneous enhancement on zzso CT images, and homogeneous zzso on zzso Of the five zzso examined with MR imaging, four were zzso and one was zzso on zzso zzso All six zzso zzso from the zzso zzso None of the 100 zzso cell zzso showed zzso high zzso on zzso CT images, homogeneous enhancement on zzso CT images, or homogeneous zzso on zzso 

In the zzso zzso high zzso on zzso CT images, homogeneous enhancement on zzso CT images, and homogeneous zzso on zzso are suggestive of zzso that contains abundant muscle and minimal zzso
