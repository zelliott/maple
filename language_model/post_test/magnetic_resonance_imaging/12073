Whole body magnetic resonance zzso imaging has recently become an important diagnostic tool for cardiovascular zzso The technique of magnetic resonance phase zzso zzso allows the quantitative measurement of zzso for an arbitrary component zzso A study was initiated to determine the ability and accuracy of MR zzso to measure a wide range of flow conditions including flow zzso three-dimensional secondary flow, high zzso zzso and zzso A steady flow system pumped water doped with zzso zzso through a variety of test zzso Images were produced using zzso echo sequences on test sections including a straight tube, a curved tube, a smoothly zzso zzso and an zzso zzso resonance zzso of zzso and turbulent flows were depicted as zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso revealed such flow behavior as zzso varying zzso zzso and secondary flows over a wide range of zzso Comparisons made with published experimental laser zzso zzso zzso and theoretical calculations for similar flow conditions revealed excellent accuracy and precision zzso The successful measurement of zzso profiles for a variety of flow conditions and zzso indicate that magnetic resonance imaging is an accurate, zzso zzso
