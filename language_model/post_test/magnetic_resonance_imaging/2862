The diagnosis of acute cerebral zzso remains zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso are not specific at early time zzso zzso imaging a new technique for magnetic resonance imaging was introduced in experimental studies and shown to have much earlier sensitivity for acute zzso zzso zzso imaging demonstrated early zzso within minutes after zzso onset and correlated well with zzso studies of the final zzso zzso On the basis of molecular motion of water, zzso during zzso on diffusion imaging are most likely related to the development of zzso induced zzso zzso and to slower zzso zzso Experimental treatment and zzso studies with diffusion imaging demonstrated zzso reversal in zzso Continuous monitoring after induction of zzso enables an in zzso demonstration of the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the apparent diffusion zzso may enable the differentiation of zzso tissue in the core of the zzso from zzso damaged zzso zzso clinical studies demonstrated a superior sensitivity of diffusion imaging compared with zzso zzso zzso may be able in the near future to image early stroke and to assess therapy when the stroke is still zzso
