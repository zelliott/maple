zzso interact with the world through actions that are implemented by sensory and motor zzso A substantial part of these interactions consists in synchronized zzso actions involving two or more zzso zzso techniques for assessing zzso simultaneously from two individuals have been zzso However, zzso recordings that permit the assessment of synchronized zzso activities at much higher levels of zzso resolution have not yet been simultaneously assessed in multiple individuals and analyzed in the zzso zzso In this study, we simultaneously recorded zzso from the brains of each of eight pairs of guitarists playing a short melody together to explore the extent and the functional significance of synchronized cortical activity in the course of zzso coordinated zzso 

By applying synchronization zzso to zzso and zzso zzso we found that phase synchronization both within and between brains increased significantly during the periods of zzso zzso metronome tempo setting and zzso coordinated play zzso Phase alignment extracted from zzso dynamics was related to behavioral play onset zzso between zzso 

Our findings show that zzso coordinated actions are preceded and accompanied by zzso zzso zzso Presumably, these zzso reflect similarities in the zzso properties of the zzso zzso and zzso Whether zzso zzso zzso play a zzso role in initiating and maintaining interpersonal action coordination needs to be clarified by further zzso
