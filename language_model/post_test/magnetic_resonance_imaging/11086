By recalling zzso zzso it is possible to generate vivid zzso perceptions in the absence of zzso zzso This zzso image influences our zzso zzso However, the mechanism of the zzso zzso of zzso perception in the human is still zzso Our findings propose a new perspective on the neural basis of zzso zzso Although zzso imagery and zzso perception shared common parts of neural zzso there was an zzso topography of zzso in the zzso the left zzso was predominantly activated by zzso imagery zzso In addition, the middle and superior frontal zzso were not activated by zzso perception but they participated in the generation of zzso zzso These regions in the frontal zzso may mediate the zzso control of retrieving zzso information from the storage of long-term zzso
