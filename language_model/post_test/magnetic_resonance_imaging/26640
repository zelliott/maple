zzso zzso might contribute to left zzso zzso dysfunction following cardiac zzso zzso resonance imaging is considered the most accurate method of determining zzso zzso We compared zzso (by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso zzso and detection of zzso 3 zzso and zzso function after regional zzso zzso and global zzso zzso 

Pigs were zzso to undergo regional zzso zzso for 20 + 20 zzso global zzso zzso with zzso bypass zzso for 40 zzso or zzso without zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso 

Compared with the control group, the number of zzso zzso was higher in the global zzso group with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and further increased in areas of unprotected regional zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with active zzso 3 were detected after global and regional zzso The global ejection fraction did not differ between zzso and regional zzso zzso 

The use of zzso and zzso efficiently protects the heart from global zzso zzso zzso during open heart zzso
