We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to zzso in individual subjects, the properties of the kinetic zzso zzso region, which previous position zzso zzso studies have shown to be involved in the processing of kinetic zzso The zzso region was significantly activated in zzso subjects tested in the zzso of uniform motion from kinetic zzso The zzso region is genuinely specialized for processing kinetic boundaries since it is significantly more activated by kinetic zzso than by zzso zzso uniform motion or transparent zzso This leaves only the kinetic zzso created by zzso in motion direction, as the specific stimulus zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso region is zzso and functionally distinct from areas zzso zzso and zzso It also has minimal overlap with the lateral zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso of the zzso region is robust and relatively immune to changes in stimulus size, spatial frequency and type of kinetic zzso These results strongly argue for the view that the zzso region is a new, separate, functional region in human zzso zzso
