zzso models that describe the outcome of white matter diffusion zzso experiments have various degrees of zzso While the simplest models assume zzso and parallel zzso more elaborate ones may include zzso of zzso diameters and zzso orientation zzso These zzso features can be zzso from zzso signal zzso zzso by solving an inverse problem, validated in several zzso Carlo simulation zzso Model development has been paralleled by zzso studies of the zzso of excised and fixed nerves, confirming that zzso diameter estimates from diffusion zzso agree with those from zzso However, results obtained in zzso are less zzso For example, the amount of slowly zzso water is lower than expected, and the zzso signal is apparently insensitive to diffusion time variations, contrary to what may be zzso Recent zzso of the resolution limit in diffusion zzso the rate of water exchange, and the presence of microscopic zzso zzso and zzso orientation zzso may, however, explain such apparent zzso zzso of the effects of zzso mechanisms on water diffusion in tissue can be used to predict the outcome of diffusion zzso imaging zzso and of diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso parameters found in studies of zzso such as zzso stroke can thus be compared with those predicted by zzso Observations in agreement with the predictions strengthen the credibility of zzso zzso those in disagreement could provide clues of how to improve zzso zzso is particularly suited for this zzso it is performed using higher zzso than zzso and thus carries more information about the tissue zzso The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current understanding of how various properties of the tissue zzso and the rate of water exchange between zzso are reflected in diffusion zzso zzso We focus on the use of zzso models for zzso zzso parameters from data obtained with single zzso sequences on clinical zzso zzso but results obtained with animal zzso scanners are also zzso While zzso of white matter is the central theme, experiments on model systems that highlight important aspects of the zzso models are also zzso
