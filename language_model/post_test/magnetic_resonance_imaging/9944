To develop a clinically relevant zzso zzso model to study pancreatic cancer using two different zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines and to assess zzso for its zzso in this zzso 

Two cell lines, zzso and zzso were employed for the zzso Cell proliferation and migration were monitored in zzso zzso was tested for its role in tumor zzso zzso cell growth was assessed after zzso injection of tumor cells into the pancreatic head of zzso mice by zzso and zzso 

zzso and migration of zzso were significantly faster than those of zzso zzso did not affect tumor zzso but prevented tumor cell spread after injection thus avoiding zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso could reliably monitor zzso tumor growth in both cell zzso zzso had a more irregular zzso growth, and zzso grew more zzso Both tumors showed local zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso growth pattern, whereas zzso displayed a moderately differentiated zzso tumor zzso zzso mice had a significantly shorter zzso zzso survival than zzso mice zzso zzso 

This model closely mimics human pancreatic zzso zzso was invaluable for zzso monitoring of tumor growth thus reducing the number of mice zzso zzso two different cell lines, this model can be used for various treatment and imaging zzso
