A common complication associated with aging is the stiffening of skeletal zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of magnetic resonance zzso zzso to study this phenomenon in zzso Twenty female subjects were included in the study with an age range of 50 to 70 zzso zzso zzso was calculated for the zzso anterior of each zzso There was not a significant relationship between age and zzso zzso However, three subjects had zzso high values and were among the oldest subjects zzso There was a significant relationship between age and tissue zzso zzso More research is needed to determine whether the changes seen here are reflective of increased tissue zzso or related to reduced muscle zzso However, zzso shows promise as a tool to study zzso muscle zzso changes or to evaluate treatments to counteract these zzso
