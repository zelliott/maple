The objective of our study was to evaluate diagnostic ability and features of quantitative zzso of three zzso zzso rate on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value, and fat suppression on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for characterizing adrenal zzso 

Image findings of zzso zzso CT, and zzso were reviewed for 78 patients with functioning zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 30) adrenal zzso The zzso zzso rate, zzso value on zzso CT, and suppression on zzso to zzso zzso were measured for adrenal zzso 

The zzso zzso rate, CT zzso value, and MR suppression index showed the sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for functioning zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for those of zzso zzso A statistically significant correlation was observed between size and zzso zzso and between CT zzso value and MR suppression zzso Regarding zzso zzso the zzso zzso ratio was significantly higher in cortisol releasing than in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso rate was reliable for characterization of zzso among adrenal masses of zzso zzso CT zzso value and MR suppression index were well correlated with each other, and were useful regardless of mass zzso
