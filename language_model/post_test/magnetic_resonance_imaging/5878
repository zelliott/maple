zzso review of case zzso 

zzso referral zzso zzso 

Three hundred zzso patients have been managed conservatively with a mean follow-up of 43 months since zzso Two hundred zzso patients with at least 1 follow-up scan have been included in the zzso 

Review of case records and zzso data to devise management zzso 

zzso growth rates, timing of detection of growth in growing tumors, and timing of detection of growth in tumors growing at different zzso 

Of 276 patients, 62 zzso demonstrated zzso The mean growth rate for growing tumors was 4 zzso annually zzso zzso zzso Of the growing tumors, zzso grew slowly zzso zzso and zzso grew more rapidly zzso zzso Four tumors displayed genuine zzso zzso Of the rapidly growing tumors, 16 of 19 were detected at the first follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (6 zzso Of all growing tumors, zzso were detected within 3 zzso The remaining zzso were detected within a further 3 zzso 

Growth is usually manifest in the first 3 years after zzso We recommend an initial magnetic resonance imaging scan at 6 months, with scans to take place at annual intervals for 2 zzso A further scan 2 years later will identify any patient with zzso zzso zzso follow-up should be lifelong every 5 zzso Cystic tumors represent a particular threat to patients and should only be treated conservatively with zzso
