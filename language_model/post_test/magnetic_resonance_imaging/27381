zzso functional movements lead to complex zzso of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to test whether zzso zzso influences zzso zzso and zzso joint zzso loading zzso 

Six subjects were analyzed by means of dynamic zzso during jaw zzso with zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso by a cast metal bar fixed zzso to two implant pairs in the zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by means of zzso for repeated zzso zzso level zzso 

zzso zzso reduced zzso deformation during jaw zzso as measured between two implants in the zzso region on each side of the zzso significantly by zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly reduced the distance between lateral zzso poles zzso displacement zzso magnitude of each pole: zzso zzso average zzso displacement zzso zzso of the zzso and led to a zzso displacement of their zzso as well as a zzso displacement of zzso zzso 

During jaw zzso zzso of the zzso leads to a significant reduction of zzso deformation and zzso distance and to altered zzso zzso resulting in changed loading patterns of the zzso zzso
