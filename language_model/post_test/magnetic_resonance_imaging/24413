The human zzso frontal zzso has been associated with the most sophisticated aspects of zzso including those that are thought to be especially refined in zzso Here we used zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and functional zzso zzso in humans and zzso to zzso and compare the organization of zzso frontal zzso in the two zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we identified 10 zzso frontal regions lying between the human inferior frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso of functional zzso between each area and the rest of the brain were then estimated with zzso and compared with functional zzso patterns in zzso Areas in human zzso frontal cortex, including areas associated with high-level social cognitive processes such as theory of mind, showed a surprising degree of similarity in their functional zzso patterns with the frontal pole, zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso in the zzso We failed to find evidence for zzso regions in human zzso frontal zzso On the lateral surface, comparison of functional zzso patterns suggested zzso in anatomical organization distinct from those that are widely zzso A human region sometimes referred to as lateral frontal pole more closely resembled area 46, rather than the frontal pole, of the zzso zzso the pattern of results suggest important similarities in frontal zzso organization in humans and other zzso even in the case of regions thought to carry out uniquely human zzso The patterns of zzso zzso are not, however, always those that are widely zzso
