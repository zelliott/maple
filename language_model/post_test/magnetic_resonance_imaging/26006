To determine the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso in the management of zzso and secondary progressive zzso as monitored by zzso 

zzso studies and several short term zzso trials of zzso suggested clinical and zzso benefits with acceptable risk for closely followed zzso zzso 

The North American zzso Trial formally screened zzso individuals for zzso or secondary progressive, clinically zzso zzso recent disease activity or zzso and an Expanded zzso zzso zzso score at entry of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was obtained on zzso subjects at zzso zzso cases at enrollment, and then at three monthly intervals until the trial was prematurely terminated for unacceptable zzso 

Enhancement was found on zzso of zzso entry zzso zzso robust correlations were found between clinical demographic data and several entry zzso measures including zzso volume, a reflection of brain zzso Assessment of the effect of treatment on zzso disease was limited by early trial zzso However, active treatment for 3 months reduced the proportion of patients with one or more zzso An exploratory analysis suggested that zzso zzso was the most active of three doses tested in limiting the total volume of enhanced zzso the proportion of zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso and by a novel zzso composite disease zzso 

The short term signature of the effect of zzso on zzso aspects of the disease suggests that safer drugs of this class might be useful in the management of zzso The use of a composite index of the zzso nature of the pathology of zzso as captured by zzso may have merit as an outcome measure in clinical zzso
