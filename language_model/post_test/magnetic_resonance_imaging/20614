Prospective memory zzso denotes the ability to remember to perform actions in the zzso It has been argued that standard laboratory zzso fail to capture core aspects of zzso 

We combined functional zzso virtual reality, zzso and verbal reports to explore the dynamic allocation of zzso processes during a zzso PM task where individuals performed zzso in a realistic model of their residential zzso Based on eye movement data and verbal reports, we modeled PM as an zzso loop of five sustained and transient zzso intention maintenance before target detection zzso zzso intention maintenance after zzso action, and zzso the latter representing the zzso of a new intention in zzso The zzso analyses revealed continuous engagement of a zzso zzso network throughout the entire task, likely zzso goal maintenance in zzso In addition, a shift was observed from a zzso zzso system while searching for places to go, to a zzso zzso zzso system for remembering what actions to perform after zzso zzso of the zzso zzso network occurred at both TD and zzso the latter likely also being characterized by zzso zzso 

Taken together, these findings show how brain systems complementary interact during real-world zzso and support a more complete model of PM that can be applied to zzso PM tasks and that we named zzso zzso zzso zzso model because of its dynamics on both zzso iteration and the interactions of distinct zzso zzso
