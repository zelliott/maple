zzso zzso is a powerful zzso zzso It has two zzso label transfer that transfers zzso labels from zzso zzso to a novel image and label fusion that combines the label transfer zzso For reliable label transfer, most methods assume that the structure of interest to be segmented have localized spatial support across different zzso Although the technique has been successful for many applications, the strong assumption also limits its zzso For example, zzso zzso has not been applied for tumor zzso because it is difficult to derive reliable label transfer for such applications due to the substantial variation in tumor zzso To address this zzso we propose a label transfer technique for zzso zzso Inspired by the zzso work zzso we approach this problem in two zzso Our method first zzso images into homogeneous regions, called zzso For a zzso in a novel image, to find its correspondence in zzso for label transfer, we first locate zzso in zzso that are most similar to the zzso the target zzso belongs zzso Then, zzso correspondence is found through searching for zzso that have most similar patches to the target zzso within the selected zzso zzso We apply this technique for brain tumor zzso and show promising zzso
