An experimental study was performed on joint specimens of the knee to assess the advantages and disadvantages of 14 generally available sequences in cartilage zzso 

Each of the 50 surgically exposed zzso zzso of the knee was examined by the following zzso zzso zzso and zzso weighted spin zzso zzso zzso and zzso weighted zzso zzso weighted zzso with fat suppression, zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso weighted zzso D, zzso zzso D, zzso D (with fat zzso and MR zzso We assessed the image quality by a scale, signal to zzso of cartilage and joint fluid, and the accuracy in detection of cartilage zzso zzso and zzso were reference methods to zzso and demonstrated grade zzso zzso on 186 of 300 joint zzso 

Advanced stages of cartilage zzso (65 grade 3 and 4 zzso were detected by standard zzso sequences in zzso Application of volume techniques zzso D, zzso zzso high definition zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso D and zzso improved the sensitivity up to zzso zzso zzso (65 grade 2 zzso were demonstrated in zzso and on MR zzso in zzso zzso changes zzso Grade 1 zzso were recorded on zzso in only zzso 

With regard to standard zzso zzso the zzso of cartilage zzso can be improved by techniques that use 512 zzso selective cartilage imaging, and volume zzso
