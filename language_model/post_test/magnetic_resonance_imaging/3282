The breast is highly zzso sensitive especially to the sex steroid hormone zzso Both zzso and zzso steroid hormone modifications could affect how the breast tissue may appear in breast imaging zzso We hypothesized that zzso deprivation therapy could reduce breast zzso enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

This study was a prospective pilot phase II clinical zzso The study was approved by Health Canada and the institutional research ethics board, and participants signed informed consent zzso Sixteen healthy zzso women were zzso and 14 completed the zzso zzso breast zzso was done followed 1 month later by administration of a high-dose zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso for 3 successive days before a second breast zzso zzso breast zzso enhancement was compared between the zzso and zzso zzso 

There was a statistically significant reduction of the average background breast enhancement after treatment with zzso zzso compared with baseline zzso Of particular interest, specific areas of benign breast enhancement were reduced after zzso inhibitor zzso No significant adverse effects were recorded using this relatively high dose of the zzso zzso 

This preliminary study provided evidence that zzso zzso could reduce the zzso background enhancement of benign breast tissue during zzso and may improve the specificity of the zzso
