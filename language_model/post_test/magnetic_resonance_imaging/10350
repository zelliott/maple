The zzso technique for zzso cruciate ligament reconstructions can potentially lead to poor clinical outcomes due to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the original zzso cruciate ligament fibers in the reconstruction will contribute significantly to the zzso stability of the knee joint, healing of the zzso and prevention of graft zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

zzso patients zzso men and 16 zzso mean age, zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso cruciate ligament reconstruction with preservation of the cruciate ligament zzso they were reviewed at a mean period of zzso zzso All patients were assessed with the zzso knee score, International zzso Documentation Committee zzso and objective evaluations, and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 40 zzso images were assessed for graft zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso zzso was performed in 42 zzso 

The mean zzso score improved from zzso to zzso The final International zzso Documentation Committee zzso evaluation rated all patients as normal or nearly normal, and the objective evaluation showed normal or nearly normal in 59 patients zzso and abnormal in 2 patients zzso The mean zzso difference on the zzso zzso was zzso zzso All patients showed zzso graft continuity on magnetic resonance zzso Mean graft thickness was zzso zzso in the zzso plane and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Images for all patients revealed zzso low signal intensity in the zzso portion of the zzso with complete healing of the graft and original zzso cruciate ligament fibers as one zzso zzso loosening or graft tear by the killer turn effect was not detected in any zzso zzso zzso revealed complete healing and graft integration, with the original zzso cruciate ligament fibers in all zzso 

In zzso zzso cruciate ligament zzso poor outcomes from the killer turn effect may be reduced by preserving the original zzso cruciate ligament zzso
