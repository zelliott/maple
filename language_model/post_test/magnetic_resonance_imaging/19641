zzso an zzso spin zzso technique, provides zzso quantitative zzso values and zzso transit times zzso This paper focuses on the negative impact of zzso partial zzso on FAIR zzso To understand and solve this problem, we performed a theoretical analysis and a range of zzso We then acquired FAIR data from a volunteer to illustrate our zzso We found that the zzso effect of zzso is a delayed zzso during inversion zzso The zzso of magnitude inversion recovery data in FAIR generates erroneous negative data and distorted fit zzso we simulated that for zzso percentages of zzso zzso and zzso will be progressively overestimated by up to zzso For higher zzso percentages the errors were found to increase zzso We explored a straightforward solution: taking the magnitude of the FAIR data before zzso This provided a remarkably strong antidote against the effects of zzso partial zzso for zzso percentages of zzso simulations now gave zzso values accurate within zzso and zzso within zzso The fit remained robust for high zzso zzso Our analysis and simulations demonstrate that using magnitude FAIR data zzso the zzso effects of zzso partial zzso Data from a healthy volunteer illustrate these zzso
