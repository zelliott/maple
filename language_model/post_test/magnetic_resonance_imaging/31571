We used zzso to directly compare zzso in two cortical regions previously identified as relevant to real-world scene zzso zzso zzso and a region of zzso zzso zzso functionally defined as the zzso place area zzso We compared zzso in these regions to full views of scenes from a global perspective, close-up views of zzso from the same scene category, and single objects highly diagnostic of that scene zzso zzso were included as a control zzso zzso in zzso place area was greatest for full scene views that explicitly included the zzso spatial structure of the environment, with progressively less zzso for close-up views of local scene regions containing diagnostic objects but less explicitly depicting zzso scene zzso followed by single zzso zzso zzso did not activate zzso place zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso zzso was greatest for full scene views, and did not differ among close-up views, diagnostic objects, and zzso The results showed that zzso place area responds in a graded fashion as images become more completely zzso and include more explicit zzso structure, whereas zzso zzso responds in a zzso manner to the presence of a complete zzso These results suggest scene processing areas are particularly sensitive to the zzso geometric structure that zzso scenes from other types of complex and meaningful visual zzso
