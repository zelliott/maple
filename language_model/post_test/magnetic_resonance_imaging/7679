Use of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso for diagnosis of zzso tumors has been previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso echo sequence zzso imaging using a zzso technique is usually used for dynamic studies and zzso phase zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso In cases where the patient has difficulty holding their breath, this scanning method can be zzso 

To investigate the usefulness of a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence using a zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso during free breathing for zzso phase zzso zzso 

Images were acquired at zzso First, a phantom with diluted zzso was scanned using the zzso sequence and the zzso zzso zzso ratios of the sequences were zzso Next, the zzso phase was zzso in 62 patients using the zzso sequence with zzso and the zzso during free zzso zzso and quantitative evaluations were zzso 

In the phantom study, zzso had a higher contrast ratio than zzso In the clinical study, artifacts were more conspicuous in zzso compared to zzso images in the qualitative zzso However, zzso images were equal to or better than zzso images in patients who had difficulty holding their zzso The signal intensity ratio of the liver was statistically higher using zzso than zzso 

zzso can be useful for zzso phase zzso zzso in patients who have difficulty holding their zzso
