An appreciation of zzso changes to the zzso base is important for understanding the evolution of modern human skull zzso Using geometric zzso techniques, this study explores zzso shape variations of the zzso and zzso during human prenatal zzso In particular, the analysis sets out to explore shape variations associated with zzso zzso and to reassess shape variations previously observed on the basis of angular zzso zzso human fetuses were zzso using high-resolution zzso zzso for 10 landmarks defining the zzso zzso and zzso were acquired and areas of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured as percentages of overall zzso base zzso The results show shape variations with increasing fetal size that are consistent with zzso base zzso anterior facial projection and zzso facial zzso These growth variations are centered on the zzso area and are associated with disproportionate variations of zzso height and zzso Small but significant correlations were observed between zzso of the zzso cartilage and components of shape that zzso among other variations, zzso zzso While zzso cannot be directly linked with the shape variations observed, it seems likely that bone formation plays a role in modulating the influence of other factors on the fetal zzso zzso
