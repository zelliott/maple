To examine the descending motor activity evoked by zzso magnetic stimulation zzso in a chronic alcoholic patient with a slight zzso of the zzso zzso and compare with that observed in zzso intact zzso 

zzso from the first zzso zzso zzso muscle, and descending activity from an zzso implanted in the high cervical zzso space for relief of pain were recorded after zzso of the hand area of motor zzso A zzso zzso was used to induce either a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso flow across the central zzso 

In intact subjects, zzso stimulation evoked the earliest zzso which we termed a D zzso This was followed by later, presumed I waves at intervals of about zzso zzso At a stimulus intensity of zzso resting threshold zzso up to 5 I waves were zzso PA stimulation rarely evoked D waves at zzso up to zzso zzso but 3 or 4 I waves were visible in all zzso The patient had an increased resting zzso and the descending zzso were dominated by a D zzso I waves were zzso with two possible small zzso at zzso and zzso zzso 

The lack of I waves in the patient was probably due to an impairment of zzso zzso in the context of the brain damage related to chronic alcohol abuse, and is consistent with a zzso origin of the I waves in zzso The intact D wave is consistent with the assumption that the D wave represents direct stimulation of the zzso of intact zzso zzso in the zzso white zzso The patient's increased zzso reflects the fact that usually multiple descending zzso are needed to discharge resting spinal zzso
