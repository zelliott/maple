zzso studies suggest that visual motion perception is zzso by opponent mechanisms that zzso to mutually zzso populations of zzso sensitive to motions in opposite zzso We tested for a zzso correlate of motion zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure brain activity in human visual zzso There was strong motion zzso in a secondary visual cortical area known as the human zzso complex zzso but there was little evidence of motion zzso in primary visual zzso To determine whether the level of zzso in human and monkey are comparable, a zzso of these experiments was performed using zzso zzso recording in areas zzso and zzso of the zzso monkey zzso Although there was substantial zzso in the degree of zzso between recording sites, the monkey and human data were zzso similar on zzso These results provide further evidence that: zzso zzso signals zzso human zzso responses, zzso zzso signals in human zzso support visual motion perception, zzso human zzso is zzso to zzso monkey zzso and adjacent motion sensitive brain areas, and zzso that zzso zzso are correlated with average zzso zzso
