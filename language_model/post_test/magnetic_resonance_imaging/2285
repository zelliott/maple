The authors, in this retrospective study, examined a group of patients with zzso syndrome and a related zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso treatment as well as revision surgery with zzso realignment were zzso 

To determine effectiveness of physical therapy and limited surgical zzso zzso as well as major realignment surgical treatment in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso plane zzso associated with distraction zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome involves zzso zzso from the zzso for disease other than zzso Several studies describe surgical realignment for zzso involving zzso systems no longer commonly zzso zzso for a systematic approach to zzso and zzso zzso syndromes are zzso 

Forty-eight patients with zzso and zzso zzso syndromes were zzso Treatment groups were defined by treatment approach and level of previous zzso zzso of treatment was reviewed in terms of zzso zzso alignment and zzso zzso 

Twenty patients were treated without realignment revision zzso zzso patients were treated with anterior and zzso zzso and realignment with zzso For patients originally fused to the zzso realignment averaged 12 zzso zzso was reduced from 7 to 3 zzso zzso In patients fused to zzso or zzso realignment averaged 7 zzso zzso was reduced from 6 to zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed viable zzso discs in four patients who were consequently spared extension of fusion to the zzso 

Treatment without realignment surgery demonstrated long-term success in zzso of zzso The latter all had two intact discs below the previous fusion and zzso zzso less than 4 zzso zzso surgery effectively reduced pain in patients failing a conservative zzso
