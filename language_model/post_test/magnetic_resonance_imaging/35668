zzso dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis zzso but long-term data on zzso in patients with clinically isolated syndromes are zzso 

We determined cognitive functions in 22 patients zzso years old diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso years earlier but had no further clinical bouts and had not progressed clinically to zzso We used a zzso test battery covering nine cognitive zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso of the brain had been performed earlier and was normal in six patients and showed two or more white matter abnormalities compatible with zzso zzso in 16 zzso 

On zzso testing, one patient was within normal range on all tests, six subjects showed borderline results, and 15 patients zzso showed significantly impaired performance in at least one cognitive zzso Seven patients showed significant impairment in two or more zzso Executive function, zzso ability, and information processing speed were the most frequently affected zzso There was no apparent correlation between zzso findings and cognitive zzso 

We conclude that cognitive dysfunction is common in patients many years after clinically isolated zzso zzso zzso dysfunction was found even in patients who had no apparent zzso zzso on follow-up zzso
