zzso dysfunction zzso particularly attention and working zzso occurs early in patients with multiple zzso Previous studies have focused on identifying potentially zzso functional reorganization through recruitment of new brain regions that could limit expression of these zzso However, zzso studies remind us that functional zzso in the brain make certain brain regions necessary for a given zzso We therefore have asked whether altered functional interactions between regions normally recruited provide an alternative zzso mechanism with multiple sclerosis zzso We used a version of the zzso task to probe working memory in patients with early multiple zzso We applied a functional connectivity analysis to test whether relationships between relative zzso in different brain regions change in potentially zzso ways with multiple zzso We studied 21 patients with zzso multiple sclerosis and 16 zzso and zzso healthy controls with zzso functional zzso The two groups performed equally well on the zzso zzso zzso were found in similar regions for patients and zzso However, patients showed relatively reduced zzso in the superior frontal and anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients also showed a zzso but generally substantially smaller increase in zzso than healthy controls with greater task complexity, depending on the specific brain region assessed zzso zzso zzso zzso connectivity analysis defined further differences not apparent from the zzso contrast of the zzso zzso zzso Control subjects showed significantly greater correlations between right zzso prefrontal and superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients showed correlations between zzso in the right and left prefrontal zzso although this relationship was not significant in healthy controls zzso zzso zzso We interpret these results as showing that, while cognitive processing in the task appears to be performed using similar brain regions in patients and controls, the patients have reduced functional reserve for zzso relevant to zzso zzso connectivity analysis suggests that altered zzso interactions between zzso and lateral prefrontal regions may provide an zzso mechanism that could limit clinical expression of the disease distinct from recruitment of novel processing zzso Together, these results suggest that therapeutic enhancement of the zzso of interactions between brain regions normally recruited zzso zzso as well as recruitment of alternative areas or use of complementary cognitive strategies (both forms of zzso functional zzso may limit expression of cognitive zzso in multiple zzso
