Early stroke recurrence risk alter a transient zzso attack zzso is zzso We studied the diagnostic implications of the recurrence pattern after zzso 

210 consecutive zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data were zzso 

At 90 day zzso 14 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso among 209 suffered an zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso a zzso and 6 zzso zzso a cardiac zzso zzso Moreover, 13 patients zzso zzso among 210 with a seven-day follow-up had an zzso zzso analyses only identified the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso as independent zzso of stroke within the first 7 days, and zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso as a predictor of stroke recurrence at 90 day zzso A new diagnosis of zzso zzso was observed in 21 subjects zzso and it was documented in the baseline zzso in zzso zzso Acute diffusion abnormalities were identified in 81 zzso of 182 patients, and chronic zzso zzso were observed in 110 zzso on zzso vs 56 zzso among 210 on CT zzso 

Due to very early zzso the routine use of zzso within the first hours after an index zzso will be useful to identify those patients at high zzso The zzso usefulness of zzso studies will be only achieved if it is performed zzso zzso zzso cardiac rhythm monitoring has a low detection zzso
