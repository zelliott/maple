Visual attention is used to selectively filter relevant information depending on current task demands and zzso Visual attention is called zzso attention when it is directed to coherent forms or objects in the visual zzso This study used real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging for zzso decoding of attention to zzso overlapped objects belonging to two different object zzso First, a zzso zzso was trained on pictures of faces and zzso zzso then saw transparently overlapped pictures of a face and a place, and attended to only one of them while ignoring the zzso The category of the attended object, face or place, was zzso on a zzso basis using the previously trained zzso The decoder performed at zzso accuracy indicating that despite competing bottom-up sensory zzso zzso visual attention biased neural patterns towards that of the attended zzso Furthermore, a comparison between different zzso approaches indicated that the representation of faces and places is distributed rather than zzso This implies that real-time decoding of zzso attention requires a zzso decoding approach that can detect these distributed patterns of cortical zzso
