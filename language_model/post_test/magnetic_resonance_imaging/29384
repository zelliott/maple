High activity zzso zzso has efficacy in selected zzso zzso brain tumors, but limited efficacy and risk of radiation necrosis have prompted investigation of additional zzso zzso This study aims to assess the toxicity of zzso zzso zzso used zzso with zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso brain zzso Twelve patients with zzso zzso brain tumors were implanted using zzso zzso intended to deliver 50 zzso at the zzso line encompassing the enhancing tumor with a zzso margin and heated to zzso degrees C for 48 zzso The average implant volume was 18 zzso with zzso zzso containing zzso sources with a total activity of 265 zzso Serious zzso included 8 motor deficits, 2 mood zzso 4 zzso and 2 zzso wound zzso fluid zzso Median survival was zzso months with the best responses being 6 with stable disease and 2 with partial zzso zzso rate for radiation necrosis was zzso zzso zzso zzso is feasible but is associated with serious zzso There is no suggestion of improved survival with zzso over zzso zzso Given the degree of toxicity observed, alternative approaches to improving local control of these tumors are being zzso
