Experimental zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was monitored by serial MR imaging to determine zzso to the zzso MR studies in multiple sclerosis zzso The relationships of zzso zzso to clinical status and zzso findings were also zzso 

We induced zzso by subcutaneous zzso in two zzso by human white matter zzso and in seven zzso by zzso (a zzso zzso fusion protein of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso along with intravenous zzso zzso vaccine to facilitate the disease zzso The zzso animals were induced with zzso zzso as the established model of zzso zzso The zzso animals were induced with either zzso incomplete zzso or zzso as part of a zzso treatment zzso MR imaging was performed at zzso T at zzso and repeated at zzso to zzso intervals for a period of up to 16 weeks in six zzso zzso and zzso for up to 70 weeks in three zzso and two control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhancement, zzso and zzso transfer zzso images were zzso The brains were prepared for zzso evaluation of zzso distribution and counts, characterization of zzso as zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The clinical, zzso and zzso scoring were done on grading systems, and correlated for zzso 

White matter zzso changes after zzso induction were observed first at 9 days in the zzso animals and at zzso weeks in the zzso animals, with subsequent zzso fluctuations on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were not observed in all zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated to zzso analysis of zzso zzso measuring from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso count and extent of zzso was greater in the zzso animals than in the zzso zzso Some zzso zzso correlated directly to clinical symptoms, but the majority of zzso were clinically zzso 

On MR images, zzso in the zzso zzso model were confined to the zzso and their development, resolution, distribution, and enhancing characteristics zzso over the duration of the zzso The dynamic presentation of zzso zzso confirms the parallels between zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso Clinical symptoms alone were not representative of ongoing zzso brain zzso zzso serial MR imaging serves as a very important adjunct to clinical and zzso surveillance of the development of new and the persistence of existing brain zzso in this animal model of zzso
