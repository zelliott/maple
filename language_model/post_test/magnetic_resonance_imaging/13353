zzso resonance imaging using zzso echo sequences can quickly generate dynamic images of the cardiovascular zzso We used a zzso echo sequence zzso time zzso 21 zzso echo time zzso 12 zzso flip angle zzso 30 zzso to evaluate how a simulated vascular zzso affects the signal intensity of flowing zzso zzso slices were obtained at regular intervals along a plastic tube containing a circular zzso zzso zzso or zzso reduction of zzso zzso Image data collected at each slice level were used to reconstruct 32 images evenly spaced in time over one cycle of zzso zzso zzso ratios were calculated between signal zzso from tube zzso and surrounding stationary water zzso zzso from each zzso signal intensity increased during zzso and decreased during zzso zzso the changes in zzso we measured with a flow zzso However, within the 51% and zzso zzso and just beyond them, there were consistent decreases in zzso signal zzso zzso through the zzso zzso had little effect on the signal intensity zzso These results suggest that the zzso echo pulse sequence may be useful in evaluating disturbed flow associated with vascular zzso
