zzso bed rest results in a loss of leg lean body zzso Previous studies using bed rest as a model for zzso have shown decreases in leg mass after 12 and 14 zzso 5 and 17 zzso 

As magnetic resonance imaging zzso can provide a precise and zzso means of determining muscle volume, we sought to determine if changes in leg muscle volume could be detected in bed rest periods as short as 7 zzso 

Five young, healthy, male volunteers were subjected to 7 d of absolute bed zzso Each subject underwent zzso zzso of zzso muscle volumes of the calves and zzso before and after bed zzso Eleven zzso and nine zzso zzso zzso thick zzso images were generated over prescribed regions using a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso magnet and body zzso Image processing was performed using a generalized zzso medical image analysis package developed at University of Texas Medical zzso Images were analyzed for muscle and zzso volumes (including fat, blood vessel, and bone zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso demonstrated bed zzso significant decreases in zzso thigh muscle zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that computerized image analysis of zzso images provides a sensitive tool capable of detecting leg volume changes of as little as zzso over a zzso period of strict bed zzso
