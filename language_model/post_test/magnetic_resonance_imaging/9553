Late zzso visual areas generally consist of cells having a significant degree of translation zzso Such a zzso of zzso representation is useful for the recognition of individual objects; however, it seems unable to explain our ability to parse a scene into multiple objects and to understand their spatial zzso We review several schemes zzso global features and serial zzso for how to reconcile zzso representation with our ability to understand zzso we review structural description theories that, in contrast, suggest that a neural binding mechanism assigns the features of each object in a scene to a separate zzso to which zzso information for that object is explicitly zzso Four functional magnetic resonance zzso experiments assessed how zzso stream regions respond to zzso of two objects in a minimal scene that depict scene translations and zzso zzso Changes of relative position zzso elephant above bus changing to bus above zzso produced larger releases of adaptation in the anterior lateral zzso complex zzso than physically equivalent zzso providing evidence that spatial relations are explicitly zzso in the anterior zzso in agreement with structural description zzso
