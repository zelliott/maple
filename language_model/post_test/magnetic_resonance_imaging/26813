To identify zzso features of zzso vascular tumors of bone, which can be used to avoid erroneously diagnosing zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

From the databases of the zzso & Netherlands Committee on Bone zzso 63 patients with a zzso diagnosis of zzso vascular tumor of bone were zzso zzso and imaging characteristics were recorded on a case record zzso 

In 63 patients, 185 zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and/or CT (30 zzso and/or zzso (19 zzso zzso was observed in 25 patients zzso in these patients most zzso were located in the zzso Typically zzso were zzso zzso had a geographically pattern of destruction and were also located in the zzso Most zzso showed cortical destruction zzso zzso No zzso reaction was seen in most cases zzso zzso In 13 of 39 patients zzso tumor extension was more advanced and/or zzso zzso (29 zzso zzso were visible on zzso and zzso In 20 cases zzso zzso destruction was better shown on CT or zzso In six patients zzso zzso reaction was only seen on zzso or CT and not on zzso In 16 zzso cases soft tissue extension was only seen on zzso or CT, and not on zzso zzso zzso changes on zzso images were seen in 11 patients zzso 

When single, or regional zzso zzso zzso zzso with cortical destruction are seen, in the zzso and with marked zzso soft tissue changes on zzso a diagnosis of zzso vascular tumor should trigger the use of additional zzso to confirm the vascular nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of zzso zzso at zzso zzso signs are key in entertaining a diagnosis of zzso vascular tumor of bone which should trigger the use of appropriate zzso zzso
