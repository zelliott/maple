Upper airway zzso is important in the zzso of zzso sleep zzso zzso studies of patients with zzso sleep zzso demonstrate increased activity of upper airway zzso zzso zzso studies of these muscles show both adaptation and muscle zzso In this study we zzso quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to characterize changes in the upper airway zzso of patients with zzso sleep zzso This technique provides zzso of the zzso relaxation times of upper airway muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the mean zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differ between the zzso and control groups, while the values for the zzso muscles zzso zzso zzso are similar between zzso In both zzso and zzso respectively the zzso values for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly greater than for the zzso zzso The changes observed are compatible with the hypothesis that there is increased zzso and possibly increased fat content of the tongue muscles in patients with zzso sleep zzso
