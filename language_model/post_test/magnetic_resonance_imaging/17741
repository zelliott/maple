A recent large-scale clinical trial found that an initial invasive strategy does not improve cardiac outcomes beyond zzso medical therapy in patients with stable coronary artery zzso Novel methods to zzso zzso patients may refine therapeutic decisions to improve zzso 

In a cohort of zzso consecutive patients referred for evaluation of zzso zzso we determined the net zzso improvement of the risk of cardiac death or nonfatal zzso zzso zzso adverse cardiac zzso incremental to clinical risk models, using zzso low zzso moderate zzso to zzso and high zzso annual risk zzso In the whole zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a strong association with major adverse cardiac events zzso zzso zzso with low negative event rates of major adverse cardiac events and cardiac death zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso was maintained in patients with previous coronary artery disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Adding zzso zzso to the multivariable clinical risk model zzso for age and previous coronary artery disease) improved discrimination of major adverse cardiac events zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted hazard zzso zzso and reclassified zzso of patients at moderate zzso risk zzso to low zzso zzso to high zzso with corresponding changes in the observed event rates zzso and zzso for low and high risk zzso zzso zzso net zzso index was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Continuous net zzso improvement was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

Stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging effectively zzso patient risk beyond standard clinical zzso specifically in patients at moderate to high zzso clinical risk and in patients with previous coronary artery zzso
