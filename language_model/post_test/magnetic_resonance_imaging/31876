zzso zzso zzso continues to be a difficult therapeutic zzso Our study was conducted to determine whether improved survival and tumor control could be achieved with modern delivery of fast zzso radiation using three-dimensional treatment zzso Ten patients were zzso zzso criteria included zzso diagnosis of zzso age zzso years, and zzso zzso Patients underwent zzso and zzso PET zzso zzso as part of initial three-dimensional treatment zzso zzso targets were treated with zzso fields to a total dose of 18 zzso in 16 zzso over 4 zzso Median and zzso overall survival were 55 weeks and zzso zzso One patient remains alive at last follow-up 255 weeks after zzso Median zzso survival was 16 weeks, and all patients had tumor progression by 39 zzso Treatment was clinically well zzso but evidence of mild to moderate zzso and zzso sclerosis consistent with radiation injury was observed at autopsy in specimens taken from regions of zzso brain that received approximately 6-10 zzso Fast zzso radiation using modern imaging, treatment planning, and beam delivery was feasible to a total dose of 18 zzso but tumor control probability was poor in comparison to that predicted from a zzso model based on older zzso zzso zzso zzso for both tumor control and zzso continue to present a challenge to establishing a therapeutic window for fast zzso radiation in zzso even with modern zzso
