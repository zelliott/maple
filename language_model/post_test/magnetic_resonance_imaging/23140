Recent reports provide indirect evidence of zzso injury and zzso dysfunction after prolonged zzso However, existing data is conflicting and lacks direct zzso of functional zzso zzso by zzso zzso MR zzso zzso The present study sought to examine structural zzso damage and modification of zzso zzso zzso wall motion by zzso imaging directly after a zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum levels, zzso zzso and TD zzso zzso and zzso were performed before and after amateur marathon races in 28 healthy males aged 41 zzso 5 zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tagging to assess zzso injury and zzso motion zzso zzso indicated zzso of zzso filling zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso filling zzso zzso zzso filling zzso ratio and zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso filling zzso zzso All participants had a significant increase in zzso and/or zzso zzso However, we found no evidence of zzso zzso MR tagging demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rotation analysis, however, revealed an increase of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation zzso during zzso filling was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso after marathon zzso in a zzso analysis adjusted for heart rate, whereas peak zzso rate showed no relevant zzso Although marathon running leads to a transient increase of cardiac zzso no zzso zzso necrosis was observed as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Endurance exercise zzso an zzso zzso wringing motion of the zzso and increased zzso filling zzso The stress of marathon running seems to be better described as a burden of zzso zzso rather than cardiac zzso
