Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with zzso zzso zzso a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the zzso itself, rather than the zzso used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive zzso only high fraction dose zzso zzso zzso resulted in significant added cognitive zzso The present study zzso the zzso and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of zzso at a mean of 12 years after first zzso 

Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment zzso substitution test, concept shifting test, zzso zzso test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and zzso word zzso zzso scores in six cognitive zzso zzso executive zzso verbal memory, working memory, zzso zzso and information processing zzso were calculated to detect differences between patients who had zzso and patients who did not have zzso zzso zzso and global cortical zzso were rated on zzso zzso 

65 patients completed zzso follow-up at a mean of 12 years zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso patients had received zzso (three had fraction doses zzso zzso The patients who had zzso had more deficits that affected zzso functioning at the second zzso regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso zzso The patients who had zzso also did worse in measures of executive functioning zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso and information processing speed zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso between the two zzso Furthermore, zzso functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had zzso zzso In total, 17 zzso patients who had zzso developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 zzso test parameters compared with four zzso patients who were zzso zzso zzso zzso and global cortical zzso were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several zzso 

zzso survivors of zzso who did not have zzso had stable zzso and cognitive zzso By contrast, patients with zzso zzso who received zzso showed a progressive decline in zzso zzso even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe zzso zzso These cognitive deficits are associated with zzso zzso Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and zzso compromise that is associated with zzso should be considered when treatment is zzso
