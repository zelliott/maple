zzso analysis of zzso cartilage changes in zzso zzso is of great importance and still a challenge in knee zzso data zzso A major challenge is to establish a reliable correspondence across subjects within the same zzso zzso We develop a novel zzso hidden zzso model zzso to establish spatial correspondence of cartilage thinning across both time and subjects within the same zzso zzso and make statistical zzso on the detection of diseased regions in each zzso zzso A hidden zzso random field zzso is proposed to extract such zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso method are both considered in making statistical zzso The proposed model can effectively detect diseased regions and present a localized analysis of zzso cartilage thickness within each zzso zzso zzso studies and diseased region detection on zzso thickness maps extracted from full zzso zzso knee zzso Data for Pfizer zzso zzso are performed, which show that our proposed model zzso standard zzso zzso
