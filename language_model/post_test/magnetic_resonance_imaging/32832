zzso is useful for assessing the zzso dysfunction after primary zzso coronary intervention zzso It remains unknown whether index of zzso resistance zzso reflects the functional outcome in patients with anterior zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso obstruction zzso study was performed to evaluate the clinical value of the zzso for assessing zzso injury and predicting zzso functional recovery in patients with zzso undergoing primary zzso We enrolled 34 patients with first anterior zzso After successful primary zzso the mean zzso coronary artery pressure zzso coronary wedge pressure zzso mean zzso pressure zzso mean transit time zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The presence and extent of zzso were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance image zzso All patients underwent follow-up zzso after 6 zzso We divided the patients into two groups according to the existence of zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso The extent of zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso of zzso arteries zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso was significantly correlated with the zzso wall motion score index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso a higher zzso is associated with worse functional zzso zzso zzso wedge pressures and zzso as parameters for specific and quantitative assessment of coronary zzso dysfunction, are reliable on-site zzso of short-term zzso viability and Left zzso functional recovery in patients undergoing primary zzso for zzso
