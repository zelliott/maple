zzso function in the prefrontal zzso zzso is regarded as a primary mechanism of cognitive zzso However, despite a strong association between the prefrontal zzso and the zzso the role of the zzso in cognitive aging is less zzso In the current study, zzso functional zzso was used to distinguish the cognitive contributions of zzso and prefrontal function in elderly versus young zzso Twenty healthy subjects, 9 elderly zzso age zzso zzso and 11 young zzso age 22 zzso performed a concurrent implicit and explicit sequence learning task while undergoing functional MR zzso Both groups showed learning in both the implicit and explicit task zzso Relative to the young subjects, the elderly subjects showed decreased zzso in the left zzso during both implicit and explicit learning, decreased zzso in the right zzso during implicit learning, and increased zzso in the right zzso during explicit zzso Our results support the theory that changes in a network of brain regions, including the zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso are related to cognitive zzso Moreover, these changes are observed during an implicit task, and thus do not seem to be zzso by zzso
