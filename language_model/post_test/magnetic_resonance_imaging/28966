Although schizophrenic and control subjects differ on a variety of zzso measures, the specificity and sensitivity of any one measure for zzso between groups are zzso This study investigated the cumulative effect of zzso brain structure on zzso 

Hemisphere and third zzso volume and the zzso zzso location of three association zzso zzso landmarks were measured on high-resolution zzso scans in 37 male patients with schizophrenia and 33 male control subjects matched on age, zzso and parental socioeconomic zzso 

While there were few group differences on individual anatomical measures, the 10 variables reliably zzso between the two groups when used in concert in a zzso function analysis zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with zzso of the subjects correctly zzso Five of the measures zzso zzso cingulate, left inferior frontal zzso right zzso zzso and left and right halves of the third zzso correlated significantly with the zzso function zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first study to demonstrate that zzso can be distinguished from matched controls on the basis of brain anatomy zzso The risk of schizophrenia may depend on the total amount of neural zzso rather than on anomalies in a single structure or zzso
