In this study, mapping of zzso zzso and zzso of acutely isolated zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso T was zzso zzso of zzso were measured from a slice through the zzso zzso with a spin zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso mapping technique published zzso zzso mapping was performed by two-dimensional zzso zzso with variable acquisition zzso The measured signal zzso were fitted by zzso zzso and zzso fitting zzso The occurrence of zzso signal zzso is outlined zzso The quality of the curve fits was zzso by mapping the value zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso For zzso zzso the zzso fit showed the best performance, whereas the zzso and zzso fits showed regionally high values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso maps was found to be difficult, because a zzso signal component can be related to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso profile, zzso sample zzso magnetic field zzso and/or residual zzso H zzso zzso It seems likely that an interplay of these effects yielded the observed signal zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso caused by chemical shift was observed and addressed to fat zzso by means of zzso In the zzso zzso no zzso of the signal zzso was observed and the zzso and zzso fits showed the best performance with comparable values of zzso Our results suggest that zzso mapping provides the more robust method for the characterization of zzso tissue by means of zzso zzso However, mapping of zzso zzso as performed in this study, is time consuming and provides less zzso ratio per time than the mapping of zzso If zzso mapping is used, zzso monitoring of the fitting quality based on reduced zzso should be employed and great care should be taken when interpreting the zzso maps of the zzso
