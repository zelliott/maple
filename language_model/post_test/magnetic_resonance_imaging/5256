zzso tests have demonstrated minimal loss of zzso closure force with zzso So we tested the zzso hypotheses that age neither affects the maximum zzso area zzso nor the volume of the zzso zzso zzso hypotheses were also tested in the adjacent zzso zzso muscle, which served as a control for the effect of age on zzso muscle in these zzso 

zzso resonance images of 15 healthy younger zzso 21-25 zzso and 12 healthy older zzso women zzso zzso zzso were selected to avoid the zzso effect of zzso Models were created from tracing outlines of the zzso zzso muscle in the zzso plane, and zzso zzso in the zzso plane using zzso zzso zzso zzso Muscle volumes were calculated using zzso while zzso was measured using zzso at nine zzso The hypotheses were tested using repeated measures analysis of zzso with zzso being considered zzso 

The effect of age did not reach statistical significance for the decrease in zzso zzso muscle maximum zzso or the decrease in volume zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, age did significantly adversely decrease zzso zzso muscle maximum zzso and volume zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso local age-related changes were observed zzso in both zzso 

Unlike the adjacent zzso muscle, zzso zzso the zzso zzso muscle in healthy zzso does not show evidence of significant age-related zzso
