Previous studies reported that depressed subjects had more white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging scans than control subjects, but the subjects had cerebrovascular disease risk zzso This study used subjects with a history of zzso major depression and matched comparison subjects, screened to exclude cerebrovascular disease risk factors, to determine whether depressed subjects had more white matter zzso and other zzso 

A zzso zzso computer program was used to compare numbers and volumes of white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso in 24 women with a history of zzso major depression and 24 comparison subjects zzso on age and education and zzso on zzso In addition, images were measured with the use of a validated zzso zzso All subjects were screened to exclude cerebrovascular disease risk zzso 

There were no significant differences in the total volumes or total numbers of zzso However, multiple linear zzso showed a significant correlation of age and depression with number of zzso this was accounted for by a greater number of small zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease risk factors most likely zzso the relationship between depression and white matter zzso seen in previous zzso However, the independent effect of depression, as well as an zzso interaction, for small zzso suggests a zzso role of depression in certain types of white matter pathology irrespective of other cerebrovascular disease risk zzso The zzso method used in this study may be more sensitive than other methods in determining zzso characteristics and correlations with clinical zzso
