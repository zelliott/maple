The presence of the zzso E e4 zzso has been considered to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and vascular zzso We therefore used demanding zzso testing and brain zzso to determine if elderly zzso with at least one e4 zzso demonstrate zzso changes in zzso and a higher frequency of brain zzso or silent zzso brain zzso The study population consisted of 214 randomly selected individuals aged 50 to 75 years without zzso or general zzso There were 175 zzso subjects without and 39 zzso with at least one e4 zzso The two groups were comparable for age, length of education, verbal intelligence, mood and major vascular risk zzso zzso E e4 carriers performed significantly worse than zzso when assessed for learning and memory abilities, while there were no differences in test results of zzso attention, speed of mental processing and zzso zzso There were no zzso differences for zzso and zzso zzso white matter zzso grading and the zzso measured white matter zzso zzso The extent of zzso and zzso widening as well as zzso and zzso volumes were also similar between the comparative zzso We conclude that the zzso E e4 zzso is associated with subtle learning and memory deficits in normal elderly persons and may therefore be suggested a marker for accelerated cognitive zzso In this group of subjects it was not associated with brain zzso changes as demonstrated by zzso
