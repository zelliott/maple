zzso is defined as a zzso motor behavior used for speech production, which involves a highly specialized coordination of zzso and respiratory zzso zzso During speech, brief periods of vocal fold zzso for zzso are zzso by voiced and zzso zzso zzso stops and zzso zzso zzso It remains unknown whether zzso coordination of zzso for speech relies on separate neural systems from respiratory control or whether a common system controls both zzso To identify the central control system for human zzso we used zzso zzso to contrast brain activity during zzso with activity during prolonged exhalation in healthy zzso Both zzso analyses and region of interest comparisons were zzso zzso of syllables containing zzso stops and zzso was accompanied by activity in left zzso bilateral zzso and zzso motor zzso zzso exhalation similarly involved activity in left zzso and zzso areas but not zzso motor zzso zzso differences between zzso and exhalation were found primarily in the bilateral auditory zzso with zzso zzso The zzso analysis similarly indicated task differences in the auditory zzso with differences also detected in the zzso motor zzso and zzso nucleus of the zzso A second experiment confirmed that activity in the auditory zzso only occurred during zzso for speech and did not depend upon sound zzso Overall, a similar central neural system was identified for both speech zzso and voluntary exhalation that primarily differed in auditory zzso
