The zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to play a crucial role in memory zzso zzso findings from animal studies suggest partially zzso zzso pathways zzso in the zzso with a zzso stream including zzso and zzso lateral zzso zzso and an anterior stream including zzso and lateral zzso zzso These zzso may operate on spatial and zzso information, zzso In humans, such a functional zzso has been suggested between zzso and zzso zzso Data from zzso and nonhuman primates suggest a similar zzso between zzso and lateral zzso cortex, which are zzso connected to zzso and zzso cortex, but evidence for functional zzso within zzso zzso in humans is zzso We addressed this issue using high-resolution zzso with improved spatial zzso Volunteers zzso zzso zzso performed a working memory paradigm involving the retrieval of spatial zzso and zzso zzso information after zzso A clear zzso between zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was more involved in the retrieval of faces after zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso was more involved in the retrieval of scenes after zzso A cluster in zzso zzso showed a zzso for the retrieval of faces after zzso Our data thus provide direct evidence for a functional specialization within human zzso zzso and thereby strongly support zzso models that emphasize the importance of partially zzso parallel processing zzso
