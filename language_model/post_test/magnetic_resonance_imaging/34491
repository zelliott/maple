The purpose of the present study was to determine whether zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso an zzso marker for a nuclear protein abundant in actively zzso zzso cells, is useful as an aid in zzso idiopathic zzso inflammatory syndrome zzso from zzso zzso zzso Records of all patients with zzso and zzso were studied zzso zzso biopsy specimens from four patients with zzso and nine patients with zzso were zzso The diagnosis in each case was based on presenting signs and symptoms, zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or magnetic resonance zzso scans, zzso criteria, and follow-up data consistent with the zzso These findings were correlated with the percentage of zzso and zzso in the zzso as well as with the number of cells that demonstrated zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity was markedly increased in the higher grade zzso zzso group as compared to that in the low grade zzso zzso and idiopathic inflammatory zzso zzso cases showed a significantly increased zzso ratio compared to zzso zzso zzso activity in conjunction with the ratio of zzso may be a helpful zzso adjunct for zzso purely inflammatory zzso of the orbit from zzso zzso Further studies are necessary to compare zzso activity in fresh frozen tissue with that in zzso zzso
