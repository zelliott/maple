We present a model of zzso zzso operation when the size of the zzso approaches a quarter wave length resulting in significant phase shifts along the current conducting zzso In the model zzso are treated as generalized transmission zzso Line termination determines whether the zzso is of the low pass or high pass zzso The model correctly describes the dependence of resonant frequency on resonant mode number as well as the distribution of current along the length of the zzso
