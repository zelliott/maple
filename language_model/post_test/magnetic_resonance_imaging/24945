Motor training consisting of voluntary movements leads to performance improvements and results in characteristic zzso changes in the motor zzso It has been proposed that repetition of passively zzso movements could also lead to improvements in motor zzso In this study, we compared zzso gains, changes in functional zzso zzso zzso in the zzso primary motor zzso zzso and in motor zzso zzso measured with zzso magnetic stimulation zzso after a 30 zzso training period of either voluntarily zzso or passively zzso induced wrist movements, when alertness and zzso aspects of training were zzso During active training, subjects were instructed to perform voluntary wrist zzso movements of a specified duration (target window zzso zzso in an articulated zzso zzso training consisted of wrist zzso extension movements zzso by a zzso zzso of the same zzso and duration range as in the active zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters of motor zzso zzso were measured before and after each training zzso Motor performance, measured as the number of movements that hit the target window zzso was significantly better after active than after passive zzso Both active and passive movements performed during zzso zzso activated zzso Active training led to more prominent increases in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso recruitment zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than passive zzso zzso a short period of active motor training is more effective than passive motor training in zzso performance improvements and cortical zzso This result is consistent with the concept of a pivotal role for voluntary drive in motor learning and zzso
