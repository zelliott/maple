zzso and lack of motivation are core symptoms of major depressive disorder zzso zzso studies in zzso patients have shown reductions in zzso activity in terminal regions of the zzso zzso zzso system, such as the zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in both zzso incentive processing and the mechanism of action of zzso zzso However, not much is known about zzso effects on zzso incentive processing in humans, which might be related to the effects on zzso 

To investigate the short-term effects of zzso on zzso activity in the zzso zzso we investigated the effect of the combined zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging in a randomized, zzso zzso crossover zzso After taking zzso zzso zzso once a day) or zzso for 14 days, participants completed a monetary incentive delay task that activates the zzso zzso during reward zzso 

Our results zzso zzso zzso show enhanced zzso zzso responses after zzso administration compared with zzso Moreover, this increase in zzso zzso activity was positively correlated with zzso plasma zzso 

This is the first study to demonstrate that zzso augment neural activity in zzso zzso incentive processing circuits in healthy zzso These effects are likely caused by the increase in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may alleviate zzso by stimulating incentive zzso
