Blood oxygen zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a zzso tool to measure modifications in tissue oxygen zzso Lower zzso zzso due to increased tissue zzso induce a longer zzso relaxation time zzso thus a stronger zzso zzso We have studied the changes in the kidney zzso profiles of living donors and their recipients by zzso associated with transplantation and zzso 

Two zzso couples were selected for this preliminary zzso zzso was performed on the donor on the day prior to surgery, on day 4, and 1 month thereafter, and on the recipient on day 4 and 1 month zzso Mean zzso values were measured in specific target regions in the cortical and zzso regions of each kidney using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of tissue oxygen profiles were then compared considering the zzso between zzso values and tissue oxygen zzso 

The clinical courses zzso were zzso throughout the study; kidney function resumed zzso All zzso examinations showed a significantly higher zzso level in the zzso than in the zzso confirming the notion that the zzso is hypoxic compared to the zzso zzso and transplantation induced a significant rise in cortical zzso values in the remnant and transplanted kidney at day 4 and 1 zzso zzso zzso level only increased in the transplanted zzso 

zzso modifications in zzso zzso intervene following transplantation and zzso zzso may be a useful tool to explore these modifications and possibly identify pathological zzso
