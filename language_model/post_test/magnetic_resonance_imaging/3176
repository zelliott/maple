The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic capacities of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnostic evaluation of acute cervical spinal column zzso We examined 39 patients with cervical spine injury suspected either clinically or by plain zzso or even zzso In 30 patients, 86 acute traumatic zzso were observed in the area of the cervical spine, zzso of which were zzso zzso by CT and zzso on zzso zzso In nine patients, no acute traumatic zzso pattern could be found either by CT or by zzso or any other subsequently employed diagnostic zzso CT yielded zzso of the zzso acute traumatic findings, the degenerative zzso narrowing the spinal channel, and of the zzso but only zzso of the zzso of the zzso ligaments, 50% of zzso zzso zzso of zzso soft tissue zzso zzso of zzso disc zzso of zzso and none of the six zzso spinal zzso zzso Without exception, zzso revealed all the traumatic zzso and zzso soft tissue changes, zzso and zzso narrowing the spinal channel, but only 50% of the zzso fractures, zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Basing on these results, after primary plain film zzso imaging, the performance of zzso seems to be zzso prior to CT in diagnostic evaluation of traumatic cervical spinal zzso if possible with regard to the patient's clinical state and the global organization, unless immediate CT imaging of other body regions zzso of the zzso is already being planned anyway, Nevertheless, zzso should not be abandoned within the zzso framework of this disease zzso
