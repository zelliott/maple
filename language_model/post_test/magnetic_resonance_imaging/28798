We report our experience using MR zzso and CT zzso in pediatric patients with zzso zzso 

Fourteen patients zzso boys, 12 zzso mean age, zzso zzso with either a zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso or a surgical finding of zzso zzso underwent zzso MR zzso using zzso zzso fast zzso sequences with a zzso zzso and CT zzso with IV infusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were correlated with findings from surgery, operative zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso tree was zzso in all 14 patients with MR zzso and in 13 patients zzso with CT zzso In the 11 zzso cases of zzso cyst, MR zzso correctly showed all zzso and CT zzso showed 10 zzso zzso The quality of images on CT zzso and MR zzso was zzso The sensitivity of CT zzso and MR zzso in revealing zzso stones was zzso and zzso zzso the specificity for both techniques was zzso The rate of detecting the pancreatic duct and the common channel by CT zzso and MR zzso was zzso and zzso zzso After surgery, CT zzso was superior to MR zzso in revealing the location of zzso zzso and the extent of zzso zzso 

Because zzso MR zzso is not invasive and does not use zzso radiation and potentially toxic contrast agents, it is recommended as the imaging technique of choice in children with zzso zzso CT zzso can be considered as an adjunct after surgery and in patients in whom MR zzso is zzso
