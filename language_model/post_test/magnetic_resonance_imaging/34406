Our goal was to evaluate the visibility and zzso of traumatic abnormalities of the zzso zzso in patients with acute ankle zzso injuries and compare these findings with the extent of lateral ankle ligament injuries on zzso 

Sixty athletically active patients zzso zzso zzso with recent inversion trauma zzso or zzso 7 zzso underwent zzso Replacement of fat tissue in the zzso zzso was zzso zzso agreement was calculated zzso Injuries of the three lateral ligaments, evaluated by zzso were graded according to partial (1 zzso or complete (2 points) tears for each of three lateral ligaments zzso zzso points) and were compared with zzso zzso zzso 

In 26 patients zzso replacement of zzso zzso fat tissue was depicted by zzso zzso agreement for MR changes of the zzso zzso was good to moderate zzso zzso zzso Grade of lateral ankle ligament injury showed a statistically significant difference zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso groups zzso 

Acute ankle zzso injuries, evaluated by zzso are associated with acute abnormalities of the zzso zzso in zzso of patients and correlate with the extent of lateral ankle ligament zzso
