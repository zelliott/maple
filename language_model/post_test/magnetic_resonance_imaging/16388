zzso deletion syndrome zzso is associated with an increased zzso to develop zzso Despite a large body of literature documenting abnormal brain structure in zzso cerebral changes associated with brain maturation in zzso remained largely zzso To map cortical maturation from childhood to adulthood in zzso deletion syndrome, we used cerebral zzso from 59 patients with zzso aged 6 to 40, and 80 typically developing zzso three year follow-up assessments were also available for 32 patients and 31 matched zzso zzso cortical thickness zzso during childhood and adolescence were zzso in age zzso zzso were also conducted with the zzso zzso Within the group of patients with zzso exploratory measures of cortical thickness differences related to zzso zzso zzso and schizophrenia were also zzso We observed zzso zzso of cortical thickness changes with age in patients with zzso In affected zzso larger prefrontal thickness was observed compared to zzso zzso Afterward, we observed greater cortical loss in zzso with a convergence of cortical thickness values by the end of zzso No compelling evidence for an effect of zzso zzso on cortical maturation was zzso Within zzso significant differences in cortical thickness were related to cognitive level in children and zzso and to schizophrenia in zzso zzso zzso of cortical thickness from childhood to adulthood provide strong in zzso cues for a zzso in the programmed synaptic zzso which in turn may explain the zzso of patients with zzso to develop zzso
