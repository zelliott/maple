zzso cortical zzso of Taylor's zzso type zzso are a frequent cause of zzso zzso in young zzso In order to characterize zzso we coupled zzso and zzso and analyzed the clinical outcome following zzso zzso 

From an zzso data bank with zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso were re-evaluated of which high resolution zzso was zzso Five additional zzso were zzso identified by zzso zzso and zzso features were related to zzso zzso following zzso was analyzed as determined on routine examinations 3, 6 and 12 months following zzso 

All but one zzso were located outside the zzso zzso A markedly zzso zzso zzso zone tapering towards the lateral zzso was the characteristic finding on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zone of the zzso displayed zzso white matter with zzso oriented balloon cells and zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso All patients with complete zzso were seizure free one year following zzso 

zzso cortical zzso of Taylor's zzso type zzso have characteristic zzso and zzso zzso zzso recognition is important, since outcome following zzso surgery is zzso
