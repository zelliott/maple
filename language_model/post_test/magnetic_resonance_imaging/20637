Brain damage following a zzso zzso zzso insult has been documented by different diagnostic zzso The aim of the present study was to relate zzso time course during the first zzso of life to brain zzso changes detected by zzso MR zzso zzso at zzso of life and to evaluate their correlation with zzso 

zzso patients with any grade zzso zzso were zzso Thirty-one out of 32 patients survived and underwent zzso examination at zzso of life; zzso was recorded during the first zzso of life in zzso zzso 26 patients underwent both zzso zzso test, evaluation of motor skills, visual and hearing function were performed at regular intervals until the age of zzso 

zzso at 6, 12 and zzso of life showed a significant correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed significantly between patients with normal or poor zzso zzso time course during the first zzso of life showed improvement in newborns with normal zzso and good outcome and a deterioration in those with abnormal zzso and poor zzso 

zzso time course may be able to document the severity and the evolution of the cerebral damage following an zzso zzso zzso is related to the severity of cerebral injury as defined by zzso and both examinations showed a good correlation with zzso These data, obtained in zzso zzso may represent reference data for future investigations in cooled zzso
