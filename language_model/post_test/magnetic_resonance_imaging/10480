Since the zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso great effort has been put into increasing its spatial resolution and signal specificity from zzso to more zzso zzso The working assumption is that the zzso signals closely mirror changes at the zzso zzso While great progress has been made, the basic and most fundamental questions remain zzso where in the gray matter do these zzso zzso changes zzso Recently, the zzso correspondence of zzso zzso signals and zzso activity was zzso The data suggest, although not zzso that the local field potential zzso response gives a better estimate of changes that accompany increased zzso zzso zzso are thought to be generated by synaptic activity reflecting input signals into layer IV within a cortical zzso If so, the spatial distribution of the zzso signal should be specific to the corresponding cortical zzso Here, in a combined imaging and zzso study, the spatial characteristics of zzso signals across the zzso were zzso In a high-resolution zzso study zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso the spatial specificity of zzso signals was correlated with the underlying cortical zzso zzso obtained within the same animal and tissue zzso We demonstrate that when surface vessels are excluded high-resolution zzso signals peak at cortical layer zzso
