zzso is an auditory phenomenon zzso by the perception of a sound in the absence of an external auditory zzso zzso zzso zzso is almost certainly maintained via central mechanisms, and this is consistent with observed measures of altered spontaneous brain zzso A number of putative central auditory mechanisms for zzso have been zzso The influential zzso zzso model suggests that zzso can be attributed to the disruption of coherent zzso activity between zzso and zzso following hearing zzso However, the extent to which this disruption specifically contributes to zzso or is simply a consequence of the hearing loss is unclear because the necessary matched controls have not been zzso Here, we rigorously test several predictions made by this model in four groups of participants zzso with hearing loss, zzso with clinically normal hearing, no zzso with hearing loss and no zzso with clinically normal zzso zzso was used to measure zzso brain activity within different frequency bands in a zzso state and during presentation of a masking zzso zzso revealed that zzso activity in the delta band zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso with hearing zzso group compared to the zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso A planned comparison indicated that this effect was unlikely to be driven by the hearing loss alone, but could possibly be a consequence of zzso and hearing zzso A further zzso linkage to zzso was given by the result that the delta activity tended to reduce when zzso was zzso zzso activity in the gamma band zzso zzso was not correlated with zzso (or hearing zzso The findings partly support the zzso zzso model and suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity may be a more reliable correlate of zzso than zzso zzso
