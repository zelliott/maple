The authors present a novel zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, two-dimensional zzso fast imaging employing zzso acquisition zzso technique with parallel zzso It achieves zzso resolution at less than half a second as well as high spatial resolution zzso imaging free of motion artifacts for evaluating the dynamic motion of fetuses in zzso The information obtained is used to predict zzso zzso 

Twenty-five fetuses with anomalies were zzso zzso demonstrated severe abnormalities in five of the zzso the other 20 fetuses constituted a control zzso The zzso fetal MR imaging demonstrated fetal head, neck, zzso zzso and finger as well as swallowing zzso Imaging findings were evaluated and compared in fetuses with major central nervous system zzso anomalies in five cases and minor zzso zzso or no anomalies in 20 zzso zzso zzso was observed in the latter zzso For fetuses in the former group, those with abnormal zzso failed to survive after delivery, whereas those with normal zzso survived with functioning zzso The power deposition of zzso presented as specific zzso rate zzso was zzso The zzso of FIESTA was approximately 13 times lower than that of conventional MR imaging of fetuses obtained using zzso fast spin echo zzso 

The following conclusions are zzso 1) Fetal motion is no longer a limitation for prenatal imaging after the zzso of parallel imaging with zzso zzso 2) zzso MR imaging illustrates fetal motion in zzso with high clinical zzso 3) For cases involving major zzso anomalies, zzso MR imaging provides information on zzso zzso in fetuses and serves as a zzso indicator of zzso outcome, and 4) The zzso MR used to observe fetal activity is technically zzso and zzso zzso It provides zzso information for making proper and timely zzso and/or zzso management zzso
