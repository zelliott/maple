Free zzso play a major role in zzso By combining zzso zzso and molecular magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso levels of free zzso were detected within mice bearing zzso zzso zzso The zzso spin trap zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered prior to injection of an zzso probe zzso zzso zzso bound to a bovine serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso to trap zzso free zzso zzso detected the presence of zzso zzso by either a significant sustained increase zzso in MR signal intensity or a significant decrease zzso in zzso relaxation, measured as zzso zzso In zzso assessment of the zzso probe indicated a significant decrease zzso in zzso relaxation in zzso cells that were zzso stressed with hydrogen zzso compared to zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso probe was targeted with zzso zzso to locate the zzso probe in excised brain zzso As a negative control a zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso construct was zzso zzso zzso were also confirmed in tumor tissue from animals administered zzso compared to zzso brain zzso zzso zzso were found to have significantly increased zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to normal mouse brain zzso indicating increased oxidized lipids and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso probe with either zzso or zzso was also zzso This is the first report regarding the detection of in zzso levels of free zzso from a zzso zzso
