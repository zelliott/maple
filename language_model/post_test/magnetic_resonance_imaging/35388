Multiple sclerosis is an zzso disease predominantly affecting the white matter of the zzso zzso functional zzso partial or total zzso Since functional connectivity linking cerebral regions is reliably reflected by synchronization of their zzso zzso in this study an zzso zzso measured by zzso was used to zzso an zzso connectivity zzso index focused on the primary zzso cortical areas zzso zzso patients affected by mild zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso zzso zzso multiple sclerosis in the zzso phase without clinically evident sensory impairment were zzso Three zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso load, discriminating black hole and zzso hole portions, zzso by individual brain zzso When matched with a control population, multiple sclerosis patients showed a reduced zzso combined with the complete loss of the zzso functional specialization in zzso zzso of the dominant zzso No association was found between zzso impairment and disease zzso or zzso of the central sensory zzso time, presence of spinal zzso zzso and ongoing disease zzso zzso The zzso index slightly correlated with the zzso zzso A local index of zzso in a circumscribed brain primary area was altered in mildly disabled zzso sclerosis patients, also in absence of any impairment of central sensory zzso In conclusion, the diffuse damage influencing the zzso network zzso complex cerebral functions also affects intrinsic cortical zzso The zzso zzso index is proposed as a highly sensitive and zzso functional measure for the evaluation of zzso synchronization mechanisms in zzso zzso
