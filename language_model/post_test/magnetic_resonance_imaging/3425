The presence of zzso in brain regions undergoing repair is evident of the recruitment of bone zzso zzso zzso cells to the zzso unit during zzso At present, post zzso sampling is the only way to identify zzso zzso such cell typing is inadequate for preserving neural zzso cells for any meaningful stem cell zzso We aimed to target cerebral zzso in zzso using dual gene zzso zzso zzso in male zzso mice after a zzso bilateral carotid artery zzso zzso We attached zzso iron oxide zzso zzso to zzso zzso that targets zzso or zzso zzso Because zzso compromises the zzso barrier zzso and zzso expression of zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso by zzso in new vessels, we delivered zzso magnetic resonance contrast agents zzso or zzso at 4 zzso zzso by zzso injection to zzso mice that had experienced zzso We demonstrated that the surge in cerebral iron content by zzso coupled zzso zzso matched the increase in the frequency of zzso We also found that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso or transgenic mice zzso zzso expressing red fluorescent protein by zzso zzso We identified zzso in the repair patch in living brains after zzso with a zzso size of zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in vascular zzso in the region of zzso injury led us to draw the conclusion that zzso can zzso reveal neural zzso cells during zzso
