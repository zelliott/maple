zzso zzso zzso is difficult because of the complexity of the flow, geometry and motion of the zzso zzso In this paper a zzso compatible phantom was built incorporating a left zzso and zzso valve zzso zzso motion was obtained using a zzso zzso The zzso valve was made zzso and the zzso volume zzso using a modified control volume zzso The modification to the method was the addition of zzso motion zzso This was attained by moving the control volume in unison with the zzso valve and by correcting for this motion in the integration of zzso This correction was found to be simple, in that it represented the volume swept out by the moving control zzso The measured zzso volume was compared to a second MR measurement using a single slice technique, made possible by the zzso construction of the zzso left zzso zzso analysis between these two methods produced a zzso line of y zzso 0 + zzso zzso R zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso
