Data from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso consist of time series of brain images that are characterized by a low zzso zzso In order to reduce noise and to improve signal zzso the zzso data are zzso zzso However, the common application of a zzso filter does this at the cost of loss of information on spatial extent and shape of the zzso zzso We suggest to use the zzso procedures introduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approach for local likelihood zzso zzso zzso zzso Fields, in zzso zzso We show that this significantly improves the information on the spatial extent and shape of the zzso region with similar results for the noise zzso To complete the statistical analysis, signal detection is based on thresholds defined by random field zzso zzso of zzso and zzso smoothing are illustrated by artificial examples and an analysis of experimental zzso
