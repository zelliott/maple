Phantom limb sensation, whether painful or not, frequently occurs after peripheral nerve zzso It can be zzso by stimulating body parts adjacent to the zzso site zzso to as phantom zzso and it is often similar in quality to the stimulation at the remote zzso The present study induced referred phantom sensations in two upper limb zzso zzso source imaging zzso as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to assess reorganization in primary zzso zzso zzso Whereas recent studies found zzso of sensation related to stimulation mainly in regions adjacent and zzso to the zzso site, we report here the zzso of phantom sensation in the arm by stimulation in the lower body part both zzso and zzso to the zzso in two arm zzso The zzso evaluation of one patient showed no shift in the location of the foot whereas zzso revealed major reorganization of the mouth region in primary zzso zzso in both zzso These data suggest that cortical structures other than zzso might be contributing to the phenomenon of referred zzso zzso structures are the thalamus, secondary zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso
