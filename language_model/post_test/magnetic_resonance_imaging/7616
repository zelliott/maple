Von zzso zzso disease is a rare zzso zzso inherited zzso disorder characterized by development of benign and zzso zzso The abdominal manifestation of the syndrome are zzso zzso resonance plays an important role in identification of abdominal abnormalities and follow-up of zzso 

To describe magnetic resonance imaging findings and patterns of pancreatic and other principal abdominal manifestations in a series of von zzso zzso disease patients and to review zzso 

We zzso reviewed abdominal magnetic resonance studies performed in 23 patients (10 zzso 13 zzso diagnosed of zzso 

In all examined patients abdominal involvement was zzso The pancreatic imaging findings detected were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including diffuse zzso zzso zzso solid neuroendocrine tumors zzso zzso zzso neuroendocrine tumors zzso zzso The zzso findings detected were: simple zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso including benign zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 5 of these zzso were multiple and zzso Five patients zzso presented zzso (4 of these were zzso zzso and 1 patient zzso presented zzso of the zzso 

In zzso disease patients, magnetic resonance imaging plays an essential role in the identification of pancreatic and other abdominal zzso in their zzso in the screening of zzso gene carriers, and in their long-term zzso
