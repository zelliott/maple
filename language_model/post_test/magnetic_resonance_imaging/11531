In this study, we report on the effectiveness and usefulness of zzso gamma knife zzso zzso for large zzso and cavernous zzso zzso that have a high rate of surgical zzso 

We have treated 7 patients suffering from large zzso and cavernous zzso zzso using zzso zzso since March zzso The tumors were located in the zzso region in 4 patients, the cavernous zzso region in 2 patients, and in the zzso region in the remaining zzso Three of the patients had been surgically treated and 4 patients zzso were only followed with MR zzso The volume of the tumors ranged between zzso to 101 zzso zzso zzso zzso The treatment volume was between zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The treatment zzso between the first zzso and second zzso was 6 zzso The marginal doses for the tumors were 8 to 12 zzso zzso 9 zzso 

Six patients demonstrated tumor growth control during the follow-up period after the first zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso zzso was observed in 3 patients zzso Three patients zzso had improved clinically by the time of the follow-up zzso No patient suffered from symptomatic radiation zzso 

Although we have treated only 7 patients using zzso zzso we believe this treatment may be a very useful option for large zzso and cavernous zzso zzso in selected zzso
