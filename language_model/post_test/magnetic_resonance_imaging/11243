zzso repetition associates with neural activity reductions during tasks that elicit behavioral zzso Here we present direct evidence for a quantitative relation between neural activity reductions and behavioral zzso zzso subjects performed a word zzso task while being scanned with functional zzso zzso reductions were found in multiple high-level cortical regions including those within the prefrontal zzso zzso activity within several of these regions, including the prefrontal cortex, correlated with behavior such that greater activity reductions associated with faster zzso zzso zzso analyses confirmed the observation of zzso overlap between regions showing activity reductions and those showing direct zzso zzso The finding of a quantitative relation between neural and behavioral effects in frontal regions suggests that repetition reduces zzso zzso processing in a manner that ultimately zzso zzso
