This study was undertaken to zzso the zzso mechanism of a new purple potato variety that has been used for the prevention of zzso diseases as a folk remedy in zzso 

zzso zzso differentiation zzso Western zzso were performed in zzso zzso while blood chemistry for zzso zzso measurement of body weight and abdominal zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis, magnetic resonance image zzso scanning were carried out in high fat diet fed zzso rats with ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Valley zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells as well as reduced the cellular zzso zzso zzso also significantly attenuated the levels of insulin and zzso at zzso in high fat diet fed zzso In addition, zzso significantly reduced total fat and whole body zzso in a therapeutic experiment, which was confirmed by zzso scanning and also significantly inhibited the zzso and zzso fats in a preventive experiment compared with zzso Similarly, the levels of total cholesterol, zzso and low density zzso zzso were significantly reduced at a lower dose zzso of zzso in a preventive experiment than at zzso in a therapeutic zzso Furthermore, body weight gain was significantly suppressed by over 4 weeks treatment of zzso compared with zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso cells by zzso and the expression of zzso protein 3 zzso was activated in fats and liver zzso of zzso treated group compared with high fat diet zzso 

zzso has zzso potential via zzso of zzso metabolism through zzso zzso and zzso zzso
