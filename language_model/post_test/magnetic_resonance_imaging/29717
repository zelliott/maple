This study zzso magnetic resonance zzso safety of the stainless-steel clip inserted after zzso directional zzso biopsy zzso of the breast, and evaluates its imaging zzso 

We used a sausage as a substitute breast and inserted the clip into zzso The MR images of the substitute were scanned using a breast zzso and it was then zzso After the substitute zzso MR scanning of the breast was performed using a dynamic contrast enhanced technique, in which a clip was placed after zzso for suspicion of zzso zzso was seen as grouped zzso zzso on zzso 

On every magnetic resonance image of the substitute, the clip was seen as a spotty signal zzso with no surrounding zzso There was no movement and no evidence of increased clip temperature on dissected of the substitute, confirming the safety of breast MR with a clip in zzso There was no patient complaint of feeling heat or pain during the zzso examination and there were only biopsy scars on the surgically excised breast zzso zzso On the breast MR images, a spreading region of the tumor adjoining the position of the signal void was identified as an early enhancing zzso 

The safety and reliability of breast MR examination using a zzso clip was demonstrated by both the mock examination and the breast zzso It is possible to zzso of tumor spread regions based on the marker position using the clip as a negative signal zzso
