The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of zzso zzso lobe zzso with zzso sclerosis zzso on corpus zzso zzso zzso in large and zzso proven zzso zzso 

We measured certain zzso dimensions in 103 patients and 33 healthy controls using in zzso magnetic resonance zzso In particular, we compared the two groups in relation to the clinical zzso of the zzso duration of zzso frequency of zzso and length of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test, zzso zzso and zzso test were used for statistical zzso 

There was no significant difference between zzso zzso with respect to age and zzso among zzso The differences between the zzso however, were significant zzso longer diameters in zzso We found significant decrease in the dimensions of the zzso body, zzso and zzso of the zzso in the zzso group, but there was no reduction in the size of the zzso 

This general reduction in the size of the zzso except for the rostrum was thought to be the result of cortical zzso secondary to the zzso zzso the preserved zzso part of the zzso it was thought that the fibers of the frontal lobe pass through different pathways than the tracts in the zzso
