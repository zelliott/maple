zzso have a greater reliance on zzso zzso for energy production than normal zzso We developed a zzso method for imaging zzso zzso in zzso that is based on magnetic resonance imaging and allows the zzso of zzso zzso to be measured through the chemical exchange of zzso between zzso groups and zzso This method differs from existing molecular imaging methods because it permits detection of the delivery and zzso of a metabolically active compound in zzso zzso We show that our technique, named zzso chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso is sensitive to tumor zzso zzso in zzso tumor models and can distinguish tumor types with differing zzso characteristics and zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso has potential as a useful and cost-effective method for characterizing disease and assessing response to therapy in the zzso
