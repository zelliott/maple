Management of symptomatic zzso is vitally influenced by zzso zzso tract and zzso The objectives of this prospective pilot study were to evaluate the diagnostic value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso compared to diagnostic zzso retrograde zzso zzso and to establish an efficient zzso for zzso and treatment of zzso 

All consecutive patients with zzso and zzso zzso tract proven by zzso as well as elevated liver function tests were enrolled within 12 zzso Patients without evidence of zzso duct zzso underwent zzso zzso whereas patients with zzso immediate zzso 

58 patients (30 male, 28 zzso with a median age of zzso years underwent zzso zzso In 18 patients (10 male, 8 zzso median age zzso zzso with evidence of zzso we subsequently performed zzso and zzso zzso duct stones were detected and removed after zzso in 10 patients, whereas zzso could not be found anymore in 8 zzso The remaining 40 patients without zzso evident on zzso were transferred to magnetic resonance zzso and zzso in case of suspected zzso or to zzso and zzso zzso zzso which could definitely exclude zzso In comparison to zzso respectively zzso zzso was able to detect zzso duct stones with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

zzso zzso seems to replace diagnostic zzso concerning the presence of zzso in case of zzso and zzso zzso tract with a high zzso The zzso zzso with stone extraction is still the therapy of choice in case of zzso confirmed zzso
