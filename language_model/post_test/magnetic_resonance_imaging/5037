We zzso evaluated 12 patients with zzso verified central zzso zzso to identify the zzso characteristics associated with this zzso All zzso had zzso signal intensity in their solid components and seven had a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were identified at the zzso periphery zzso with the lateral zzso zzso These zzso were formed by walls of multiple zzso of medium zzso zzso of the lateral zzso wall attached to the zzso capsule was seen in nine zzso These zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso zzso In a diagnostic experiment to test the differential diagnosis of zzso from other zzso near the zzso of zzso the identification of zzso made a greater contribution to the specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis than the soap bubble zzso Thus, recognition of multiple zzso zzso between the solid part of the zzso and the lateral zzso wall on zzso may contribute to a correct zzso diagnosis of zzso
