To study the reliability and construct zzso of ultrasound in zzso finger zzso affected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso as the reference zzso 

252 zzso were examined by zzso conventional zzso and clinical zzso zzso was performed using a zzso linear zzso (12 zzso 18 zzso On the same day, magnetic resonance images of 112 zzso were obtained on a zzso T magnetic resonance zzso The ultrasound and zzso images were zzso independently by other readers unaware of the diagnosis, clinical and other imaging zzso zzso reliability was calculated by the percentage of exact agreement obtained and zzso zzso With zzso as the reference method, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in detecting structural zzso zzso and zzso and soft tissue zzso and zzso zzso changes in zzso were zzso 

zzso and zzso were found to be more sensitive in detecting zzso than conventional zzso in zzso A high agreement between ultrasound and zzso in the assessment of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso A high percentage of inflammatory changes was found in zzso and in smaller amount in zzso both confirmed by zzso Good zzso reliability of ultrasound was obtained for all variables (all median zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound proved to be a reliable and valid imaging technique to assess zzso and soft tissue changes, compared with zzso as a reference method in zzso
