Extension of a zzso zzso into the spinal canal is rare, but many isolated cases have been reported in the zzso Three existing patients with multiple zzso zzso at our institution had development of zzso findings and were found to have zzso in the spinal zzso These findings led us to perform magnetic resonance imaging or zzso zzso scans for the remaining patients with multiple zzso zzso at our zzso 

zzso patients at our institution (including zzso male patients and zzso female zzso had multiple zzso zzso zzso patients were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and one was evaluated with zzso zzso to look for spinal column zzso 

Thirty zzso of the zzso patients had zzso arising from the spinal column, and twelve zzso had zzso encroaching into the spinal zzso zzso of the zzso patients also had plain zzso but only six had zzso that accurately identified the zzso and another six had zzso that zzso identified zzso that were not confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging or zzso zzso Patients with zzso inside the spinal canal were typically zzso and zzso normal, with zzso that did not demonstrate the zzso Compared with female patients, male patients were more likely to have spinal zzso and more likely to have zzso encroaching into the spinal canal zzso zzso zzso 

The risk that a patient with multiple zzso zzso has a zzso within the spinal canal is much higher than previously suspected zzso Because the potential exists for serious zzso injury to occur, we have begun to use magnetic resonance imaging to screen all patients who have multiple zzso zzso at least once during the growing zzso
