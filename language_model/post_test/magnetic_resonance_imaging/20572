Major depressive disorder is associated with zzso zzso cortisol levels and small zzso zzso zzso However, it is still debated whether these phenomena are a consequence of the illness or whether they may represent a vulnerability marker existing before the illness zzso Here, we aimed to examine this notion of vulnerability by assessing whether abnormalities in zzso cortisol zzso and HC volumes are already present in a sample of healthy young adults who showed varying levels of depressive zzso but at zzso zzso 

We recruited healthy young men and women from the local zzso On the basis of depression scores derived from standard zzso three groups were zzso a control group zzso zzso zzso a zzso group zzso zzso 23), and a high-risk zzso group zzso zzso zzso The participants underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan and collected saliva samples for the assessment of zzso cortisol zzso 

Both the zzso and the high-risk zzso group failed to show a significant increase in cortisol levels after zzso The high-risk zzso group also showed a lower zzso increase of cortisol levels after awakening compared with control zzso In addition, this group also had smaller total HC volume compared with control zzso 

The findings from this zzso sample suggest that zzso cortisol awakening response and small HC volume may constitute vulnerability factors for major depressive zzso Further investigations are needed to discern the mechanisms that may zzso these zzso
