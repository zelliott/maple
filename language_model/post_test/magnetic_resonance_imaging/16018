zzso zzso reportedly produce a stronger functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso signal in those parts of the zzso cortical maps where they are oriented zzso to the point of zzso We sought to extend this finding by examining zzso in the response of cortical areas zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso was used to measure the zzso signal in the visual zzso of six human zzso zzso were composed of strips of spatial white noise texture presented in an zzso zzso The texture in alternate strips moved in opposite directions zzso or zzso The strips themselves were zzso and zzso 45 degrees left or right from zzso zzso with maps of the visual field obtained from zzso zzso analysis revealed systematic patterns of zzso zzso For motion, a stronger response to horizontal was evident within zzso and along the borders between V2 and zzso For orientation, the response to zzso zzso contours was greater in left zzso and right zzso zzso zzso bias for the orientation of zzso contours analogous to that reported previously for zzso zzso could reflect zzso processing or the operation of distinct mechanisms subject to similar zzso in orientation zzso zzso bias for motion might be related to the phenomenon of zzso zzso zzso zzso integration by the visual system introduces oriented blur along the axis of zzso We speculate that the observed forms of zzso bias reflect a common underlying zzso in the representation of zzso image structure across the visual zzso
