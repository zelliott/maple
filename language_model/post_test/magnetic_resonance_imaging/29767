To use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso to determine the relationship between zzso cartilage zzso and zzso bone changes of the zzso zzso and zzso in human knees with zzso zzso 

zzso were divided into three groups: without zzso zzso mild zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso images of the knee zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso were obtained at zzso and used for calculating the volume and thickness of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso were used for calculating the zzso bone structure zzso apparent bone volume zzso zzso number, zzso separation and zzso zzso 

zzso volume and thickness were less in patients with zzso compared to normal controls zzso zzso cartilage thinning is associated with bone structure loss in the opposite zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso there were extensive correlations between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cartilage zzso and loss of bone structure in the lateral zzso and lateral zzso Additional correlations existed between the zzso differences zzso minus zzso of cartilage thickness and bone zzso 

zzso of zzso cartilage within a compartment zzso with a loss of bone structure in the opposite zzso The correlation between the zzso differences corroborates this zzso zzso of the knee due to cartilage zzso is associated with bone formation in the diseased zzso and bone zzso in the opposite zzso
