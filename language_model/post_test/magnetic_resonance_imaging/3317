zzso zzso has been identified as marker for the development of Alzheimer's zzso zzso To what extent vascular risk factors and white matter zzso zzso affect zzso volume zzso in zzso elderly subjects and thus may impact such a zzso capacity is zzso 

We zzso zzso participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso with a Mini Mental State zzso score zzso who were free of zzso disease and had undergone zzso including zzso zzso sequences allowing for zzso assessment of zzso Global brain volume zzso was measured using zzso zzso were rated according to the zzso scale and segmented to obtain zzso zzso 

Higher age was associated with lower absolute and zzso zzso a lower zzso and higher zzso zzso None of the vascular risk factors had an impact on zzso except for zzso zzso This effect disappeared after zzso of zzso zzso severity and volume did not affect zzso zzso 

Our data indicate zzso loss in parallel with the whole brain and suggest no specific vulnerability towards vascular risk factors or age-related zzso in a cognitively intact normal elderly zzso This also supports the utility of zzso zzso to identify impending zzso
