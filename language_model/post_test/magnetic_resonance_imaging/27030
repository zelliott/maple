zzso can be considered an auditory phantom zzso in which patients hear an internal sound in the absence of any external sound source, mimicking tonal zzso zzso however can be perceived exclusively zzso or zzso 

The zzso differences were investigated between unilateral and bilateral zzso using zzso source localized resting state zzso zzso 

The difference between unilateral and bilateral zzso is reflected by high frequency activity zzso and zzso in the superior prefrontal zzso right zzso right angular zzso and right auditory zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso in the superior prefrontal zzso in comparison to bilateral zzso but gamma in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso has delta activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso in comparison to unilateral zzso and bilateral zzso in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso is also characterized by bilateral zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and bilateral zzso can be differentiated based on their resting state zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in the superior zzso cortex, zzso area and angular zzso seem to form the core of a spatial zzso network involved in zzso 

These differences should be taken into account when evaluating functional zzso data relating to zzso
