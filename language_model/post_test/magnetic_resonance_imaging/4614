An zzso time course of 512 zzso images zzso in resting human brain obtained every 250 zzso reveals fluctuations in signal intensity in each zzso that have a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional zzso methodology zzso Time courses of low frequency zzso zzso zzso fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor zzso It is concluded that correlation of low frequency zzso which may arise from fluctuations in blood zzso or flow, is a manifestation of functional connectivity of the zzso
