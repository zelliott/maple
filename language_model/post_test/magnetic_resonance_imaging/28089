To characterize the zzso of schizophrenia and to identify zzso markers in zzso patients with no or little prior treatment zzso 

Prospective study of an inception zzso 

Psychiatric division of an academic medical center with a suburban metropolitan zzso zzso 

70 patients in their first episode of schizophrenia zzso or zzso disorder zzso with no zzso or limited prior zzso exposure zzso and 50 healthy volunteer control zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical evaluations of natural history and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulation tests as measures of central nervous system zzso zzso brain magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso features previously identified in zzso and primarily chronically ill patients are also present in zzso during their first zzso These include zzso response to zzso zzso abnormal growth hormone zzso zzso zzso abnormal brain zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction zzso An association of zzso variables with increased symptom severity and earlier age of onset was observed but not statistically zzso The strongest associations among zzso variables were for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso response to zzso which may reflect increased zzso zzso neural zzso decreased zzso response to zzso and zzso enlargement, which may represent a zzso correlate of anterior zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso lobe and third zzso were associated with normal eye zzso suggesting that these zzso features are zzso by distinct zzso 

These phenomena appear to be a consequence of the disease rather than the effects of zzso drug treatment, or zzso It remains to be determined if these zzso phenomena will remain stable over time or change with disease zzso A companion article examines the clinical significance of these zzso
