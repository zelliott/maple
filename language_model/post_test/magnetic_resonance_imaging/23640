Neurological involvement in zzso zzso type II zzso zzso is indicative of more severe disease, but is not attenuated by current zzso replacement therapy which does not significantly penetrate the zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso is an objective method of determining brain zzso and has the potential to identify disease zzso with utility in evaluating current and novel zzso MRS studies from seven patients with zzso all receiving zzso replacement therapy were compared with a large cohort of children with various zzso disorders with normal MR zzso All studies were completed on zzso clinical MR zzso Brain zzso zzso were determined from zzso zzso and zzso white matter using zzso zzso zzso trends in brain zzso were zzso zzso of mean zzso and quantitative zzso zzso demonstrated significantly decreased white matter zzso (a zzso zzso total zzso and zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of serial zzso of white matter zzso demonstrated no change in two patients with stable MR imaging features but decreasing zzso in two patients more severely affected or zzso These data demonstrate the utility of MRS to monitor serial zzso in brain zzso including zzso which could be used as zzso of progressive neurological disease in zzso Integrated as an adjunct to zzso such an approach could aid the evaluation of the efficacy of current zzso and also novel zzso therapies in zzso
