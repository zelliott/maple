zzso in the zzso arch is characterized primarily by the presence of a strong secondary flow superimposed over the zzso flow, skewed zzso zzso profiles and zzso flow zzso A significant amount of zzso flow has also been observed in the descending zzso of humans and in zzso In this study a zzso model of the abdominal zzso complete with two sets of zzso arteries was adapted for three-dimensional steady flow zzso The flow through the model was predicted using the zzso equations to study the effect that a zzso component of flow has on the general flow dynamics in this vascular zzso The zzso zzso profile introduced at the inlet was developed from magnetic resonance zzso zzso taken from a plane zzso to the zzso zzso zzso showed that flow division ratios increased in the first set of branches and decreased in the second set with the addition of zzso zzso zzso stress varied in magnitude with the addition of zzso flow, but the zzso stress distribution did not zzso No regions of flow separation were observed in the zzso arteries for either zzso zzso flow may have a stabilizing effect on the flow patterns in branches in general, as evidenced by the decreased difference in zzso stress between the inner and outer walls in the zzso zzso
