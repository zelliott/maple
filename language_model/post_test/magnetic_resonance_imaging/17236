To evaluate the diagnostic capability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso assessment of musculoskeletal masses, in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging and plain zzso zzso 

zzso patients with musculoskeletal masses underwent plain zzso zzso and zzso zzso The following five items were evaluated for all zzso zzso properties, zzso zzso involvement, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso images with three-dimensional reconstruction were zzso compared with zzso 

In 32 bone zzso zzso was zzso to zzso regarding zzso properties in zzso zzso in zzso zzso involvement in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso involvement in zzso cases, zzso In 36 zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso with zzso properties in zzso zzso in zzso zzso involvement in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso involvement in zzso cases, zzso The zzso evaluation of both zzso and zzso involvement in bone zzso was superior to that in zzso zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between benign and zzso zzso in the evaluation of each of the five zzso 

zzso provided additional and more comprehensive information than zzso for the zzso assessment of musculoskeletal masses, especially for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images can be adopted equally to zzso for the zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
