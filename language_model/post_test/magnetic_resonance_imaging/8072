We report on a woman with zzso of belly dancer's syndrome 5 months after central zzso and zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso This case demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be the underlying zzso zzso for the rarely observed belly dancer's zzso The sequential appearance of zzso symptoms might reflect an ongoing but ineffective or deficient zzso zzso The presence of zzso should be considered in patients with zzso zzso of the abdominal zzso
