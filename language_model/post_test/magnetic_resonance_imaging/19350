Through cardiac looping during embryonic development, paths of flow through the mature heart have direction changes and zzso whose zzso and functional significance remain relatively zzso Here we show, using magnetic resonance zzso zzso the zzso zzso of streaming blood in zzso and zzso cavities of the adult human heart, with zzso zzso zzso paths of flow through the zzso On the basis of mapped flow fields and drawings that illustrate spatial relations between flow zzso we propose that zzso and zzso of the zzso heart have potential zzso and dynamic zzso zzso of zzso filling seem to be zzso in a manner that allows the momentum of zzso zzso to be redirected towards zzso valves, and the change in direction at zzso level is such that zzso away from ejected blood is in a direction that can enhance rather than inhibit zzso zzso zzso asymmetry might help to minimize zzso interaction between entering, zzso and zzso zzso These factors might combine to allow a zzso zzso zzso mode of action to come into effect when heart rate and output increase during zzso
