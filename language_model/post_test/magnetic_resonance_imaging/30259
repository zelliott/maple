We used zzso zzso zzso to assess the pattern of regional gray matter zzso loss in patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis zzso and its relation with the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score, disease zzso and the extent of zzso zzso load zzso 

From 28 patients with pediatric zzso zzso (16 zzso mean age zzso zzso years, range zzso 7 to 16 zzso and 21 matched controls, zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso prepared rapid acquisition zzso echo sequences were zzso zzso zzso was measured using a local zzso zzso zzso Data were analyzed using an zzso zzso analysis and statistical zzso zzso 

In pediatric patients with zzso mean brain zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume did not differ between patients and zzso Compared to controls, patients with pediatric zzso had significant zzso loss in the thalamus, zzso which was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the right thalamus, r zzso zzso for the left thalamus, p zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso No correlation was found between zzso zzso loss, disease zzso and zzso 

In patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis zzso differently from what happens in zzso zzso gray matter zzso zzso seems to involve the zzso only, with sparing of the zzso and other deep zzso zzso The correlation found between zzso and zzso zzso load suggests zzso and zzso zzso as the most likely zzso of tissue loss in the zzso of these zzso
