The invention and initial demonstration of magnetic resonance force zzso zzso in the early 1990s launched a renaissance of mechanical approaches to detecting magnetic zzso This article reviews progress made in zzso in the last decade, including the demonstration of scanned probe detection of magnetic resonance zzso spin zzso zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic zzso and the mechanical detection of electron spin resonance from a single zzso Force and zzso approaches to mechanical detection are reviewed and recent related work using zzso sensitivity cantilevers to probe minute fluctuating electric fields near surfaces is zzso Given recent progress, pushing zzso to single zzso sensitivity remains an exciting zzso We will survey some practical and fundamental issues that must be resolved to meet this zzso
