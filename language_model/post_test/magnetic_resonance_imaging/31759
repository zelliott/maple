We analyzed the behavior of zzso and zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso in 3 patients who had zzso zzso and underwent modified zzso zzso 

We compared zzso and zzso measured with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso were measured both in the immediate zzso period and some months zzso 

At the immediate zzso examination, zzso were preserved in all 3 patients with both zzso and BC zzso The zzso showed stable or improved parameters in 2 of our patients and were absent in the third zzso At the follow-up examination, zzso did not show any significant change with respect to the previous zzso In contrast, zzso were absent in 2 of our patients with zzso stimulation and in 1 patient with BC zzso 

Our results seem to indicate a greater stability and zzso of zzso compared with zzso In 1 patient, who had a zzso of the inferior zzso zzso the preservation of zzso and the absence of zzso in the immediate zzso period confirm that the zzso represents the origin of zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that not only the zzso but also the zzso could be implicated in the origin of zzso
