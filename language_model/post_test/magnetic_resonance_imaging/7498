The purpose of this study was to evaluate magnetic resonance zzso temperature imaging of the zzso zzso zzso comparing the zzso resonance frequency zzso and T 1 zzso zzso zzso was applied to a zzso zzso gel zzso zzso rise up to 70 zzso was measured using a zzso fiber-optic zzso MR imaging was performed by a zzso scanner utilizing fast zzso echo sequences including a segmented echo zzso imaging zzso sequence for zzso and the following sequences for T 1 method: fast zzso shot zzso inversion recovery zzso flash zzso zzso recovery zzso flash zzso and true fast imaging zzso zzso change of the zzso values in circular regions of interest, selected on images under the temperature probe tip, was zzso For each zzso a zzso constant could be determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were evaluated in further zzso experiments in phantom comparing the calculated temperatures with the fiber zzso zzso temperature zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, performing the zzso analysis, temperature accuracy was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso sequence was found to be more convenient for MR temperature imaging of zzso due to its relatively high precision and zzso Among the T 1 method zzso zzso showed the highest accuracy and zzso
