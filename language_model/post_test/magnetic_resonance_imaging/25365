The aims of this study were to evaluate the role of spinal ultrasound in detecting zzso spinal zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and to determine the degree of agreement between ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive infants had spinal ultrasound over 31 zzso Of these, 15 patients (age 1 zzso months, mean 40 zzso nine zzso had follow-up zzso zzso and zzso findings were correlated zzso 

Six out of 15 zzso ultrasound examinations showed full agreement with zzso seven of 15 zzso had partial agreement, and two of 15 zzso had no zzso In the present series ultrasound failed to zzso four of four zzso zzso zzso three of four fatty zzso zzso one of one terminal zzso two of four partial zzso zzso three of four zzso and one of 10 zzso zzso 

zzso between ultrasound and zzso was good, particularly for the detection of zzso zzso zzso Therefore we recommend ultrasound as a zzso screening test for zzso If ultrasound is zzso zzso or technically zzso zzso is advised for full zzso
