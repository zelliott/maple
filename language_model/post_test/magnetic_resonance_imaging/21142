We employed a zzso zzso methodology known as zzso cloud zzso to extract functional connectivity patterns derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The method was applied to correlation zzso of 106 regions of interest zzso in 29 individuals with zzso spectrum disorders zzso and 29 individuals with typical development zzso while they completed a cognitive control zzso zzso zzso geometry was examined at both zzso and zzso zzso At the coarse scale, the connectivity zzso geometry produced 10 valid clusters with a coherent relationship to neural zzso A supervised learning zzso employed fine scale information about zzso motif zzso and zzso and coarse scale information about zzso and zzso zzso the zzso correctly classified zzso and TD participants with sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso Most of the zzso power of the zzso zzso model resided at the level of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that cellular versus systems level disturbances are more prominent in individuals with zzso This article provides validation for this zzso geometric approach to zzso brain functional connectivity pattern information and for its use in zzso of zzso
