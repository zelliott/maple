The diagnostic accuracy of zzso guided zzso zzso was assessed in a group of 47 patients with suspected pancreatic zzso A correct diagnosis with the aid of biopsy was obtained in 44 of the 47 patients zzso In 3 patients with a zzso of the zzso the correct diagnosis was not obtained with the first zzso In 2 of these 3 patients, a simultaneous biopsy of a liver zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso No major complications zzso zzso biopsy of the zzso is considered a useful, reliable and zzso method for the diagnosis of pancreatic zzso Twenty-five patients with known neuroendocrine zzso disease were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso needles to evaluate the respective diagnostic accuracy of the 2 needle zzso The influence of zzso zzso on the zzso diagnosis was also zzso The overall diagnostic accuracy with the zzso zzso needle was zzso as compared to zzso with the zzso zzso zzso This difference, however, seems more related to needle guiding difficulties with the zzso zzso needle than to insufficient tissue zzso The increased amount of zzso tissue due to zzso treatment did not seem to zzso influence the diagnostic zzso In order to assess the diagnostic accuracy rate for zzso with different experience of biopsy procedures 175 cases of zzso zzso zzso were zzso No statistical significant difference was found between the different zzso zzso with detailed instruction even operators with limited experience produced biopsy results equal to those of operators with extensive practice in zzso zzso The automated sampling performance of the zzso with a consistent high diagnostic sampling rate zzso was believed to be responsible for these zzso The role of duplex zzso ultrasound in monitoring zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso was zzso The patients were divided into 4 groups: zzso zzso zzso 10), progressive disease zzso zzso 17), stable disease zzso zzso zzso and objective response zzso zzso zzso No significant differences in zzso values were found between the groups, and at present duplex zzso ultrasound does not seem to play a role in the evaluation of zzso therapy in zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
