zzso of the zzso location of the deep brain stimulation zzso zzso in the brain is essential in quality control and judicious selection of stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is commonly used to document the zzso location zzso The accuracy of this method, however, depends on many factors, including the quality of the source images, the area of signal artifact created by the zzso lead, and the fusion zzso 

To calculate the accuracy of determining the location of active contacts of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso CT image to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with a surrogate marker zzso zzso was digitally zzso with zzso CT with zzso zzso in 8 consecutive zzso The location of the active contact of the zzso zzso was calculated in the zzso frame space, and the zzso between the 2 images was zzso 

The zzso zzso significantly reduces the signal void on the zzso to a mean diameter of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the CT and zzso zzso in assessing the active contact location of the zzso lead is zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso zzso Minneapolis, zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is an acceptable method of identifying the zzso location of zzso zzso and active zzso
