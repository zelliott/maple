zzso which patients are at risk for the development of diabetic zzso is expected to greatly improve existing prevention and treatment zzso In this study, using an animal model of diabetic zzso the hypothesis was tested that magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a zzso inhalation challenge provides important diagnostic information regarding the risk of developing diabetic zzso 

zzso was used to measure zzso the change in oxygen tension along the entire inner zzso zzso from superior zzso zzso to inferior zzso zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhalation challenge zzso zzso Two animal groups were examined by this zzso method at two time zzso zzso rats fed either normal rat zzso zzso zzso zzso or a 50% zzso diet zzso zzso zzso for zzso months zzso before the appearance of extensive retinal zzso or zzso rats fed either normal rat zzso zzso zzso 3) for 15 months or a zzso zzso diet zzso zzso 4) for 15 to 18 months zzso when zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso 

After zzso months of zzso before the appearance of extensive retinal zzso zzso a significant zzso zzso zzso reduction in the zzso zzso response was observed in the zzso group compared with its zzso zzso These zzso animals also displayed a significantly zzso zzso zzso larger zzso response in the inferior zzso than in the superior zzso After 15 to 18 months of zzso during the period when zzso are present, the zzso zzso response remained significantly zzso zzso zzso lower in the zzso animals than in their zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso results, the zzso response in zzso animals at 15 to 18 months was significantly zzso zzso zzso larger in the superior than in the inferior zzso zzso zzso responses were not different in normal controls at either zzso 

zzso measurement of the retinal zzso response to a zzso challenge appears to be a powerful new and zzso approach that may be useful for assessing aspects of zzso underlying the development of diabetic zzso in zzso zzso These results support our working hypothesis and suggest that further research into the diagnostic potential of this zzso approach for predicting the development of diabetic zzso is zzso
