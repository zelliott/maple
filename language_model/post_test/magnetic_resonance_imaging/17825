To investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso by delivering a zzso boost to the residual tumor during the last 6 zzso of zzso 

Twenty-five patients with zzso or zzso zzso cancer were zzso zzso chemotherapy consisted of zzso 100 zzso on days zzso 0, and zzso and zzso 200 zzso from day zzso to the end of radiation therapy zzso 0 is the start of radiation zzso zzso therapy consisted of zzso zzso in 18 zzso zzso zzso per zzso with zzso to the tumor and regional zzso zzso zzso target volume, zzso defined on simulation CT and zzso After 9 zzso simulation CT and zzso were repeated for the planning of the zzso zzso zzso was generated by adding a zzso margin to the residual zzso In the last 6 zzso a boost of zzso zzso per fraction (in total zzso zzso in 18 zzso was delivered to zzso while zzso delivering zzso zzso per fraction to zzso outside zzso 

Three patients experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal zzso 2 of 3 showed toxicity before the zzso zzso Full dose of radiation therapy, zzso and zzso was delivered in zzso zzso and zzso of patients, zzso Two patients with clinical complete response zzso refused surgery and were still zzso at 17 and 29 zzso For the remaining 23 zzso patients, 15 of 23 zzso showed tumor zzso grade 3 response, and 7 of 23 zzso had zzso complete zzso 8 zzso and 12 zzso tumor zzso grade 3 patients had zzso and zzso residual viable cells, zzso 

An zzso boost strategy is zzso with an acceptable grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity rate and a very encouraging tumor response zzso The results suggest that there should still be room for further dose escalation of the residual tumor with the aim of increasing zzso complete response and/or zzso zzso
