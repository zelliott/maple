The aim of this study was to combine the anatomy and physiology of the human zzso junction (the junction between the esophagus and the zzso into a unified computer zzso A three-dimensional zzso computer model of the zzso junction was created using zzso images from a human zzso The governing equations of finite deformation elasticity were incorporated into the zzso zzso The model was used to predict the zzso pressure values zzso inside the zzso due to the muscle contraction of the zzso junction and the effects of the surrounding zzso The zzso pressure results obtained from the zzso model were consistent with experimental values available in the zzso The model was also used to examine the independent roles of each muscle layer zzso and zzso of the zzso junction by contracting them zzso zzso showed that the zzso pressure values predicted by the model were primarily due to the contraction of the circular muscle zzso If the circular muscle layer was zzso the contraction of the zzso muscle layer resulted in an expansion of the zzso In conclusion, the model provided reliable predictions of the zzso pressure values during the contraction of a normal zzso zzso The model also provided a framework to examine the role of each muscle layer during the contraction of the zzso zzso
