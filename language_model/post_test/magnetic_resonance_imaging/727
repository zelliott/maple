A traditional method of zzso brain functions has been to identify shared areas of brain damage in individuals who have a particular zzso The rationale of this zzso zzso approach is zzso if the individuals can no longer perform the function, the area of brain damaged in most of these individuals must have been responsible for that zzso However, the zzso association, zzso the probability of the zzso causing the deficit, is often not zzso In this study, we illustrate potential weaknesses of this approach, by zzso regions of the brain essential for orchestrating speech zzso A particularly elegant and widely cited zzso overlap study identified the superior part of the zzso zzso of the zzso (in the anterior zzso as the shared area of damage in chronic stroke patients with zzso of zzso a disorder of motor planning and programming of zzso Others have confirmed that patients with zzso of speech commonly have damage to the anterior zzso However, this reliable association might reflect the vulnerability of the zzso to damage following zzso or narrowing of the middle cerebral artery (which can independently cause zzso of speech and many other zzso To evaluate this possibility, we examined the relationship between zzso of speech and the zzso in three unique ways: zzso we determined the probability of the zzso causing the deficit, as well as the deficit being associated with the zzso by examining speech articulation and advanced zzso in two consecutive series of patients with acute left hemisphere, zzso stroke, 40 with and 40 without insular zzso zzso we studied patients at stroke onset to identify the deficit before it resolved in cases of small zzso and zzso we identified regions of dysfunctional brain zzso as well as structural zzso Using this approach, we found no association between zzso of speech and zzso of the left zzso anterior zzso or superior tip of the zzso zzso of the zzso Instead, in patients with and without insular zzso zzso of speech was associated with structural damage or low blood flow in left zzso inferior frontal zzso These results illustrate a potential limitation of zzso overlap studies, and illustrate an alternative method for identifying zzso zzso
