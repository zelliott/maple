An increasing amount of evidence supports a crucial role for the anterior zzso lobe zzso in semantic zzso zzso a selective disruption of the functional connectivity between left and right zzso in patients with chronic zzso stroke has been zzso The aim of the current study was to evaluate the consequences that zzso on the ATL have on the zzso network supporting semantic zzso Unlike previous work, in this zzso study we selected a group of patients with small zzso centered on the left zzso zzso lobe before zzso We then used an effective connectivity method zzso dynamic zzso zzso to investigate the consequences that these zzso have on the functional interactions within the zzso This approach allowed us to evaluate the zzso of the zzso interactions among brain regions and their associated connectivity zzso zzso we found that semantic processing was altered when patients were compared with a strictly matched group of zzso Dynamic zzso modeling for event related responses revealed that picture naming was associated with a bilateral zzso network, encompassing zzso and feedback zzso zzso of specific network parameters between groups revealed that patients displayed selective network zzso Specifically, backward connectivity from anterior to zzso zzso lobe was decreased in the zzso hemisphere, whereas it was enhanced in the zzso zzso These results reinforce the relevance of ATL in semantic memory, as well as its zzso organization, and highlight the role of feedback connections in enabling the integration of the semantic zzso
