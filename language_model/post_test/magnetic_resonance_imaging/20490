To investigate the associations among brain zzso changes as seen on magnetic resonance imaging zzso cerebrovascular risk zzso and clinical diagnosis and zzso in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment and zzso living in urban zzso 

zzso study performed from May 1, 2007, to November 31, zzso 

Memory Disorders Clinic of the zzso Hospital and the Shanghai zzso 

zzso older people: 32 with normal zzso zzso 30 with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and 34 with zzso 

For each patient, we administered a zzso and physical examination, zzso zzso and brain zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The volumes determined by zzso were assessed using a semiautomatic zzso 

Brain volume was significantly smaller in the zzso patients compared with the NC zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso volume zzso was lower and white matter zzso zzso volume was higher in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with NC zzso The presence of zzso was significantly associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso blood pressure was positively associated with zzso score zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso score zzso were positively associated with zzso zzso The zzso volume zzso and zzso score zzso were higher among zzso patients compared with NC zzso 

Brain structure changes seen on zzso were significantly associated with clinical zzso In addition, blood pressure was highly associated with zzso score and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a valuable measure of brain injury in a Chinese cohort and can serve to assess the effects of various degenerative and cerebrovascular zzso
