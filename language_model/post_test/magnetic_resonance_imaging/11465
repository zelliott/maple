The ability to control the shape of zzso zzso was investigated for various zzso heating zzso incorporating zzso zzso and device zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso were constructed and the effects of ultrasound power, frequency, scan rate and heating time on zzso radius were studied in heating experiments in excised liver zzso Continuous zzso zzso were generated by scanning heating zzso over a 180 angular zzso The region of zzso zzso was restricted to the prescribed zzso zzso radius increased with acoustic power and heating time and decreased with increasing zzso The relationship between the temperature distribution generated by the zzso and the resulting zzso zzso was assessed with zzso Analysis of MR temperature maps revealed that the temperature distribution could be measured accurately within 2 zzso from the surface of the zzso and the boundary of zzso zzso was defined by a temperature of 54 zzso 12 degrees zzso zzso of temperature zzso indicated that slower scan rates can overcome the tendency of zzso to reduce the radius of zzso zzso This zzso design and delivery strategy make zzso zzso heating zzso
