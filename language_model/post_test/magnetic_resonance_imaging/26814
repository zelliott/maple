To define and compare the complications of bone tumors after zzso zzso zzso and zzso with or without zzso 

Eighty patients (40 males and 40 zzso ages zzso zzso with 61 zzso and 19 benign bone tumors were evaluated for local and distant complications after zzso Two groups of patients were zzso zzso 53 patients had zzso without zzso zzso or with external beam zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso 27 patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso without zzso zzso or with zzso (5 zzso Patient follow-up varied from 1 month to zzso years with mean follow-up of zzso zzso Imaging studies included bone and chest zzso spin echo zzso and zzso (or zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for bone zzso 

zzso differentiated the rapidly enhancing zzso residual tumors and zzso from the slowly enhancing zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to lung and zzso and zzso were greater than twice as frequent in patients after zzso than after zzso Although zzso of zzso patients had residual zzso no zzso patient had residual zzso In contrast, after zzso infection was almost three times as frequent and zzso loosening twice as frequent as compared with the zzso zzso Bones treated with zzso and/or zzso showed increased prevalence of fractures and zzso In addition, muscle inflammation was more common in the zzso zzso patient as compared with the patient who did not receive this zzso However, another soft tissue complication, zzso zzso was rare in the patient after zzso but zzso of patients after zzso and zzso after zzso showed zzso zzso zzso complications after zzso or zzso involved adjacent nerves with partial zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso to recurrence or zzso after zzso or zzso with or without zzso One patient developed a zzso zzso artery zzso after zzso 

zzso of patients with benign and zzso bone tumors demonstrated the efficacy of zzso for distinguishing rapidly enhancing viable tumor from the slowly enhancing or zzso benign processes after different zzso Although zzso residual tumors, zzso and zzso were more common after zzso fractures, zzso infection, and muscular zzso predominated in the zzso zzso zzso further predisposed zzso and zzso patients to develop fractures, osteoporosis and infection and was the major cause of persistent muscle inflammation at zzso Because complications can evolve and resolve years after treatment, the patients with bone tumors, particularly zzso must receive zzso zzso imaging for zzso diagnosis and zzso
