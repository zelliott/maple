Five zzso zzso patients participated in a zzso treatment that used an intention manipulation zzso a box and pressing a button on a device in the box with the left hand) to initiate naming trials and was designed to zzso word production mechanisms from the left to the right frontal zzso To test the underlying assumption regarding zzso patients participated in zzso of zzso generation before and after zzso Generally, the four patients who improved during treatment showed reduced frontal activity from zzso to zzso zzso with increasing concentration of activity in the right zzso frontal lobe zzso cortex, zzso zzso demonstrating a significant shift in zzso toward the right lateral frontal zzso as zzso Three of these four patients showed no left frontal activity by completion of treatment, indicating that right zzso lateral frontal activity supported zzso zzso Patients who improved in treatment showed no difference in zzso of lateral frontal activity from normal controls zzso but zzso their lateral frontal activity during zzso generation was significantly more right zzso than that of zzso zzso of activity zzso and zzso suggested increasing efficiency of cortical processing as a result of treatment in the four patients who zzso The one patient who did not improve during treatment showed a zzso shift in lateral frontal zzso that was significantly different from the four patients who did zzso Neither zzso frontal nor zzso zzso zzso from immediately zzso to immediately zzso images was a necessary condition for significant treatment gains or shift in lateral frontal zzso Of the three patients who improved and in whom zzso zzso activity could be measured at zzso zzso all maintained equal or greater amounts of zzso zzso activity as compared to zzso This finding is consistent with reviews suggesting both zzso are involved in recovery of language in zzso zzso
