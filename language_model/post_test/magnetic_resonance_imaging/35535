The aim of this study was to investigate the various zzso zzso models in the zzso of local cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso and the corresponding relationship with cerebral blood flow zzso during brain zzso This aim was addressed by simultaneously measuring the relative changes in zzso cerebral blood volume zzso and blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso signals in the human visual zzso during visual zzso A zzso zzso delivered flash stimulation at five different zzso Two zzso models, the zzso model zzso and the zzso model zzso were used to determine the relative changes in zzso using three zzso zzso zzso with parameters identical to those used in a prior zzso study zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso with directly measured parameters zzso from zzso and alpha from measured zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The magnitude of relative changes in zzso and the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso obtained with zzso zzso and zzso were not in agreement with those obtained using zzso zzso However, the results of zzso zzso and zzso were aligned with zzso zzso zzso findings from the zzso Our results indicate that if appropriate parameters are used, the zzso and zzso models are equivalent for zzso the values of zzso and determining the zzso zzso
