With the largest data set of patients with zzso zzso the major cause of zzso zzso zzso related to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso described so far, we aimed to refine the spectrum of neurological and zzso features and to assess relationships with the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso A total of 63 patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Of the 63 patients, 40 were found to carry either zzso point zzso zzso or small zzso deletions zzso and 1 carried a zzso nonsense zzso On the basis of the severity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso findings, correlations with the location and type of zzso were zzso 

Most patients with zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with thin corpus zzso zzso and prominent zzso spaces zzso By contrast, patients without zzso zzso tended to have less severe zzso zzso zzso zzso and no additional brain zzso The degree of zzso impairment was in accordance with the severity of zzso with a high zzso of zzso zzso zzso the severity of zzso was not determined with the same reliability because zzso had early onset of zzso and zzso had zzso more often than zzso In addition, neither the zzso type nor the location of the zzso were found to predict the severity of zzso zzso 

Our results confirm the zzso profile of patients with zzso zzso who demonstrate in a large proportion zzso zzso grade zzso and the absence of correlation with zzso zzso
