A comparative measurement design investigating the zzso zzso zzso under simulated clinical tests for cervical zzso using magnetic resonance zzso 

The purpose of this study was to evaluate functional changes in the cervical zzso zzso during the zzso zzso test zzso zzso distraction test zzso and zzso test zzso 

Although zzso of the zzso area of the cervical zzso zzso during zzso and rotation have been reported, there are no studies that have measured functional changes in zzso zzso area zzso or shape during the simulation of clinical tests for cervical zzso 

23 participants (12 men, age: zzso zzso without history of significant spinal disorders were zzso The zzso sequence of the magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso was performed with a zzso zzso open zzso zzso were taken of zzso and zzso shape zzso of zzso height to zzso These zzso were conducted under 4 different zzso zzso in zzso zzso in neutral with a 12 zzso distraction force, zzso in neutral with a 7 zzso zzso zzso force, zzso cervical spine was extended zzso degrees ), rotated zzso degrees ), and zzso zzso zzso degrees ), in a standardized zzso 

At all levels except for zzso the zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso during the zzso to around zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso significantly decreased to approximately zzso of control zzso zzso zzso at all levels during the zzso In addition, there were significant differences zzso zzso zzso in zzso shape between the ACT and zzso condition, but only at the zzso and zzso zzso 

During 3 clinical tests for cervical zzso functional, relevant, and changes in the cervical zzso zzso were evident particularly in the middle cervical zzso
