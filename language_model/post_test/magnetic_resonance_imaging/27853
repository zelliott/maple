Various abnormalities in frontal and zzso regions have been reported in children with prenatal alcohol and/or methamphetamine zzso In a recent zzso study, we observed a correlation between accuracy on a zzso task and functional zzso in the zzso in children with prenatal methamphetamine and zzso zzso Because the zzso is part of the zzso motor loop whereas the zzso is involved in the executive loop, we hypothesized that a loss of segregation between distinct zzso networks may occur in these zzso The current study was designed to test this hypothesis using functional connectivity zzso We examined 50 children ranging in age from 7 to 15, including 19 with prenatal methamphetamine exposure (15 of whom had zzso prenatal alcohol zzso 13 with prenatal exposure to alcohol but not methamphetamine, and 18 zzso zzso We measured the zzso between blood zzso level dependent zzso fluctuations during a zzso task in four zzso seed regions and those in the rest of the zzso We found that the zzso seeds showed increased connectivity with frontal brain regions involved in executive functions while the zzso seeds showed decreased connectivity with some of these regions in both groups of exposed subjects compared to zzso These findings suggest that localized brain abnormalities resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol and/or methamphetamine lead to a partial zzso of zzso zzso These results represent important progress in the field, and could have substantial clinical significance in helping devise more targeted treatments and zzso strategies designed to better serve the needs of this zzso
