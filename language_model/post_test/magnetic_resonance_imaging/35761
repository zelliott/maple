The knees of 17 patients (18 zzso with possible zzso cruciate zzso and zzso cartilage abnormalities were examined with a three-dimensional zzso transform zzso zzso acquisition in a steady state zzso pulse zzso zzso confirmation was available in all cases and was the standard for zzso Thirteen of these zzso were also examined by using a two-dimensional zzso transform zzso pulse sequence with a zzso repetition time and zzso and zzso echo zzso In these 13 cases, both pulse sequences correctly identified seven of eight zzso zzso However, interpretation of the zzso zzso images resulted in fewer zzso zzso tears (three vs zzso zzso ligament tears were detected more readily on the zzso zzso images (six vs three with two possible tears on the zzso zzso These preliminary findings suggest that the overall accuracy of MR imaging of the knee could be improved by including zzso zzso pulse zzso
