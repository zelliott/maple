zzso selection pressures have been one of the factors proposed to zzso sex differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso control may vary as a function of the zzso cycle and may be modulated by the stimuli being processed if these stimuli are related to zzso zzso We used functional zzso to study women's brain zzso across the zzso cycle on a zzso response zzso task using attractive male and female faces as zzso We detected brain activity changes for both successful inhibitions and errors of commission that were unique to the male stimuli during the zzso phase of the zzso zzso That is, when pregnancy was possible women had superior zzso brain function and heightened detection of zzso failures when processing male zzso Moreover, we show that individual differences between females in sexual desire and social risk taking zzso correlate with zzso brain activity to the male stimuli during the zzso phase of the zzso zzso These results suggest an interaction between hormonal influences and zzso effects in producing an zzso outcome predicted by evolutionary psychology, and suggest that the functioning of the zzso monitoring system can predict individual differences in both traits and real-world risk-taking zzso
