We tested zzso patterns of individual muscles and zzso compartments zzso of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso exercises zzso Eight healthy men performed repetitive zzso zzso at 120 degrees zzso Before and after zzso muscle functional magnetic resonance images of the thigh were taken to calculate zzso relaxation times zzso for the individual muscles of the zzso In terms of exercised zzso a moderate correlation was observed between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso and between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso Furthermore, a strong correlation was also observed between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso and between the zzso and VI ( zzso zzso There was a significant difference in zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso We conclude that at least two strategies are applied for force production in the human zzso zzso zzso of specific pairs of individual muscles and zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the zzso
