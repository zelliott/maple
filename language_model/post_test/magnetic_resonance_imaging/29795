In selected patients undergoing zzso surgery, zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso the zzso zone and identifying eloquent zzso zzso the relationship of the zzso to underlying brain architecture traditionally has been zzso This report describes and zzso the use of an original zzso method that displays a representation of the zzso positions, based on zzso CT or MR findings, zzso with a zzso image of the brain, on an zzso surgery zzso 

zzso patients underwent the procedure with visual zzso of the actual and virtual zzso undertaken during the second zzso zzso The accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso positions was further studied in a zzso of five patients during surgery by plotting the distance from the actual zzso positions by using an infrared zzso zzso 

The accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso positions by visual inspection was satisfactory in all 17 zzso In the five cases in which quantitative zzso were performed, the mean error for the CT derived zzso positions was zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the mean error for the zzso zzso positions of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso positions were highly accurate in zzso the actual position of the zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated a trend toward better zzso but the CT images were quicker and easier to zzso This technology has the potential to minimize both human and technical zzso allowing for a more precise tailoring of the cortical zzso in zzso zzso
