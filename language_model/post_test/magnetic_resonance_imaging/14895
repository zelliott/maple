To compare the accuracy of prenatal zzso zzso to magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the zzso of zzso lung anomalies, and to assess their agreement with final zzso To evaluate the influence of additional zzso information on therapeutic zzso 

26 prenatal zzso lung anomalies detected zzso between 2006 and 2012 were zzso zzso zzso were initially observed at prenatal US and further investigated with zzso zzso US and zzso imaging findings, and suggested diagnosis were compared with the final diagnosis, obtained from zzso zzso pathological evaluation following surgical zzso zzso and zzso imaging studies zzso 

zzso diagnoses included 7 zzso pulmonary airway zzso 8 complex zzso 7 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso cyst, 1 zzso and 1 bilateral zzso Suggested prenatal US and zzso diagnosis was correct in zzso and zzso of patients, respectively, mainly isolated lung zzso with typical imaging zzso zzso imaging findings at US and zzso studies were observed in zzso of zzso In zzso of the operated anomalies, pathological dissection revealed the presence of complex zzso zzso changed the US diagnosis, but not the further management in zzso of the zzso 

zzso US and zzso showed a high accuracy in the diagnosis of isolated zzso lung zzso with typical imaging zzso However, overall zzso rates were low, because of both a high percentage of complex zzso and of zzso with zzso imaging zzso zzso was better than US in zzso complex zzso but its additional information did not influence therapy zzso
