The zzso of zzso has not yet been zzso The purpose of the study was to zzso in patients with zzso the volume, iron content, and zzso of the brain during zzso episodes of zzso and zzso 

Eleven right-handed zzso patients with zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years; disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 matched control subjects were studied with a zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso sequence used for zzso and a zzso zzso zzso sequence used for zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was used for zzso Brain zzso was recorded during spontaneous zzso and zzso zzso software was used for analysis of the functional zzso 

The patients showed no regional brain volume change, but zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso relaxation time in the right zzso zzso internal and the zzso indicating increased iron zzso The patients were observed to activate the following zzso in the left hemisphere, the primary motor and zzso cortex, the thalamus, the zzso zzso and the zzso anterior zzso and in the right hemisphere, the zzso the inferior and superior zzso zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso the zzso and the zzso 

zzso is associated with increased iron content of the zzso zzso internal and zzso suggesting dysfunction of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso area may represent the zzso zzso zzso the repetitive compulsive movements seen in zzso
