We aimed to investigate the relationship between movement disorders, changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso therapy in children with infantile zzso 

zzso review and brain zzso analysis of children enrolled in the International Collaborative zzso zzso Study zzso who developed a movement disorder on zzso zzso Comparisons were made with controls within zzso who had no movement zzso 

Ten of 124 infants had a movement disorder and in eight it had developed on zzso zzso Two had a movement disorder that resolved on zzso of zzso one had improvement on withdrawing zzso two had resolution without any dose change, and in three it persisted despite zzso zzso The typical brain zzso changes associated with zzso therapy were noted in two zzso Ten control infants were zzso Typical zzso changes noted with zzso were noted in three zzso 

It is possible that in two out of eight cases, zzso was associated with the development of a movement zzso In six out of eight cases a zzso relationship was less zzso The majority of infants treated with zzso did not develop a movement zzso zzso changes associated with zzso do not appear to be specifically related to the movement zzso
