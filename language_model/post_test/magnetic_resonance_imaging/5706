To use magnetic resonance imaging to re-evaluate and improve the 6th edition of the International Union Against zzso Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of the data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients had undergone magnetic resonance imaging examinations and received zzso as their primary zzso 

The T zzso N zzso and stage group were independent zzso No significant differences in the local failure hazards between adjacent T categories were observed between Stage zzso and zzso Stage zzso and zzso and Stage zzso and zzso Although the disease failure hazards for Stage zzso were similar to those for Stage zzso those for Stage zzso were similar to those for Stage zzso Survival zzso of the different zzso zzso showed a better segregation when Stage zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were incorporated into zzso and the zzso greatest dimension was zzso The disease failure hazard for zzso zzso were similar to those of the zzso zzso belonging to Stage zzso the same result was found for the zzso zzso in the sixth American Joint Committee on Cancer staging zzso However, the staging system we propose shows more consistent hazards within the same stage group and better survival discrimination among T categories, N categories, and overall zzso 

Using the 6th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system produces an acceptable distribution of patient numbers and segregation of survival zzso among the different stage zzso The zzso accuracy of the staging system could be improved by zzso the zzso zzso and group stage zzso
