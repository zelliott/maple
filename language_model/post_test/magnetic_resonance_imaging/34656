An zzso study on zzso induced zzso of the peripheral zzso in nude rats was conducted, comparing zzso and GE sequences after zzso application of zzso iron zzso with regard to contrast and image zzso 

40 nude rats with an zzso in the right hind leg and 7 zzso animals were measured without, one and 48 hours after zzso of the contrast zzso 4 zzso and 3 GE sequences with different parameters and slice orientation were zzso The contrast medium consisted of zzso particles with a core diameter of zzso zzso and a coating material of zzso zzso zzso The laboratory animals were divided into 5 groups of zzso animals zzso The rats of the first 4 groups were given a zzso dosage of 100, zzso 200 and 250 zzso zzso body weight, zzso The animals of the fifth group were zzso and served as zzso 

The minimum dosage for detection of zzso zzso zzso one hour after application, was established at zzso zzso zzso body zzso The higher the dosage of the contrast zzso the more signal zzso could be zzso The GE sequences were more sensitive than zzso zzso One GE sequence with the parameters zzso 90 zzso TE 13 zzso FL 8 degrees turned out to be highly zzso 

zzso iron zzso induce signal zzso in zzso of the peripheral soft zzso GE sequences proved to be more sensitive than zzso zzso
