zzso guidelines on high-resolution zzso designed to assess remaining volumes of the zzso and the zzso zzso after zzso zzso lobe zzso surgery could provide a useful tool to investigate the involvement of these anatomical regions in surgical outcomes and in human zzso For this purpose, we implemented an zzso zzso analysis, already applied to healthy population or zzso patient before surgery, to zzso the volume of the zzso the zzso zzso and the regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso spared after unilateral zzso zzso carried out to treat medically uncontrolled zzso lobe zzso zzso Based on the locations of remaining anatomical landmarks, we zzso the volume of these regions in 24 patients after zzso zzso and in 16 control zzso Our results show that zzso mean volumes of these regions zzso to the zzso focus were similar to those of normal subjects, zzso zzso measures obtained from the zzso side were much smaller than those from the zzso side or from normal values and zzso the extent of zzso zzso was comparable in right or left zzso zzso Individual analysis of patients showed that the zzso cortex, as opposed to the other regions, was not systematically removed across zzso As a zzso zzso method, it therefore proves valuable to assess group data as well as to explore differences between individual zzso
