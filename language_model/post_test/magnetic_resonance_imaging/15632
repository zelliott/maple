We sought to identify zzso zzso of zzso rivalry through zzso measures of a key brain region involved in cognitive and emotional zzso 

Twenty subjects from each city were recruited from two large zzso databases, and were scanned on a GE zzso zzso T magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso thickness of the anterior zzso zzso zzso was measured using a zzso mesh method, after image zzso These measures were compared with key zzso financial and academic zzso 

Residents of Melbourne had a significantly thicker zzso zzso zzso zzso than Sydney residents, and this difference remained significant when age and zzso volume were controlled for zzso zzso zzso This difference mirrored that in variables measuring wealth, sporting and academic zzso 

The thinner zzso seen in zzso may reflect the effects of increased stress due to elevated property prices, relative lack of sporting success and other zzso An alternative explanation is that a thinner zzso is the result of increasing cortical refinement and efficiency, and a marker of a more mature zzso However, if these findings are a result of zzso effects, this may have significant implications for residents of more northern regions of the Australian zzso
