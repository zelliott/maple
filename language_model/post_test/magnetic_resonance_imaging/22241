To zzso and compare zzso transfer data from biological zzso a method was developed to extract the average zzso zzso of the zzso pool directly from zzso transfer experimental data along with the four other parameters that characterize the zzso model of zzso zzso transfer data for several biological zzso were analyzed using this method and the resulting zzso zzso were compared with zzso and zzso zzso The use of flexible zzso noticeably improves the fit of the zzso model to the zzso The derived flexible zzso of all the zzso analyzed are physically realistic and show remarkably consistent zzso
