zzso zzso of brain imaging data can enable the automatic detection of differences in cognitive processes of specific groups of zzso Furthermore, it can also give zzso information related to the regions of the brain that are most relevant to detect these differences by means of feature selection procedures, which are also zzso to deal with the high zzso of brain imaging zzso This work proposes the application of zzso feature elimination using a machine learning zzso based on composite kernels to the zzso of healthy controls and patients with zzso This zzso which evaluates zzso relationships between zzso analyzes zzso zzso data from an auditory task experiment that is segmented into anatomical regions and zzso eliminates the zzso ones based on their relevance estimates, thus yielding the set of most zzso brain areas for group zzso The collected data was processed using two analysis zzso the general linear model zzso and independent component analysis zzso zzso spatial maps as well as zzso zzso lobe and default mode component maps were then input to the zzso A mean zzso accuracy of up to zzso estimated with a zzso zzso procedure was achieved by doing zzso data zzso In addition, it is shown that the zzso accuracy rate obtained by using zzso data zzso that reached by using zzso data, hence showing that this zzso takes advantage of the complimentary nature of zzso and zzso
