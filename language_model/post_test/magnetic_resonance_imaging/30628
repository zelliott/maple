zzso resonance imaging zzso is applied in many studies on experimental cerebral zzso in zzso to monitor the zzso evolution of zzso zzso We report a protocol to evaluate the zzso size after middle cerebral artery zzso with zzso zzso in male zzso zzso Imaging was performed with a zzso T scanner and we focused on zzso imaging zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso We show the detailed procedure of zzso the zzso ratio zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso volumes at different zzso zzso The presented method is of low zzso if image contrast between zzso and zzso tissue is very high, which is the case not only for all sequences at 8 and 12 h of zzso but also for zzso after 3 and 5 h of zzso Furthermore, we describe the so-called mismatch region of zzso sizes depicted on zzso and zzso zzso that suffers from zzso zzso but lacks contrast zzso
