zzso guidelines do not indicate when zzso reservoirs should be placed in children with zzso zzso and delayed intervention is zzso We zzso that delayed zzso drainage has adverse effects on structural development and functional zzso 

Using a well-established animal model of zzso zzso zzso we evaluated zzso deficit after early zzso week zzso or late zzso weeks zzso placement of zzso reservoirs which were tapped according to strict zzso zzso 

Progressive zzso was similar in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The average zzso deficit scores zzso over the experimental period were 0 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the control, zzso and zzso groups, zzso At zzso placement, zzso animals displayed enlarged zzso without zzso deficits zzso zzso while the late group displayed zzso with clinical signs of zzso zzso zzso The correlation between zzso severity and zzso in the early group was strongly positive in the acute zzso surgery to 3 weeks zzso zzso zzso and chronic (6 to 12 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso while the late group was less correlated zzso zzso chronic zzso 

Current practice favors delaying zzso zzso until signs of elevated zzso pressure and zzso deficit zzso Our results demonstrate that animals in early and late groups undergo the same course of zzso The findings also show that tapping reservoirs in these zzso zzso animals based on zzso deficit does not halt progressive zzso enlargement and that zzso deficit zzso strongly with zzso zzso
