To investigate the assessment of global cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and white matter changes zzso in patients screened at a memory clinic with a zzso row zzso zzso zzso brain zzso in comparison with the reference standard, magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review zzso Written informed consent was obtained from all zzso Thirty patients (21 men, nine zzso median age, 62 zzso who presented to a memory clinic underwent zzso row CT and zzso MR imaging of the brain on the same zzso Three readers blinded to the clinical diagnosis assessed the zzso zzso Images were presented in random order and scored for zzso zzso and zzso with published visual rating zzso zzso agreement between CT and MR imaging zzso agreement across both zzso expressed by weighted zzso analysis, and zzso agreement within each zzso between readers zzso W zzso were zzso 

Overall, excellent zzso agreement between CT and MR imaging was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the left and right sides of the brain, zzso There was substantial overall agreement concerning zzso zzso zzso zzso For all three tested zzso zzso zzso was low and comparable for CT and MR zzso 

Use of zzso row brain CT yields reliable information that is comparable with that obtained with MR zzso Thus, zzso row CT is a suitable diagnostic imaging tool in a memory clinic zzso
