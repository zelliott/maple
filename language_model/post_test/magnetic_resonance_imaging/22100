To compare zzso zzso findings of small zzso zzso zzso with those of other imaging zzso and to determine whether these zzso are related to zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso in 223 patients, small zzso zzso zzso not directly related to zzso zzso and focal areas of zzso contrast material enhancement more than 1 zzso in diameter were found in 28 zzso These 28 patients were zzso evaluated with zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT after zzso oil administration zzso zzso 23), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso images zzso zzso 10) and dynamic CT scans zzso zzso 4) in these patients were zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso noted at zzso zzso as zzso defects at zzso in 10 patients and as an area of zzso contrast enhancement at dynamic CT in three zzso No zzso was seen at MR imaging, and no persistent zzso oil zzso was seen at zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso tumor growth around the zzso at follow-up zzso and no tumor was present at zzso 

zzso of the zzso changes caused by these small zzso can aid in the interpretation of vascular imaging zzso
