To evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in patients with normal zzso coronary zzso 

Twelve consecutive patients referred for acute chest pain and normal coronary arteries on zzso coronary zzso were involved in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso examinations were performed within 36 hours and 4 days, respectively, after patient zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso was performed by 3 independent blinded observers in term of final diagnosis, number of involved zzso and zzso zzso 

Final diagnosis between zzso and zzso zzso was identical for zzso zzso and zzso with a significant agreement for number of involved segments and zzso zzso zzso zzso was good for both zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso zzso allows differentiation between zzso zzso and zzso with the same accuracy at acute phase compared with zzso
