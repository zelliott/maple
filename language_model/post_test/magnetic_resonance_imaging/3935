zzso patients with zzso received zzso zzso zzso during the years 1987 through zzso In 15 cases, the zzso were zzso either separated by segments of normal zzso or zzso 

Even in the zzso cases, only one zzso zzso was introduced, usually into the zzso zzso Access to the zzso was obtained via a zzso zzso which was performed in an area at which the spinal zzso zzso the zzso was at its zzso 

The progressive clinical course of zzso was arrested in all zzso Surgery resulted in improvement for 11 zzso Five patients remained unchanged without further zzso Two patients became worse as the result of new deficits caused by zzso In four patients, the zzso lead to new but discrete sensory loss of minor zzso zzso magnetic resonance images showed a rapid and persistent collapse of all zzso in all zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso is favorable in patients with large zzso In patients with zzso zzso the procedure may be a second alternative to zzso zzso zzso
