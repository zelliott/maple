zzso control is necessary to navigating through an uncertain zzso With the stop signal task zzso we measure how cognitive control functions in a controlled zzso There has been conflicting evidence on whether trait zzso might reflect differences in cognitive control during the zzso While some studies find that trait zzso relates to measures of response zzso such as the stop signal reaction time zzso other studies do zzso Here, in 92 young adult participants zzso zzso age 25 zzso 4 zzso we examined whether trait zzso measured by the zzso zzso scale zzso is associated with differences in performance and regional brain zzso for the component processes of cognitive control during the zzso Across participants, trait zzso showed a zzso correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In simple zzso zzso of the right anterior zzso zzso and middle frontal zzso zzso during stop as compared to go trials zzso correlated with motor and zzso zzso zzso Using the generalized form of zzso interaction zzso we showed that functional connectivity of the right zzso and zzso with the left zzso prefrontal zzso and bilateral visual areas were also zzso correlated with zzso None of the other component processes of cognitive control, including response zzso error processing, zzso zzso were significantly related to zzso zzso These results suggest that trait zzso as measured by zzso may have distinct effects on zzso processing in adult zzso
