The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of performing in zzso zzso zzso MR zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to document the zzso spectrum of this zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent localized zzso MR zzso performed at zzso zzso zzso zzso from both primary tumors zzso zzso and zzso zzso (18 zzso were obtained at TE 136 and zzso zzso were analyzed in the time domain by using a zzso least squares fitting zzso with incorporation of previous zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios for primary zzso and zzso zzso were calculated and zzso zzso from normal neck muscle of five volunteers were acquired as control zzso 

zzso MR zzso was successfully obtained in seven zzso of nine primary tumors and 16 zzso of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso signals in the range of zzso to zzso zzso were observed in zzso of zzso at TE 136 and zzso of zzso at TE zzso At TE zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than the ratio for primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios for zzso zzso were higher than those for normal neck muscles, for which values ranged from 0 to zzso and 0 to zzso at TE 136 and zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso is a feasible technique for the evaluation of zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso ratios for the zzso were high compared with those for normal neck zzso
