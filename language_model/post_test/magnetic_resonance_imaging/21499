The case of a patient with profound retrograde and minor zzso zzso is described and used to discuss the kind of brain damage which will most likely result in persistent retrograde zzso as the principal zzso The patient was an industrial manager who had fallen off a horse four years prior to the present zzso and zzso zzso zzso examination revealed an injury to both zzso poles and to the zzso portion of the right prefrontal zzso The prefrontal and zzso cortical damage on the right side deeply invaded the white matter while the zzso cortical damage on the left side was much smaller; here, however, portions of the zzso transition zone were affected as zzso The patient was of average zzso His attention, short-term memory, and learning ability were average or somewhat below zzso His old memories were severely affected in the zzso domain, and much less so in that of semantic remote zzso We conclude from this case that the necessary anatomical zzso for the retrieval of old episodic memories lies within the anterior zzso regions (including deeper situated fiber zzso and possibly involves an interaction with the prefrontal cortex, and that this damage is zzso from the zzso zzso damage leading to zzso zzso
