Our purpose was to characterize the pattern and distribution of left zzso zzso zzso by cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso to more precisely define zzso expression and its clinical implications in zzso zzso zzso 

Based on prior zzso and zzso zzso studies, zzso has been regarded as a disease characterized by substantial zzso wall zzso 

zzso and late zzso enhancement zzso were performed in zzso consecutive zzso patients (age 43 zzso 17 zzso 

zzso anterior zzso free wall and the zzso anterior zzso zzso were the most commonly zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was focal zzso zzso or zzso 2 segments zzso or zzso zzso of zzso in 41 patients zzso intermediate (3 to 7 segments zzso to zzso of zzso in 112 patients zzso and diffuse zzso or zzso 8 segments zzso or zzso 50% of zzso in 180 patients zzso 42 patients zzso showed zzso segments separated by regions of normal zzso The number of zzso segments was greater in patients with zzso zzso tract obstruction zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso than without (10 zzso 4 zzso 8 zzso 4 per zzso p zzso zzso and was associated with an advanced New York Heart Association functional class zzso zzso zzso zzso wall thickness was greater in segments with late zzso enhancement than without (20 zzso 6 zzso zzso 16 zzso 6 zzso p zzso zzso We also identified 40 zzso of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso largely confined to the zzso free wall, zzso zzso or zzso which was underestimated or zzso by zzso 

Although diverse, patterns of zzso zzso are usually not extensive in zzso involving zzso or zzso 50% of the chamber in about one-half the patients, and are particularly limited in extent in an important zzso zzso portions of anterior free wall and zzso constituted the zzso region of wall zzso with implications for clinical zzso These observations support an emerging role for zzso in the contemporary evaluation of patients with zzso
