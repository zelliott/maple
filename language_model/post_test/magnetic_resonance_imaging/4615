A particularly powerful paradigm for functional MR imaging of zzso zzso incorporates zzso materials that create significant image zzso These include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso agents for mapping cerebral blood volume and zzso activity, zzso zzso interpretation of these maps requires an understanding of the zzso of zzso image zzso The authors developed a novel zzso Carlo model with which the authors zzso the relationship between microscopic tissue zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso contrast in zzso The authors found vascular zzso to water and the flow of zzso to be relatively zzso contributors to zzso delta zzso However, pulse zzso echo time, and concentration of contrast agent have profound effects on the vessel size dependence of delta zzso For a model zzso containing both zzso and zzso the authors predicted a linear volume fraction dependence for zzso volume changes based on recruitment and zzso and a concentration dependence that is zzso and pulse sequence zzso Using the model, the authors demonstrated that spin echo functional images have greater zzso sensitivity than zzso echo images, and that the specifies of the volume fraction and concentration dependence of zzso zzso change should allow for robust mapping of relative blood zzso The authors also demonstrated excellent agreement between the predictions of their model and experimental data obtained from the serial injection of zzso contrast agent in a rat zzso
