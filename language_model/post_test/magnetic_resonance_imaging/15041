zzso research suggests that zzso zzso receptors zzso have a crucial role in working memory zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the brain zzso and connectivity that zzso zzso Because of its importance in zzso the lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly the zzso prefrontal zzso and its connections, were the focus of zzso Healthy participants zzso participated in a single functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso They received saline and then the zzso zzso zzso while performing a spatial zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to compare lateral prefrontal zzso during saline and zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity analysis was used to compare zzso prefrontal connectivity during the two conditions and zzso connectivity was used to test for zzso in these zzso zzso reduced accuracy on the spatial zzso task and brain zzso during the zzso and early maintenance zzso period of task zzso zzso in zzso zzso during zzso were related to performance zzso zzso reduced connectivity in the zzso network zzso and zzso reductions in connectivity were related to zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso are critical for zzso The knowledge gained may be helpful in understanding disorders that might involve zzso deficits such as schizophrenia and developing better zzso
