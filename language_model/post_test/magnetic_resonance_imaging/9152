To evaluate the effectiveness in diagnosing zzso and zzso zzso breast zzso by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso guided zzso breast biopsy in patients who presented to a community-based hospital with a newly established breast zzso zzso 

The records of 142 consecutive patients, median age of 55 years, who had undergone zzso biopsy at our institution between July 2006 and July 2007 were zzso From these patients, 197 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso at the time of zzso The pathology was then reviewed and correlated with the zzso zzso 

Cancer was present and subsequently discovered in zzso of the previously zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the women studied zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso were invasive zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso Fourteen percent of the discovered zzso zzso were defined as high risk and included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In total, zzso zzso and high-risk zzso were discovered in zzso of the found zzso zzso or zzso of the women who underwent zzso biopsy zzso 

This study demonstrated that detection of zzso and high-risk zzso can be significantly increased when an zzso biopsy program is introduced at a community-based zzso We believe that as zzso gain confidence in imaging and zzso zzso community-based hospitals can achieve similar rates of zzso zzso diagnosis as those found in data emerging from academic zzso
