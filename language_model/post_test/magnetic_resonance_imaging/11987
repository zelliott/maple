The reconstruction of two-dimensional spatial images with zzso resolution using zzso zzso generated by an zzso zzso system rotated about the sample is demonstrated for zzso The method retains chemical shift, should be capable of mapping zzso and zzso information, and might offer sensitivity advantages for zzso with short zzso
