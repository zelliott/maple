zzso zzso is based on changes in cerebral zzso triggered by increased zzso zzso zzso This change in blood flow follows a pattern known as the zzso response function zzso which typically zzso 4-6 s following stimulus zzso However, in the presence of cerebrovascular disease the zzso may not follow this normal pattern, due to either the zzso signal to noise zzso ratio or delays in the zzso which may result in zzso or zzso of zzso zzso The present study examined the zzso and zzso in five individuals with zzso resulting from stroke and four zzso participants using a zzso decision task and a long trial zzso zzso zzso images were acquired using an zzso sequence and zzso zzso images were acquired using Echo zzso Imaging to measure time to peak zzso in the zzso Data were analyzed using Brain Voyager in four zzso regions known to be involved in language zzso zzso area and the zzso zzso network zzso (including zzso area, the angular and zzso zzso and right zzso zzso of these zzso The zzso area also was examined as a control zzso zzso showed that the zzso in three out of five patients in the left zzso area was increased significantly as compared to normal individuals and the left primary visual zzso in the same zzso In two other patients no significant delays were zzso We also found that the zzso for zzso signal detection may by insufficient in damaged zzso These findings indicate that obtaining zzso zzso and quality assurance zzso information is essential for studying zzso patterns in zzso patients in order to avoid errors in interpretation of the zzso An example of one such zzso and the need for alternative data analysis strategies is zzso
