Large zzso defects of the zzso aspect of the zzso head can engage the zzso rim and cause zzso instability after zzso zzso repair for zzso zzso Filling of the zzso head zzso with the zzso aspect of the capsule and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been proposed as an additional zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that the zzso zzso in the zzso bone zzso without a severe adverse effect on shoulder mobility, allowing return to zzso sports zzso 

Of zzso patients operated on for zzso traumatic anterior shoulder instability, zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso repair combined with zzso zzso with use of zzso zzso All had a large zzso zzso zzso grade zzso engaging over the zzso zzso without substantial zzso bone zzso Nine patients had had prior unsuccessful surgery to address zzso instability (three zzso and six zzso zzso The average age at the time of surgery (and standard zzso was 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso comparative shoulder motion was precisely measured with use of digital photographic zzso zzso healing was assessed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance image zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean duration of follow-up was zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso aspect of the capsule and the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso was observed in all zzso patients who underwent zzso imaging, and zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso Compared with the normal zzso side, the mean deficit in external rotation was zzso zzso zzso with the arm at the side of the trunk and zzso zzso zzso in abduction at the time of the last zzso Of zzso patients involved in sports, zzso zzso were able to return zzso and zzso zzso returned to the same level of sports, including those involving overhead zzso zzso percent zzso of the zzso patients had a stable shoulder at the time of the last zzso 

zzso zzso zzso performed in combination with a zzso repair, is a potential solution for patients with a large engaging zzso head bone zzso but no substantial zzso bone zzso The zzso zzso zzso predictably in the zzso zzso The slight restriction in external rotation zzso zzso does not significantly affect return to sports, including those involving overhead zzso The zzso which may also be useful for revision of previous failed zzso instability surgery, is not indicated for patients with zzso bone zzso
