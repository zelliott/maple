We sought to assess right zzso zzso function in young patients with corrected zzso of zzso and pulmonary zzso 

Pulmonary zzso is an important problem in repair of zzso of zzso Its effects on right zzso zzso function in children are zzso 

zzso children with repair of zzso of zzso zzso age zzso zzso 12 zzso 3 years, mean age at operation zzso zzso 1) and 12 healthy children were zzso zzso of magnetic resonance zzso mapping pulmonary and zzso volume flow zzso provided right zzso zzso zzso zzso size was assessed with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso exercise testing was zzso 

zzso and random differences zzso zzso zzso of zzso mapping and zzso zzso time to peak zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 26 zzso r zzso zzso peak zzso 2 zzso 11 zzso r zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and duration of pulmonary zzso (20 zzso 35 zzso r zzso zzso were zzso In 6 patients zzso zzso late zzso forward pulmonary artery flow was zzso in 13 patients zzso zzso this flow contributed zzso to zzso to right zzso stroke zzso zzso differences were increased zzso time zzso zzso 91 zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso p zzso zzso decreased filling fraction (44 zzso 11 zzso 55 zzso zzso p zzso zzso and increased peak early filling rate zzso zzso 124 zzso zzso zzso 112 zzso p zzso zzso between control subjects and group I, and increased zzso time zzso zzso 40, p zzso zzso between control subjects and group zzso Pulmonary zzso zzso size and ejection fraction did not differ significantly between patient zzso Exercise function was diminished with restrictive right zzso physiology zzso zzso zzso group II zzso control zzso 

zzso relaxation and restriction to filling affect right zzso function in children with repair of zzso of zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso right zzso physiology is associated with decreased exercise zzso
