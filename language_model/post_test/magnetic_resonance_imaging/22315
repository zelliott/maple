The effect of the novel inhibitor of zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on focal cerebral zzso was studied in zzso rats submitted to permanent zzso zzso of the right middle cerebral artery zzso The treated group zzso zzso 7) received subcutaneous injections of 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso (in 1 zzso zzso 10 zzso after vascular zzso and again after 3 zzso The zzso group zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso with 1 zzso saline at the same zzso Evolution of zzso was monitored by zzso recording of zzso and cortical steady potential and by zzso magnetic resonance imaging during the initial 6 h of vascular zzso The zzso zzso and zzso changes were studied after 6 h by combining zzso measurement of blood flow with zzso zzso and pictorial zzso of zzso zzso and tissue zzso In the zzso animals, the zzso zzso volume zzso as the region in which the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of water declined to below zzso of zzso steadily increased by approximately 50% during the initial 6 h of vascular zzso relative to the first set of data 10 zzso zzso In the treated animals, in contrast, the zzso zzso volume declined by approximately zzso during the same zzso Treatment also led to a significant reduction in the number of zzso zzso After 6 h of vascular zzso blood flow was significantly higher in the treated animals, and the volume of zzso and zzso injured tissue representing the zzso core was zzso zzso The volume of severely zzso zzso in contrast, did not zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso does not reduce the size of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso treatment of permanent focal zzso with zzso zzso zzso delays the expansion of the zzso core into the zzso for a duration of at least 6 h and therefore substantially zzso the window of opportunity for the reversal of the zzso impact in the peripheral parts of the evolving zzso
