We examined 46 patients with zzso documented zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso 20 patients with zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso In each patient a zzso zzso sequence in zzso double zzso plane was performed to assess left and right zzso volumes, ejection fraction and zzso zzso zzso a blood flow sensitive zzso echo technique was done to zzso direction and extension of the zzso zzso zzso data were compared with quantitative and qualitative assessment of zzso by zzso and zzso Using the zzso echo technique zzso could demonstrate the zzso jet in all zzso A linear correlation for volume parameters by zzso and zzso was found with best correlation for the left zzso stroke volume zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction correlated with zzso determined zzso fraction in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso assessment of zzso by zzso echo technique showed an agreement with zzso grading by Sellers in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The comparison of zzso and color zzso zzso showed only moderate correlation of r zzso zzso zzso less than zzso
