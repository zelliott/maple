In zzso functional zzso zzso studies, greater activity for items that are subsequently remembered zzso than for items that are subsequently forgotten zzso or zzso effect zzso in zzso has been attributed to successful zzso zzso In contrast, regions showing a reverse zzso effect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been linked to zzso processes leading to zzso Yet, zzso may reflect not only zzso for zzso zzso but also zzso for zzso zzso and the latter alternative is more likely to reflect beneficial rather than zzso zzso zzso To investigate this issue, we used a paradigm that included a fixation baseline and could distinguish between the two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants were scanned while zzso semantic associations between words or zzso associations between words and zzso and their memory was measured with zzso recognition zzso For both semantic and zzso zzso zzso effects were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast with a prior study that attributed zzso in these regions to zzso zzso the present results suggest that these effects reflect beneficial zzso that is, the efficient zzso of zzso zzso At the same time, zzso effects were found in other regions, such as the zzso and these are more consistent with an interpretation in terms of zzso zzso Whereas most zzso studies of zzso have focused on zzso increases, the present study indicates that zzso decreases are also critical for successful learning of new zzso
