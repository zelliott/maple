The delayed reaction zzso consisting to discover two different rules zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by a delayed reversal task, is a specific marker for the functioning of zzso prefrontal zzso Although several works in zzso report the use of zzso delayed zzso tasks, in none of the studies mice with zzso of the prefrontal zzso were used in this zzso In the current study, mouse experiments were conducted using a new, totally automated device, the zzso zzso Here, we show that unilateral zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso in mice induced similar deficits to those observed after frontal zzso in monkeys and zzso These pronounced learning deficits seem to come from difficulty zzso a new rule and the inability to inhibit the previous rule, characterized by zzso after prefrontal zzso zzso The present results demonstrate that this very simple experimental paradigm using the zzso zzso presents the advantage to be fast (one training zzso and well suited to assess the frontal functions in zzso It should be useful for testing pharmacological or stem cell approaches in order to reduce organic damages or gain insight into the cognitive functions of the frontal zzso using transgenic or zzso zzso
