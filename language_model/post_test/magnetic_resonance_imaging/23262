Does the zzso face zzso zzso code only for zzso This question continues to elude the zzso field due to at least two kinds of problems: first, the relatively low spatial resolution of zzso in which the zzso was defined and second, the potential bias inherent in prevailing statistical methods for analyzing the actual zzso of cortical zzso Using high-resolution (1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso imaging data of the zzso face area zzso from 4 subjects who had zzso images as zzso zzso zzso or zzso we used zzso linear and zzso zzso to decode the zzso zzso zzso Prior to identifying the appropriate zzso we performed exploratory analysis to determine the nature of the zzso over classes and the zzso intensity pattern structure between zzso The zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso revealing zzso sequences of zzso which appeared in small zzso clusters of categories, intertwined with other zzso Since this analysis suggested that feature space was highly zzso we trained various statistical zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and separated the four categories with zzso reliability (over zzso and generalized to zzso cases with high significance (up to zzso zzso zzso The increased noise inherent in high-resolution zzso data relative to standard resolution resisted any further gains in category performance above zzso (with zzso category often having the highest bias per zzso even coupled with various feature zzso zzso A zzso analysis for each zzso per zzso zzso zzso reliable (with zzso sensitivity present throughout the zzso for all 4 categories, and zzso showed zzso that is, many zzso were selective for more than one category with some high zzso but at zzso zzso This work is clearly consistent with the characterization of the zzso as a distributed, zzso similarity structure and bolsters the view that the zzso response to zzso stimuli in standard resolution may be primarily due to a linear bias, which has resulted from an averaging zzso
