zzso cruciate ligament zzso zzso surgery has seen significant progress since zzso interference screws have replaced synthetic metallic screws for ligament graft fixation within the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our study compared the MR images of patients who underwent zzso reconstruction using zzso interference screws with those of patients who underwent zzso reconstruction using metallic screws to evaluate the MR aspects of degradation and zzso processes of zzso interference screws zzso 

Between September 1999 and December 2002 we performed zzso on 40 patients who underwent zzso zzso reconstruction with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso screws in 35 cases and metallic screws in 5 zzso After surgery, all patients underwent an intensive rehabilitation zzso along with clinical evaluation using the standard knee ligament evaluation form of the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso and zzso zzso MR studies were performed 1, 2 and 3 years zzso using a zzso MR scanner with zzso and zzso and STIR zzso 

zzso patients were clinically classified as group A zzso (full return to sports zzso and 7 patients as group B zzso No zzso reaction was found in patients treated with zzso interference screws, both from a clinical point of view and from laboratory zzso zzso zzso were found in all patients treated with metallic interference zzso In patients with zzso interference screws, degradation of the screws and absence of significant zzso allowed correct evaluation of the signal of the reconstructed ligament throughout its zzso the zzso tunnels and the joint zzso In 34 of 35 patients with zzso interference screws, the screw could not be detected due to complete zzso In 8, 12 and 4 cases, a small zzso formation due to screw zzso was present at the screw site within 1, 2 and 3 years from surgery zzso Only in 4 cases was the process of zzso of the screw and bone plug complete 3 years after the operation, with zzso restoration of bone zzso 

The use of zzso interference screws is a valuable alternative to synthetic metallic fixation implants as the absence of zzso allows correct zzso MR zzso zzso is the only technique able to zzso all the portions of the transplant and to evaluate the healing zzso zzso interference screws usually degrade within one zzso However, full zzso requires a long time and may not be complete 3 years after zzso The presence of zzso zzso at the screw site has to be regarded as a normal feature of the screw degradation zzso zzso the use of zzso interference screws is recommended as it enables MR follow-up of the knee after zzso zzso
