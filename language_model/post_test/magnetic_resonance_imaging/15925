zzso in zzso clearance are associated with the accelerated loss of lung function in several respiratory zzso zzso enabling the in zzso zzso of zzso dynamics in zzso at high resolution and sensitivity would be beneficial for experimental lung zzso We describe the synthesis and characterization of two zzso zzso zzso zzso binding specifically to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso in zzso cells in the lungs of zzso rats has been demonstrated in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and confirmed by zzso The effects of zzso zzso were then studied in zzso rats by simultaneously administering the imaging probe and the zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso but at the same time induced a release of zzso from zzso cells, thus not contributing to the overall reduction of zzso in the zzso The approach outlined here enables one to derive information on zzso zzso as well as zzso Such a global view on zzso dynamics may prove invaluable when testing new pharmacological agents aimed at improving zzso zzso
