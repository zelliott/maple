To zzso evaluate the fat content of zzso muscles by using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in patients with chronic low back pain zzso and in zzso volunteers matched with regard to age, sex, and body mass zzso 

The study was approved by the responsible institutional review zzso zzso consent was obtained from each patient and each zzso zzso zzso MR zzso was used to measure the fat content of the zzso zzso and zzso muscles in 25 patients (13 women, 12 zzso mean age, zzso zzso with chronic zzso and in 25 matched zzso volunteers (13 women, 12 zzso mean age, zzso zzso The fat content was also graded zzso zzso zzso The relationship between fat content and zzso zzso zzso intensity, and zzso disability was assessed zzso zzso 

The mean percentage fat content of the zzso muscle was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the volunteers zzso zzso zzso The corresponding values for the zzso muscle were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the volunteers zzso zzso zzso The zzso grading of the fat content of the zzso muscle was 0 in 12 zzso of 25 patients and in 14 zzso of 25 volunteers, 1 in 11 zzso patients and in eight zzso volunteers, and 2 in two zzso patients and three zzso zzso The zzso grading of the fat content of the zzso muscle was 0 in nine zzso of 25 patients and 15 zzso of 25 volunteers, 1 in 13 zzso patients and nine zzso volunteers, and 2 in three zzso patients and one zzso zzso Neither grade 3 nor grade 4 was assigned to any zzso The grading differences were not significant between patients and zzso No significant correlation was found between fat content and pain intensity, pain zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso demonstrates a significantly higher fat content in the zzso muscle in patients with chronic zzso than in zzso zzso No difference was detected with a zzso grading zzso
