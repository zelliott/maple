zzso iron oxide zzso zzso are very promising contrast media, especially for molecular imaging, due to their superior zzso zzso They even have wider biomedical applications such as in drug and gene delivery, tissue engineering and zzso or as sensitive biological zzso By zzso them to affinity zzso zzso can bind to drugs, zzso zzso zzso or zzso For in zzso biomedical applications, the detection of molecular interaction is possible by using a diversity of systems capable of sensing the magnetic properties of these zzso The goal of the present work was to develop and validate various in zzso biomedical applications of zzso zzso particles of iron oxide zzso including some that are not related to their magnetic zzso zzso coated with zzso starch or zzso exposing zzso groups were zzso and some of them were zzso by zzso various zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso or zzso specific zzso The in zzso biomedical applications assessed in the present work zzso zzso the zzso measurement of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso molecular interaction, and zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells and detection of molecular interaction in an zzso system; zzso zzso applications of zzso derivatives; and zzso detection of specific zzso by zzso Our results confirm that rapid and simple in zzso detection of a diversity of zzso zzso with relevance in medicine is possible by the existing zzso techniques and by chemical zzso zzso The protocols can be applied to minimally prepared biological samples zzso whole blood, blood plasma or serum, cell suspensions, zzso zzso zzso zzso and often do not need complicated systems of signal zzso The use of zzso labeled compounds could zzso contribute to cost reductions in the diagnosis and in patient zzso
