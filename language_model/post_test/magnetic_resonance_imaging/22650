To study the outcome of zzso from patients with zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso 

Three zzso zzso children who had been diagnosed with zzso type 1 zzso abnormalities and who exhibited zzso a wide range of abnormalities according to common anatomical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chen zzso zzso I zzso clinical and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a lack of specific, clinical signs of increased zzso pressure, and zzso apparently zzso zzso abnormalities zzso intermittent rhythmic delta activity zzso in patients 1 and 3, and with focal zzso plus spikes and spike waves of high zzso in patient zzso Standard zzso were recorded before surgery and within one month of surgery, which was performed in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso to control zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso were performed within zzso months of zzso 

In all patients, zzso zzso zzso control demonstrated poor zzso flow, which was completely restored by zzso zzso zzso In all patients, the zzso abnormalities disappeared within one month of surgery and the zzso were normal at zzso 

A new zzso zzso identified as focal zzso alone or focal zzso plus spikes and spike waves of high zzso in the zzso seems to be associated with poor zzso flow in zzso zzso patients with zzso type I zzso 

The identified, zzso zzso abnormalities should be interpreted as an indirect sign of subtle zzso zzso
