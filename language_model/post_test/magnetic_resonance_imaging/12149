The effects of variations in blood zzso composition on magnetic relaxation rates and magnetic resonance zzso image have been characterized in zzso Both zzso and zzso were found to be linear functions of zzso for blood and zzso with increases in zzso resulting in progressive decreases in image signal zzso zzso formation in fully zzso samples produced no change in relaxation rates or MR images compared with zzso blood, but zzso zzso was associated with a significant increase in zzso that resulted in a decreased zzso zzso resulted in a zzso image with appearance of a zzso peripheral zzso differences in the method of zzso preparation resulted in significant image zzso The pattern of zzso was found to depend on the type of zzso zzso used and its site of initial zzso zzso of tissue zzso zzso into the zzso resulted in zzso primarily in the zzso interior, whereas placing the zzso in the surrounding serum caused degradation from the outside of the zzso Both observations are consistent with the high binding affinity of tissue zzso zzso for zzso By comparison, zzso with low zzso binding zzso dissolved zzso in a peripheral pattern whether injected into the zzso or introduced in the zzso These findings identify several variables of zzso composition and structure that influence MR images of zzso and should be considered in their zzso
