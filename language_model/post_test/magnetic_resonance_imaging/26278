To determine the degree to which the zzso of the internal auditory canal zzso can be zzso during the middle zzso approach zzso 

Conventional wisdom states that the zzso provides excellent access to the zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso On the basis of observations derived from a substantial surgical experience, it became obvious that a variable fraction of the zzso lies obscure from the zzso line of sight during the zzso because of zzso the zzso of the zzso crest and/or zzso the zzso of the facial nerve at its entry into the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were performed in ten cases to determine the typical angle of view to the zzso of the zzso in the zzso This angle of view was projected onto zzso zzso zzso scans of 40 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were made to determine the amount of zzso that could not be directly zzso during a zzso zzso 

On the basis of a surgical line of sight, the fraction of the inferior compartment of the canal that could not be directly zzso because of zzso of the zzso crest ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

Complete zzso of zzso tumors involving the zzso via the zzso requires some degree of blind zzso Specialized tools and techniques are required to minimize the risk of neural injury during this indirect zzso zzso of the zzso with either mirror or zzso is often necessary to exclude the possibility of retained tumor zzso
