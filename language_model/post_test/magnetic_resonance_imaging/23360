Evidence for zzso structural zzso has been previously reported for brain zzso regions supporting zzso functional zzso Here, we aimed to investigate whether the two brain zzso demonstrate dissimilar general structural attributes zzso different principles on information flow zzso Common left zzso zzso structural network properties are estimated and compared for right-handed healthy human subjects and a nonhuman zzso by means of 3 different zzso magnetic resonance imaging fiber zzso zzso and a graph theory zzso In both the human and the nonhuman zzso the data support the conclusion that, in terms of the graph zzso the right zzso is significantly more efficient and interconnected than the left hemisphere, whereas the left zzso presents more central or indispensable regions for the zzso structural network than the right zzso From our point of view, in terms of functional principles, this pattern could be related with the fact that the left zzso has a leading role for highly demanding specific process, such as language and motor actions, which may require dedicated specialized networks, whereas the right zzso has a leading role for more general process, such as integration tasks, which may require a more general level of zzso
