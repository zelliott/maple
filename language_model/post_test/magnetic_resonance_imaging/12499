We hypothesized that vascular zzso contributes to chronic brain zzso therefore zzso burden measured by Pittsburgh compound B retention on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso would correlate with the extent of magnetic resonance imaging zzso white matter zzso zzso or zzso in patients with high vascular zzso deposition zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in patients with high zzso zzso deposition zzso disease zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso or in healthy elderly zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso patients, 50 HE subjects, and 43 zzso patients had brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso linear zzso was used to assess the independent association between zzso retention and white matter disease volume, controlling for age, zzso zzso E zzso and vascular risk factors within each zzso 

zzso patients were younger than HE and zzso subjects zzso zzso 10 vs zzso zzso 7 and 74 zzso zzso p zzso zzso but had higher amounts of zzso zzso zzso 21 vs zzso and zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso for both zzso Global zzso retention and zzso showed strong correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in the zzso group but not in HE or zzso These associations did not change in the zzso zzso zzso zzso count, another marker of zzso severity, also remained as an independent predictor of zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso burden in zzso subjects (with primarily vascular zzso but not zzso subjects (with primarily zzso zzso independently zzso with zzso zzso These findings support the idea that vascular zzso burden directly contributes to chronic cerebral zzso and highlights the possible utility of zzso imaging as a marker of zzso zzso
