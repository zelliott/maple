Recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso tissue zzso located in close vicinity to the zzso coronary arteries may play a role in the development of coronary artery zzso zzso has primarily been measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso or with zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to validate contrast zzso derived measures of total zzso volume by a comparison to zzso In 52 patients, aged 60 years zzso zzso Body Mass Index 28 zzso zzso and with stable zzso heart disease, paired zzso and zzso scans were zzso The optimal fit for measuring zzso using contrast zzso was developed and validated by the corresponding measures on zzso The median for zzso volume in patients was 175 zzso zzso zzso and 153 zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso and zzso zzso Four different zzso values were tested, and the smallest difference in zzso was noted when zzso to zzso zzso were used in zzso zzso The median difference between zzso and zzso for the assessment of zzso was 9 zzso zzso 50) suggesting a reasonable robust method for the assessment of zzso in a large-scale zzso zzso zzso tissue can be measured on standard coronary CT zzso images with a reasonable degree of accuracy when compared to zzso
