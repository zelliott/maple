zzso zzso fluid collection is not a single clinical entity but can be divided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment requires zzso zzso Delayed magnetic resonance zzso imaging with intravenous administration of zzso acid zzso was used to differentiate zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Timed zzso blood specimens were taken after intravenous zzso administration in patients with zzso zzso fluid collections (five zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso Delayed MR imaging was performed 1 hour after administration of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fluid and blood specimens were measured by zzso coupled plasma zzso zzso Dynamic zzso modeling was used to calculate the transfer rate constant for zzso influx into these zzso fluid zzso 

The zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were 16 zzso 6 and 79 zzso 12 zzso zzso The transfer rate zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These values were significantly higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Delayed MR imaging with zzso showed significantly higher mean enhancement of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Delayed MR imaging with zzso can differentiate zzso zzso and zzso zzso
