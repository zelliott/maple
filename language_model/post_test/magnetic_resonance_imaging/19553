This study was performed to evaluate the zzso and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast enhancement pattern of progressive massive zzso zzso in coal workers' zzso zzso zzso in 12 patients were evaluated using a zzso MR zzso zzso zzso images were obtained before and zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, zzso 10, zzso and 15 minutes after injection of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Imaging findings, the contrast enhancing pattern, enhancement time curve, and the contrast zzso equivalent zzso zzso were zzso On zzso images, 14 zzso showed high signal intensity, and four showed low signal zzso On zzso images, all zzso were of low signal intensity and were indistinguishable from zzso lung zzso After contrast infusion, all zzso except two enhanced zzso The time enhancement curve showed a zzso gradual increase in signal intensity up to 3 minutes, a subtle increase in signal intensity up to zzso minutes, and then a plateau until 15 minutes after zzso zzso zzso MR findings of zzso in coal workers' zzso include zzso high signal intensity, zzso low signal intensity, and marked zzso zzso The time enhancement curve shows a zzso gradual increase of signal intensity up to 3 minutes and plateau up to 15 zzso
