The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso of acute and chronic zzso size zzso by delayed enhancement zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso size zzso can be used as surrogate end point to reduce the sample size in studies comparing different zzso strategies in zzso zzso zzso Delayed enhancement zzso is a rather new technique, and so far zzso IS zzso has not been established zzso 

In 21 patients (10 acute zzso and 11 chronic zzso IS was assessed repeatedly on consecutive days by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed and compared by the zzso zzso 

Acute and chronic IS were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso size difference zzso between scan I and scan II was zzso zzso and limits of agreement were zzso zzso Mean bias zzso zzso and limits of agreement zzso were slightly higher for acute in comparison with chronic zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was low with a mean bias of zzso zzso zzso of agreement zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso size measurement by zzso is an excellent tool for IS assessment, zzso to its excellent zzso in chronic and acute zzso It has therefore the potential to serve as a surrogate end point to uncover advantages of new zzso zzso
