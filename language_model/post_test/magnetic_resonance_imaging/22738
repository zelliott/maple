We used straightforward linear mixed effects models as described in zzso et zzso together with recent advances in smoothing to control the degrees of freedom, and random field theory based on discrete local zzso This has been implemented in zzso a Python version of zzso Our main novelty is zzso zzso for both magnitude and delay zzso of the zzso zzso Our analysis appears to be more sensitive than that of zzso et zzso Our main findings are greater magnitude zzso zzso zzso and delay zzso zzso zzso zzso for different sentences compared to same sentences, together with a smaller but still significantly greater magnitude for different speaker compared to same speaker zzso zzso zzso
