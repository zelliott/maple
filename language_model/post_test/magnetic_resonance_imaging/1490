To determine if zzso injection of iron oxide particles improves zzso of pelvic zzso zzso at magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to determine the effect of injection site on location of zzso zzso 

In nine healthy volunteers, zzso iron oxide zzso zzso iron per zzso was injected into the anterior thigh (three subjects) or zzso (three subjects) or zzso zzso (three zzso zzso at zzso T was performed before injection and one, three, and seven days after zzso 

The mean of 30 zzso seen zzso was greater than the mean of zzso seen zzso zzso zzso zzso After thigh injection, a mean of three internal zzso 36 external zzso were zzso Compared with thigh injection, there was a higher fraction of internal zzso with zzso zzso of nine internal zzso 14 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso injection zzso of 11 internal zzso five zzso P zzso zzso More zzso were seen with zzso sequences than with other sequences zzso zzso zzso 

zzso injection of iron oxide particles increases zzso of pelvic zzso zzso zzso and zzso injection increases the number of internal pelvic zzso zzso seen compared with thigh zzso
