A new method for enhancing zzso contrast between gray matter zzso and white matter zzso in zzso surgery patients with symptomatic zzso is zzso This method uses the radiation zzso feedback interaction in zzso zzso to amplify contrast due to small differences in resonance frequency in zzso and zzso corresponding to variations in tissue zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso images of in zzso brain tissue from five patients were acquired at 14 T and compared with corresponding conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso density zzso zzso The zzso images yielded a six times better zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso on average than the best zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images zzso zzso zzso Regional analysis of the signal as a function of evolution time and initial pulse flip angle, and comparison with zzso simulations confirmed that radiation zzso was responsible for the observed signal zzso The time evolution of the signal in different tissue regions was also used to identify subtle changes in tissue composition that were not revealed in conventional MR zzso zzso contrast is compared with conventional MR methods for separating different tissue types, and its value and limitations are zzso
