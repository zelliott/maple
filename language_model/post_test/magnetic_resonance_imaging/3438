This article provides a concise review of the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for measurement of regional zzso deposition in the zzso Basic aspects of zzso and its use in lung imaging and measurement of regional ventilation are zzso Imaging of hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso zzso gases as the zzso source signals are zzso The addition of contrast agents to zzso particles in order to allow measurement of regional zzso deposition is zzso zzso in zzso human and in zzso animal model zzso of regional zzso deposition in the respiratory tract demonstrate the capability of zzso in this zzso However, as a tool for human deposition studies, current approaches require contrast agent doses that are too high to be considered competitive with traditional zzso zzso deposition measurement zzso Thus, future use of zzso in human studies of regional zzso deposition is predicated on improvement over present zzso
