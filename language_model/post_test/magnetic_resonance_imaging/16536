zzso image registration can improve the diagnostic value of imaging procedures and is an alternative to hybrid zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomical accuracy of automatic rigid image registration of independently acquired zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and abdominal magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso were performed on 28 abdominal zzso from 20 zzso The PET data were obtained using a zzso PET camera in 14 cases and a hybrid zzso scanner in 9 zzso The abdominal zzso and zzso zzso scans were acquired on zzso T zzso zzso The mean time zzso between zzso and PET was zzso days zzso zzso Automatic rigid registration was carried out using a zzso registration tool integrated into commercial available software zzso for zzso zzso zzso between the zzso of gravity of 28 manually delineated zzso zzso represented in PET and zzso were measured in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso observer zzso were zzso 

The average distance in all zzso sequences was zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso There was a significantly higher zzso in zzso zzso The zzso was not significantly different for the registration of zzso and zzso weighted sequences zzso 

The zzso between zzso and abdominal zzso registered using an automated rigid registration tool was comparable to data reported for software-based fusion between PET and zzso Although this zzso may not affect diagnostic zzso it is not sufficient to allow for zzso integration of zzso and PET zzso
