zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed by zzso imaging zzso is often highly zzso and it is therefore necessary to zzso the functional to zzso anatomical images, especially for clinical zzso This pilot study provides an evaluation of human and automatic zzso results in the human motor zzso of normal and pathological zzso Ten healthy right-handed subjects and ten right-handed patients performed simple right hand movements during zzso A reference point chosen at a characteristic anatomical location within the zzso zzso zzso was transferred to the high resolution anatomical zzso images by three human zzso experts and by three automatic zzso zzso The zzso distance between the median zzso of experts and programs was calculated and compared between patients and healthy zzso zzso show that zzso zzso on anatomical images was better with the experts than software in zzso of the cases and that software performance was worse for patients than healthy subjects zzso zzso P zzso zzso With zzso zzso the maximum disagreement between experts and software was quite zzso The zzso consistency was better for the zzso experts compared to the zzso programs zzso P zzso zzso We conclude that results of automatic zzso should be evaluated carefully, especially in case of clinical zzso
