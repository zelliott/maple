Nine different definitions of zzso zzso hearing loss zzso have been reported in zzso The objectives of this study are to: zzso compare all these definitions of zzso zzso zzso measure the agreement between these definitions in detecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso determine the strongest association between an zzso zzso definition and positive VS on magnetic resonance imaging zzso The study is a retrospective chart review in a zzso care zzso Cases were included if they were evaluated by an zzso assessment and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reported in literature were applied to request for a further zzso zzso The likelihood ratio zzso for a positive test result zzso was the highest for the Rule 3,000 zzso On comparing all the other definitions with Rule 3,000, seven of the eight existing definitions have a zzso under the clinical usefulness threshold zzso zzso zzso When zzso tests were applied, the zzso test identified Rule 3,000 with a highly significant P value zzso zzso zzso Rule 3,000, defined as zzso zzso of 15 zzso or more at the frequency 3,000 zzso could serve as a universal referral guide for further zzso zzso zzso show that Rule 3,000 is more reliable to detect VS on zzso a very simple rule that covers all the eight definitions of zzso zzso reported in zzso This would help to reduce the number of negative zzso and to save time and zzso If zzso zzso is less than 15 zzso a zzso zzso testing follow-up could be zzso
