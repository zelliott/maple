As more individuals are enrolled in clinical functional MR imaging zzso studies, an understanding of how sex may influence zzso brain zzso is zzso 

We used zzso and zzso models to study the influence of sex on zzso patterns of brain zzso during a simple zzso reaction time task in the group of 26 zzso men and zzso We evaluated the right zzso left zzso left primary zzso left supplementary zzso and left anterior zzso zzso 

Volumes of zzso did not significantly differ between the groups in any defined zzso Analysis of zzso failed to show any significant correlations between sex and volumes of brain zzso in any location zzso Mean percentage zzso changes for all locations were similar between men and zzso A zzso zzso test of brain zzso in men and women, performed as a part of zzso zzso showed no significant difference at any zzso 

Our results suggest that sex seems to have little influence on zzso brain zzso when we compared performance on the simple zzso zzso The need to control for sex effects is not critical in the analysis of this task with zzso
