The authors, with experience with more than 400 zzso zzso transplantation zzso cases since 1996, report a new technique of a retrograde zzso zzso transplantation for the treatment of isolated zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso started in zzso We treated 5 patients, 3 who presented with painful traumatic zzso defects in the central zzso portion of the zzso plateau (1 in the zzso and 2 in the lateral zzso and 2 who presented with painful zzso zzso on the zzso zzso An anterior cruciate ligament zzso drill guide positioned in the center of the zzso was used to accurately prepare the cartilage surface, in one case zzso and in 4 cases through an open zzso A zzso was introduced and drilled through the zzso and a zzso zzso equal to the diameter of the zzso was zzso An zzso cylinder was harvested from the zzso zone of the zzso zzso at the angle that corresponded to the angle on the zzso drill zzso The zzso was inserted in a retrograde fashion from the cortical window into the zzso tunnel to be flush with the zzso surface in zzso zzso The remaining tunnel zzso between the cortical window on the zzso and the zzso aspect of the zzso was filled with a zzso zzso cylinder and secured with a diagonal zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso with the zzso on the zzso zzso plateau was corrected in the same surgery using a high zzso zzso to relieve stress on the zzso Patients were followed up for 6 to 35 zzso A complete healing of the zzso was seen in control magnetic resonance images zzso All patients were satisfied with the zzso Control zzso showed the zzso zzso well integrated and flush with the zzso zzso
