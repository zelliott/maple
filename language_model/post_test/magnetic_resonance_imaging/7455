The ability to track cells and their patterns of gene expression in living organisms can increase our understanding of tissue development and zzso Gene reporters for zzso fluorescence, zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso have been described but these suffer variously from limited depth zzso spatial resolution, and zzso We describe here a gene reporter, based on the organic zzso transporting protein zzso which mediates zzso of a clinically approved, zzso zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the reporter showed readily zzso intense, and positive contrast (up to zzso signal zzso in zzso magnetic resonance images acquired in zzso The maximum signal enhancement obtained so far is more than double that produced by zzso gene reporters described zzso zzso the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso also allowed detection by zzso zzso zzso zzso thus combining the spatial resolution of zzso with the sensitivity of zzso zzso
