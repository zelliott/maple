While we occasionally observe negative zzso signals, its zzso basis has remained zzso This is in part due to the qualitative use of zzso where the baseline is zzso zzso away to reveal focal zzso of zzso Recently, however, there has been a noticeable trend towards quantitative zzso where changes in zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Freeman, zzso zzso Analysis of oxygen metabolism implies a neural origin for the negative zzso response in human visual zzso zzso used zzso zzso in conjunction with a novel stimulus paradigm to investigate the neural basis of the negative zzso signal in awake zzso They hypothesized - based on prior results - that if the baseline was lowered then zzso would have to be zzso While their main findings point to an energetic basis for the negative zzso zzso their results have far reaching implications for the present definition of baseline as well as for future research investigating the neural and/or energetic basis of zzso
