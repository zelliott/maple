zzso has been widely used to study zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso and registration errors that may affect the reliability of zzso zzso zzso zzso and registration have been demonstrated by zzso zzso before zzso zzso appears to improve registration versus the zzso Our aim was to compare the performance of zzso versus zzso and the effect of zzso in the regional analysis of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging scans were acquired from 26 patients with zzso and 28 zzso zzso zzso replaced zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso before image zzso zzso analysis was performed in zzso by using zzso and zzso with and without zzso allowing the comparison of 4 zzso methods zzso + zzso zzso - zzso zzso + zzso and zzso - zzso zzso of zzso was assessed by using zzso zzso and a simulation zzso 

Overall, zzso + zzso yielded the most accurate zzso maps among the 4 methods zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso + zzso showed significant zzso loss in the bilateral zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso versus zzso The other 3 methods overestimated the number of regions of zzso loss in zzso versus zzso zzso improved the accuracy of both zzso zzso zzso data suggested the accuracy of the results provided from patient MR imaging zzso 

We introduce a pipeline that shows promise in limiting zzso and registration errors in zzso analysis in zzso
