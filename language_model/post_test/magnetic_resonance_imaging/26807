The mechanism and zzso of zzso spinal stroke remain largely zzso because most clinical studies have included mostly patients without a systematic study of associated vascular and zzso disease of the zzso zzso zzso we assessed the zzso mechanisms and short-term outcomes of the patients with spinal stroke based on clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We studied clinical, imaging, and outcome data for 36 patients with acute spinal stroke admitted between 1998 and zzso There were 16 men and 20 women zzso age 73, range zzso zzso 

Twelve patients zzso had anterior spinal artery patterns, 8 zzso had anterior and 6 zzso had zzso unilateral zzso 5 zzso had zzso spinal artery zzso pattern, 3 zzso had central involvement, and 2 zzso had zzso zzso Twelve patients zzso had no cause of zzso Patients with central zzso and zzso zzso had a high frequency of peripheral vascular disease and prolonged zzso and one patient each had a chronic spinal zzso The onset of all other zzso was associated with mechanical triggering movements in 12 patients zzso zzso and with diseases of the spine in 19 zzso zzso with the clinical picture suggesting root involvement at the level of the spinal zzso zzso The short-term outcomes were favorable in two-thirds of patients, while zzso of them did not show any recovery on leaving the zzso 

The most common type of spinal zzso zzso is bilateral or unilateral anterior spinal artery zzso due to zzso artery disease with acute or chronic spinal disease and followed by central and zzso zzso due to extensive spinal zzso zzso and zzso
