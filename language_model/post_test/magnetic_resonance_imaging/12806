zzso and zzso are commonly used to sedate children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso zzso Research zzso zzso was created in 2003 to improve pediatric sedation process and zzso 

To use zzso records to compare the effectiveness, efficiency and adverse events of zzso vs zzso for sedation of children undergoing zzso 

zzso zzso Research zzso records of children aged 6 months to 6 years who were primarily zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso were zzso Participating zzso investigators obtained institutional review board approval before data zzso 

Of 11 zzso zzso for zzso zzso met inclusion criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso details were similar between the two zzso zzso sedation was produced in zzso of the zzso group and in zzso of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso but zzso was more likely to result in poor sedation zzso the procedure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso changes more frequently than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with prolonged recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso admission zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vomiting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and allergic complication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of airway complications was not significantly different between the zzso The median recovery time for patients receiving zzso was 30 zzso whereas for zzso it was 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Among institutions contributing data to the zzso it is found that zzso provides more efficient and effective sedation than zzso for children undergoing zzso Although zzso occurred with a greater frequency in patients who received zzso the rate of zzso and airway complications for zzso was not statistically different from that seen in patients who received zzso
