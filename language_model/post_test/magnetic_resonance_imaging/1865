Various prefrontal cortical regions have been shown to be activated during emotional zzso whereas zzso mechanisms underlying emotional processing in the prefrontal zzso remain zzso We therefore investigated the influence of the zzso zzso zzso on prefrontal cortical zzso zzso zzso pattern in a combined functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso led to the reversal in zzso zzso pattern, a shift of the early magnetic field zzso from the zzso to zzso prefrontal cortex, and zzso in zzso cortical function during negative and positive emotional zzso It is concluded that negative emotional processing in the zzso zzso may be modulated either directly or indirectly by zzso zzso Such a zzso of zzso cortical emotional function by zzso has to be distinguished from its effects on cortical motor function as being independent from the kind of processing either emotional or zzso
