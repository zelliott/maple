To evaluate zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the detection of zzso and chronic zzso zzso 

The authors performed 19 zzso MR imaging examinations at zzso T in 14 adult patients with zzso zzso zzso days after the zzso and 22 zzso examinations in 22 adult control zzso The detection of zzso and chronic zzso zzso on zzso images was compared with the detection on conventional zzso MR and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly superior to zzso imaging zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso P zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso exact zzso Although zzso imaging zzso zzso was superior in chronic zzso zzso zzso there were no statistically significant differences between zzso zzso imaging demonstrated all zzso zzso areas as zzso areas within 18 days and up to a maximum of 45 days after the zzso In a blind comparison, no zzso images acquired in control subjects were confused with those acquired in zzso 

zzso diagnostic images are superior to conventional MR or CT images in patients with zzso zzso zzso
