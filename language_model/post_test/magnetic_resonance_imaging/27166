Variation in the definition of zzso zzso on imaging and difficulties in their detection may be zzso zzso stroke zzso We assessed literature definitions of imaging zzso zzso and the definitions and detection of zzso zzso among zzso disease zzso 

We assessed definitions of imaging zzso zzso in 50 randomly selected articles from 3 zzso journals and an online survey of zzso disease zzso In the literature review, we assessed zzso definitions of zzso zzso In the survey, we assessed zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso appearance, background white matter zzso and provision of relevant zzso 

Among 50 articles, imaging definitions were varied and often zzso size was stated in 21 of 43 zzso studies of acute and in 9 of 20 zzso studies of old zzso and site in 18 zzso and 4 zzso zzso Clinical definitions also zzso and images were read mostly by zzso Among 56 survey zzso multiple descriptions were used for recent and old, symptomatic and zzso zzso on zzso Most agreed on definitions for site zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were usually identified as zzso zzso with increasing white matter zzso however, zzso zzso were very unlikely to be identified, even with prior imaging available zzso 

Imaging definitions of zzso zzso vary widely, in part due to variation in zzso detection and zzso A consensus for imaging definitions of zzso disease features would be zzso
