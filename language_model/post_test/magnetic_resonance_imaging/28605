We describe a method for reconstructing the three-dimensional motion and deformation of the zzso surface of the right zzso free wall zzso using magnetic resonance tissue zzso zzso points were defined where the tag stripes intersected the zzso zzso and were tracked through zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso model of the zzso surface of the zzso was constructed to fit the zzso shape at end zzso The model was then zzso to each subsequent frame by fitting the tag zzso and zzso zzso zzso The method was applied to two human studies, a normal subject and a patient with right zzso zzso The root mean squared error between model tag planes and tracked tag points was zzso zzso for the normal heart zzso points) and zzso zzso for the zzso heart zzso points), both less than the image zzso size of approximately zzso zzso The differences in contraction patterns were zzso between the two zzso We conclude that this method allows accurate, zzso measurement of in zzso zzso zzso
