Whereas a number of studies suggest that the zzso zzso is not associated with disease zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso results with regard to disease severity, however, are zzso Some studies suggest an zzso role of the zzso zzso This study was performed to assess the association of the zzso zzso with both disease zzso and disease course in a large group of zzso patients using clinical and zzso zzso In addition the data were combined with available data from the zzso 

In a group of zzso patients with clinically zzso zzso zzso distribution was compared with that of 144 healthy zzso Combined analysis of published data on the association of zzso zzso with zzso was zzso zzso and clinical findings were recorded and related to the zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso findings were available and related to the zzso zzso 

No significant differences were found in the distribution of zzso between zzso patients and zzso Combined analysis of published data showed a slightly increased zzso for zzso in zzso Disease characteristics (including age at onset and onset zzso disease severity zzso index, time to reach zzso 6) and zzso findings zzso volumes and zzso zzso were not associated with zzso o zzso or zzso 

In this cohort no association of the zzso zzso with disease zzso nor clinical and zzso measures could be zzso However, combined analysis of published data could not definitely exclude the possibility of a minor role for zzso in zzso
