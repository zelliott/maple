To evaluate whether repetitive exposure to magnetic fields of zzso zzso and zzso T affect the growth of human fetal lung zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were exposed to zzso magnetic fields of zzso zzso and zzso T for 1 zzso for 5 consecutive zzso Control groups were kept under identical environmental conditions, apart from the magnetic field, during the zzso Cell cycle analysis for zzso and zzso growing cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso To rule out midterm effects, proliferation zzso of the cells were analyzed for 21 zzso 

Cell cycle analysis of synchronized and zzso cells did not reveal statistically significant differences between the exposed and control zzso The zzso did not indicate any growth zzso during zzso zzso zzso did not provide any hint of midterm growth zzso effects of repetitive magnetic field zzso 

zzso magnetic field exposure does not exert any zzso effect on overall cell growth and cell cycle distribution of cultured zzso zzso effects due to magnetic field exposure were not zzso
