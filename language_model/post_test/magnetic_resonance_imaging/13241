The standard model of zzso consolidation zzso that the zzso is part of a retrieval network for recent zzso According to this theory, the memories are gradually transferred to zzso circuits with consolidation, where the connections within this circuit grow stronger and reorganized so that redundant and/or contextual details may be zzso Thus, remote memories are based on zzso networks and can be retrieved independently of the zzso To test this model, we measured regional brain activity and connectivity during retrieval with functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso were trained on two sets of zzso association and were tested with two different delays, 15 zzso and 24 h including a whole night of zzso We hypothesized that memory traces of the locations associated with specific faces will be linked through the zzso for the retrieval of recently learned association, but with consolidation, the activity and the functional connectivity between the zzso areas will zzso We show that zzso zzso activity related to zzso retrieval decreased and zzso activity increased with zzso Moreover, the connectivity between the zzso and the zzso regions decreased and in turn, zzso connectivity between the zzso areas zzso The results provide zzso support for a zzso process of the zzso memory system, involving initial representation of new associations in a network including the zzso and subsequent consolidation into a predominantly zzso zzso
