zzso studies show pathological changes in the zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso Here, we examine the surface of the zzso in zzso and assess whether changes of the surface are associated with impaired cognitive zzso The shape of the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso was compared between 35 zzso patients and 35 individuals without cognitive zzso The zzso was automatically segmented from zzso zzso magnetic resonance images and automatic shape modeling tools zzso zzso zzso were applied for zzso zzso zzso zzso tests were used to identify locations of consistent shape zzso of the zzso surface in zzso Linear zzso models, corrected for age, zzso educational level, head size, and total brain zzso volume were used to assess the relation between cognitive performance and local surface zzso In zzso patients, differences of shape were observed on the zzso head of the zzso nucleus and on the zzso lateral zzso but not on the zzso The head of the zzso nucleus and zzso lateral zzso are characterized by extensive connections with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of cognitive impairment was associated with the degree of zzso of the surfaces of the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso lateral zzso These findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that in zzso primarily zzso and zzso cerebral networks are zzso
