To evaluate the image quality of segmented echo zzso zzso with inversion recovery zzso preparation zzso to depict the anatomy and zzso changes involving the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence was performed on 30 healthy volunteers and 20 zzso zzso techniques were used to generate images of zzso zzso and the images acquired were zzso evaluated by two experienced zzso based on grading of the zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso and nerve soft tissue zzso zzso were calculated and the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were compared with the STIR zzso zzso 

Although zzso had more zzso artifacts than STIR zzso excellent general image appearance with minor blurring can be achieved with zzso In all healthy volunteers the means of zzso were significantly greater for zzso than for zzso while the means of zzso were significantly lower for zzso than for zzso 

In the present study the zzso sequence obtained uniform fat suppression and zzso zzso images of zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso sequence may provide high zzso in evaluating zzso zzso
