To determine whether zzso of brain structure in normal aged individuals zzso the development of mild cognitive impairment zzso or zzso disease zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso demonstrate cortical volume losses vs zzso aged individuals, particularly in the zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso It is unknown whether these losses or other zzso changes are present, and to what degree, in cognitively normal individuals before the clinical diagnosis of zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on a zzso of 136 zzso examined normal aged zzso All subjects were cognitively normal at the time of their zzso but 23 later developed zzso and 9 of these 23 went on to an zzso zzso zzso volumes from zzso zzso analysis were combined with clinical data to compare the 23 subjects who eventually developed zzso to 113 subjects who remained cognitively normal over an average follow-up of zzso zzso 

zzso normal subjects who eventually developed zzso demonstrated decreased gray matter volumes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and left angular zzso while still cognitively zzso 

zzso brain changes in zzso areas involved in higher cognitive processes zzso clinical signs and symptoms in zzso followed normal subjects destined to develop mild cognitive zzso
