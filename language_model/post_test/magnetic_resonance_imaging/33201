The development of zzso spin labeling methods has allowed measuring regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso and to show the pattern of cerebral activity associated with any state such as a sustained pain state or changes due to a zzso zzso 

The authors studied the differential effects of three pain conditions in 10 healthy subjects on a 3 zzso scanner during resting zzso heat, cold, and zzso pain using continuous zzso spin zzso 

Cold pain showed the greatest absolute zzso increases in left anterior zzso cortex, left amygdala, left angular zzso and zzso area 6, and a significant zzso decrease in the zzso Changes in zzso were characteristic of the type of pain zzso cold and heat pain showed increases, whereas the zzso condition showed a reduction in mean absolute gray matter flow compared with zzso An association of subjects' pain tolerance and cerebral blood flow was zzso 

The observation that quantitative zzso changes are characteristic of the pain task used and that there is a consistent zzso change in zzso area 6, an area responsible for the integration of a motor response to pain, should provide extremely useful information in the quest to develop an imaging zzso of zzso zzso response in zzso may serve as an objective measure of zzso zzso
