To evaluate the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in target volume zzso for zzso and to determine the zzso zzso 

Two independent observers performed treatment planning in 10 patients according to a prospective written zzso In the first step, they used zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso In the second step, zzso was added to zzso zzso fusion based on mutual zzso 

The correlation between gross tumor volume zzso delineated by the two observers based on zzso was zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso were zzso The number of patients with agreement in more then zzso of the outlined volume increased with the availability of zzso from 1 in 10 to 5 in zzso The median volume of intersection between the regions delineated by two observers increased significantly from zzso (from the composite zzso to zzso by the addition of zzso zzso The information of zzso was useful to delineate zzso in the area of cavernous zzso orbit, and base of the zzso 

The zzso findings of potential normal tissue sparing and reduced zzso zzso provide arguments for invasive studies of the correlation between zzso images and zzso tumor extension and for prospective trials of target volume zzso with zzso image zzso
