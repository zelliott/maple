zzso of experimental stroke research into the clinical setting is often zzso Novel approaches are therefore zzso As humans, pet dogs suffer from spontaneous zzso stroke and may hence offer new ways of studying genuine stroke injury zzso 

The objective of this study was to compare clinical symptoms and zzso topography of naturally occurring zzso stroke in pet dogs with human zzso zzso 

Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of 27 dogs with spontaneous zzso stroke were zzso investigated with respect to clinical symptoms and zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics were compared with zzso 

zzso per cent were diagnosed with middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Motor dysfunction or zzso dysfunction was reported in zzso including specific signs of zzso motor dysfunction in 11 of 27 zzso zzso were reported in 15 of 27 cases zzso 

zzso occurring zzso stroke in dogs share characteristics with human zzso stroke in terms of clinical symptoms and zzso zzso zzso pet dogs with spontaneous zzso stroke may provide an alternative approach to the research of stroke injury mechanisms as they occur naturally, and should be further zzso
