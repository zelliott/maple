The purpose of the study was to investigate the ability to predict survival, need for zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso of chronic lung disease in patients with zzso zzso zzso in the context of a zzso into three different times of gestation zzso 28, zzso and zzso 32 weeks) by assessing the ratio between observed and expected zzso fetal lung zzso 

The data analysis included 226 fetuses with zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed at different times of gestation with a zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to investigate the zzso value of assessment of the ratio between observed and expected zzso fetal lung volumes at different stages of fetal zzso 

For all reviewed times of zzso the ratio between observed and expected zzso fetal lung volumes had almost equivalent statistically significant differences for zzso survival zzso zzso zzso need for zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso and development of chronic lung disease zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso accuracy for early and for medium and late times in gestation also were zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis showed the highest area under the curve zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso hernia, the relation between observed and expected zzso fetal lung volume is a valuable zzso zzso for predicting zzso zzso morbidity represented by the development of chronic lung disease, and the need for zzso therapy in early gestation zzso 28 weeks) as well as later gestation with no statistically significant zzso
