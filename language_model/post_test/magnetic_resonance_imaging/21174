The aim of this study was to investigate if brain zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso patients during the disease onset predicts long term zzso 

zzso patients with follow-up time of at least 7 years from disease onset and with baseline and second magnetic resonance 12 months later were included to measure brain zzso Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in three groups, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and used as disability zzso 

Twenty-six patients were zzso Mean zzso during the first year in patients that reached an zzso was zzso zzso in patients with an zzso between 1 and zzso was zzso while in patients with an zzso of 0 it was zzso zzso 

Brain zzso rates during the first year of disease were zzso of disease progression in our zzso
