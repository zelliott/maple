The purpose of this study was to compare the patient tolerance and zzso as magnetic resonance imaging negative oral contrast agents, of a mixture of clay compound zzso and low density zzso zzso suspension with that of higher density zzso zzso Twenty patients were zzso into two groups: 10 patients receiving a mixture of low concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and 10 patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images zzso were obtained on a zzso zzso Two independent readers scored the overall zzso signal intensity and zzso of the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent zzso Patient acceptance was evaluated via a short zzso by recording spontaneous comments and documenting the quantity of contrast agent zzso There was greater zzso zzso signal reduction and organ zzso with zzso zzso zzso than with the zzso mixture on both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With both agents there was greater signal reduction on zzso zzso than zzso zzso Higher scores for organ zzso for both contrast agents were seen with zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso there was significantly better zzso of the pancreatic body zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic tail zzso zzso zzso on zzso compared with zzso zzso With the zzso mixture, zzso zzso showed improved zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the volume of contrast zzso in the two zzso zzso zzso were recorded for one patient in each zzso These results suggest that zzso mixture, although useful as a negative zzso contrast agent, is not as effective as zzso zzso zzso Further studies with a larger patient population and concentration zzso studies are zzso
