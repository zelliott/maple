To investigate the impact of variations in zzso pelvic dimensions observed from zzso magnetic resonance imaging on operative time, zzso blood loss, and surgical margin status on performing open radical zzso zzso 

A prospective study was undertaken in which zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 190 patients who were diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer before radical zzso zzso Using the magnetic resonance image findings, various zzso pelvic dimensions were zzso The associations of the measured pelvic dimensions and various zzso factors with the operative time, estimated blood loss, and surgical margin status were analyzed on zzso zzso 

For operative time, none of the individual pelvic dimensions measured demonstrated significant associations on zzso zzso In contrast, only the newly developed zzso the pelvic dimension index, approached significance zzso zzso zzso Only body mass index zzso proved to be independently associated with the operative time on zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso Also, only the prostate volume zzso zzso zzso was independently associated with the estimated blood zzso For the surgical margin status, the zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso along with the pelvic dimension index zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significant associations on zzso zzso However, only the zzso level zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso approached significance on zzso zzso 

Our results have demonstrated that variations in the zzso pelvic dimensions might have some impact, but not significantly so, on open radical zzso zzso compared with other zzso baseline factors such as the zzso or prostate zzso
