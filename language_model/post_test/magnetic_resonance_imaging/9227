We evaluated the effects of partly substituting zzso with marine zzso fatty acids zzso on body composition and weight, zzso tissue distribution and gene expression in five zzso zzso of male zzso rats fed a high-fat zzso zzso were fed diets including zzso zzso % zzso or zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso % zzso for 7 zzso Feed consumption and weight gain were similar, whereas plasma zzso zzso were lower in the zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed smaller visceral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso animals zzso 44 and 32 % zzso zzso zzso zzso feeding increased zzso expression of zzso as well as zzso in several zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rats, and zzso plasma insulin levels were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was increased in the visceral zzso zzso whereas zzso was reduced in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was almost doubled in the zzso depot and zzso zzso analyses showed similar body fat zzso in the two feeding groups, indicating that zzso zzso feeding led to zzso of fat away from the visceral zzso
