The measurement error for right zzso zzso size and function assessed by cardiac zzso zzso in zzso heart disease has not been fully zzso As zzso parameters are being increasingly zzso to make clinical decisions, defining error in the clinical setting is zzso 

This investigation examines the zzso of zzso for RV size and zzso 

Forty consecutive people with zzso heart disease involving the RV were zzso zzso zzso of RV volumes was performed by two expert zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were multiplied by the mean value for each group studied to define a threshold beyond which measurement error was unlikely to be zzso 

The zzso for zzso RV zzso volume zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso which yielded threshold values of zzso and zzso zzso For RV ejection fraction zzso the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso comparisons were zzso and zzso which resulted in threshold values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The threshold values generated can be used during serial assessment of RV size and zzso
