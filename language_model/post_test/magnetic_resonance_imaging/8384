The cellular zzso processes behind cognitive development during childhood, including the development of working memory capacity, are still zzso By using the most standard zzso model of zzso working memory, we investigated the consequences of cellular zzso zzso including zzso synaptic zzso and synaptic zzso on working zzso brain activity and zzso We implemented five structural zzso changes occurring as a result of the cellular zzso processes in the zzso based zzso network zzso The zzso changes in memory activity predicted from the simulations of the model were then compared to brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging in children and zzso We found that networks with stronger zzso synaptic connectivity between cells coding for similar zzso but not those with faster zzso stronger connectivity within a region, or increased coding zzso predict measured zzso increases in both working zzso brain activity and in correlations of activity between zzso zzso zzso synaptic connectivity between cells coding for similar stimuli was thus the only zzso process that accounted for the observed changes in brain activity associated with development of working memory during zzso
