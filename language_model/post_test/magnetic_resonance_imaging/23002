The purpose of this study was to determine whether the degree of anterior compartment zzso and zzso compartment zzso zzso are zzso and whether 2 anterior compartment elements zzso and zzso are related at zzso zzso 

Women with a complete spectrum of pelvic support were recruited for a pelvic support zzso Dynamic magnetic resonance scans were taken during zzso A convenience sample of 153 women with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso zzso years with a zzso in zzso was zzso zzso compartment status was assessed by the most zzso zzso point and the internal urinary zzso The external cervical zzso was used to assess the zzso zzso The position of the zzso zzso and zzso were determined in 20 zzso women to determine their reference zzso The distances of each structure below the reference positions were calculated at maximum zzso 

Average distances of the zzso base, zzso and zzso from the reference positions at zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso of the relationship between the zzso base and zzso distances was r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso of the zzso distance and zzso distance was r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Half of the observed variation in anterior compartment support may be explained by zzso zzso
