How do animals distinguish between sensations coming from external sources and those resulting from their own zzso A zzso discharge system has evolved that involves the transmission of a copy of motor commands to sensory cortex, where the expected sensation is zzso Through this zzso sensations are zzso as coming from self, and responsiveness to them is zzso The present study investigated whether neural phase zzso between motor command and auditory cortical areas is related to the suppression of the auditory cortical zzso We recorded zzso from the human brain during a zzso zzso zzso phase zzso between zzso area and auditory zzso in the gamma band (35 to zzso zzso in the zzso time window preceding speech onset was greater during zzso than during listening to a playback of the same spoken zzso Because zzso neural zzso was correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with the subsequent suppression of the auditory cortical response to the spoken sound, we zzso that phase zzso in the gamma band between zzso area and auditory zzso is the neural zzso of the transmission of a copy of motor zzso We suggest that neural phase zzso of gamma zzso may contribute to transmission of zzso zzso in zzso
