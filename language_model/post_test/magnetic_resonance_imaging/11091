zzso in diagnostic criteria and methods have led to mixed results regarding the zzso pattern of zzso brain injury in relation to zzso zzso zzso a zzso MRS consortium was formed to evaluate the zzso in zzso patients with or without cognitive zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso at zzso time (30 zzso was assessed in the frontal white matter, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 100 zzso patients zzso with AIDS zzso complex zzso and 39 zzso zzso and 37 zzso zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso zzso had higher zzso marker zzso ratio zzso in the white matter zzso zzso adjusted zzso while zzso showed further increased zzso in the white matter and zzso zzso (both zzso and increased zzso compounds zzso in white matter zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso showed a reduction in the zzso marker zzso compound zzso in the frontal white matter zzso zzso but not zzso viral load correlated with zzso and zzso in white matter and zzso in zzso zzso zzso infection and aging had additive effects on zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and white zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso occurs during the zzso stages of zzso infection, whereas further inflammatory activity in the zzso zzso and zzso injury in the white matter is associated with the development of cognitive zzso Aging may further exacerbate brain zzso associated with inflammation in zzso patient and thereby increase the risk for cognitive zzso
