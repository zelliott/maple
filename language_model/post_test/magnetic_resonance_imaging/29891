To investigate whether dynamic and delayed magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso contrast agent, has potential for the differential diagnosis of experimental zzso zzso 

Twelve male rats received zzso solution as drinking water to induce zzso zzso After injection of zzso rats were subjected to dynamic and delayed zzso The relative enhancement zzso was zzso and the time of the maximum zzso zzso was zzso After zzso liver was zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso in diameter were induced after 18 weeks of treatment with zzso zzso of zzso and 81 of them were zzso The zzso in zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in moderately or poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso in the late phase, whereas there was no significant difference in zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The average zzso in zzso was about 13 minutes, whereas that of each differentiated zzso was about 1 zzso 

It was possible to differentiate benign zzso and zzso zzso (especially zzso zzso by evaluating the change of zzso or comparison of zzso with zzso zzso
