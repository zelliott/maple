zzso tumor of the zzso is rare, and there are few reports that described its CT or magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso We describe the characteristic CT and zzso findings in four cases of zzso tumor of the zzso 

zzso and zzso features were analyzed in four zzso All patients underwent zzso dynamic CT and zzso 

The tumor size in the four cases ranged zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected in one zzso On zzso dynamic CT, the peak enhancement of the tumors was seen at the zzso dominant phase in three zzso the remaining one was at the portal zzso phase with prolonged zzso zzso The tumors showed low to high signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso of the main pancreatic ducts zzso zzso to the tumors was seen in three cases, in which tumor invasion into the zzso was zzso zzso Furthermore, the tumors having mild to severe zzso zzso invaded into the zzso zzso or zzso 

It would be characteristic of zzso tumor of the zzso to be well enhanced at the zzso dominant phase on dynamic CT, and to highly invade into the zzso and the zzso zzso or zzso
