External zzso drainage zzso of zzso is a test to determine the suitability of a shunt for patients with normal pressure zzso zzso but its effect on zzso volume is not zzso This study investigates the effect of zzso zzso of 500 zzso on zzso size and clinical features in patients with idiopathic zzso 

Fifteen patients were investigated in a zzso zzso scanner before and after zzso zzso volume was measured zzso Clinical features involved motor and cognitive functions, testing primarily gait and zzso Reduction in zzso volume was correlated to total drain volume and clinical zzso zzso tests were zzso and p zzso zzso was required for zzso 

Drain volume was 415 zzso zzso 470 zzso range zzso zzso zzso size was reduced in all patients, averaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso which corresponded to a zzso zzso The ratio of volume contraction to drain volume was only zzso Seven patients improved in gait and 6 in zzso zzso reduction and total drain volume correlated neither with improvement nor with each zzso The 7 patients with the largest drain volumes (close to 500 zzso had zzso changes varying from zzso to zzso zzso 

Clinical improvement occurs in patients with zzso after zzso despite zzso zzso suggesting that zzso size is of little relevance for zzso improvement or determining shunt zzso The clinical effect provided by zzso mimicking zzso is probably related to the recurring zzso zzso rather than to the cumulative effect of the drainage on zzso zzso
