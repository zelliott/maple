The goal of this study was to define treatment results of repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso obliteration and zzso 

The authors analyzed their experience with repeated zzso zzso performed in 41 patients for whom follow-up review lasted at least 2 zzso The median duration of follow up was 34 months zzso zzso zzso after repeated zzso in this zzso The residual zzso was located within the area of focus (in zzso of the initial zzso in 28 patients zzso zzso doses to the margin varied from zzso to 20 zzso zzso 18 zzso During repeated treatment the dose to the margin varied from zzso to 20 zzso zzso 17 zzso and the retreated volumes ranged from zzso to 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed at least 2 years zzso revealed complete zzso obliteration in 21 zzso of 30 zzso The estimated overall zzso obliteration rate, based on findings on magnetic resonance imaging zzso of 11 zzso and zzso (29 of 41 zzso was zzso zzso rates correlated with margin doses zzso zzso zzso with a trend toward higher rates in cases with zzso zzso persistence zzso zzso zzso The zzso curve for zzso zzso obliteration was not significantly different from that of the initial zzso In two patients zzso zzso zzso zzso developed within zzso risk years after repeated zzso zzso per patient zzso zzso symptomatic adverse radiation effects developed in two zzso of 41 patients following repeated zzso zzso imaging changes were identified in 11 zzso of 41 patients, which correlated with a zzso volume from repeated surgery zzso zzso zzso 

When necessary, repeated zzso zzso achieves obliteration with an acceptable zzso Despite the effects of previous zzso repeated zzso required similar or slightly higher radiation doses to achieve the same zzso obliteration rates as those needed to zzso an zzso that had not been treated by radiation zzso
