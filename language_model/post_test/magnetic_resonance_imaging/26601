This work addresses the choice of imaging flip angle in blood zzso level dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso When noise of zzso origin becomes the dominant noise source in zzso zzso it causes a zzso dependence of the zzso zzso ratio zzso versus zzso ratio zzso that can be exploited to perform zzso zzso at angles well below the Ernst angle without any zzso effect on our ability to detect sites of zzso zzso We show, both zzso and zzso that for situations where available zzso is high and zzso noise dominates over zzso noise, although zzso still reaches it maximum for the Ernst angle, reduction of imaging flip angle well below this angle results in negligible loss in zzso Moreover, we provide a way to zzso a suggested imaging flip angle, which constitutes a conservative estimate of the minimum flip angle that can be used under given experimental zzso and zzso noise zzso For our experimental conditions, this suggested angle equals zzso for the zzso matter zzso while the Ernst zzso Finally, using data from eight subjects with a combined zzso task we show that imaging at angles as low as zzso introduces no significant differences in observed zzso response zzso zzso ratio, zzso effect size or statistical maps of zzso as compared to imaging at zzso (an angle close to the Ernst zzso These results suggest that using low flip angles in zzso zzso zzso to obtain benefits such as zzso reduction of zzso power, zzso limitation of apparent zzso inflow effects, zzso reduction of zzso motion artifacts, zzso lower levels of zzso noise, and zzso improved tissue contrast is feasible when zzso noise dominates and zzso is zzso
