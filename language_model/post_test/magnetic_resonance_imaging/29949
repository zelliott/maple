We present a series of eight patients undergoing zzso neural zzso and stabilization of the zzso spine via a single zzso zzso approach, with complete zzso for a variety of zzso Four had primary zzso two secondary zzso one patient had tuberculosis and one had delayed zzso due to zzso This single zzso approach is made possible via the use of an zzso cage that may be expanded in zzso to offer anterior and middle column zzso There were no major neurological complications and all patients with deficits improved zzso zzso zzso fixation was avoided with five patients undergoing a one zzso below fixation and three undergoing a two zzso below zzso When combined with zzso screw and rod fixation this anterior reconstruction makes a sound zzso The flexibility of this approach in the zzso spine, some of the zzso advantages and pitfalls are zzso
