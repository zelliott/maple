The purpose of the study was to zzso compare technique effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso versus magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

In 35 consecutive patients 53 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso procedures were performed in the treatment of 56 zzso 29; zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso procedure was performed at a zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso Assessment of treatment response was based on dynamic MR imaging at zzso The mean follow-up was zzso zzso zzso technique effectiveness was assessed 4 months after zzso zzso Secondary technique effectiveness was assessed 4 months after a zzso second zzso zzso zzso and secondary technique effectiveness of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was compared by using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso technique effectiveness after a single session was achieved in zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Secondary technique effectiveness was achieved in zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A local tumor progression was detected in zzso zzso tumors after initial technique zzso Major complications were detected after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso are locally effective therapies in the treatment of zzso Due to a higher rate of primary technique effectiveness zzso zzso zzso may reduce the number of required sessions for complete tumor zzso
