To investigate the relationship of zzso and the serum zzso oxide zzso zzso and nitrate zzso to disease activity and progression in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso 

The study was divided into zzso and zzso In the zzso study, 20 patients with zzso zzso 21 with secondary progressive zzso and 10 with primary progressive zzso zzso and 14 control subjects were zzso Patients were assessed on clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Index zzso zzso Peg Test zzso and zzso zzso In the follow-up study, 34 zzso patients from the zzso study agreed to be assessed again after an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured using a zzso zzso 

In the zzso study, zzso zzso was raised in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso Higher zzso zzso levels were found in patients with mild disability zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso vs patients with advanced disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso of patients having zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation between the volume of enhancement and zzso zzso was found zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In the follow-up study, patients with disability progression had higher baseline zzso zzso levels than those who were stable on zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation was found between baseline zzso zzso and the change in MR zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and nitrate levels were increased in mildly disabled patients with zzso and found to correlate with the volume of zzso zzso on zzso Raised baseline zzso zzso was associated with clinical and zzso progression in zzso patients over zzso zzso
