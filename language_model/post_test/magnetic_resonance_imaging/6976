Multiple sclerosis zzso is believed to be an zzso disease of the human central nervous system zzso by zzso T zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be effective in reducing disease activity defined by clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso criteria in zzso zzso zzso Yet, the exact mechanisms by which these benefits are achieved remain zzso zzso is a marker for zzso T zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed on resting zzso 

Forty-eight patients with zzso 24 of them treated with zzso zzso and 24 zzso were enrolled in this prospective study over 18 zzso We investigated the percentage of zzso zzso cells within the total zzso subset in the peripheral blood serially every 3 months and in zzso once at zzso zzso clinical examination including Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score was performed every 3 months and zzso zzso scans were assessed every 6 zzso 

We found a temporary increase in the zzso zzso zzso ratio in peripheral blood of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we determined a significant negative correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso between age as well as the zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the percentages of zzso zzso zzso in peripheral blood but a positive correlation between zzso score and the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso at zzso 

zzso zzso zzso ratio in peripheral blood might indicate zzso in zzso However, from our data it cannot be finally concluded whether it is also influenced by zzso zzso
