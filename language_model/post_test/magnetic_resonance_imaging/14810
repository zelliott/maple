In this study we established a bipedal animal model of zzso hip joint collapse in zzso for testing potential treatment protocols to be developed for prevention of zzso joint collapse in zzso zzso Five adult male zzso were treated with a zzso zzso zzso induction protocol using combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional three zzso were used as normal zzso zzso zzso gait was observed, magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed, and blood was collected for routine examination, including testing blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso were sacrificed at week 24 zzso bilateral zzso were collected for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso limping gait and abnormal zzso signals were found in zzso zzso zzso was found in all zzso with a joint collapse zzso of zzso The percentage of zzso zzso zzso and parameters on zzso metabolism significantly increased after zzso zzso revealed structure deterioration of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed larger fat cell fraction and size, thinning of zzso plate and cartilage layer, smaller zzso perimeter percentage and less blood vessels distributed at collapsed region in zzso group as compared with the normal zzso zzso electron microscope zzso showed poor mineral zzso and more zzso outline in the collapsed region in zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso developed in the current study was safe and effective to induce zzso and deterioration of zzso bone in bipedal zzso with subsequent zzso head collapse, a typical clinical feature observed in patients under zzso steroid zzso In conclusion, bipedal zzso could be used as an effective zzso experimental model to evaluate potential treatment protocols to be developed for prevention of zzso hip joint collapse in zzso
