The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso MR zzso in evaluating zzso changes and pancreatic function after zzso 

Twenty patients who underwent zzso were evaluated with zzso MR zzso zzso fast zzso zzso dynamic MR zzso were obtained before and every minute for 10 zzso after zzso zzso Image analysis included image quality for the zzso of the pancreatic duct and zzso features of the pancreatic duct zzso zzso zzso zzso irregular zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso function was assessed using the Van de zzso method and the zzso blood zzso and oral zzso tolerance zzso zzso filling was graded from the lowest amount of filling zzso 1) to normal filling zzso 3) on the last MR zzso 

The zzso of the main pancreatic duct was significantly improved with dynamic MR zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso site was zzso in 14 patients zzso on MR zzso after zzso administration zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant improvement in other zzso data was seen after zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of reduced zzso filling zzso 1) for assessment of reduced pancreatic zzso function were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The relation between reduced zzso filling zzso 1) and diabetes was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

The administration of zzso improves zzso of the pancreatic ducts and helps in the evaluation of remnant pancreatic function after zzso
