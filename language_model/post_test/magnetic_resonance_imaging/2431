It is generally considered that mass effect caused by zzso zzso zzso is evidence of zzso In the present study, the zzso of mass effect in clinically zzso zzso was zzso and the underlying zzso factors and zzso mechanisms were zzso 

zzso patients with clinically zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The majority were suffering from zzso and frontal lobe involvement was revealed in approximately half of the zzso zzso studies, zzso zzso scans, and magnetic resonance images were obtained for all zzso zzso patients underwent removal of zzso In 10 of the surgically treated patients, zzso vascular pressure zzso were obtained before removal of the zzso 

Mass effect was detected in 12 zzso of the 27 zzso zzso zzso obliteration zzso zzso and lateral zzso displacement zzso zzso were frequently zzso The volume of zzso was significantly larger in patients with mass effect than in those without mass effect zzso zzso zzso Large zzso zzso zzso or zzso veins were observed to be associated with mass effect zzso zzso zzso In only one patient was gross displacement related to a surrounding massive brain zzso zzso vein pressure in patients with mass effect was significantly elevated as compared to the average value in patients without mass effect zzso zzso 5 versus 12 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that mass effect is not zzso in clinically zzso zzso Furthermore, multiple zzso factors were zzso including the large size of zzso marked draining vein zzso and brain zzso around the zzso zzso also indicated that a zzso high pressure in the zzso drainage system may contribute to mass zzso
