zzso resonance imaging and computer image analysis in human clinical studies effectively identify abnormal zzso in disease zzso As more mouse models of neurological disorders are discovered, such an approach may prove useful for zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a similar strategy for mouse zzso studies by zzso mice with the zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging for increased zzso we zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice and made an zzso zzso of the structures in 15 individual zzso We then performed computer automated volume zzso on the zzso We found a reduced zzso volume in the zzso zzso which was expected, but we also found a new zzso in the inferior zzso and the zzso zzso zzso local zzso revealed additional zzso abnormalities in the zzso zzso This demonstrates the utility of anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and zzso image analysis for detecting abnormal zzso in zzso zzso
