The purpose of this article is to update the zzso community on the expanding field of surgical zzso and to present the design of a novel zzso zzso It is intended to mimic standard technique and deploy conventional zzso zzso The intention is to ease its integration into the zzso zzso of both the traditional operating room and zzso 

To permit benefit from updated zzso imaging, magnetic resonance zzso materials were incorporated into the zzso Advanced zzso zzso and auditory communication with the surgical site recreate the sight, sound, and feel of zzso 

zzso and advanced imaging have pushed surgeons to the limit of their zzso and zzso zzso in contrast, are indefatigable and have superior spatial resolution and geometric zzso The use of zzso filters and motion zzso permits procedures requiring superior zzso 

zzso testing of the zzso components has shown spatial resolution of 30 zzso greatly exceeding our zzso zzso will not only be able to perform current procedures with a higher margin of safety but also must speculate on techniques that have zzso not even been zzso This includes zzso the robot to intelligent tools that interrogate tissue before its manipulation and the potential of molecular imaging to transform zzso research into surgical exploration of the cell, not the zzso
