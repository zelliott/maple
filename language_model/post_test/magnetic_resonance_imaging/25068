To prove feasibility of zzso chemical shift imaging zzso zzso during zzso zzso authors performed zzso zzso in combination with a zzso zzso and selected targets according to local zzso information, evaluated the zzso zzso The zzso zzso directed zzso biopsy was performed in four zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso were performed simultaneously after the fitting of a zzso zzso zzso areas of increased zzso and zzso ratios were selected as target sites in the zzso MR zzso zzso zzso is possible with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso samples taken from areas of increased zzso ratios and decreased zzso ratios provided information upon increased zzso zzso and cellular zzso and facilitated zzso zzso samples taken from areas of increased zzso ratio showed zzso feature of zzso zzso zzso was feasible with the zzso zzso in zzso The final zzso results obtained were zzso with the local zzso information from zzso zzso We believe that zzso zzso zzso biopsy has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of zzso biopsy zzso
