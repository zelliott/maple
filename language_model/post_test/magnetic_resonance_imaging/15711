zzso detection nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study fluid flow and zzso in a porous medium from a purely zzso point of view zzso in a laboratory frame of zzso Information about fluid displacement is obtained on a zzso scale in a long-time regime, while local zzso zzso are averaged zzso It is shown how these experiments can be described using the common flow zzso zzso and how experimental data can be analyzed to obtain effective zzso flow zzso inside the porous zzso fluid zzso and flow tracing of zzso
