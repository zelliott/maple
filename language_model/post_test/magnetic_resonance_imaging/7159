The biological and physical properties of zzso and zzso make them attractive candidates as special purpose zzso contrast agents which could be used to study the zzso compartment or specific targets in zzso In this study, zzso complexes were prepared by reduction and zzso of the zzso bonds of the protein and characterized by electron spin resonance and ultraviolet zzso zzso An average of six zzso were bound zzso to each zzso of human serum zzso The water zzso zzso of the zzso zzso (at 20 zzso and 37 degrees zzso was zzso greater than that of the free zzso The zzso of the zzso complexes by cells or by zzso decreased the zzso of the zzso zzso The rate of reduction of zzso zzso by cells was much slower than that of the free zzso but still was zzso zzso increase in the rate of reduction in the absence of zzso
