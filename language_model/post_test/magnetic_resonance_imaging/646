Combined zzso has recently been used to explore the zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso This study examines whether zzso of the form of the zzso response function zzso results in significant zzso responses being missed in the statistical zzso zzso data from 31 patients with focal zzso were zzso with four zzso zzso from 3 to 9 zzso after each zzso event, in addition to a standard zzso that peaked after zzso zzso In four patients, zzso responses were correlated with zzso MR zzso and with zzso data from zzso zzso In an attempt to understand the absence of zzso responses in a significant group of patients, the degree of signal loss occurring as a result of magnetic field zzso was compared with the detected zzso responses in ten patients with zzso lobe zzso Using multiple zzso resulted in an increased percentage of data sets with significant zzso zzso from zzso when using the standard zzso alone, to zzso The standard zzso was good at detecting positive zzso responses, but less appropriate for negative zzso responses, the majority of which were more accurately zzso by an zzso that peaked later than the zzso zzso of statistical maps with zzso zzso suggested that the detected zzso responses were not in general related to large zzso Signal loss in the zzso zzso seemed to be an important factor in 7 of 12 patients who did not show zzso zzso with any of the zzso
