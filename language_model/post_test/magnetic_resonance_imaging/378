zzso zzso zzso is of limited use in areas such as the zzso and inferior zzso zzso due to the presence of local zzso field zzso zzso which result in severe image zzso Several techniques have been developed to reduce these artifacts, the most common being the zzso spiral sequences zzso and zzso In this study, a new multiple spiral acquisition technique was developed, in which the later spiral acquisitions are acquired zzso with the peak of a zzso causing increased zzso but matched zzso This zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated significant improvements in minimizing the signal loss and increasing the image quality as well as optimal zzso zzso The zzso spiral is compared to conventional zzso using both zzso ratio zzso and whole brain zzso zzso volumes from a zzso task acquired at 4 zzso The zzso dual spiral has exhibited zzso increases of up to zzso in areas where strong zzso are zzso As a result, the zzso spiral is highly efficient for recovering lost zzso in areas of zzso as demonstrated by a zzso increase in the total number of activated zzso over the whole zzso Post zzso zzso spiral images have decreasing zzso due to zzso signal losses, however the increase in zzso leads to a higher percentage of signal changes producing zzso spiral images with equivalent zzso ratio zzso for each zzso The use of this sequence allows for recovery of zzso zzso in areas of zzso without sacrificing the zzso over the whole zzso
