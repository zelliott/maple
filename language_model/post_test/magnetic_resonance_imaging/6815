Of the different zzso to induce local zzso focused ultrasound is the only zzso technology available at the zzso In addition to the zzso zzso of the target region, it has been shown that zzso can provide real-time zzso and allows online, automatic control of temperature evolution of the focal zzso Treatment of a large tissue volume (as compared to the focal spot size, zzso the ultrasound zzso can be achieved rapidly by moving the focal point along an zzso spiral zzso It has been shown previously that under linear conditions of energy deposition versus temperature, the spatial profile of the temperature within a large area can be zzso In this study, a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso controller is described for the control of the temperature evolution within the target region under more variable zzso The aim was to reach a zzso temperature profile after a few successive zzso Heat zzso in tissue is exploited to obtain a uniform temperature increase in a volume using discrete zzso without any waiting zzso zzso data sets consisted of zzso temperature maps provided online by a MR zzso For each new zzso the controller zzso the number of zzso per surface unit zzso density of points describing the zzso and the applied zzso Its performance was tested ex zzso and in zzso zzso of the target region ranged from 9 zzso to 19 zzso zzso temperature increase ranged from zzso degrees C to zzso degrees zzso zzso temperature control showed good stability and fast zzso for both circular and zzso zzso
