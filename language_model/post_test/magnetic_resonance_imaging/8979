zzso zzso zzso zzso are located in zzso zzso surrounded by eloquent zzso zzso zzso access is difficult due to narrow surgical corridors and requires zzso through a depth of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso management of zzso clipped using zzso zzso zzso zzso with combined zzso and zzso zzso and zzso approach is zzso 

zzso care referral zzso prospective zzso 

Five patients with zzso zzso causing zzso zzso presented in modified Hunt and Hess zzso zzso grades II zzso III zzso and IV zzso zzso In 4 patients, the zzso were zzso zzso in diameter, situated 7 zzso zzso above zzso zzso Two of them had zzso projecting zzso One patient had a giant, high zzso with a left zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso artery was seen in 2 zzso In one patient, internal carotid artery was mobilized by zzso anterior zzso drilling with carotid zzso zzso zzso therapy was administered following zzso 

There was no zzso zzso or temporary zzso Follow up zzso showed complete zzso obliteration with preservation of zzso cerebral and superior zzso zzso Follow up zzso zzso zzso H and H grades were II zzso and III zzso zzso The morbidity include zzso and zzso region zzso transient III zzso nerve zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso 

This simple approach provides a wide surgical corridor from 5 zzso below to greater than 1 zzso above zzso zzso with adequate zzso control of zzso zzso It is an option to zzso zzso especially with large and giant, or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and an associated large zzso
