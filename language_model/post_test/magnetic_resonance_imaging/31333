Different criteria have been used in literature to describe the anterior zzso zzso zzso anomaly, resulting in uncertainty over its zzso association with zzso and definition of the indications for zzso It has been recently proposed that the term zzso should be restricted to anomalies in which a normal appearing zzso orifice is located in the zzso in a more anterior location than normal, with an zzso canal of normal zzso that is shown by electrical stimulation to be surrounded by the voluntary external zzso zzso zzso We report about four zzso three females and one male, who presented with zzso and had an zzso located zzso orifice of normal zzso The zzso position index measured clinically was less than zzso in all the female patients and zzso in the male zzso In zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso the zzso was distributed all around the circumference of the zzso canal, including the zzso aspect of the zzso canal, in all the zzso zzso zzso documentation of zzso distribution is recommended for the diagnosis of zzso as it would help in better definition of its association with zzso and the results of surgical zzso
