The aim of this study was to evaluate the MR findings of zzso zzso using an external pelvic zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso 15 patients with zzso of the zzso canal underwent zzso weighted and zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging before and after zzso Images were reviewed in consensus by two zzso At zzso imaging, the zzso size and stage, signal intensity and zzso of adjacent structures were zzso MR imaging was repeated immediately after zzso every 6 months for the first year and then zzso zzso response was assessed by recording change in zzso size and signal zzso Prior to treatment, the mean zzso size was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared mildly zzso at zzso weighted and STIR zzso There was good agreement in T staging between clinical examination and MR imaging zzso zzso zzso In 12 zzso with long disease zzso a greater percentage reduction in the size of MR signal zzso in the zzso area was observed at 6 months zzso zzso zzso than immediately after treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed stabilization of zzso signal reduction in the zzso area after 1 year, and zzso showed complete resolution of signal zzso at 2 zzso zzso zzso MR imaging is useful for local staging of zzso zzso and assessing treatment zzso After treatment, a decrease in zzso size accompanied by reduction and stability of the MR zzso signal characteristics at 1 year after zzso treatment was associated with zzso zzso
