A set of cortical and zzso brain structures has been linked with zzso semantic zzso However, it remains unclear how these brain regions are organized to support the semantic integration of a word into zzso zzso To look into this issue, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study that required participants to silently read sentences with zzso zzso or zzso endings and analyzed the network properties of the brain with two approaches, independent component analysis zzso and graph theoretical analysis zzso The zzso suggested that the zzso network is zzso stable across zzso The zzso revealed a network zzso the supplementary motor area zzso left inferior frontal zzso left middle zzso zzso left zzso nucleus, and left angular zzso which was modulated by the incongruity of sentence zzso Furthermore, the zzso specified that the connections between the left zzso and left zzso nucleus as well as that between the left zzso nucleus and right zzso were stronger in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso
