zzso has been used extensively to zzso track the location of cells labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Typically, zzso are employed as a negative contrast agent which makes it difficult to differentiate labeled cells from extraneous sources of zzso and actual voids in the zzso As a result, several novel approaches have been put forth to obtain positive contrast from zzso One technique proposed by Cunningham et zzso zzso zzso selective zzso to zzso and zzso spins in the vicinity of the zzso Although the frequency selectivity of this technique provides effective positive contrast, the lack of slice selectivity results in interfering signal from sources of zzso outside the slice of zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso pulse to achieve zzso zzso imaging of zzso zzso Using a zzso pulse zzso flexibility in zzso selection since the spin echo may be placed at any time after the end of the zzso The spatial selectivity achieved by the zzso zzso pulse eliminates background signal from zzso regions and reduces the zzso water suppression zzso Phantom and in zzso data demonstrate that positive contrast and zzso are achieved using this novel zzso zzso
