To evaluate serum levels of the zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of type I collagen zzso as possible markers of bone zzso in patients with prostate zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso were measured by zzso of serum from 29 patients with benign zzso zzso zzso 17 patients with zzso without bone zzso and 29 patients with zzso and bone zzso 

zzso levels of zzso in patients with zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than those in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in patients with zzso without bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was observed between the zzso and the zzso without bone zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were significantly higher in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and without bone zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso groups with and without bone zzso 

zzso zzso levels correlate well with results of bone scans, while serum zzso levels increase in patients with zzso regardless of the presence of bone zzso
