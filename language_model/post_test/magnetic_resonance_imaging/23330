Previous magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies described consistent age-related gray matter zzso reductions in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in elderly subjects, but not as frequently in zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether such features are already present during earlier stages of adulthood, and if age-related zzso changes may follow zzso patterns at such age zzso This zzso zzso study investigated the relationship between zzso volumes and age specifically during zzso life zzso zzso in 89 healthy individuals zzso males and 41 zzso zzso analyses showed significant zzso zzso negative correlations in the right prefrontal zzso and left zzso and positive correlations zzso lack of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso masks showed that age-related zzso prefrontal volume zzso followed zzso patterns, and were less prominent in females compared to males at this age zzso These findings further support for the notion of a zzso and zzso pattern of age-related brain zzso changes, with zzso zzso zzso
