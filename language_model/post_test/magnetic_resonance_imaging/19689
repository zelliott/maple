In this review, we zzso a new line of zzso showing that zzso zzso can bias information processing in the working memory domain as well as in the zzso domain to zzso zzso zzso A new experimental paradigm was developed, which revealed that spatial zzso cues that appear after zzso events zzso when these have been zzso into working memory zzso can zzso enhance performance to a similar degree as spatial zzso appearing before zzso zzso As part of their zzso action, zzso diminish the costs of retrieving items from increasing loads within working zzso zzso and zzso brain imaging experiments show a high degree of overlap between brain areas and dynamics involved in spatial zzso in the working memory domain compared to the zzso zzso In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging points to the selective involvement of frontal areas during spatial zzso in the working memory zzso The roles of different frontal areas remain to be clarified but may include both early roles in guiding spatial shifts occurring within a zzso context as well as selection of memorized targets zzso distracting zzso zzso have also begun to reveal the ability to orient attention selectively to zzso representations in working memory and suggest that the neural representations of objects in working memory can be directly modulated by this zzso The findings bolster contemporary notions of a strong theoretical relationship between zzso zzso and working memory, suggesting that these two cognitive functions interact in more ways and directions than previously zzso
