zzso MR sequences are more sensitive to flow phenomena than zzso sequences zzso We investigated zzso zzso flow by fast zzso zzso Fast zzso imaging offers the opportunity to perform a dynamic study of fluid motion that is zzso with the cardiac zzso A section perpendicular to the cerebral aqueduct was zzso in 18 healthy zzso zzso gated zzso 50 zzso from the zzso R zzso zzso zzso images with 70 zzso zzso zzso were obtained with a single zzso The behavior vs time of zzso signal in the aqueduct was compared with that in the lateral zzso The former showed a peak at zzso zzso zzso zzso of a heart cycle after the R zzso No zzso with the heart rate was observed for the zzso zzso signal zzso The mean zzso signal intensity in the aqueduct was found to range from about twice to three times that in the lateral zzso over a cardiac zzso Fast zzso imaging is a sensitive and practical sequence for the MR investigation of zzso zzso zzso Its potential in patients with zzso is studied in a companion zzso
