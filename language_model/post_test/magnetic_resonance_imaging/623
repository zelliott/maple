To compare zzso of the liver with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with intravenous contrast media in the follow-up of liver zzso in patient on chemotherapy for zzso zzso 

This was a prospective study with patients on chemotherapy for liver zzso from zzso zzso Patients underwent both zzso zzso CT using 2 zzso contrast at 3 zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging at zzso T using 2-3 zzso contrast at 5 zzso zzso within a two week zzso Two experienced zzso independently reviewed all scans in a blinded fashion and recorded image quality as well as presence and number of liver zzso zzso analysis was performed using the zzso signed rank zzso 

All examinations were of good zzso A total of 71 zzso were detected at CT, with 69 zzso consistent with zzso and 2 zzso consistent with zzso A total of 98 zzso were detected at zzso with 97 consistent with zzso and 1 zzso consistent with a zzso zzso weighted images with zzso significantly detected two additional zzso compared to CT zzso No significant difference was demonstrated between zzso weighted images without zzso and CT or between zzso weighted images and zzso 

zzso resonance imaging with zzso is significantly more sensitive than zzso zzso and zzso CT for the follow-up of liver zzso
