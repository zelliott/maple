zzso neural imaging studies have identified a network of brain areas that are more active to faces than to other zzso However, it remains largely unclear how these areas zzso individual facial zzso To investigate the neural representations of facial identity, we constructed a zzso face space structure, whose dimensions were derived from geometric information of faces using the Principal zzso Analysis zzso Using zzso we recorded zzso neural responses when viewing blocks of faces that differed only on one dimension within a zzso Although the response zzso to different blocks of faces did not differ in a zzso analysis, zzso pattern analysis revealed distinct patterns related to different face space dimensions in brain areas that have a higher response magnitude to faces than to other zzso The results indicate that dimensions of the face space are zzso in the zzso brain areas in a zzso distributed zzso
