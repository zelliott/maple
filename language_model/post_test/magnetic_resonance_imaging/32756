No study has reported an zzso experimental model of electrical injury to the spinal zzso This paper presents the first systematic establishment of an animal model of electrical injury to the spinal zzso with subsequent zzso zzso 

The zzso required for the electrical shock was generated by an zzso therapy apparatus zzso zzso unit; zzso zzso zzso We used one side ear as the entry site and the zzso hind limb as the exit zzso Seven electrical shock zzso 120 zzso pulse zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 99 zzso was applied to each rat and used rat showing hind limb zzso zzso and zzso evaluations were performed at one day, one, two and four weeks after zzso 

Twelve rats showed the hind limb weakness among the total 18 zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging showed interruption of spinal zzso enhancement in the zzso zzso zzso examination showed a greater decrease in the number of zzso in the zzso horn versus the zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates a novel design and analysis of an zzso experimental model of spinal zzso injury by electrical zzso This model is useful for experimental studies of injuries to the spinal zzso
