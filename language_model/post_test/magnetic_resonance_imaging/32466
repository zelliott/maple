This paper describes an R package, named zzso that zzso a method recently proposed for spatial cluster detection of case event zzso This method is based on a data zzso This transformation is achieved by the definition of a zzso which allows to attribute to each point a selection order and the distance to its nearest zzso The nearest point is searched among the points which have not yet been selected in the zzso Due to the trajectory effects, the distance is weighted by the expected distance under the uniform distribution zzso Potential clusters are located by using multiple structural change models and a dynamic programming zzso The double maximum test allows to select the best zzso The zzso of potential clusters is determined by zzso Carlo zzso This method makes it possible the detection of multiple clusters of any zzso
