zzso is a prospective zzso study of zzso disease zzso that examines disease progression in zzso individuals carrying the zzso zzso gene and those with early stage zzso We report 12-month zzso changes, building on baseline zzso 

we did a 12-month follow-up of patients recruited from the four zzso study sites in Canada, France, the Netherlands, and the zzso Participants were zzso individuals zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso patients with early zzso and controls matched by age and sex with the combined zzso and early HD zzso Data were collected by use of zzso zzso and clinical, zzso quantitative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis assessed zzso change with the use of linear zzso models to estimate differences between zzso 

116 zzso individuals, 114 early HD patients, and 115 people in the control group completed zzso Four zzso individuals, nine early HD patients, and eight people in the control group did not complete the zzso A further nine participants, who completed follow-up zzso were unable to undergo zzso After adjustment for zzso zzso rates of zzso and regional brain zzso were higher in zzso and early HD groups than in zzso zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per year higher in zzso participants and zzso zzso zzso in early HD patients, and zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso per year higher in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in early zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso even in subjects furthest from predicted disease zzso zzso imaging showed statistically significant associations with disease burden, an indicator of disease pathology, and total functional capacity, a zzso clinical measure of disease zzso Relative to controls, decline in zzso and quantitative motor function was zzso in both zzso and early zzso as was deterioration in zzso function in early zzso 

quantitative imaging showed the greatest differentiation across the spectrum of disease and functional measures of decline were sensitive in early zzso with cognitive and quantitative motor impairment also zzso in zzso We show zzso change over 12 months in zzso and regional brain volume, zzso and quantitative motor tasks in individuals many years from predicted disease onset and show the feasibility of obtaining quantifiable zzso for future zzso
