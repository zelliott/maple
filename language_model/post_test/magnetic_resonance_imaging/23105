Imaging of water diffusion using magnetic resonance imaging has become an important zzso method for probing the white matter connectivity of the human brain for scientific and clinical zzso Current methods, such as diffusion zzso imaging zzso high angular resolution diffusion imaging zzso such as zzso imaging, and diffusion spectrum imaging zzso are limited by low spatial resolution, long scan times, and low zzso ratio zzso These methods fundamentally perform reconstruction on a zzso level, effectively discarding the natural zzso of the data at different points in zzso This paper attempts to overcome these tradeoffs by using spatial information to zzso the reconstruction from raw diffusion zzso data, and thereby improve angular resolution and noise zzso zzso constraints are specified in terms of a prior probability distribution, which is then incorporated in a zzso reconstruction zzso By taking the log of the resulting zzso distribution, optimal zzso reconstruction is reduced to a cost zzso zzso The zzso is solved using a new zzso zzso based on successive least squares zzso zzso zzso studies and in zzso results are presented which indicate significant gains in terms of higher angular resolution of diffusion orientation distribution functions, better separation of crossing zzso and improved reconstruction zzso over the same zzso method, zzso harmonic zzso imaging, without spatial zzso zzso data also indicate that the proposed method might be better at maintaining accurate zzso for smaller numbers of zzso acquisition directions zzso faster zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso impacts of this work include improved evaluation of white matter zzso integrity in regions of crossing fibers and higher spatial and angular resolution for more accurate zzso
