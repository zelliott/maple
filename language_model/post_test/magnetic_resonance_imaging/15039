zzso protein zzso a marker of underlying zzso zzso has been associated with the zzso of bipolar zzso Additionally, bipolar disorder may be accompanied by functional or structural cerebral zzso We attempted to discover whether serum zzso zzso zzso levels are linked to the structural volume change of a specific brain region along with cognitive zzso 

We recruited 17 physically healthy patients with bipolar I disorder zzso aged zzso years and zzso to undergo the Wisconsin zzso zzso Test zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso The zzso method was based on the hidden zzso random field model with an zzso algorithm, and the volume of each brain region was presented as a percentage of the total zzso zzso 

Among the various regions, only the zzso zzso had a significantly negative correlation with serum zzso levels after adjustment for age and gender zzso and right zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and r zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Regarding cognitive function, poor zzso performance was also associated with certain zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso of serum zzso levels, an indicator of zzso may be associated with reduced volume of the zzso zzso zzso inflammation in the zzso phase of bipolar disorder may involve the zzso or zzso of zzso of the frontal zzso
