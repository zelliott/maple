zzso advances have been made in understanding the role of tumor zzso and its influence on tumor progression in zzso Based on this knowledge, a series of zzso of zzso have been developed and evaluated in zzso and clinical zzso Since detailed information of tumor progression in response to therapy is important to assess the efficacy of zzso treatment in zzso zzso imaging techniques emerge more and more as important tools to monitor zzso in tumor growth and vessel zzso as well as zzso spread over zzso So far, remarkable efforts have been made to improve the technical capability of these imaging zzso based on better resolution, as well as to implement zzso approaches combining molecular with anatomical zzso Advanced imaging techniques not only allow the detection and monitoring of tumor development, but also facilitate a broad understanding of the cellular and molecular events that zzso tumor zzso as well as those occurring in response to zzso This review provides an overview of different imaging techniques in zzso settings of zzso research and discusses their potential impact on clinical zzso Imaging zzso will be presented that have been implemented to address key biological issues by exploring tumor zzso processes and evaluating zzso zzso
