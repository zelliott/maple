The zzso of sudden deafness can remain zzso despite extensive zzso This study addresses the value of magnetic resonance imaging in the analysis of sudden deafness zzso 

zzso zzso 

In a prospective study, 49 patients attended at zzso emergency room of Federal University of zzso zzso zzso de zzso from April 2001 to May 2003, were submitted to magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso abnormalities were seen in 23 zzso patients and revealed two tumors suggestive of zzso three zzso zzso thirteen zzso changes of the brain and five zzso pathological conditions of the zzso 

zzso deafness should be approached as a symptom common to different zzso The presence of zzso angle tumors in zzso of our cases, among other zzso causes, justifies the recommendation of zzso magnetic resonance use, not only to study the auditory peripheral pathway, but to study the whole auditory zzso including the zzso
