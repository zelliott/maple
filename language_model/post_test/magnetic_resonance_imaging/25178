zzso of the severity of a coronary artery zzso is of paramount importance for zzso A relevant zzso provokes zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso This zzso response was investigated in the present study by use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso without contrast zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso system may be studied zzso and without a contrast agent by zzso zzso which is based on the zzso property of zzso This effect, also referred to as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is investigated by phase relaxation zzso zzso 

In patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso coronary artery disease, no history of zzso zzso normal left zzso function at rest, and a positive stress zzso the zzso zzso zzso was assessed in the zzso 

In regions associated with the zzso artery, zzso was significantly lower than in residual zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference in zzso increased after application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients being zzso after therapeutic interventions, the zzso zzso was partly zzso 

For the first time, we could show that zzso zzso zzso detects zzso zzso recruitment dependent on coronary artery zzso
