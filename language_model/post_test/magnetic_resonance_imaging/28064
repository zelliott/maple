The neural activities of the zzso association zzso were studied in humans through the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The magnetic field responses were recorded in the zzso association zzso following visual stimulation with LED zzso Main responses zzso at about zzso 170 and 220 zzso after LED onset were zzso The estimated current zzso sources of the magnetic field responses at zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were revealed to be located in the zzso zzso A change in the magnetic field responses with the eye position was found in the zzso
