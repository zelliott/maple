Most of the current methods to assess effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso rely on the assumption that all relevant brain regions are entered into the zzso If this assumption is untenable, which we believe is most often the case, then zzso connections between brain regions can zzso In this paper we propose to use an ancestral graph to model zzso which provides a way to avoid zzso zzso The ancestral graph is determined from zzso variation and not from the time zzso A random effects model is defined for ancestral zzso which allows for individual differences in terms of graph parameters zzso connection zzso zzso for model selection, model fit, and hypothesis testing of ancestral zzso are zzso The hypothesis test can be used to find differences in connection strength between, for example, zzso zzso Carlo simulations show that the ancestral graph is appropriate to model connectivity from zzso condition specific trial zzso To assess the accuracy further, the proposed method is applied to real zzso data to determine how brain regions interact during speech zzso
