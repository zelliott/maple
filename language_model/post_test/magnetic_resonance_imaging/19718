We report three patients, who have zzso zzso and secondary generalized zzso with generalized spike wave zzso The first two patients have unilateral zzso zzso one with generalized zzso zzso on awakening the other with zzso zzso During the course of the disease both children developed electrical status zzso in slow wave sleep zzso The third patient has a zzso unilateral zzso tumor and zzso that mimics juvenile zzso zzso All the patients have a zzso located in the zzso part of the zzso The role of some zzso and zzso zzso in the generalized zzso electrical pattern zzso is discussed, with emphasis on the possible role of the zzso system from the zzso zzso
