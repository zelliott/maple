The purpose of this paper is to illustrate contrast enhancement patterns of solid focal liver zzso on dynamic and late phase imaging with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso and late phase zzso zzso zzso MR imaging of different focal liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Dynamic imaging was performed using zzso zzso sequences after the zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was obtained at 1-3 h after contrast zzso 

Dynamic imaging with zzso provides the same information as with conventional zzso zzso contrast agents, while zzso imaging gives additional information for zzso identification and zzso
