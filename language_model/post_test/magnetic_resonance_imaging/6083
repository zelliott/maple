To zzso evaluate the efficacy of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the zzso staging of cervical zzso compared with that at zzso imaging, with surgery and zzso analysis as the reference zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso Thirty-one consecutive patients (age range, zzso years; mean age, zzso zzso underwent zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso and qualitative analyses were zzso Two zzso independently evaluated images in terms of zzso zzso MR findings were compared with zzso zzso 

Mean tumor zzso ratios, mean cervical zzso zzso ratios, and mean zzso zzso zzso ratios at zzso imaging were significantly higher than those at zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Image zzso at zzso imaging was significantly inferior to that at zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in terms of the degree of zzso zzso zzso agreement between the two zzso for zzso staging was good or excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for zzso 1 in the evaluation of zzso invasion were zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso imaging, zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso imaging, and zzso zzso for zzso imaging and zzso for zzso imaging, zzso zzso values for zzso invasion were zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso imaging, zzso zzso for zzso imaging and zzso for zzso imaging, and zzso zzso for zzso imaging and zzso for zzso imaging, zzso zzso values for zzso zzso zzso were zzso 57% for both zzso and zzso imaging, zzso zzso for zzso imaging and zzso for zzso imaging, and zzso zzso for zzso imaging and zzso for zzso imaging, zzso Neither zzso noted significant differences between values obtained with zzso imaging and those obtained with zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso for all comparison zzso 

In this study, zzso MR imaging was characterized by high diagnostic accuracy in the zzso evaluation of patients with cervical zzso although zzso imaging was not significantly superior to zzso zzso
