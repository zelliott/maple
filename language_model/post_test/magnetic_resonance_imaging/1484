The growing use of highly sensitive but only moderate specific breast zzso requires the development of both zzso as well as precise biopsy zzso The aim of the study was to prove the accuracy and feasibility of a biopsy procedure carried out in prone position in a vertically opened MR zzso 

The zzso were carried out in 21 women with zzso visible on zzso alone using an open breast zzso with an integrated biopsy zzso A 14 G zzso needle was placed under near real-time zzso After the tip of this needle was verified in contact with the zzso we used a non zzso but zzso biopsy gun with a 16 G zzso to take four to eight zzso 

We found eight zzso and 12 benign zzso In one patient the procedure was not zzso In case of zzso the operation confirmed the diagnosis in all zzso The zzso patients with benign zzso have been followed without evidence of zzso growth over eight to 28 zzso 

The described procedure allows zzso minimal invasive core biopsy of small breast zzso (five to 17 zzso with a high degree of zzso
