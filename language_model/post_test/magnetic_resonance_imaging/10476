This study aimed to further explore processing of auditory and visual stimuli in working zzso Smith and zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Working memory: A view from zzso zzso zzso 33, zzso described a modified working memory model in which visual input is automatically transformed into a zzso zzso To study this process, auditory and the corresponding visual stimuli were presented in a zzso of the zzso task which involved changes from the auditory to the visual zzso and vice zzso Brain zzso patterns underlying visual and auditory processing as well as transformation mechanisms were zzso zzso yielded a significant zzso in the left primary auditory zzso associated with transformation of visual into auditory information which reflects the matching and zzso of a stored item and its zzso This finding yields empirical evidence for a transformation of visual input into a zzso code, with the auditory zzso as the neural correlate of the zzso process in working zzso
