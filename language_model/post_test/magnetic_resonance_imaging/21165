zzso zzso of the central nervous system zzso is a rare zzso whose zzso has increased substantially in zzso zzso zzso To examine the clinical and zzso features in this risk group, with the aim of establishing a set of characteristics that can lead to a quick and accurate zzso 

The study zzso all the cases of diffuse zzso zzso that had been diagnosed zzso over the past 13 years in two zzso zzso and zzso referral hospitals in the zzso of the zzso zzso A total of 38 patients were studied zzso zzso years zzso zzso of whom were zzso The most frequent clinical presentation was gait instability, speech disorders and zzso The analysis showed that zzso of the zzso are zzso and zzso have zzso zzso In magnetic resonance imaging, 50% show homogeneous zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso the mean size being zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of the zzso to be zzso All the patients displayed enhancement following the administration of zzso The overall median time of survival is 209 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can manifest a number of different features per image, which have gradually changed over time, and we must be familiar with them in order to establish a quick zzso zzso efforts must be made to improve sensitivity and diagnostic zzso and to conduct research on the biological mechanisms, the possible risk factors and the prevention of zzso zzso
