zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an imaging technique that can be used to characterize brain zzso activity, usually presented as zzso volumes in function of zzso In the context of our previous work in zzso association studies in electroencephalogram zzso time series, we were able to identify clinical relevant features useful in clinical zzso The use of a similar approach in zzso now adapted for zzso time series, is both appealing and zzso Such time series analysis zzso challenging requirements regarding zzso power and medical image zzso In this paper we propose a grid architecture framework to support the typical analysis protocol of association analysis applied to zzso The system, implemented using the zzso zzso provides the necessary support to manage brain images and run zzso zzso analysis zzso
