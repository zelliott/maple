Based largely on data from animal models, migraine is hypothesized to involve changes in neural function in brain areas that mediate zzso the zzso zzso spinal zzso nucleus, and zzso These hypotheses about migraine zzso can be tested directly in humans for the first time, with recent advances in functional zzso techniques, which allow assessment of functional activity of specific brain zzso This article discusses the hypothesized role of the zzso pain system in zzso reviews recent findings involving functional imaging of the human zzso system, and considers applications of functional imaging in the study of migraine zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso approach for the objective measurement of changes in neural activity in zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging has been applied to the measurement of neural zzso of the zzso zzso system in healthy volunteers, and in patients with pain syndromes such as zzso zzso 

The demonstrated utility of functional magnetic resonance imaging at zzso in a regionally specific manner, the functional and zzso changes in neural activity in the zzso zzso system, promises to make it a useful tool for the study of migraine zzso and the evaluation of therapeutic zzso
