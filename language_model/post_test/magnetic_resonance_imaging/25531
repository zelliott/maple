Recently, more investigators have been applying higher magnetic field strengths zzso zzso in research and clinical zzso Higher magnetic field strength is expected to afford higher spatial resolution and/or a decrease in the length of total scan time due to its higher signal zzso Besides MR signal intensity, however, there are several factors which are magnetic field dependent, thus the same set of imaging parameters at lower magnetic field strengths would provide differences in signal or contrast to noise ratios at 3 T or zzso zzso an outcome of the combined effect of all these factors should be considered to estimate the change in usefulness at different magnetic zzso The objective of this article is to illustrate the practical scientific applications, focusing on MR imaging, of higher magnetic field zzso First, we will discuss previous literature and our experiments to demonstrate several changes that lead to a number of practical applications in MR imaging, zzso in relaxation times, effects of contrast agent, design of zzso zzso maintaining a safety profile and in switching magnetic field zzso Second, we discuss what will be required to gain the maximum benefit of high magnetic field when the current magnetic field zzso or zzso zzso zzso is switched to 3 or 4 zzso In addition, we discuss MR zzso which is one of the anticipated applications of high magnetic field strength to understand the quantitative zzso of the gain benefit and other considerations to help establish a practically available imaging zzso
