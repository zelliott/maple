The imaging of dynamic processes in the body is of considerable interest in zzso examinations as well as zzso studies, and spiral imaging is a fast magnetic resonance imaging technique zzso suited for such zzso zzso In this zzso magnetic resonance zzso pulse sequences in which zzso spirals are used to continuously acquire data and reconstruct one movie frame for each repetition time zzso are zzso For many applications, not all of zzso needs to be updated each frame, and zzso zzso sampling can be used to exploit this rapid imaging strategy by allowing variable update rates for different spatial zzso Using the appropriate reconstruction algorithm, the zzso updating rate for each spatial frequency is effectively zzso to the corresponding zzso sampling zzso zzso from a motion phantom as well as in in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso tracking studies in a rat model demonstrate the high zzso resolution achievable using these techniques as well as the tradeoffs available with zzso sampling zzso This paper focuses on the acquisition of real-time dynamic information, and all images presented are reconstructed zzso The issues of real-time data reconstruction and display are not zzso
