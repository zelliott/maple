Brain activity preceding rapid eye movements zzso during human zzso sleep has remained poorly zzso Slow negative brain potential zzso zzso appears before zzso Current sources of this potential were investigated to identify brain activity immediately preceding zzso 

In this study, 22 young healthy volunteers zzso years old) zzso zzso were recorded during normal nocturnal zzso Brain zzso between zzso before and zzso after the onset of zzso and zzso zzso before the onset of zzso were zzso zzso zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso was used to estimate current sources of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso appeared with the zzso zzso at right prefrontal sites immediately before zzso However, this zzso did not appear before zzso Current sources of the zzso zzso were estimated in the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and frontal eye zzso 

The zzso zzso reflects brain activity coupled with the occurrence of zzso zzso of this study suggest that emotion, memory, and zzso brain activity might occur before zzso 

zzso zzso is expected to be a zzso index for zzso functions of zzso zzso
