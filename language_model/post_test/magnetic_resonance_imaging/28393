This study was undertaken to validate the potential of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso as a zzso alternative for zzso zzso biopsy in detecting cardiac zzso zzso zzso hearts from either Lewis rats zzso or zzso rats zzso were transplanted into the neck of L rats resulting in a zzso group zzso and a rejecting group zzso zzso and zzso rats were serially studied by means of zzso MRS from zzso day zzso In addition, rejection was confirmed by zzso A similar, marked decrease in zzso zzso zzso ratio from day 1-3 was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso This ratio zzso off on zzso day 3 and remained depressed on subsequent zzso days in both groups, although zzso showed an increase in the severity of rejection in zzso However, the zzso zzso ratio in zzso started to decrease after day 4, coinciding with the zzso evidence of severe rejection zzso zzso whereas in zzso hearts zzso zzso this ratio remained zzso until day zzso Since zzso zzso metabolism is affected by the unloaded status of the zzso transplanted heart, irrespective of zzso the zzso ratio appears not to be a specific marker for the detection of acute rejection in this zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso ratio appears to be a specific and sensitive marker of acute zzso but only in a late, severe zzso
