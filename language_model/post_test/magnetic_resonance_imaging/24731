A prospective zzso study including clinical, zzso serial zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso findings, and zzso zzso 

To document in zzso the site of anatomical failure in zzso disc zzso zzso 

Although in zzso mechanical disruption studies have implicated both the zzso junction zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as the site of failure in zzso there are no in zzso human studies to document the exact anatomy of zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive patients requiring zzso at a single level formed the study zzso The status of the zzso and zzso in the operated level zzso zzso and the other discs zzso were evaluated by plain zzso thin slice zzso zzso zzso plain and contrast magnetic resonance imaging, zzso examination, and zzso zzso 

zzso due to zzso failure zzso type I zzso was more common zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso discs had a significantly higher zzso of zzso than control discs zzso zzso zzso The zzso was evident zzso as zzso corner zzso in 30 patients, rim zzso in 46, frank zzso zzso in 24, and zzso at both upper and lower zzso in zzso Thirteen discs with normal zzso zzso had cartilage or bone zzso zzso zzso discs zzso had intact zzso of which zzso high intensity zone was found in 21 zzso suggesting a disruption of zzso zzso II zzso zzso magnetic resonance image of 20 patients showed dye leak at the zzso proving zzso as main cause of zzso 

Our study provides the first in zzso evidence that zzso in humans is more commonly the result of zzso than zzso zzso and offers clinical validation of previous in zzso mechanical disruption zzso Future research must focus on the zzso as a primary area of interest in zzso
