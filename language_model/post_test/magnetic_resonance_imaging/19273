zzso zzso in the zzso gene on zzso 17 are known to cause zzso zzso We have identified a novel silent zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a subject without significant zzso or cellular zzso of the frontal and zzso zzso Rather the cellular pathology was characteristic of progressive zzso zzso with zzso zzso concentrating within the zzso regions of the zzso zzso Two affected family members presented with symptoms of zzso and later developed neurological deficits including zzso of vertical gaze and zzso zzso The third presented with zzso of the left arm and zzso and later developed a zzso gaze zzso and zzso The zzso is located in zzso 10 of the zzso gene and forms part of a zzso structure at the zzso zzso donor zzso Although the zzso does not give rise to an zzso acid change in the zzso zzso functional zzso experiments show that it results in a significant zzso increase in the zzso of zzso 10, resulting in the presence of zzso containing four zzso zzso This study provides direct molecular evidence for a functional zzso that causes progressive zzso zzso pathology and demonstrates that zzso in the zzso gene are zzso
