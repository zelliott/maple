We zzso compared the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure residual breast cancer in patients treated with different zzso chemotherapy zzso 

Forty patients with locally advanced breast zzso underwent zzso zzso Twelve patients received zzso zzso six zzso 28 zzso received zzso chemotherapy (six cycles zzso 13 patients, eight cycles zzso zzso 15 zzso All patients had baseline and zzso zzso The spread of zzso residual disease zzso was compared to zzso zzso measures according to chemotherapy zzso 

zzso zzso of the spread of residual zzso was never superior to zzso in zzso group, whereas it appeared in zzso zzso zzso zzso patients in zzso group zzso zzso shrinkage led to single zzso residual zzso in zzso group, whereas vast numerous microscopic nests were observed in zzso group in zzso 

Among zzso treated with a zzso regimen, residual disease was frequently underestimated by zzso because of zzso zzso
