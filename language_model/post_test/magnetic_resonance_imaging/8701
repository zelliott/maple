zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the neural zzso of semantic judgments to Chinese zzso Adult participants were asked to indicate if character pairs were related in meaning that were arranged in a continuous variable according to association zzso This zzso manipulation allowed for a more precise determination of the role of the left inferior zzso zzso in processing meaning, which has not been reported in previous Chinese zzso zzso with previous findings in English, participants showed zzso in left inferior frontal zzso zzso 47, zzso and left zzso middle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with stronger semantic association zzso greater zzso in left inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting stronger integration of highly related semantic zzso By contrast, characters with weaker semantic association zzso greater zzso in both an anterior zzso region zzso zzso and a zzso region of left inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso suggesting a controlled retrieval process and a selection zzso Our findings of association strength are discussed in a proposed zzso model of semantic zzso
