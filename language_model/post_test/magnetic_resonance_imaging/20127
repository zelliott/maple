Following bilateral injection of zzso zzso into the zzso motor cortex, electrical stimulation of the zzso is shown to increase the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso tract zzso as assessed by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso echo images were acquired in 3-D and displayed in different zzso to zzso delineate the zzso zzso from zzso to spinal zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of the SC were produced from zzso based image data to demonstrate the distribution of the zzso properties of the SC tissue and to zzso assess the zzso occurring in the zzso due to the presence of zzso zzso zzso for improving the tract tracing ability with the proposed in zzso approach and its application to spinal zzso injury zzso research are discussed in terms of aiding future experimental investigations of zzso following an zzso
