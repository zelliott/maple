The year 2001 has been very fertile for innovations and developments in the field of cardiac zzso In Nuclear zzso this year has been marked above all by a very large number of studies on the zzso which allows joint analysis of the zzso and contraction of the left zzso The contribution of this technique is zzso as being very significant in all fields using conventional zzso zzso for cardiac disease, evaluations of prognosis and zzso Innovation has also been focused in the field of zzso with studies on the very promising markers of zzso or cellular zzso Lastly, much work has been conducted on the zzso especially to adapt it for imaging with the zzso used in zzso zzso zzso zzso This will enable the distribution to all the Nuclear Medicine services of zzso imaging, which is the reference technique for studying zzso zzso In zzso much work has been carried out on sequences using zzso a vascular contrast agent, in order to identify and zzso the zzso of zzso even when they are limited to the zzso The most spectacular technical innovations were probably in the methods allowing an increase of the recorded signal zzso and in updating the imaging sequences in real time, without zzso and without zzso zzso But, as every year, significant progress has also been made in zzso zzso of the coronary vessels, and thus in the analysis of zzso tissue zzso with sequences which can be used without the injection of contrast zzso
