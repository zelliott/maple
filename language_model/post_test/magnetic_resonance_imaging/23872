This work uses the well-established (by zzso confrontation naming task to compare PET and zzso in a cognitive zzso zzso The signal changes from this task are much less than the changes caused by visual or motor zzso tasks used in previous zzso zzso methods adjusted for multiple comparisons were used to determine significant changes in signal between confrontation naming and figure size discrimination zzso All 17 significantly increased regions zzso naming signal zzso seen on one zzso were increased on both zzso Ten of 13 regions that were significantly decreased on one zzso were decreased on the zzso Three mismatched regions showed a significant decrease on one zzso and a zzso increase on the zzso This study could not detect a consistent difference in zzso site location between PET and zzso
