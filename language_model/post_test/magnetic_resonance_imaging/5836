To compare the quantitative and qualitative image quality zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso in patients with chronic liver zzso 

The study group included 24 consecutive patients (17 zzso 7 zzso mean age zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso who had chronic liver diseases and underwent abdominal zzso for the liver evaluation at both zzso and zzso T within a zzso zzso All zzso studies were zzso evaluated zzso and zzso zzso analysis was performed by measuring signal to noise ratio zzso on various abdominal zzso zzso analysis was performed by two zzso to assess image quality, artifacts, and imaging findings of chronic liver zzso zzso and qualitative analyses findings were compared between zzso and zzso T using the paired Student zzso and zzso signed rank test, zzso 

The statistically significant increase in zzso in various abdominal zzso ranged from zzso to zzso at zzso T compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso sequences demonstrated significantly higher image quality at zzso T zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso echo zzso sequences demonstrated significantly higher image quality at zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences did not show any significant difference in image quality between zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of various abdominal zzso demonstrated significant increases at zzso zzso The image quality of zzso sequences was higher at zzso zzso whereas the image quality of zzso zzso sequences was higher at zzso
