The sensitivity of zzso acid zzso in detecting zzso zzso zzso tissue compared to zzso zzso and zzso contrast zzso of tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans was investigated in a retrospective image zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso verified zzso in eloquent brain regions underwent 11 surgeries with zzso and zzso assisted tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso was labeled zzso on the navigation zzso scans and images were fused with zzso zzso PET and zzso contrast zzso 

zzso at the end of save zzso in all patients zzso faint zzso positive zzso planes were detected zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso positive zzso planes zzso zzso and 0-2 positive zzso contrast zzso zzso planes in zzso zzso The difference between the number of zzso and zzso positive zzso planes was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso investigation of zzso positive zzso margins demonstrated zzso tumor in every zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso margins and zzso zzso zzso areas or residual contrast zzso areas were zzso in all cases, documented by zzso image zzso 

zzso faint zzso zzso is documented in large areas at the end of zzso zzso and zzso to tumor zzso These zzso positive zzso plans exceeded the zzso zzso areas in zzso PET zzso Thus, zzso zzso residual zzso seems to be a more sensitive marker than zzso PET for residual tumor in zzso zzso
