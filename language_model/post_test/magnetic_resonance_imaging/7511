As patients with Parkinson's disease zzso are at high risk for zzso depression, it is hypothesized that these two diseases are sharing common zzso zzso Using regional zzso zzso and functional connectivity approaches, we characterized human regional brain activity at resting state to examine specific brain networks in patients with zzso and those with zzso and depression zzso This study comprised 41 zzso human patients and 25 normal human zzso The patients completed the Hamilton Depression zzso zzso and were further divided into two groups: patients with depressive symptoms and zzso zzso patients zzso Compared with the zzso patients, those with depressive symptoms exhibited significantly increased regional activity in the left middle frontal zzso and right inferior frontal zzso and decreased zzso in the left zzso and bilateral zzso zzso Brain network connectivity analysis revealed decreased functional connectivity within the zzso system and increased functional connectivity in the prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso in zzso compared with the zzso zzso In zzso the findings showed regional brain activity zzso and disruption of the mood regulation network in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso may be attributed to abnormal neural activity in multiple brain zzso
