The term idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso a variety of zzso syndromes that may present with a purely zzso syndrome zzso or with additional zzso features zzso Multiple system zzso is also a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder of unknown origin that may cause prominent zzso symptoms zzso The final zzso answer to the question whether zzso and zzso represent different varieties of one disease or two distinct entities is still zzso zzso zzso zzso allows zzso investigations zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was therefore performed in 46 patients with sporadic zzso zzso and 16 zzso healthy zzso Patients with zzso were excluded from the study since cognitive impairment is an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of zzso zzso patients were clinically divided into two groups: 33 patients with multiple system zzso with prominent zzso symptoms zzso and 13 patients with zzso features not corresponding to zzso zzso There was evidence for substantial zzso zzso in both zzso groups while additional zzso zzso was significantly more pronounced in zzso zzso Absolute zzso and zzso zzso was found to be restricted to single zzso individuals while group comparisons of mean volumes did not yield significant differences from zzso Based on the zzso data, diagnosis could be correctly predicted in zzso of control, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The finding of specific imaging characteristics strengthens zzso the value of zzso zzso in separating zzso from other types of sporadic zzso zzso and zzso the hypothesis of two independent neurodegenerative disorders in zzso and zzso
