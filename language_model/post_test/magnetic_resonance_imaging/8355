zzso zzso involving disruption of white matter tracts in the brain, has been hypothesized as a mechanism of age-related cognitive zzso zzso zzso in the white matter (so called white matter zzso zzso on zzso zzso scans are regarded to represent zzso damage of the zzso fiber system and are found to be increased with advanced zzso In the present study, we examined whether zzso might be a zzso factor for zzso in zzso zzso For that purpose, we examined the association between age, deep or zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso listening performance in healthy older adults with ages ranging from 50 to 81 zzso We found decreased zzso listening performance with increasing age, specifically for the left ear zzso but not the right ear zzso in a standard zzso condition, and for the unattended ears but not the attended ears in conditions in which attention was zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso is partially zzso by zzso specifically in the zzso zzso to the attended zzso Moreover, we found indications that zzso performance is specifically affected by zzso in the right and left frontal and zzso areas, and that zzso performance is mostly affected by zzso selectively in the left hemisphere, including the left zzso zzso The present study zzso the idea that zzso is involved in age-related cognitive zzso
