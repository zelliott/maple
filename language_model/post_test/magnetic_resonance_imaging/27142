Recent advances in the development of zzso zzso platforms allow for the unbiased identification of genes and zzso sequences related to zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed human short-term memory, which refers to the ability to remember information over a brief period of time and which has been found disturbed in many zzso conditions, including schizophrenia and zzso We performed a zzso survey at zzso zzso zzso and report six genetic variations significantly associated with human short-term memory performance after zzso correction for multiple zzso A zzso within zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the type I zzso sodium zzso was zzso in three independent populations of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging during an zzso working memory task detected zzso zzso zzso differences in brain regions typically involved in working memory zzso These results suggest an important role for zzso in human short-term zzso
