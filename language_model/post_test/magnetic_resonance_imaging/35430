The zzso space around the zzso nerve in the orbit can be zzso using zzso MR imaging with the zzso pulse zzso The zzso nerve sheath zzso diameter can be estimated by measuring the outer diameter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with idiopathic zzso hypertension and zzso and is believed to reflect increased zzso pressure zzso The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso is unclear because of the difficulty in obtaining zzso zzso of zzso The authors investigated the relationship between zzso pressure measured at the time of surgery and zzso diameter measured on MR images in patients with chronic zzso fluid zzso 

Twelve patients underwent zzso zzso with continuous drainage for chronic zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained before and after surgery, and the zzso diameters were measured just behind the zzso zzso zzso pressure was measured using a zzso before opening of the zzso zzso 

A significant correlation was found between the zzso diameter and the zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso diameter before surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced after surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso are expressed as the mean zzso standard zzso 

Increased zzso diameter measured on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images is a strong indicator of increased zzso and helps to differentiate between passive zzso fluid collection due to brain zzso and zzso zzso with increased zzso
