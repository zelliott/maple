Silent brain zzso and white matter zzso are frequently seen on magnetic resonance imaging in healthy elderly people and both are associated with an increased risk of stroke and zzso Plasma total homocysteine may be a potentially modifiable risk factor for stroke and zzso We examined whether elevated total homocysteine levels are associated with silent brain zzso and white matter zzso The Rotterdam zzso Study is a zzso study of zzso people aged 60 to 90 years who had cerebral magnetic resonance zzso The zzso relation of total homocysteine with silent zzso and white matter zzso was analyzed with adjustment for cardiovascular risk zzso The mean plasma total homocysteine level was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of silent brain zzso increased with increasing total homocysteine levels zzso ratio zzso zzso increase, zzso confidence zzso zzso The severity of zzso white matter zzso and extent of zzso white matter zzso were also significantly associated with total homocysteine levels, even after excluding those with silent brain zzso The overall risk of having either a silent brain zzso or severe white matter zzso was strongly associated with total homocysteine levels zzso ratio zzso zzso increase, zzso confidence zzso zzso We concluded that total homocysteine levels are associated with silent brain zzso and white matter zzso independent of each other and of other cardiovascular risk zzso
