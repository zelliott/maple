Working memory zzso evoked by linguistic cues for zzso spatial and zzso spatial aspects of a visual scene was investigated by zzso zzso zzso signal (or zzso with performance on a zzso zzso zzso indicated the relative positions of a person or object zzso by the personal zzso zzso in a previously shown image relative to either themselves zzso reference zzso or shifted to a reference frame anchored in another person or object in the image zzso reference zzso zzso zzso he in front of zzso Good performers had both shorter response time and more correct responses than poor performers in both zzso These zzso variables were entered into a principal component zzso The first component reflected zzso performance zzso We found that the frontal eye fields zzso zzso had a higher zzso response during recall involving zzso compared to zzso spatial reference zzso and that this difference was larger in good performers than in poor performers as measured by the first zzso principal zzso The frontal eye fields may be used when subjects move their internal gaze during shifting reference frames in zzso zzso Analysis of actual eye movements in three subjects revealed no difference between zzso and zzso recall tasks where visual stimuli were also zzso Thus, the zzso machinery for directing eye movements may also be involved in changing reference frames within zzso
