zzso memory of basic stimulus features seems to rely upon low-level functional components of the visual zzso By using a repetition zzso zzso we previously showed that visual area zzso is important for holding motion direction information, but not spatial position zzso Here we extend our previous findings and investigate the possible locus of spatial position zzso We compare the effect of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso over right angular zzso and left and right frontal eye fields on zzso for spatial position and motion zzso zzso over left frontal eye field selectively and significantly reduced zzso for spatial position but there was no significant effect of zzso over right zzso or right frontal eye zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso are implicated in short-term memory storage of spatial position, and extend and support the idea that memory for basic stimulus features is retained within the sensory areas that respond to primary stimulus zzso They add to a growing body of evidence that the frontal eye fields are involved in many visual functions independent of eye zzso
