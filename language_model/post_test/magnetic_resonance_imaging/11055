To evaluate the impact of different tabletops with or without a knee support on the position of the zzso zzso and bulb of the zzso and to evaluate the effect of these zzso devices on treatment zzso 

For 10 male volunteers, five zzso scans were made in four different zzso on a flat zzso with knee support, on a flat zzso without knee support, on a rounded zzso with knee support, and on a rounded zzso without knee zzso The fifth scan was in the same position as the zzso With image zzso the position differences of the zzso zzso and bulb of the zzso were measured at several points in a zzso plane through the central axis of the zzso A planning target volume was generated from the delineated zzso with a margin of 10 zzso in three zzso A zzso treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 78 zzso to the International Commission on zzso Units and zzso point was automatically generated from each planning target zzso zzso zzso were calculated for all zzso zzso 

The shape of the zzso did not affect the zzso and prostate zzso zzso of a knee support shifted the anterior and zzso zzso walls zzso For the anterior zzso wall, the maximum zzso shift was zzso zzso zzso error of the mean zzso zzso zzso at the top of the zzso For the zzso zzso wall, the maximum zzso shift was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the middle of the zzso zzso the zzso filling was pushed zzso when a knee support was zzso The knee support caused a rotation of the prostate around the zzso axis at the zzso zzso a zzso zzso by zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees ) and shifts in the zzso and zzso directions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The position of the bulb of the zzso was not influenced by the use of a knee support or rounded zzso The volume of the zzso wall receiving the same dose range zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso when a knee support was zzso No significant differences were observed between the first and fifth scan zzso zzso with knee zzso for all measured points, thereby excluding time zzso 

The zzso and prostate were significantly shifted zzso by the use of a knee zzso The zzso shifted more than the zzso resulting in a dose benefit compared with zzso without knee zzso The shape of the zzso did not influence the zzso or prostate zzso
