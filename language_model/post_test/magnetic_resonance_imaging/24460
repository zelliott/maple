There is increasing evidence that spinal zzso injury without zzso abnormalities zzso is underreported in zzso The increasing availability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso has added substantial information, but there remains considerable disagreement concerning definition as well as diagnostic and therapeutic zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the literature is constrained by the lack of a reliable zzso system based on the zzso abnormalities zzso by zzso A comprehensive systematic review was performed to identify all the data published concerning adults experiencing zzso To assess a potential correlation between clinical and imaging findings, we developed a novel zzso zzso zzso 

Database searches were conducted for studies on zzso in adults using zzso and zzso zzso criteria were zzso traumatic spinal zzso injury with zzso deficit, zzso absence of fractures and/or zzso of the spinal column, and zzso a mature zzso Data collected included clinical and zzso zzso zzso patterns and clinical course were zzso 

zzso articles reporting zzso patients were identified, of which 44 studies reported zzso cases with zzso zzso At admission, zzso deficit assessed by the American Spinal zzso Association impairment scale zzso in zzso patients was A in zzso B in zzso C in zzso and D in zzso At final zzso these were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso no zzso abnormalities zzso I) were zzso and zzso exhibited abnormal scan results zzso zzso Of the latter, zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed combined abnormalities zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso impairment at admission and follow-up revealed significant differences in outcome between patients with different imaging zzso 

This review emphasizes the zzso value of spinal zzso for adults with zzso Using the zzso zzso system in future reports will enhance zzso and zzso and might improve our understanding of the zzso
