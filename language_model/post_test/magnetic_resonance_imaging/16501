Iron oxide zzso obtained by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were coated with a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to ensure zzso zzso The magnetic zzso were thoroughly characterized by a range of zzso methods, which proved the presence of the coating on the zzso zzso with rat zzso stem cells zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso were not zzso and that the average efficiency of stem cell labeling was good and comparable to that obtained with commercial zzso The cells labeled with zzso zzso zzso displayed excellent contrast on magnetic resonance zzso zzso Such particles are thus promising for in zzso MR imaging of transplanted zzso Moreover, zzso offers the possibility of additional modification by zzso compounds that reduce zzso protein zzso
