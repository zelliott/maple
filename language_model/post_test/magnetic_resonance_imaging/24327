The specific zzso rate is used as one of the main safety parameters in magnetic resonance zzso The performance of imaging sequences is frequently hampered by the limitations imposed on the specific zzso rate that increase in severity at higher field zzso The most well-known approach to reducing the specific zzso rate is presumably the variable rate selective zzso technique, which zzso the zzso zzso in zzso In this article, an alternative approach is introduced that uses zzso fields with zzso variations in space to reduce the specific zzso zzso The effect of such zzso fields on the relationship between the desired zzso profile and the corresponding zzso pulse is zzso The feasibility of the method is demonstrated using three examples of zzso pulse zzso Finally, the proposed method is compared with and combined with the variable rate selective zzso zzso
