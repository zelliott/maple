The aim of the study was to evaluate connectivity modifications in the zzso zzso Network zzso in patients with cerebral zzso and to correlate these modifications to tumor zzso 

zzso patients with a zzso cerebral tumor zzso grade II and 10 grade IV zzso and 14 healthy zzso right-hand volunteers were enrolled in the zzso zzso underwent zzso while performing language tasks for zzso zzso Data was analyzed with independent component analysis in order to identify the zzso zzso group maps were produced by zzso analysis zzso zzso An analysis of zzso across the three groups zzso and zzso zzso contrasts between pairs of groups were calculated zzso zzso 

All three groups showed typical zzso zzso However, reduced zzso connectivity was detected in tumor patients with respect to zzso A significantly increased and reduced integration of zzso areas was observed in the zzso and prefrontal regions, zzso zzso were closely related to tumor zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso to tumor in the zzso but not in the high-grade tumor zzso 

zzso of zzso connectivity were induced by zzso and differed for high and low grade zzso
