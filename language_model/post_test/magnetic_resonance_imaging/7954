To evaluate the diagnostic values of the superior zzso recess sign in patients with shoulder adhesive zzso The sign consists in evaluating in zzso of the shoulder the presence of fluid zzso of the zzso in the superior zzso zzso 

We evaluated zzso of 165 shoulders in 48 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of shoulder adhesive zzso in the freezing phase zzso zzso in 49 zzso superior cuff tear zzso zzso and in 65 controls zzso zzso between 2010 and zzso On the zzso weighted images, we evaluated the presence of an high intensity signal within the superior zzso zzso consistent with fluid zzso of the zzso 

The sign was found in zzso patients zzso with shoulder adhesive zzso in zzso zzso patients with superior cuff tear and in zzso controls zzso zzso The mean diagnostic values were: sensibility zzso specificity zzso positive zzso value zzso negative zzso value zzso likelihood ratios for an abnormal test result zzso likelihood ratios for a normal test result zzso 

For the orthopedic surgeon or the clinician, the sign is useful to confirm in zzso the clinical diagnosis of shoulder adhesive zzso zzso the zzso should describe and relate this sign to the pathology in the report, looking eventually for further typical sign of shoulder adhesive zzso
