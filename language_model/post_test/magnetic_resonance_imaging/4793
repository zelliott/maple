We used zzso magnetic resonance image analysis and an zzso battery of zzso tests to measure brain zzso and cognitive function in 14 older zzso alcoholic men and 11 older controls in the expectation that these subject groups would show the greatest and most persistent cerebral effects zzso to chronic zzso The zzso zzso exhibited cognitive zzso zzso in memory and zzso zzso compared with the zzso In contrast, we found no difference in global cerebral zzso between the groups, although two zzso had extensive zzso compared with all other zzso However, there was a stronger association between age and zzso zzso in the alcoholic sample compared with zzso We conclude that a zzso other than magnetic resonance zzso global zzso must zzso the persistent cognitive zzso evident in the sampled zzso Furthermore, if there are global zzso changes in the brain associated with chronic alcoholism, these effects are not ubiquitous and/or may be zzso in most patients with sufficient zzso
