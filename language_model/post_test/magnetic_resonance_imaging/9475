To examine the differential features of focal zzso liver disease zzso from liver zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty patients with 41 zzso and 20 patients with 55 zzso were enrolled in this zzso Liver zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso image zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso portal, 20 zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Images were analyzed for the margin and shape of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso signal intensity of the zzso on zzso zzso presence of rim enhancement and zzso zzso and presence of significant smaller zzso on the zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso phase zzso 

zzso analysis revealed the following significant parameters to favor zzso a fuzzy margin, irregular shape, subtle signal intensity changes on zzso and zzso absence of target signs on the zzso phase image, presence of zzso signs, and size discrepancies on zzso and zzso phase zzso zzso analysis revealed only a significantly smaller zzso size on zzso compared to zzso phase images to be zzso of zzso 

A significantly smaller zzso size on zzso relative to zzso phase image is the best predictor for identifying zzso on zzso zzso zzso
