A zzso MR chemical shift imaging zzso technique is presented which enables selective imaging of the zzso drug zzso zzso and its major zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence employs a chemical shift selective zzso zzso pulse to suppress either the zzso or the zzso resonance before the other component of the zzso zzso MR spectrum is zzso Because the zzso frequency can always be set to the zzso frequency of the zzso resonance to be zzso this approach yields zzso and zzso MR images free of chemical shift artifacts in zzso and zzso zzso In phantom experiments, selective zzso and zzso images with a spatial resolution of 15 zzso 15 zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso were obtained in 30 zzso from a model solution, whose drug and zzso zzso were similar to those estimated in the liver of tumor patients undergoing IV chemotherapy with zzso The zzso MR imaging technique developed is, therefore, zzso for the direct and zzso monitoring of the zzso and zzso of zzso in liver tumors in zzso
