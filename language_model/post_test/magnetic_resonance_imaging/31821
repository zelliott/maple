The purpose of this study was to report the magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of multiple zzso zzso zzso and to correlate them with zzso zzso features of 11 patients with zzso proven by zzso were zzso reviewed and correlated to zzso zzso presented as zzso zzso and zzso distributed zzso in all zzso All were zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso images relative to the liver zzso zzso zzso were identified in 10 of 11 zzso zzso They were zzso on zzso images, intermediate signal on zzso zzso zzso images showed mural zzso enhancement in 9 of 10 patients zzso or a peripheral zzso enhancement of the whole zzso in one case zzso zzso were present in all liver zzso In the six patients examined at MR zzso the zzso lacked communication with the zzso zzso At zzso the mural zzso corresponded to an zzso zzso projection made of zzso zzso Three zzso patients had associated focal zzso zzso and 1 zzso had zzso zzso zzso features allowed diagnosis of zzso with zzso Their recognition, especially the mural zzso may help avoid zzso
