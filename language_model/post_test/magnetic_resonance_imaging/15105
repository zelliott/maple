zzso with zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso knee zzso has a well-established positive effect on clinical zzso This effect, however, is only temporary and the working mechanism of zzso injections is not zzso It was suggested that zzso might have disease zzso properties because of its beneficial effect on cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso Delayed zzso zzso of cartilage zzso is a highly zzso zzso surrogate measure for zzso content and hence composition of zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether improvement in cartilage structural composition is detected using zzso 14 weeks after 3 weekly injections with zzso in patients with zzso knee zzso 

In 20 zzso knee zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso was acquired before and 14 weeks after 3 weekly injections with zzso To evaluate patient symptoms, the knee injury and zzso outcome score zzso and a zzso rating scale zzso for pain were zzso To evaluate cartilage zzso six cartilage regions in the knee were analyzed on zzso Outcomes of zzso zzso and zzso before and after zzso were compared using paired zzso Since we performed multiple zzso we applied a zzso correction to determine statistical significance for these zzso 

All zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and the zzso pain improved significantly 14 weeks after zzso with zzso Outcomes of zzso did not change significantly after zzso compared to baseline in any of the cartilage regions analyzed in the zzso 

Our results confirm previous findings reported in the literature, showing zzso improvement in symptomatic outcome measures in zzso knee zzso patients 14 weeks after zzso Outcomes of zzso however, did not change after zzso indicating no change in cartilage structural composition as an explanation for the improvement of clinical zzso
