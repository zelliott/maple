The current source during zzso zzso of the in zzso heart has not been well zzso We analyzed current zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in 16 healthy subjects and 10 patients with the zzso syndrome or premature zzso zzso Single current zzso were estimated by zzso with the spatial position, direction, and strength in the initial 40 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In 12 of the 16 healthy subjects, the origin of current zzso moved zzso from the initial position with the increase in the peak strength at 30 zzso of zzso In the other 4 healthy subjects, zzso moved zzso jumping to the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso In abnormal zzso zzso the zzso remained in the initial position with little movement, smaller strength of zzso than that of normal with a delayed peak zzso The moving zzso analysis can be applied to determine spatial distribution of normal and abnormal zzso sources at the initial phase of zzso zzso in the in zzso zzso
