The zzso flash illusion is an zzso zzso a single flash is presented along with two or more zzso observers report seeing two or more zzso Previous research has shown that the illusion gradually disappears as the zzso delay between auditory and visual stimuli increases, suggesting that the illusion is consistent with existing zzso rules of neural zzso in the superior zzso to zzso zzso However little is known about the effect of spatial zzso and whether the illusion follows the corresponding spatial zzso If the illusion occurs less strongly when auditory and visual stimuli are zzso then zzso processes supporting the illusion must be strongly zzso on spatial zzso In this case, the illusion would be consistent with both the spatial and zzso rules describing response properties of zzso zzso in the superior zzso 

The main aim of this study was to investigate the importance of spatial zzso in the zzso zzso zzso combinations of one to four short flashes and zero to four short zzso zzso tones were zzso zzso were asked to count the number of flashes they zzso After replication of the basic illusion using zzso zzso the auditory and visual components of the illusion stimuli were presented either both 10 degrees to the left or right of fixation zzso zzso or on opposite zzso zzso sides, for a total separation of 20 zzso 

The zzso flash zzso illusion was successfully zzso However, when the sources of the auditory and visual stimuli were zzso zzso perception of the illusion was zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso does not extend to describing zzso responses in this zzso We also find no evidence for an associated zzso illusion reportedly occurring when multiple flashes are accompanied by a single zzso
