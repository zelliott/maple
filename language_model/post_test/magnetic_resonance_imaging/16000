There have been few studies that investigated and clarified the relationships between progression of degenerative changes and zzso alignment of the cervical zzso The objective of the study was to zzso evaluate the relationships among progression of degenerative changes of the cervical spine with age, the development of clinical symptoms and zzso alignment of the cervical spine in healthy zzso Out of 497 zzso volunteers who underwent zzso and plain zzso of the cervical spine between 1994 and 1996, 113 subjects zzso males and 68 zzso who responded to our contacts were zzso All subjects underwent another zzso at an average of zzso years after the initial zzso Their mean age at the time of the initial imaging was zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso The items evaluated on zzso were zzso decrease in signal intensity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso disk zzso and zzso disk space zzso Each item was evaluated using a zzso grading zzso The subjects were divided into four groups according to the age and zzso alignment of the cervical spine, zzso subjects under or over the age of 40 years, and subjects with the zzso or zzso type of zzso alignment of the cervical zzso During the 10-year period, progression of decrease in signal intensity of the zzso zzso disk zzso and disk space narrowing were recognized in zzso zzso and zzso of the subjects, zzso zzso of zzso disk zzso was significantly more frequent in subjects over 40 years of age with zzso type of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that stiff shoulder was closely correlated with females zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of the upper zzso was closely correlated with age zzso zzso zzso and male zzso zzso zzso However, no significant correlation between the zzso alignment of the cervical spine and clinical symptoms was zzso zzso alignment of the cervical spine had some impact on the progression of degenerative changes of the cervical spine with zzso however, it had no correlation with the occurrence of future clinical zzso
