zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare, progressive, inflammatory neurodegenerative zzso Our aim was to determine the zzso abnormalities of brain in zzso and late-stage zzso by using MR zzso and to assess areas of involvement in the early stages when MR imaging findings were zzso 

Children with stage II zzso zzso 3) or III zzso zzso 3) zzso and 10 healthy, zzso children underwent MR imaging, zzso MR zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso zzso Areas of involvement in the brain were determined with chemical shift zzso For zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso were placed in the frontal zzso white matter zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratios were zzso 

Comparisons of zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratios between patients and control subjects showed significant differences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso ratios in zzso were significantly less than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios in patients with stage II zzso and those in the control group were not significantly zzso this may reflect the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso ratios, and increased zzso and zzso zzso were found in patients with stage III zzso 

MR zzso showed findings suggestive of inflammation in stage II and findings of zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso metabolism in stage zzso MR zzso could be a promising technique for early diagnosis and treatment planning in cases of zzso
