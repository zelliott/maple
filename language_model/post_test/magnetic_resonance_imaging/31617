In zzso zzso workers may be exposed to strong zzso and dynamic magnetic fields outside of the zzso Body motion through the strong, zzso zzso magnetic field generated by the main zzso magnet and exposure to zzso magnetic fields can result in the induction of electric fields and current zzso in the zzso The interaction of these fields and occupational workers has attracted an increasing zzso To protect occupational workers from zzso the member states of the European Union are required to incorporate the Physical Agents zzso zzso zzso into their zzso This study presents zzso evaluations of electric fields and current zzso in zzso equivalent male and female human models zzso zzso as they lean towards the zzso of three zzso magnet models zzso 4, and 7 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The combined effect of the zzso T zzso magnet and the three zzso coils on the body models is compared with the contributions of the magnet and zzso coils in zzso The simulation results indicate that it is possible to induce field quantities of zzso significance, especially when the zzso operator is zzso close towards the main magnet and all three zzso coils are switched zzso
