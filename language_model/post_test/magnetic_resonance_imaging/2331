The objective of this study was to validate the zzso three-dimensional zzso method in patients with abnormal zzso geometry compared with two-dimensional zzso using magnetic resonance imaging as a zzso 

zzso zzso methods for zzso left zzso volume and mass in clinical use today are limited by zzso and variations caused by use of geometric assumptions and errors in image plane zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso with operator guidance by a zzso of zzso display eliminates these assumptions and zzso This method of volume and mass zzso has been validated as highly accurate and zzso in healthy zzso 

Left zzso zzso and zzso volumes and zzso mass were determined by zzso three-dimensional zzso by conventional two-dimensional zzso using the zzso zzso zzso of discs method zzso and the truncated zzso method zzso by zzso zzso using the Penn method zzso and by magnetic resonance imaging in 30 patients selected only for the presence of an abnormal zzso zzso were compared by means of linear zzso and the zzso method of zzso 

There was excellent zzso low bias, and low zzso between three-dimensional zzso and magnetic resonance imaging for zzso volume zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was less accurate and more variable as zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass determination zzso zzso was least accurate and most variable zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso 

zzso three-dimensional zzso is a method of high accuracy and low zzso for computing left zzso volume and mass in clinical patients with abnormal zzso It is superior to conventional one- and two-dimensional zzso The improvement achieved is attributed to elimination of geometric assumptions and image plane positioning errors and additional sampling of the zzso
