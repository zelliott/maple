The prognosis for zzso disease zzso among young patients is known to be worse than that among older zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and treatment outcomes of young patients with zzso 

A total of 204 patients with zzso who underwent zzso with or without zzso zzso were zzso into three groups according to their ages at the time of surgery, zzso Group A zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso of age), Group B zzso zzso 50, 3-6 zzso of age), and Group C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso For each group, patterns of presentation and the occurrence of subsequent zzso or zzso zzso were zzso Clinical outcomes and zzso zzso status were zzso 

At initial zzso zzso were significantly more frequent in Group A zzso and Group B zzso than in Group C zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred significantly more frequently in Group A zzso than in Group B zzso or Group C zzso The median zzso between the onset of symptoms and a subsequent zzso zzso was 3 months zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in the rates of zzso zzso among the three groups was zzso The rate of favorable clinical outcomes was significantly lower in Group A zzso than in Group B zzso or Group C zzso although the rates of zzso zzso improvements were similar among the zzso The poor clinical outcomes for Group A were caused mainly by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrates rapid disease progression and results in poor clinical zzso These findings indicate the necessity of early surgery for young patients with zzso however, the actual benefits should be verified with additional controlled studies, with long-term follow-up zzso
