The objective of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso zzso of zzso are lower in several brain regions of zzso and zzso subjects with bipolar disorder as compared with matched healthy zzso zzso subjects zzso and zzso and zzso healthy control zzso were studied using zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging on a zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso and zzso values were zzso to yield zzso zzso Fourteen regions of interest and five zzso zzso in each subject were selected for statistical zzso We found that bipolar subjects had significantly decreased zzso zzso in both zzso heads and the left zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the head of the right zzso were also significantly decreased in bipolar zzso zzso increased zzso was found in the left zzso head in bipolar zzso zzso subjects showed significantly decreased zzso zzso in the frontal white matter zzso and in the right zzso zzso No differences were found for other zzso zzso These preliminary findings suggest decreased zzso density or viability in the zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities in the frontal zzso of subjects with bipolar zzso
