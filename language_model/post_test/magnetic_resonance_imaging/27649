To investigate the particular pathology of the Arctic zzso zzso zzso familial zzso disease zzso zzso for the first time in zzso with PET in comparison with other zzso zzso and sporadic zzso disease zzso 

We examined 2 zzso zzso carriers together with 5 zzso siblings zzso with zzso Pittsburgh compound B zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Likewise, we examined 7 patients with zzso 1 carrier of a zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 carrier of the Swedish zzso zzso zzso and 7 healthy controls zzso 

zzso zzso retention was very low in the zzso zzso carriers while cerebral zzso metabolism and zzso levels of zzso total and zzso zzso were clearly zzso This was in contrast to the zzso and zzso zzso carriers revealing high zzso retention in the zzso and the zzso in combination with abnormal zzso metabolism and zzso zzso and the patients with zzso who showed typically high cortical zzso retention and zzso zzso levels as well as decreased zzso metabolism when compared with zzso 

The lack of zzso zzso zzso as zzso by zzso PET in zzso zzso carriers suggests, given the reduced zzso metabolism and levels of zzso in zzso that other forms of zzso such as zzso and zzso are important for the zzso processes leading to clinical zzso zzso
