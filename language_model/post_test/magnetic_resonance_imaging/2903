The magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of 27 zzso proven acoustic zzso in 24 patients (13 men, 11 women, age zzso zzso are described in zzso Three patients had bilateral zzso Twenty-two tumors zzso had zzso and zzso zzso three tumors zzso were limited to the internal auditory canal zzso and two tumors zzso were limited to the zzso angle zzso The diameters of zzso zzso in the zzso ranged from 12 to 50 zzso and most of them were round in zzso All zzso portions of zzso tumors had a zzso appearance on the zzso images and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso There was strong homogeneous contrast enhancement of the solid components in 12 tumors zzso and zzso enhancement in 15 tumors zzso The zzso components of the tumors correlated well with the zzso zzso All tumors could be demonstrated in their zzso by zzso The zzso zzso first described in this study, helped to confirm the zzso component of acoustic zzso which were usually found in the zzso zzso The results of this study show that zzso is a sensitive imaging zzso for the assessment of acoustic zzso located at the zzso or zzso or in both zzso zzso is zzso and does not involve zzso zzso It should be considered the imaging examination of choice to evaluate patients with suspected acoustic zzso
