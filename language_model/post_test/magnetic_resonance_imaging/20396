Our zzso study compares the neural zzso of zzso zzso in healthy individuals with an zzso zzso versus zzso cognitive style zzso The zzso group consists of individuals that score high on zzso and low on zzso while the zzso group consists of individuals with an opposite cognitive zzso We zzso that the zzso group will show stronger zzso neural activity zzso in mirror zzso areas, zzso prefrontal cortex, anterior zzso zzso or zzso neural activity zzso in areas involved in perspective taking and experiential zzso compared to the zzso zzso As hypothesized, our study reveals that the zzso group shows significantly stronger activity in mirror zzso areas of the brain, such as the left inferior frontal zzso and inferior zzso zzso and in zzso areas involved in perspective taking and autobiographical zzso Moreover, the zzso group, but not the zzso group, shows activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso which have been related to zzso neural activity in the brain and are central to zzso Also, the zzso group shows significantly stronger activity in the left zzso zzso In conclusion, both the zzso and zzso individuals show zzso and zzso neural activity during zzso zzso However, more neural activity indicative of zzso processing is seen in the zzso individuals, while more neural activity indicative of zzso processing is seen in the zzso zzso
