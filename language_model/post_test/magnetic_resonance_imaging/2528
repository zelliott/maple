We investigated the functional anatomy involved in sustaining or switching visual attention between different zzso levels, using functional imaging measures of neural zzso Two experiments were carried out using zzso organized letters zzso large letters made out of small zzso In a zzso task, subjects were required to switch attention between local and global zzso The number of successive stimuli for which subjects had to sustain attention to either the global or local level zzso significantly with zzso zzso zzso Other zzso were also observed in the right zzso cortex, the right zzso prefrontal cortex, and the right middle zzso zzso The number of switches between levels zzso significantly with zzso in the left supplementary motor area and the left zzso zzso zzso In the zzso task, subjects were required to attend to either the global or local level of the stimuli throughout all zzso attention to the global aspect resulted in significant zzso of the right zzso zzso while attention to the local aspect significantly activated the left inferior zzso zzso We suggest that left zzso zzso with increasing numbers of switches between zzso levels reflect increased demands on an executive zzso system, while sustained attention to either level activates a predominantly right zzso network involving zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso Overall, the results provide evidence for relative zzso specialization for global and local processing in accordance with previous zzso zzso In addition, the findings demonstrate that early visual processing mechanisms in the zzso zzso are influenced by an zzso system in zzso zzso
