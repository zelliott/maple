With the use of magnetic resonance zzso zzso the options and limitations of this modern technique in zzso teeth and zzso should be zzso zzso extracted teeth were stored in zzso and measured in two different devices of the magnetic resonance zzso One is common for material research and normally used for zzso of zzso zzso takes place in the zzso of the magnet which leads to the term zzso Field zzso zzso The other one is a zzso with an additional zzso device zzso resonance zzso where resolutions up to zzso zzso can be zzso For the first time the zzso allowed to make pictures from the zzso of the zzso hard zzso A two or three zzso imaging on the basis of microscopic resolution became zzso In addition the zzso allowed to depict the soft tissue portion and the outer zzso of the teeth in zzso and zzso The two-dimensional pictures were able to show a texture within the pulp zzso The three-dimensional images enabled a zzso and zzso zzso of the outer surface and the pulp zzso The results shown here open very new perspectives for zzso
