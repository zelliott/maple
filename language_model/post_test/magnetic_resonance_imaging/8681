zzso zzso Imaging zzso is increasingly used in clinical zzso for a rapidly growing number of zzso The zzso technique is zzso and can provide information on the zzso function and metabolism of zzso in zzso zzso scans of tissue anatomy and function make use of the two hydrogen atoms in water to generate the zzso Apart from differences in the local water content, the basic contrast in the MR image mainly results from regional differences in the intrinsic relaxation times zzso and zzso each of which can be independently chosen to dominate image zzso However, the intrinsic contrast provided by the water zzso and zzso and changes in their values brought about by tissue pathology are often too limited to enable a sensitive and specific zzso For that reason increasing use is made of zzso contrast agents that alter the image contrast following intravenous zzso The degree and location of the contrast changes provide substantial diagnostic zzso Certain contrast agents are predominantly used to shorten the zzso relaxation time and these are mainly based on zzso weight zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The most widely used zzso zzso agents are based on iron oxide zzso zzso Depending on their chemical zzso molecular structure and overall size, the in zzso distribution volume and zzso properties vary widely between different contrast agents and these largely determine their use in specific diagnostic zzso This review describes the current status, as well as recent and future developments of zzso contrast agents with focus on applications in zzso First the basis of MR image contrast and how it is altered by contrast agents will be zzso After some considerations on zzso and zzso specific applications of contrast agents will be presented according to their specific purposes, starting with zzso contrast agents used in classical contrast enhanced magnetic resonance zzso zzso and dynamic contrast enhanced zzso Next targeted contrast agents, which are actively directed towards a specific molecular target using an appropriate zzso functional contrast agents, mainly used for functional brain and heart imaging, smart contrast agents, which generate contrast as a response to a change in their physical environment as a consequence of some biological process, and finally cell labeling agents will be zzso To conclude some future perspectives are zzso
