zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of the brain have shown that cortical reorganization might contribute to a more zzso clinical outcome of multiple sclerosis zzso In order to assess whether zzso changes can also be detected in the spinal zzso from patients with zzso and to investigate their nature and extent, zzso patients and 12 matched healthy controls were scanned during a tactile stimulation of the palm of the right zzso The zzso mean signal change was zzso for all activated zzso within the cervical zzso and, zzso in the right and left zzso right and left zzso and middle cervical zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso number, brain zzso zzso load, gray matter mean zzso zzso and normal appearing white matter MD and fractional zzso were also zzso One control and one patient were excluded prior to zzso analysis due to motion zzso The zzso signal change of all zzso activated zzso was zzso zzso for controls and zzso zzso for zzso patients zzso Compared with controls, zzso patients showed a higher signal change in the following zzso zzso right anterior at zzso zzso right anterior zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and middle at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients showed a more frequent zzso activity in the left zzso cervical zzso at zzso than controls zzso No significant correlation was found between zzso zzso changes and brain structural zzso zzso In zzso patients, the zzso of the zzso zzso cervical zzso associated to a reduced functional zzso suggests an abnormal function of the spinal relay zzso
