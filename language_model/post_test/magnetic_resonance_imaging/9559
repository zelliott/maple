Two patients with isolated zzso zzso are zzso Both showed zzso zzso zzso zzso due to impaired character recall, zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduction in character size during zzso after a zzso that involved the zzso lateral and zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso revealed zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso Area 6) and anterior zzso zzso in zzso Six months later, the extent of blood flow reduction decreased in the zzso zzso in both patients and the zzso zzso in patient zzso By this time, the writing impairment improved to nearly the normal zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in Western zzso with poor zzso formation and zzso arises from a zzso in the zzso lateral and zzso zzso in the left zzso The accompaniment of poor zzso formation and zzso may reflect disruption of the zzso motor circuit involving the zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is also suggested that multiple cortical sites can be a target for secondary dysfunction that yields zzso in a zzso zzso and that the recovery of reduced cortical blood flow does not always proceed in parallel with that of zzso
