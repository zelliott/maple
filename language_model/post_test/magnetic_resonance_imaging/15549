The capacity to voluntarily regulate emotions is critical for mental health, especially when coping with aversive zzso Several zzso studies of emotion regulation found the zzso to be a target for zzso and prefrontal regions to be associated with zzso To characterize the role of prefrontal regions in zzso emotion regulation and to investigate regulatory influences on zzso activity and peripheral zzso measures, a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study with simultaneous recording of zzso startle zzso and skin zzso responses was carried zzso zzso viewed zzso pictures and were asked to zzso and zzso their emotional responses using zzso zzso While startle zzso responses (in successful zzso and skin zzso responses were amplified during zzso but showed no consistent effect during zzso zzso activity was increased and decreased according to the regulation zzso zzso ratings of regulation success correlated positively with activity in zzso during zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso was characterized by zzso zzso zzso in anterior zzso cortex, zzso prefrontal cortex, and zzso zzso and zzso was characterized by a pattern of prefrontal zzso not restricted to the left zzso Further analyses showed significant overlap of prefrontal zzso across both regulation conditions, possibly reflecting cognitive processes underlying both zzso and zzso but also showed distinct zzso in each zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso responses to zzso stimuli can be controlled through the use of cognitive strategies depending on recruitment of prefrontal areas, thereby changing the zzso affective zzso
