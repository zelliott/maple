We applied zzso zzso diffusion zzso imaging zzso to two patients with zzso zzso Data were analyzed using zzso color-coded images and a 3-D tract reconstruction technique for the study of altered white matter zzso Each tumor was near two major white matter zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Those tracts were identified using the color-coded zzso and spatial relationships with the tumors were zzso In one patient the tumor displaced adjacent white matter zzso whereas in the other it infiltrated the superior zzso zzso without displacement of white zzso zzso provides new information regarding the detailed relationship between tumor growth and nearby white matter zzso which may be useful for zzso zzso
