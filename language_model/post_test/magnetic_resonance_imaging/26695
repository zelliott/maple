To monitor joint inflammation and destruction in zzso arthritis zzso patients receiving zzso combination therapy using zzso and zzso To assess the zzso value of zzso and zzso for zzso progression on CT and compare zzso for erosion zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were followed with repeated zzso zzso zzso and zzso assessments during zzso combination zzso 

No overall erosion progression or repair was observed at 6 or 12 months zzso p zzso zzso but erosion zzso and zzso were observed using the smallest zzso change zzso Scores of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and power zzso zzso decreased after 6 and 12 months zzso zzso zzso as did zzso zzso and tender and swollen joint counts zzso zzso zzso Patients with progression on CT had higher baseline zzso bone zzso zzso The zzso for CT progression in bones with versus without baseline zzso bone zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso bone zzso power zzso and zzso scores were higher in zzso with CT progression zzso p zzso zzso With CT as the reference method, zzso for erosion in zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Median zzso correlation zzso was zzso zzso zzso 

During zzso combination therapy, no overall zzso progression or repair occurred, whereas repair of individual zzso was documented on zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso especially zzso bone zzso was zzso for zzso progression on CT, at zzso level and zzso bone zzso also at patient zzso
