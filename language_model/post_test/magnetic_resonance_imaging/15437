Our zzso planning and navigation system has proven its capacity for accurate surgery on the anterior and lateral skull zzso With the incorporation of zzso reality, zzso surgery will evolve into zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso skull base surgery is technically demanding and its outcome has a great impact on a patient's quality of zzso The goal of the project was aimed at developing and evaluating enabling navigation surgery tools for zzso planning, training, education, and zzso This clinically applied technological research was zzso by a series of patients zzso who were treated by anterior and lateral skull base procedures between 1997 and zzso 

zzso tracking technology was used for zzso sensing of zzso A newly designed dynamic reference base with specific registration techniques using fine needle zzso or ultrasound enables the surgeon to work with a target error of zzso 1 zzso An automatic registration assessment method, which provides the user with a color-coded fused representation of CT and MR images, indicates to the surgeon the location and extent of registration zzso zzso of a small tracker camera mounted directly on the microscope permits an advantageous zzso way of working in the operating zzso Additionally, guidance information zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso directly onto the surgical microscope zzso The virtual simulator as a training tool in zzso and zzso skull base surgery provides an understanding of the anatomy as well as zzso practice using real patient zzso 

Using our navigation system, no major complications occurred in spite of the fact that the series included difficult skull base zzso An improved quality in the surgical outcome was identified compared with our control group without navigation and compared with the zzso The surgical time consumption was reduced and more minimally invasive approaches were zzso According to the zzso zzso the educational effect of the virtual simulator in our residency program received a high zzso
