zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso findings might determine zzso of a zzso in symptomatic zzso during zzso zzso To evaluate the additive effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso findings were compared to zzso findings from zzso of patients with zzso zzso 

In 28 patients with drug-resistant zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of different zzso (20 zzso 6 zzso and 2 extended zzso zzso were compared to zzso findings from long-term zzso monitoring and validated by zzso and zzso outcome zzso zzso 2 years zzso zzso 

The mean distance between a zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The distance to the zzso was on average zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso and on average zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso findings were consistent with zzso findings in all patients, although they were sometimes distributed over multiple zzso and zzso pronounced on the side of the zzso zzso zzso outcome of Engel 1 could be achieved in zzso zzso zzso and none of the patients had an outcome worse than Engel zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso zzso are able to determine zzso of zzso and lateral zzso lobe zzso zzso results are consistent with zzso zzso findings from long-term zzso Future studies should assess the zzso of zzso by zzso in selected zzso
