zzso transplantation of zzso zzso cells zzso has been previously correlated with significant zzso of zzso and improvement of left zzso function following zzso zzso However, precise zzso zzso of the transplanted cells and the extent of in zzso cell migration are zzso We present a novel technique using magnetic resonance imaging zzso to zzso transplanted zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso cells were isolated from human peripheral blood by magnetic zzso zzso zzso cells adhere to zzso zzso coated magnetic zzso while zzso cells do zzso All cells were labeled with fluorescent zzso for zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso cells zzso 1 zzso 106 and 2 zzso 106 zzso were transplanted into zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) of zzso zzso zzso were sacrificed 24 h after cell zzso The zzso hearts were zzso ex zzso using 3 and zzso T zzso zzso correlation between the zzso findings and fluorescent zzso for identification of retained zzso cells was zzso 

zzso cells were identified as areas of low signal intensity on zzso images within the zzso These areas increased in size with the gradual increase in the echo time due to zzso zzso The extent of the low signal intensity at a given echo time was zzso to cell zzso No areas of low signal were identified in the zzso cell transplanted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells documented a direct zzso correlation with the zzso of transplanted cells on the zzso zzso 

zzso labeled zzso transplanted for therapeutic zzso in zzso zzso can be zzso with ex zzso zzso at zzso zzso
