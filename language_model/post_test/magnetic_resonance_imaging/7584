The prevalence of zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso has been the subject of implant recalls and warnings from various regulatory zzso To date, there is no consensus on whether ultrasound or zzso is superior for the detection of zzso 

We zzso compared ultrasound to zzso for zzso detection in an zzso cohort of patients with zzso zzso We also compared ultrasound to zzso for assessment of zzso growth and progressive soft tissue involvement at a zzso zzso 

We enrolled 40 patients with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The mean age was 54 years zzso zzso zzso The mean time from surgery was 54 months zzso zzso zzso There were 28 men and 12 zzso All patients underwent ultrasound and zzso using slice zzso for metal artifact zzso The gold standard was defined as zzso if both ultrasound and zzso agreed, this was interpreted as zzso and the result was considered zzso 

zzso and zzso agreed in 37 of 40 patients zzso The prevalence of zzso was zzso (12 of zzso in our zzso zzso of 39 patients zzso had completely normal tests and four zzso had simple fluid zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso while zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso 

A negative ultrasound rules out zzso in zzso patients as this test is zzso zzso Given its lower cost, we recommend ultrasound as the initial screening tool for zzso
