The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso technique was performed in 28 patients with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso A three-dimensional zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso sequence was used to create zzso reconstructions of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tree or pancreatic duct in 23 patients due to zzso zzso or strictures was depicted with excellent contrast zzso The approximate level of obstruction and all zzso were accurately predicted by zzso In another 3 patients no cause was found for the zzso zzso In the last 2 cases no abnormalities were found by either zzso or zzso retrograde zzso zzso The zzso technique at zzso T is an accurate method for the assessment of pathology of the zzso zzso
