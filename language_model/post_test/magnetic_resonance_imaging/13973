This functional magnetic resonance imaging study verified an zzso pattern in which a zzso zzso of zzso primary zzso zzso was coupled to the zzso zzso zzso in healthy controls during zzso hand zzso Of note, dramatic reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed during movement of intact hands by patients with unilateral zzso zzso zzso We propose that the disappearance of the zzso pattern of zzso activities in the patients with zzso zzso injury reflects a reduction of zzso zzso which may mirror an zzso mechanism to functional zzso
