The objectives of the study were to compare MR imaging at zzso and zzso T in the same patients concerning image quality and zzso of cartilage pathology and to assess diagnostic performance using zzso as a standard of zzso 

Twenty-six patients were identified zzso as having comparative zzso and zzso T MR studies of the knee within an average of 102 zzso Standard protocols included zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso sequences in three zzso sequence parameters had been adjusted to account for differences in relaxation at zzso zzso zzso was performed in 19 zzso Four zzso reviewed each study zzso scored image quality, and analyzed pathological zzso zzso zzso and zzso in diagnosing cartilage zzso were calculated in the 19 patients with zzso and differences between zzso and zzso T exams were compared using paired zzso zzso tests with a significance threshold of p zzso zzso 

Each zzso scored the zzso T studies higher than those obtained at zzso T in visualizing anatomical structures and abnormalities zzso zzso zzso Using zzso as a standard of reference, diagnosis of cartilage abnormalities was improved at zzso T with higher sensitivity zzso versus zzso accuracy zzso versus zzso and correct grading of cartilage zzso zzso versus zzso zzso confidence scores were higher at zzso than zzso T zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio at zzso T was approximately twofold higher than at zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso T improved zzso of anatomical structures and improved diagnostic confidence compared to zzso zzso This resulted in significantly better sensitivity and grading of cartilage zzso at the zzso
