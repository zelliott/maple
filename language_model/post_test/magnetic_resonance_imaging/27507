It is well established that there is individual zzso in pain and temperature zzso zzso brain imaging studies have found that zzso heat pain zzso zzso with brain activity in sensory and pain zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that these individual differences are associated with zzso in gray matter thickness of cortical regions involved in zzso and zzso To test this, we investigated the relationship between zzso thresholds and cortical thickness in 80 healthy zzso zzso underwent a zzso session to determine their cool detection zzso warm detection zzso cold pain zzso and heat pain zzso zzso A high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scan was acquired for each zzso We correlated each threshold measure to cortical thickness of regions associated with zzso and zzso The mean zzso zzso thresholds were zzso zzso zzso zzso for CD, zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The brain gray matter analysis revealed a strong correlation between greater zzso and pain sensitivity and cortical zzso of the primary zzso zzso Additionally, greater sensitivity to cool stimuli correlated with cortical zzso in the zzso zzso and greater zzso correlated with cortical thinning in the anterior zzso zzso We also found that greater zzso sensitivity correlated with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These cortical gray matter zzso of zzso and pain sensitivity provide a neural basis for individual differences in zzso zzso
