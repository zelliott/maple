zzso based on magnetic resonance imaging for the measurement of three-dimensional zzso of radiation dose are highly zzso However, relatively little work has been done on optical zzso zzso zzso This paper describes a new zzso scanner based on a broad beam light source and a two-dimensional zzso device zzso zzso A number of key design features are discussed including the light zzso the scanning tank, turntable and zzso motor zzso the zzso screen onto which images are projected and the zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso sensitivity of the low-cost zzso detector used and the zzso of the zzso screen lead to a serious ring zzso in the reconstructed zzso zzso are described for eliminating zzso The problems arising from reflection and refraction at the walls of the gel container are zzso zzso zzso simulations are presented for zzso containers with a variety of zzso and verified zzso Small changes in the model parameters lead to large variations in the signal intensity observed in the projection zzso The effect of imperfect containers on data quality is discussed and a method based on a zzso zzso is shown to be successful in correcting many of the related image zzso The results of two zzso experiments are zzso In the first experiment, a zzso zzso gel sample was exposed four times in different positions to a 100 zzso zzso beam perpendicular to the plane of zzso Images of absorbed dose with slice thickness of 140 zzso were zzso with zzso zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso at the edge of the 72 zzso field of view and zzso higher resolution at the zzso The nominal doses measured correlated well with the known exposure zzso The second experiment demonstrated the well known phenomenon of diffusion in the zzso gels and yielded a value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the diffusion zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the overall implications of the above findings for zzso using zzso are zzso
