zzso arteries are the preferred site of peripheral zzso for zzso inflow in type A zzso dissection zzso The presence of zzso zzso severe peripheral zzso disease, zzso of the zzso vessels, and zzso extension of the zzso dissection may zzso their zzso zzso artery zzso may represent a valid alternative in these zzso 

Between January 15, 1989, and August 20, 1998, in our institution, 22 of 152 operations zzso for acute type A zzso dissection were performed with the use of the zzso artery for the zzso zzso zzso artery zzso was undertaken in the presence of zzso arteries zzso compromised by dissection in 12 patients zzso abdominal zzso and peripheral aneurysm in 5 patients zzso severe zzso of both zzso arteries in 3 patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease in 2 patients zzso In all patients, zzso zzso was performed with an open technique after deep zzso circulatory zzso zzso cerebral zzso was used in 9 patients zzso 

zzso artery zzso was successful in all zzso The left zzso artery was zzso in 20 patients zzso and the right zzso artery was zzso in 2 patients zzso zzso artery zzso followed an attempt of zzso artery zzso in 15 patients zzso zzso All patients survived the operation, and no patient had a cerebrovascular zzso No zzso artery zzso no zzso zzso injury, and no zzso zzso were recorded in this zzso Two patients zzso died in the hospital of complications not related to zzso artery zzso 

In patients with type A zzso dissection in whom zzso arteries are acutely or chronically zzso zzso artery zzso represents a safe and effective means of providing zzso inflow during zzso zzso
