In the present study, we examined the relationship between zzso zzso of zzso brain systems and adolescents' zzso with social zzso zzso adolescent, and adult participants viewed cues indicating that a camera was alternately off, warming up, or projecting their image to a peer during the acquisition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that a peer was actively watching them was sufficient to induce self-conscious emotion that rose in magnitude from childhood to adolescence and partially subsided into zzso zzso zzso was uniquely heightened in zzso These behavioral patterns were paralleled by emergent engagement of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso connectivity during adolescence, which are thought to promote motivated social behavior in zzso These findings demonstrate that adolescents' self-consciousness is related to zzso sensitivity of brain systems critical to zzso zzso Further, unique interactions between the zzso and zzso may provide a mechanism by which zzso contexts influence adolescent zzso
