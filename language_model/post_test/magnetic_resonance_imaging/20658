Many zzso used for therapy zzso zzso radiation zzso or diagnostic such as zzso zzso Imaging zzso have a composite structure consisting of an organic core or organic coverage zzso magnetic zzso and they are commonly dispersed in liquid suspensions for intravenous zzso Here is presented the application of a new Environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso mode in transmission, so called zzso for transmission imaging of droplets of such zzso This is illustrated by zzso images from zzso zzso (about zzso zzso in zzso loaded with zzso zzso (about 10 zzso in zzso and from iron oxide core (about 5 zzso in zzso zzso contrast agents, both examples in zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso mode allows both the collective behavior of such zzso in suspension to be characterized and the inner composite structure of individual zzso to be zzso Such experimental results are discussed by comparison with zzso Carlo computer simulations of the distribution of the electrons scattered through the samples in rather large solid angles (between zzso and zzso corresponding to the detection zzso
