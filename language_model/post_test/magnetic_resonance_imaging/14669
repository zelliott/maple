To evaluate the changes in zzso white matter and corpus zzso volumes in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso 

High resolution three-dimensional zzso fast zzso zzso recalled echo magnetic resonance images were obtained from 16 zzso patients and 16 normal controls, and 11 zzso patients also received the same magnetic resonance imaging scans after insulin therapy for 1 zzso zzso analysis was performed and analysis of zzso and paired zzso test were zzso 

A lower volume was demonstrated in zzso patients than that in the normal controls in bilateral zzso middle frontal zzso bilateral zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso right middle zzso zzso and left zzso zzso lobe (all zzso After insulin therapy for 1 year, the increased zzso white matter of brain regions were demonstrated in left zzso zzso zzso right zzso middle frontal zzso right inferior zzso zzso right zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso right middle zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso left zzso lobe and left insular lobe at the follow-up level in zzso patients compared with baseline level zzso The decreased volumes of zzso white matter were observed in the bilateral zzso zzso right superior zzso lobe and right zzso lobe in zzso patients on insulin therapy for 1 year zzso A decreased trend of zzso white matter was involved in corpus zzso zzso and a significant decreased volume was demonstrated in the middle zzso part of corpus zzso after insulin therapy for 1 zzso 

zzso patients have decreased zzso white matter of multiple brain regions, and the zzso of zzso white matter can be improved by the insulin zzso The volume analysis of zzso white matter is a simple and effective tool for the evaluation of white matter damage in zzso zzso
