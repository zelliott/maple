With the advances in new zzso zzso the role of imaging of acute zzso stroke has broadened and progressed from making diagnoses to providing valuable information for patient zzso The goal of zzso therapy for acute zzso stroke should be to salvage the zzso tissue zzso that can respond to zzso and avoid zzso of the dead zzso zzso It is essential to have rapid diagnostic zzso that can distinguish viable zzso tissue from zzso damaged zzso because there is a risk of zzso injury such as zzso complications with early zzso Although diffusion magnetic resonance zzso imaging has been reported to have a high sensitivity and specificity for acute zzso in acute stroke patients without early zzso therapy, the capability to differentiate zzso from irreversible zzso by diffusion MR imaging has not been zzso zzso MR imaging techniques provide direct information on zzso zzso status zzso of the collateral zzso and may have the potential for providing important information about tissue viability and/or zzso for selecting appropriate patients for zzso zzso
