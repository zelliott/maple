Our aim was to measure the relaxation times of the zzso brain and to use these to derive pulse sequence parameters that enhance the zzso ratio zzso and contrast of zzso scans of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation times were measured for 10 healthy zzso and the average relaxation times were calculated for both gray and white zzso zzso using these values were then performed to estimate the optimal pulse sequence zzso Images were obtained in three zzso using both the zzso and conventional sequence zzso 

The measured zzso zzso zzso relaxation times of the zzso brain at zzso T were zzso equals zzso zzso 235 zzso and zzso equals zzso zzso 52 zzso in white matter and zzso equals zzso zzso 245 zzso and zzso equals 206 zzso 26 zzso in gray zzso The zzso zzso imaging used a zzso zzso sequence with an zzso length of 3 and zzso of zzso zzso and showed increases in both the contrast and the zzso The zzso zzso sequence used a TE of zzso zzso and markedly increased the contrast but at the expense of a reduction in the zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequences for scanning zzso are different from those required for adult studies, and appropriate protocols should be zzso
