zzso in cerebral zzso are thought to reflect early zzso defects in zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether there is abnormal brain zzso in early onset schizophrenia zzso and whether it is related to the unusually early onset of the zzso 

Adolescent patients with recent onset schizophrenia and an equal number of matched control subjects participated in the zzso The volumes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions were measured zzso from magnetic resonance images using zzso zzso zzso indexes were calculated for each region using the formula zzso - zzso + zzso zzso zzso A composite index of asymmetry zzso was zzso as the sum of the five index zzso 

A total of 40 patients with zzso and 40 zzso controls were zzso There were no group differences in demographic zzso No group differences in brain asymmetry measures were seen in any of the brain regions zzso 

The unusually early onset of schizophrenia in this population does not appear to be associated with abnormalities in zzso zzso
