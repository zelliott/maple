We combined functional imaging and zzso to investigate the behavioral and neural effects of a zzso zzso zzso associated with the expression level of this important synaptic zzso which has been implicated in zzso On a working memory zzso task for emotional faces, participants with the zzso related to increased expression showed higher zzso capacity for happy faces compared with the zzso related to lower zzso zzso in several zzso brain areas with known zzso expression was increased, including zzso zzso and frontal zzso Although these increases occurred across emotions, they were mostly observed in areas whose activity correlated with performance for happy zzso This suggests effects of zzso in zzso on zzso zzso capacity and zzso zzso brain zzso in zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso that altered zzso and/or zzso zzso may be related to the increased zzso zzso The combination of imaging and zzso thus allows us to bridge the gap between the zzso and zzso level and extend the cognitive zzso approach to a comprehensive biology of zzso
