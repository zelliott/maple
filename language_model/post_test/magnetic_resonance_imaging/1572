Surgery in the superior frontal zzso partially involving the supplementary motor area zzso may be followed by zzso transient weakness and zzso initially indistinguishable from damage to the primary motor zzso However, recovery is different, and zzso deficits may resolve completely within days to zzso No study has assessed the distinct zzso deficits after tumor zzso in the zzso on a homogeneous patient zzso 

zzso patients with World Health Organization Grade II zzso in the superior frontal zzso zzso treated by surgery were zzso Degree and duration of zzso deficits were evaluated according to tumor location and boundaries via magnetic resonance imaging scans, zzso zzso results, and extent of tumor zzso 

zzso motor deficits were evident in 21 of 24 and speech deficits in 9 of 12 zzso Motor function quickly recovered in 11 and speech function in 3 zzso None of the 12 patients in whom the zzso tumor zzso line was at a distance of more than zzso zzso from the zzso zzso experienced persistent motor zzso Eight of these patients developed typical zzso syndrome with transient initiation zzso Seven of 12 patients in whom the tumor extended to the zzso zzso still had motor deficits at the 12-month follow-up zzso 

Surgery for Grade II zzso in the superior frontal zzso is more likely to result in permanent morbidity when the zzso is performed at a distance of less than zzso zzso from the zzso zzso or positive stimulation zzso zzso cortical mapping of motor and speech function, in critical cases under local zzso with the patient as his or her own zzso is recommended; zzso should be tailored to obtain good functional outcome and maintain quality of zzso
