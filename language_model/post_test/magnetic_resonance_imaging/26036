zzso of the zzso bone extending into the zzso region is an unusual zzso Most cases have been attributed to secondary extension of a primary zzso zzso zzso of the zzso bone into the middle or zzso zzso Within the past two and a half decades, zzso extension of acquired zzso zzso has been recognized as a likely alternative to this zzso Recent literature has rejoined this observation by considering both primary and secondary zzso of the zzso bone as a single group, zzso zzso The present study is presented to analyze the clinical zzso imaging findings, and surgical treatment of six patients with acquired zzso zzso extending into the zzso zzso zzso in this study are compared with the extant literature on zzso and acquired zzso of the zzso zzso This study proposes that zzso zzso is a valid anatomical zzso however, the zzso of zzso zzso is still important in understanding the clinical presentation and management of zzso that extends beyond the usual confines of the middle ear and zzso 

zzso case review conducted at a zzso referral zzso 

From 1985 to 1999, 477 patients were surgically treated for acquired zzso zzso Patients with zzso extension of zzso were zzso Clinical zzso imaging studies, operative findings, surgical treatment, and zzso results were zzso 

Six cases in a series of 477 patients with acquired zzso zzso had zzso extension of zzso In this series, the most frequent zzso for zzso extension was zzso through the zzso recess into the middle zzso zzso A less frequent zzso was via the zzso air cells into the zzso zzso zzso zzso access for removal of zzso zzso was accomplished through several approaches including zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso In two patients who had zzso for possible residual disease, one was free of residual disease and one was found to have residual zzso in the region of the horizontal facial zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can extend into either the middle or zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso extended into the middle zzso through the zzso recess along the labyrinthine facial nerve and into or above the internal auditory zzso A less frequent path is through the zzso air cells into the zzso zzso zzso acquired zzso is generally small and presents with complaints related to underlying zzso media rather than the neurological deficits that are often associated with primary zzso bone zzso While zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging are both required to differentiate zzso zzso zzso from other zzso of the zzso bone, zzso zzso of the zzso bone is usually sufficient to diagnosis and define zzso extension of acquired zzso zzso These zzso can be completely excised rather than zzso
