The objective was to study the relation between changes in cerebral zzso size and clinical outcome after zzso third zzso zzso in both primary (no previous zzso and secondary zzso zzso diversion for zzso zzso Changes in zzso size were related to the need for further surgery for zzso zzso A blinded retrospective study of the zzso and zzso sizes of the zzso in an zzso series of patients undergoing this procedure was zzso A decrease in third zzso size was seen in significantly more patients in the primary group than in the secondary zzso Median change in third zzso zzso for those who did not require further zzso diversion was significantly greater than those with no clinical benefit zzso Positive zzso power for successful outcome was highest for measures of the third zzso zzso and zzso for third zzso zzso and height respectively, zzso for anterior to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, third zzso size reduces after zzso The use of such a change as an zzso of success in this procedure is questionable as clinically successful cases can have no change in zzso zzso It is considered that clinical outcome is the most important guide to success or failure as reduction in zzso size is by no means zzso zzso outcomes alone may be misleading and reliance on them should be zzso
