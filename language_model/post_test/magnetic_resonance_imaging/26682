MR imaging has been used extensively for identification and determination of zzso of zzso A major emphasis is placed on identification of zzso or fluid zzso within the zzso zzso Little attention is given to other spinal structures such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and facet zzso spinal ligaments, and zzso zzso Our objective was to assess the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso disk injury as seen on MR imaging studies of patients with acute or zzso painful zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of spine MR imaging examinations in all patients who presented to our institution for subsequent treatment with zzso zzso One hundred six patients had MR imaging studies and reports available for zzso A total of 211 acute or zzso zzso zzso fractures were identified in this group of zzso All fracture levels were evaluated for the presence or absence of zzso zzso and/or associated zzso disk zzso 

zzso analysis of the images showed a high zzso of zzso and zzso disk zzso Superior zzso zzso injury zzso was more common than inferior zzso injury zzso while the combination of both was observed in zzso of the zzso The pattern of zzso disk injury was similar, with injury to the disk above the fracture zzso more common than injury to the disk below the fracture level zzso While the official zzso reports correctly identified the zzso zzso fractures, they did not mention or describe the associated zzso zzso or disk zzso 

zzso zzso injury is commonly seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this is frequently associated with injury to the adjacent zzso zzso These findings are often zzso but should be described because they may have important implications for symptomatic zzso patient management, and zzso
