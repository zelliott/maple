We sought to study the relationship between left zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso size in patients with zzso heart disease zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to determine a dysfunction index based on the maximum possible zzso in relation to zzso zzso 

In 149 patients with chronic zzso zzso and zzso size were zzso by zzso zzso index was defined as the maximum possible zzso minus measured zzso 

The maximum possible zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso index for the study population was mean 20 zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the study population had a dysfunction index zzso and zzso had a dysfunction index zzso 

The present study suggests that zzso size by zzso can be used to estimate a maximum possible zzso and a dysfunction zzso The distribution of dysfunction index in the population suggests a considerable prevalence of dysfunctional but viable zzso Future studies are needed to assess if the dysfunction index can be useful to assess the potential for improvement in zzso following zzso
