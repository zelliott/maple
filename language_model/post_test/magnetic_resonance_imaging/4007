zzso zzso exerts a zzso of actions potentially relevant for the zzso of multiple zzso including the expression of a zzso calcium zzso influx leading to an zzso zzso zzso increase able to lower T zzso threshold of zzso It has been previously shown in a cross zzso cumulative study that this influx is associated with clinical and zzso evidence of disease zzso 

To evaluate the zzso relation between disease activity and the zzso activated zzso influx in individual patients, a zzso analysis was performed on peripheral blood zzso from eight patients with zzso multiple sclerosis every 15 days for one zzso 

zzso of the influx were correlated with clinical events and monthly enhanced brain zzso The influx was detected a mean of zzso zzso zzso times per patient during our zzso In zzso of the occasions, influx induced zzso increases were recorded in each patient in more than two consecutive zzso determining sustained zzso increases lasting for a mean of zzso zzso Peak zzso increases preceded clinical attacks zzso or zzso detection of brain zzso enhancing zzso zzso by a mean of zzso and zzso days zzso zzso analysis of time series further indicated that the fluctuation frequency of zzso increases due to the influx over time were zzso on the appearance of new zzso zzso in all patients and confirmed that in two thirds of the patients these zzso increases occurred significantly before zzso or concurred with new zzso zzso Finally, the overall presence of the influx throughout the follow up period correlated zzso with the patients' zzso zzso 

zzso events leading to T zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis occur in the peripheral blood before zzso specific events become evident and are, in part, sustained by zzso induced zzso zzso zzso
