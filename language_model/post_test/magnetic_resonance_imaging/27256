In this study we investigate the potential of zzso carbon zzso zzso with low metal zzso zzso zzso as magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast zzso Taking into account probable zzso at high zzso concentration analysis shows that the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso gels at zzso is zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso this is attributed to both the presence of iron oxide zzso and also to the carbon zzso structure zzso Stem cells were zzso with zzso to demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso as zzso contrast agents for cellular zzso The zzso did not impair cell viability or zzso These results suggest that the zzso contrast agent properties of the zzso could be used in zzso for stem cell zzso and during zzso targeted zzso of zzso
