We investigated the potential of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso particles as cellular specific magnetic resonance contrast agents to image zzso populations within the central nervous system zzso with the final goal of obtaining a reliable tool for zzso detecting and tracking specific cellular populations in zzso We used zzso particles bound to a zzso zzso The particle is the contrast agent, by means of its zzso relaxation zzso the zzso is the targeting zzso responsible for zzso the particle to target a surface zzso To investigate the efficiency of particle zzso by these zzso we compared two types of zzso zzso particles in zzso We successfully employed zzso zzso particles to image zzso cells in a zzso model of zzso zzso Likewise, we were able to identify zzso infiltrates in a zzso model of multiple zzso The specificity of the technique was confirmed by zzso and electron zzso of corresponding zzso Our findings suggest that indirect binding of the zzso to a zzso particle allows for enhanced particle zzso compared to zzso binding of the zzso to the zzso
