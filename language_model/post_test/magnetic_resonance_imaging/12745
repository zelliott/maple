The authors describe their experience in a series of cases of zzso zzso within the hip and pelvic regions, and explain the mechanism of formation and propagation of this pathological zzso 

Five patients with 6 zzso zzso are zzso Four patients presented with symptomatic zzso zzso in the zzso and pelvis affecting the zzso and zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso affecting the opposite zzso nerve was found on MR imaging in 1 zzso The fifth patient, previously reported on by another group, had an zzso zzso zzso that the authors zzso 

All 5 zzso zzso affecting the zzso and zzso zzso elements were found to have a joint connection to the zzso aspect of the hip zzso the zzso zzso zzso had a joint connection to the zzso aspect of the hip zzso In all cases, initial review of the MR images led to their zzso 

To the zzso knowledge, these are the first cases of zzso zzso demonstrated to have a connection to the hip zzso This finding at a rare site provides further evidence for the unifying zzso zzso theory for the formation of zzso zzso and reveals a shared mechanism for their zzso Furthermore, understanding the zzso of these zzso provides insight into their successful treatment and their zzso
