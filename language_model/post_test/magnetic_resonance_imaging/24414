Whether humans adjust their behavior in response to unaware errors remains a controversial issue relevant to insight in zzso zzso zzso error awareness studies found that the zzso zzso zzso an zzso potential zzso originating in the zzso prefrontal zzso after zzso activated equally for aware and unaware zzso suggesting a candidate zzso zzso However, recent studies demonstrate that the zzso decreases after unaware zzso We hypothesized that the zzso is dependent upon zzso and predicted that previous discrepancies might be due to unaware errors not being differentiated from zzso uncertain, zzso responses that might increase the zzso zzso Here we addressed this hypothesis by distinguishing between aware zzso unaware zzso and uncertain responses, and using stimuli zzso associated with well established sensory zzso to evaluate the degree of stimulus processing for each trial zzso We found that while aware and unaware errors were related to failures at the time of response, uncertain responses were due to failures at the time of stimulus processing zzso by lower zzso sensory zzso Moreover, uncertain responses showed similar zzso activity as aware zzso in comparison with decreased activity for unaware zzso Finally, compared with aware zzso uncertain responses and unaware errors showed reduced neural compensations, such as alpha zzso Together these findings suggest that the zzso is activated by aware motor errors as well as sensory failures, and that both awareness and certainty are necessary for neural adaptations after zzso
