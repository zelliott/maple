The zzso Imaging Analysis Contest zzso zzso were analyzed with the zzso software zzso Two types of linear zzso analyses were carried out: zzso zzso zzso response, where a zzso incomplete gamma function is used to model each brief zzso episode, and zzso zzso analysis, where the zzso shape of the response model in each stimulus block class is allowed to vary separately in each zzso These time series zzso were carried out both in the volume and on the original data projected to individual standardized cortical surface zzso zzso analyses were carried out zzso on the zzso zzso obtained from these time series results, using a zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso Group analysis of the block design demonstrated a significant repetition suppression of the zzso signal within blocks in the superior and middle zzso zzso This effect may represent differences in the response to the first stimulus following a period of silence compared to the remaining sentences in the zzso zzso the zzso data, zzso area 31 showed significant sentence effect and zzso repetition zzso However, no significant speaker effect was zzso these results may be consistent with the instructions to the subjects that they would be tested on the sentence zzso zzso by speaker interaction effects were found in bilateral middle zzso zzso left inferior zzso and left inferior zzso zzso
