zzso medical image registration requires the zzso of a function with a large number of degrees of zzso zzso approaches to reduce the zzso complexity, such as uniform zzso and zzso image zzso introduce zzso homogeneous zzso and may lead to less accurate registration in particular for motion fields with zzso This paper introduces the concept of sparse image representation based on zzso which are zzso and therefore enable accurate zzso of sliding organ motions frequently seen in respiratory and cardiac zzso Previous shortcomings of using zzso in motion zzso in particular inconsistent zzso in ambiguous regions, are overcome by employing multiple layers of zzso Furthermore, we propose a new similarity criterion based on a zzso shape representation of zzso which improves the accuracy of zzso registration and enables zzso zzso We validate our findings based on the registration of two challenging clinical applications of zzso zzso registration: motion zzso between inhale and exhale phase of CT scans for zzso planning, and zzso zzso registration of diagnostic zzso and CT chest zzso The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art registration zzso and require no additional anatomical knowledge with greatly reduced zzso zzso
