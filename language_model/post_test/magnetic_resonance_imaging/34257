The purpose of this study was to compare fast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso in the evaluation of pelvic floor descent in zzso Thirty-five women with clinical evidence of pelvic floor descent were zzso A fast zzso MR sequence was performed in the zzso position during pelvic floor relaxation and during zzso pelvic zzso On the same day, a dynamic zzso was performed with the patient seated on a zzso The degree of descent of the zzso zzso and zzso junction was evaluated as the vertical distance between the zzso line and the zzso base, the zzso vault, and the zzso zzso zzso A zzso of more than 3 zzso measured as the distance between the extended line of the anterior border of the zzso canal and the tip of the zzso was interpreted as a zzso zzso was compared with zzso during zzso pelvic strain zzso 1) and during zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was considered as the gold zzso Compared with clinical examination, zzso I showed a larger number of involved zzso except for the middle zzso zzso II was superior to clinical examination in all zzso In comparison with zzso I and especially zzso II, zzso had a lower sensitivity, especially for the anterior and middle zzso Even four zzso seen on zzso II were not detected by zzso When zzso I and zzso II were zzso a zzso a zzso vault zzso an zzso and a zzso were more readily seen on zzso II than with zzso zzso When compared with zzso zzso dynamic zzso is zzso especially in the anterior and middle zzso Even in the detection of zzso zzso was superior to zzso In general, the best results with zzso can be expected for evaluation of the zzso
