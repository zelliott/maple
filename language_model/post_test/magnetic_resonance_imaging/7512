zzso in social zzso have been described in schizophrenia and relate to core symptoms of the zzso Social zzso is zzso by a network of brain regions, many of which have been implicated in zzso We hypothesized that deficits in connectivity between components of this social brain network may zzso the social zzso zzso seen in the zzso 

We investigated brain zzso and connectivity in a group of individuals with schizophrenia making social judgments of zzso from faces zzso zzso zzso compared with a group of matched healthy volunteers zzso zzso 24), using functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso connectivity from the zzso was estimated using the zzso interaction zzso 

While making zzso judgments, healthy participants recruited a network of social brain regions including amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso zzso and left zzso prefrontal zzso During the zzso task, healthy participants showed increased connectivity from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and left superior frontal zzso In comparison to controls, individuals with schizophrenia zzso the right middle frontal zzso superior frontal zzso and zzso and had reduced connectivity between the zzso and the zzso zzso 

We report increased zzso of frontal and zzso zzso regions during social judgment in patients with zzso accompanied by decreased connectivity between the zzso and zzso We suggest that the increased zzso of frontal control systems and association zzso may reflect a zzso mechanism for impaired connectivity of the zzso with other parts of the social brain networks in zzso
