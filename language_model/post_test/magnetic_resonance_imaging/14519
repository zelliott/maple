zzso zzso neural networks mature progressively with zzso However, nothing is known about the impact of gender on their zzso This study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the effects of age, sex, and sex by age interactions on the brain zzso of 63 healthy males and zzso between 13 and 38 years, performing a Stop zzso zzso age was associated with progressively increased zzso in typical response zzso areas of right inferior and zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso showed significantly enhanced zzso in left inferior and superior frontal and zzso regions relative to zzso while males showed increased zzso relative to females in right inferior and superior zzso zzso zzso left frontal and zzso areas that showed increased zzso in zzso also showed significantly increased functional maturation in females relative to zzso while the right inferior zzso zzso that was increased in males showed significantly increased functional maturation relative to zzso The findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso patterns of enhanced left zzso zzso in females and enhanced right zzso zzso in males during motor zzso appear to be the result of underlying gender differences in the functional maturation of these brain zzso
