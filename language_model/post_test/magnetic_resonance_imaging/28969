To determine the frequency of isolated, zzso zzso of the peripheral skeleton in patients with breast and prostate zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of staging skeletal zzso Patients with hot spots in the peripheral skeleton in the absence of convincing evidence of zzso disease in the zzso skeleton were zzso to determine the nature of the peripheral zzso based on other imaging zzso serial imaging or zzso and to determine if the zzso had been symptomatic at the time of the zzso 

200 patients with zzso proven zzso of the breast or zzso 

Four patients zzso had isolated zzso involvement of the peripheral zzso and would, therefore, have been wrongly staged by a magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, in three of these patients the zzso were painful, prompting diagnostic plain zzso independent of the zzso zzso Twelve patients zzso had isolated zzso abnormalities of the peripheral skeleton suggestive of zzso disease but which on further investigation were shown to be benign zzso 

A limited magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso confined to the zzso skeleton would not result in any significant loss of accuracy in staging patients with breast and prostate zzso compared with skeletal zzso Given the proven increased sensitivity of MR over skeletal zzso in the detection of bone zzso and the additional information MR provides, it is likely to provide a more accurate basis for zzso
