zzso of actions, critical for guiding zzso behavior, is deficient in zzso zzso zzso may reflect more general zzso zzso Prior studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso component of the zzso potential zzso is smaller in patients with zzso Other studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso have shown the anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso both critical for error zzso to be less responsive to errors in patients with zzso In the present study, both zzso and zzso data were collected while 11 patients with schizophrenia and 10 healthy controls performed a zzso task requiring a button press to zzso zzso while withholding responses to zzso zzso We measured the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso to false zzso The task zzso a robust zzso and modest zzso in zzso and zzso to false zzso As expected, zzso was larger in controls than zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso were not greater in controls than zzso Surprisingly, zzso was more activated by errors in patients than zzso zzso may be superior to zzso for assessing error processing abnormalities in schizophrenia because zzso zzso can be measured precisely without needing to control for the multiple comparisons of zzso and zzso zzso have the zzso precision to detect transient activity necessary for error detection and zzso behavioral zzso
