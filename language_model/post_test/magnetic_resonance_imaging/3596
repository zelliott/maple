In addition to zzso injury, zzso and zzso zzso evidence suggests multiple sclerosis zzso is also associated with increased iron deposition in the zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso particularly at very high field strengths, is sensitive to iron zzso and may enable zzso and zzso of iron associated with zzso 

To investigate the zzso gray matter in patients with zzso zzso zzso using zzso and novel, quantitative zzso measures at very high zzso 

In total, 22 patients with zzso zzso and 22 control subjects were zzso at zzso zzso zzso relaxation rates zzso and zzso and zzso phase were zzso in four zzso zzso zzso the thalamus, and the red zzso zzso in patients with zzso were compared with those in healthy subjects and correlated with clinical zzso 

zzso abnormalities were observed in most structures, most notably in the zzso zzso zzso correlations with disability were observed in the zzso marginally significant correlations were also observed in the zzso and red zzso No significant correlations were observed with duration since index zzso 

zzso abnormalities are present in the deep gray matter zzso of patients recently diagnosed with zzso these abnormalities can be detected via zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso particularly zzso relate to disease severity in the zzso and other gray matter zzso
