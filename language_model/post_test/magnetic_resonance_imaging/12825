zzso joint zzso disc displacement zzso is a common finding in zzso zzso The natural progression of this disorder has not been described with magnetic resonance zzso 

The zzso of a zzso sample of 94 zzso adolescents were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging to zzso zzso disc position zzso The average time between imaging visits zzso and zzso was zzso years zzso zzso zzso Boys and girls had significantly different zzso values at zzso and therefore changes in zzso from zzso to V2 were analyzed separately for each zzso 

The highest standard zzso was zzso zzso for zzso measurement zzso zzso analysis identified no significant association between change in disc status and time between zzso There was no significant difference in mean change in zzso in girls or the right zzso in zzso The boys' left zzso showed a significant mean increase zzso zzso of anterior zzso zzso zzso of right zzso and zzso of left zzso had more than 2 zzso of anterior zzso during the zzso In the girls, approximately zzso of the right zzso and zzso of the left zzso showed more than 2 zzso of zzso disc position changes from zzso to zzso 

A natural progression in severity of zzso in adolescents was not zzso Some subjects had large increases in anterior zzso
