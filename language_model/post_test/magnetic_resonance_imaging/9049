zzso nerve stimulation zzso resulting from electric fields induced from the rapidly changing magnetic fields of zzso coils is a concern in zzso Nerves exposed to either electric fields or changing magnetic fields would be expected to display consistent threshold zzso motivating the direct application of electric field exposure criteria from the literature to guide the development of zzso magnetic field exposure criteria for zzso The consistency of electric and magnetic field zzso was tested by comparing zzso times for electric and magnetic zzso zzso for 22 healthy human zzso Electric and magnetic stimulation thresholds were measured for exposure of the zzso using both surface zzso and a zzso magnetic zzso zzso The average zzso times for the electric and magnetic field conditions were 109 zzso 11 zzso and 651 zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso We do not propose that these results call into question the basic zzso namely that rapidly switched zzso magnetic fields induce electric fields in human zzso resulting in zzso However, this result does motivate us to suggest that special care must be taken when using electric field exposure data from the literature to set zzso zzso zzso safety standards in zzso
