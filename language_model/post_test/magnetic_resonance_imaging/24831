zzso diagnosis of the topographical relationships of zzso zzso involving the third zzso and/or zzso remains a challenging issue that critically influences the prediction of risks associated with their radical surgical zzso This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of zzso to define the precise topographical relationships between zzso zzso the third zzso and the zzso 

An extensive retrospective review of zzso zzso reported in the zzso era between 1990 and 2009 yielded 875 zzso largely or wholly involving the third zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies, in addition to detailed descriptions of clinical and surgical findings, were selected from this database zzso zzso zzso The position of the zzso and the zzso zzso caused by the tumor on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and third zzso floor, including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso bodies zzso were analyzed on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These changes were correlated with the definitive zzso topography and type of third zzso involvement by the zzso as confirmed zzso 

The zzso body angle zzso is the angle formed by the intersection of a plane zzso to the base of the zzso and a plane parallel to the floor of the fourth zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso represented a reliable zzso sign that could be used to discriminate the type of zzso involvement by the zzso in zzso of cases in this series zzso zzso zzso An acute zzso zzso zzso was indicative of a primary zzso topography, whereas an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a primary zzso zzso position, causing either an zzso of the third zzso zzso zzso or its invasion zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A zzso model including a combination of 5 variables (the zzso position of the zzso presence of zzso psychiatric symptoms, and patient zzso allowed an accurate definition of the zzso topography preoperatively in zzso of zzso depending on the specific type of relationship between the tumor and third zzso 

The type of zzso body displacement caused by zzso represents a valuable clue for zzso the topographical relationships between these zzso and the third zzso on zzso zzso zzso The zzso provides a useful sign to preoperatively differentiate a primary zzso zzso originating at the zzso area from a primary zzso zzso which either zzso or zzso invaded the third zzso
