To determine the differences between zzso disorders including MD and zzso 

A study was undertaken to investigate patients with MD and zzso disorders registered in Japan and to set up provisional criteria for the new clinical entity zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso The preliminary diagnostic criteria include raised serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso plasma cells in the tissue zzso plasma cells zzso with zzso or zzso The clinical features, laboratory data and zzso of 64 patients with zzso and 31 patients with typical SS were zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was significantly lower in patients with zzso than in those with typical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly more frequent and total zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly increased in zzso zzso specimens from patients with zzso revealed marked zzso plasma cell zzso Many patients with zzso had zzso zzso formation, but zzso zzso were zzso Few zzso cells were seen in the tissue of patients with typical zzso zzso patients with zzso treated with zzso showed marked clinical zzso 

Despite similarities in the involved zzso there are considerable clinical and pathological differences between zzso and zzso Based on the clinical features and good response to zzso we propose a new clinical zzso zzso
