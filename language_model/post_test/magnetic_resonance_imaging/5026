It is commonly accepted that the zzso plays a major role in zzso memory across species and that it is of particular relevance for spatial memory in zzso However, the interplay between zzso function and zzso memory systems, such as procedural zzso zzso or sequential learning, is less clear: depending on task requirements, an interaction, zzso or interference between zzso function and other memory systems may zzso This study was conducted to investigate the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso on learning and performance of sequential behavior in a rat version of the serial reaction time task zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso analyses of the zzso revealed a bilateral volume reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso They were largely confined to its zzso part and led to an expected spatial memory deficits in an object place recognition test as compared to healthy controls, even though sham zzso had the same zzso Our earlier studies on sequential learning had revealed substantial zzso in case of zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, however, zzso zzso animals unexpectedly showed superior performance throughout zzso testing and training as compared to controls, which resulted in a higher degree of subsequent automated sequential zzso Thus, our data reveal the zzso case where zzso zzso lead to long-term improvements in test performance of a type of rather complex procedural zzso One possible explanation for this effect is that zzso activity in zzso can interfere with other memory systems during the acquisition of procedural tasks with very low spatial requirements, as used zzso Alternative explanations for the observed superior zzso performance in zzso animals, such as zzso or increased exploratory drive are also topic of the zzso
