zzso cavernous zzso zzso are vascular zzso of the zzso characterized by zzso enlarged zzso cavities that can occur sporadically or as a familial zzso dominant condition with incomplete zzso and variable clinical expression attributable to zzso in three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among our group of zzso Italian patients, we selected a cohort of sporadic cases negative for zzso in zzso zzso In this zzso five zzso in zzso gene were zzso which proved to be the known zzso in zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in coding sequence zzso zzso in zzso 2, zzso zzso in zzso 4 and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we undertook a zzso study to investigate the possible association of these zzso with sporadic zzso The five zzso were identified in 91 zzso sporadic patients and in 100 healthy controls by direct sequencing methods using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed statistically significant differences in zzso between patients and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of the zzso zzso was significantly lower in the zzso group than in the control zzso Patients with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso had a significant increase for zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the same was observed for the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso in zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with different types of zzso zzso analysis, performed only on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that zzso zzso zzso significantly increased among zzso sporadic patients compared to the control zzso zzso differences between patients and controls were observed only for zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating their possible association with sporadic zzso and an increased risk of zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with a more benign course of the zzso These data were confirmed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso
