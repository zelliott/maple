zzso zzso zzso of breast can provide functional information on the vascular and structural compartments of zzso in regions identified during simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso can be acquired during dynamic zzso zzso zzso to accomplish zzso zzso of the enhancing regions, potentially increasing the diagnostic specificity of the examination and reducing the number of zzso performed as a result of zzso zzso breast imaging zzso 

We combine synergistic attributes of concurrent zzso and zzso with a new design of the clinical zzso breast interface that couples to a standard MR breast zzso and allows imaging of variable breast zzso zzso information from healthy volunteers and cancer patients is recovered, providing molecular information in regions defined by the segmented MR image zzso 

The new zzso system significantly improves examination utility by allowing improved zzso of the zzso fibers to breasts of all cup sizes and zzso zzso This improvement is demonstrated over a range of breast sizes zzso size A through zzso and normal tissue zzso using a group of eight healthy volunteers and two cancer zzso zzso located in the zzso region and zzso breast are now accessible to zzso zzso zzso images were found to have biologically plausible zzso content, oxygen zzso and water and zzso zzso 

In zzso a new zzso breast interface was developed to accommodate the variation in breast sizes and zzso locations that can be expected in clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso and scattering in zzso regions, increasing the diagnostic information acquired from MR zzso
