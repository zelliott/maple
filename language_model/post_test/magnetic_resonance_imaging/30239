Stem cell labeling with iron oxide zzso particles allows labeled cells to be detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and is commonly used to track stem cell zzso However, the zzso of zzso for distinguishing surviving zzso cells from other sources of zzso zzso for example, zzso containing zzso released from zzso cells, has not been thoroughly zzso We sought to determine the relationship between the persistence of zzso zzso signals and cell survival 3 weeks after injection of zzso or zzso zzso stem cells zzso stem zzso in zzso 

We studied zzso human and rat zzso stem cells and human zzso stem cells doubly labeled with zzso and zzso and injected zzso into zzso zzso zzso Animals were zzso at 2 days and 3 weeks after stem cell injection in a clinical zzso zzso zzso At 2 days, injection sites of zzso and zzso cells zzso stem cells and zzso stem zzso were identified by zzso as large zzso signal voids that persisted at 3 weeks zzso to zzso of initial zzso zzso (at 3 weeks) revealed the presence of zzso zzso at the injection site, identified by zzso zzso but very few or no zzso stem cells in the animals transplanted with zzso or zzso cells, zzso 

The persistence of significant zzso zzso signal derived from zzso zzso despite few or no viable stem cells 3 weeks after transplantation indicates that zzso of zzso cells does not reliably report long-term stem cell zzso in the zzso
