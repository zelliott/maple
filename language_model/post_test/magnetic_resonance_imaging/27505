Gas challenges zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with room air was delivered to rabbits to investigate their effect on tissue zzso and zzso zzso fiber-optic zzso of absolute oxygen and relative blood flow were made in the liver and kidney zzso 

Only the liver demonstrated a zzso response to zzso zzso changes to other gases were minimal in both zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the liver responding only when zzso was present and the kidney only when zzso was zzso 

This study reveals distinct zzso response mechanisms to gas challenge in the liver and zzso The detailed characterization of zzso responses is critical to improving our understanding and interpretation of MR zzso in various body zzso and will help broaden the application of MR for zzso studies of gas zzso
