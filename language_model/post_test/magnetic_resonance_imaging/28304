White matter zzso zzso may result from cerebral zzso or zzso We investigated the association of zzso with blood pressure, hypertension, and its treatment and zzso 

A random sample of 1920 participants aged 55 to 72 years in the zzso zzso in Communities Study zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso scan images were coded from 0 for normal to 9 for most severe zzso zzso was defined as zzso or zzso pressure zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or use of zzso zzso 

The percentages of persons with zzso grades 0 through 2 and 3 through 9, respectively, were as zzso zzso zzso and zzso versus all zzso subjects, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and treated controlled zzso zzso and zzso versus treated uncontrolled zzso subjects, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted odds ratios zzso confidence zzso for zzso grade zzso or zzso 3 relative to zzso subjects was zzso zzso to zzso for all zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for treated controlled zzso and zzso zzso to zzso for treated uncontrolled zzso After additional adjustment for hypertension zzso treatment, and control status, the odds ratios zzso confidence zzso for a 1 zzso increase of zzso and zzso blood pressure were zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso is associated with increased odds of zzso and treated uncontrolled zzso subjects have greater odds of zzso than those with treated controlled zzso The data suggest that the level of blood pressure, especially zzso blood pressure, is related to zzso additional to the effects of zzso defined hypertension and its treatment and control zzso
