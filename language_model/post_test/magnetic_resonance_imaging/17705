Small animal magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool to study cardiac function and changes in zzso zzso The high heart rates of small animals zzso to 600 zzso have previously limited the role of zzso zzso Small animal zzso inversion recovery zzso is a zzso mapping sequence for small animals to overcome this zzso zzso maps provide quantitative information about tissue zzso and contrast agent zzso It is also possible to detect diffuse zzso processes such as zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, from a single set of image data, it is possible to examine heart function and zzso zzso by generating zzso and inversion zzso late zzso zzso MR zzso The presented video shows zzso the procedures to perform small animal zzso zzso Here it is presented with a healthy zzso zzso however naturally it can be extended to different cardiac small animal zzso
