In order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in spontaneous zzso zzso 14 patients with recent zzso verified by CT or zzso puncture were investigated with both selective zzso digital zzso zzso zzso and zzso by two independent teams, each having the same zzso zzso The results were compared with each other and whenever possible (all positive cases except one) with those of surgical zzso Seven patients were identified by zzso and zzso as having a single aneurysm on the circle of Willis, 1 an aneurysm of the zzso inferior zzso artery 1 an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery zzso and 2 patients with two zzso on the circle of zzso zzso and zzso both failed to demonstrate zzso in 2 zzso Three patients had negative results on both methods and no surgical intervention was zzso The zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso In most cases there was agreement between zzso and zzso leading us to believe that, if the proper protocols are followed, zzso is a powerful alternative to other established methods in the detection of zzso zzso At this stage it will not replace zzso prior to surgery, but the ability to obtain various projections using zzso zzso may improve surgical zzso
