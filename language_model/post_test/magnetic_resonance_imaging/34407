Our goal was to compare the abilities of zzso and stress zzso to detect the extent of recent lateral ankle ligament inversion zzso 

In this prospective study, 60 athletically active patients zzso zzso zzso with recent inversion trauma zzso or zzso 7 zzso underwent stress zzso and zzso In 15 patients, the MR findings were reviewed at zzso Patients were divided into three groups according to severity of ligament injury on zzso zzso one, or two to three ligament zzso Based on bilateral stress zzso patients were classified into three groups according to the differential degree of zzso tilt zzso or zzso 5, zzso or zzso or zzso 15 zzso and compared with patients from the MR zzso 

Surgery showed zzso to have zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in the evaluation of complete lateral ankle ligament zzso zzso between MR and stress zzso groups for the severity of recent lateral ankle ligament tears was poor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso should be performed in young, athletically active patients if surgical intervention is contemplated, especially at zzso degrees zzso tilt on stress zzso since stress zzso tends to zzso and underestimate the severity of lateral ligament zzso
