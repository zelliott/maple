Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death among both men and women zzso The skeleton is the most common site of cancer zzso Early detection is crucial for zzso To evaluate and compare the capability for bone zzso assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and bone zzso zzso in lung cancer patients, a zzso is zzso 

We searched zzso zzso zzso and the Cochrane Library for studies evaluating diagnosis zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso between January 1990 and August zzso zzso methods were used to pool sensitivity, zzso diagnostic odd ratios zzso and to construct a summary zzso characteristic curve zzso 

A total of 17 articles (9 zzso studies, 9 zzso studies, 6 zzso studies and 16 zzso zzso that included zzso patients who fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria were considered for inclusion in the zzso The pooled sensitivity for the detection of bone zzso in lung cancer using zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The pooled specificity for the detection of bone zzso from lung cancer using zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The pooled zzso estimates for zzso zzso were significantly higher than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The pooled sensitivity of zzso was not correlated with the prevalence of bone zzso 

The results showed that both zzso and zzso were better imaging methods for diagnosing bone zzso from lung cancer than zzso and zzso zzso has higher diagnostic value zzso specificity and zzso for diagnosing bone zzso from lung cancer than any other imaging zzso
