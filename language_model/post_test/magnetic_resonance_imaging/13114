The early detection of stimuli zzso threat to an zzso is a crucial evolutionary zzso For example, the perception of aversive bodily sensations such as zzso and pain strongly motivates fast zzso zzso to ensure zzso Their similarly threatening and motivating characters led to the speculation that both sensations are zzso by common brain areas, which has also been suggested by zzso studies on either zzso or zzso By using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we formally tested this hypothesis and compared the cortical processing of perceived heat pain and zzso load induced zzso in the same group of zzso Here we show that the perception of both aversive sensations is processed in similar brain areas including the zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso These areas have a documented role in the processing of emotions such as fear and zzso Thus, the current study highlights the role of a common zzso human brain network which zzso the perception of aversive bodily sensations such as zzso and zzso This network seems crucial for translating the threatening character of different bodily signals into zzso consequences that promote zzso
