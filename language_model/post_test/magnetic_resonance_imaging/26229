Visual perception critically depends on zzso signals that arise early in visual zzso zzso show greater behavioral sensitivity to zzso with horizontal or vertical zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso than to other, zzso zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure an asymmetry in the responses of human primary visual zzso zzso to oriented zzso We found that neural responses in zzso were larger for zzso stimuli than for zzso zzso degrees zzso degrees ) zzso Thus the zzso pattern in zzso closely resembled subjects' behavioral zzso responses in zzso were greater for those zzso that yielded better zzso zzso
