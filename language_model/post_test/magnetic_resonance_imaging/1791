Information on the consequences of zzso zzso zzso on brain zzso and function in the aging rat is missing although several groups have hypothesized that PA may be responsible for neurological and psychiatric deficits in the zzso We therefore decided to study the effects of PA on the central nervous system zzso in terms of zzso zzso neurology and behavior in the aging zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated zzso by zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging and zzso also by zzso zzso Neurological function was tested by an zzso test battery and zzso rod zzso zzso functions were examined by zzso and the Morris water maze zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso and a significant difference in the escape zzso when the platform of the zzso was moved to a new location, were observed in zzso zzso We showed that deteriorated cognitive functions accompanied by zzso expression of zzso zzso and impaired zzso are long-term zzso of zzso zzso a finding that may form the basis for understanding zzso pathology in the aging subject, animal or zzso
