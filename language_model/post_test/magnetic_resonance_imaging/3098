The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of zzso MR imaging for measurement of regional zzso blood flow in human zzso The first pass of the contrast agent zzso through the zzso was zzso in 12 normal volunteers with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the contrast agent through the zzso after a zzso injection was derived from zzso of zzso versus zzso The zzso was injected through an intravenous zzso which was advanced to the central zzso position (preferably the right zzso To investigate zzso input function, different zzso zzso and zzso positions were zzso It is concluded that zzso MR imaging is feasible in human subjects when a central injection of zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso values were similar throughout the zzso of normal subjects at rest, reflecting normal zzso Absolute values of zzso were related to the zzso zzso
