LA and zzso Anatomy in Patients With zzso 

Although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires accurate zzso knowledge, pulmonary vein zzso anatomy has not been fully zzso zzso of this study is to describe left atrium zzso and zzso anatomy by magnetic resonance zzso zzso in a large cohort of patients with zzso 

zzso was performed in zzso patients preceding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso persistent zzso The Venice zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso branching zzso 

About zzso of the patients presented typical zzso branching pattern (2 left and 2 right zzso A representative number of patients presented a common left trunk zzso and zzso short and long, zzso A right middle zzso was described in zzso and 2 right middle zzso in zzso zzso The remaining patients presented other complex, previously zzso zzso zzso presented an accessory zzso originating from LA areas not zzso as right or zzso and zzso a common left trunk plus right middle zzso zzso and circumference of each zzso zzso and LA zzso volumes resulted larger in patients presenting persistent compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study highlights that zzso zzso branching pattern is not a common zzso That zzso of the patients present at least 1 accessory zzso needs to be kept in careful consideration when planning and performing zzso zzso zzso In addition, not only LA volume, but also each zzso zzso and LA zzso are significantly enlarged in patients with persistent compared to zzso zzso
