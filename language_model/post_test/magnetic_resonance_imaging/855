To assess the zzso of zzso gamma knife zzso in controlling zzso of the brain zzso and to analyze the factors related to tumor recurrence or development of new zzso 

From November 1993 to September 2001, 35 patients, 28 males and 7 zzso aged 36 (16 approximately zzso 18 with multiple tumors and 17 with solitary zzso the number of tumors being 93 in total, were treated by zzso zzso patients with zzso were associated with von zzso disease zzso The tumor size ranged 5 approximately 55 zzso with a mean size of 13 zzso The mean maximum zzso dose was zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso at tumor center and the mean minimum dose was zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso at tumor zzso Fisher exact test, independent T test and zzso rank sum W test were used to analyze the results of zzso on solitary and multiple zzso the zzso time of the zzso and the relation between minimum zzso dose and tumor zzso 

35 patients had been followed for 24 - 114 months with a mean value of 66 zzso 29 patients were alive and 6 zzso Of the 29 patients 21 achieved satisfying tumor control, and 8 patients underwent open surgery because of zzso zzso enlarging or development of new tumors after zzso 21 patients had improvement or remained stable in neurological zzso Of the 8 reopened patients, 2 had deteriorated symptoms and the other 6 remained zzso zzso Of the 35 patients, 7 developed new tumor during the follow-up period, and 5 had second zzso zzso zzso Of the 29 cases, solitary or multiple tumors in 23 patients decreased in volume or remained the same, although two developed new zzso The result of zzso in controlling zzso showed no significant difference between the solitary and multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso but the dose of long-term tumor control was significantly higher than that of uncontrolled tumors zzso zzso 98, P zzso zzso The tumor control rate was zzso 1 year zzso zzso 2 years zzso zzso 3 years zzso zzso 4 years zzso and zzso 5 years zzso For the patients with solitary zzso the mean time of development of new tumor was 63 months, but for the patients with multiple zzso the time was 25 zzso There was a significant difference between the two groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso With margin dose of 18 zzso zzso showed that no tumor cell was found and there were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the tumor zzso 48 months after zzso 

zzso is a good choice for small- or zzso solid HB in long term, especially when tumor margin dose is 16 - 20 zzso Although zzso can treat multiple tumors in one single treatment session, for HB in patients associated with zzso zzso faces the problem of tumor recurrence or development of new zzso
