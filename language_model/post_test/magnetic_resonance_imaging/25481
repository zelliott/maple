There is a shortage of data addressing the clinical characteristics of patients with zzso zzso zzso who present with zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective cohort study of members of a large, zzso health care program was conducted to identify factors that distinguish zzso secondary to cerebral zzso from all other zzso zzso and zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso test, zzso zzso test, and zzso zzso 

Patients with an underlying zzso were younger and more likely to be female, zzso with lower blood pressures, lower cholesterol, and lower white blood cell counts on zzso 

These clinical characteristics may be useful in defining potential risk factors in future prospective studies as well as targeting candidates for additional imaging studies after zzso with no apparent zzso
