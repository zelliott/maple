Combination chemotherapy with zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso 4 zzso followed 24 hour later by zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso results in 10 and zzso cure rates of animals bearing human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and avascular and zzso poorly differentiated regions with low zzso density zzso whereas zzso is zzso poorly differentiated with higher zzso density zzso Studies were carried out for determining the role of zzso and avascular regions in drug resistance in zzso and detection of such regions with zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso were harvested for zzso evaluation and zzso zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IX, zzso vascular zzso factor zzso and zzso immediately after zzso imaging following the 3rd dose of zzso zzso liquid zzso determination of zzso drug concentration of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso was done 2 hours after zzso zzso 

Although zzso zzso showed three times higher concentration of zzso zzso was more responsive to zzso After therapy, zzso tumor consisted mostly zzso zzso of zzso regions zzso for zzso lacking zzso with a hypoxic rim zzso for zzso zzso IX and zzso containing few zzso zzso zzso poorly differentiated zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso tumor regions showed zzso lower zzso zzso zzso compared with poorly differentiated areas zzso zzso zzso Blood oxygen level zzso zzso imaging was able to zzso distinguish the hypoxic and zzso regions within the zzso 

zzso regions in zzso cell zzso offer sanctuary to some hypoxic but viable tumor cells zzso zzso IX and zzso zzso that escape therapy because of limited drug zzso This study provides direct evidence that because of a specific zzso structure, zzso zzso hypoxic regions in tumors exhibit low drug zzso and represent a unique form of drug zzso
