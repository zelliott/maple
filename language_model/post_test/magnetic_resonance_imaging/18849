The zzso column is composed of a series of zzso each capable of a specific range of zzso To investigate these movements, a study into the zzso range of rotation at the zzso joint has been zzso The movements and their interpretation under imaging conditions are crucial if any underlying spinal zzso or the consequences of trauma are present in an zzso 28 healthy volunteers were examined using dynamic zzso zzso Imaging with maximum head rotation to the right and left sides in zzso An anatomical zzso of the zzso joint was zzso using zzso zzso with the zzso fixed in varying degrees of zzso The results indicate that there is a significant but incomplete loss of contact between the zzso surfaces of C1 zzso and C2 zzso The range of motion to the right was between 20 and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso and to the left was between 13 and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso significance between left and right movement was not zzso The instantaneous axis of rotation was examined for the joint and was found to be located within the zzso peg zzso These findings indicated that a wide range of movement occurs within the zzso joint in normal zzso Furthermore, the appearances under imaging could be zzso as a pathological zzso This has implications if the subject with a spinal zzso also has a zzso associated with a potential zzso The zzso of the instantaneous axis of rotation within the zzso is also important in zzso the understanding of the movement of this zzso
