We encountered 2 patients with zzso lateral sclerosis zzso with tongue enlargement and zzso outside the oral cavity zzso To our knowledge, the relationship between zzso and ALS has not been reported in the zzso The objective of this article was to describe the clinical zzso imaging, and pathology of zzso in ALS and to develop a hypothesis regarding its zzso 

Two patients developed progressive weakness at age 54 and 40 zzso Both patients exhibited zzso zzso tongue zzso neck zzso zzso and weakness of jaw closure during a zzso zzso Both required zzso and mechanical ventilation and afterward developed zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso image confirmed tongue zzso outside the oral cavity with focal zzso and showed the transition from the zzso part of the tongue in the zzso to the zzso part outside the zzso Tongue biopsy demonstrated fatty replacement and zzso of degenerative zzso 

We are unaware of previous reports of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Given the paucity of case material, we speculated that this is an extremely rare complication of zzso Based on this series, we propose a zzso mechanism by reviewing imaging and tongue zzso
