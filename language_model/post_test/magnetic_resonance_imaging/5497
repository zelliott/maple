The delayed zzso zzso zzso Imaging of zzso zzso method allows for both qualitative and quantitative measurement of the spatial distribution of zzso zzso in excised zzso The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso fixation on zzso zzso Five bovine and seven human cartilage pieces were punched into zzso plugs, fixed for 18 h in zzso zzso solution, and zzso The magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was measured prior and post fixation in cartilage without zzso and with zzso the zzso charged zzso contrast agent zzso Images of tissue before and after fixation were zzso very zzso The ratios of zzso zzso and calculated zzso after zzso relative to before zzso were near or slightly higher than 1 for both bovine cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for human cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, these data suggest that zzso can be used on previously fixed samples to assess the three zzso spatial distribution of zzso
