To investigate zzso functions of the zzso zzso 

zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were recorded directly from zzso zzso in a patient with a left frontal brain zzso 

The most prominent zzso components after electrical stimulation of the right and left hands and the right foot were double peaked zzso recorded just above the zzso zzso zzso 80 to 150 zzso respectively zzso and zzso zzso sources for the zzso counterparts of those zzso zzso and zzso were both zzso at the upper bank of the zzso zzso and those of zzso were more zzso located than those of zzso 

These findings suggest the existence of at least two separate zzso areas within the human zzso zzso
