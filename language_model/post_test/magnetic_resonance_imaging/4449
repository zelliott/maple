This study was aimed at assessing the accuracy of zzso zzso Imaging zzso in the characterization of focal liver zzso We zzso examined 51 patients with focal liver zzso the zzso features were investigated with different pulse sequences and the functional characteristics were studied after the zzso administration of zzso (2 zzso MR findings were compared with those of gold standard methods, zzso zzso zzso surgery or, for zzso zzso blood cell liver zzso All zzso presented with typical features: signal intensity was very high on long TE images zzso 140 zzso and a zzso enhancement pattern, with zzso zzso was observed after dynamic zzso This signal pattern on zzso images is highly indicative of zzso Five of 7 focal zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso on all pulse zzso the central zzso was observed in zzso cases on short zzso images and in all cases on long zzso images in zzso cases zzso High signal intensity on zzso images was statistically significant for zzso A zzso was observed in 12 cases zzso A mosaic pattern on zzso images was observed in 3 zzso zzso per cent of zzso exhibited signal enhancement during the zzso phase of the dynamic zzso zzso presented a uniform pattern, zzso they were zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso images in zzso cases zzso A central zzso area on zzso images is indicative of zzso zzso A zzso with these zzso features and zzso signal is suggestive of zzso
