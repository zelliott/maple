Using a zzso zzso study of zzso geriatric depression zzso we zzso the relationships among cognitive function, zzso functional connectivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso or deletion zzso zzso during resting zzso A total of 26 zzso patients and 24 matched controls were zzso and zzso tests, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso were examined for each zzso A 2 zzso 2 zzso analysis of zzso zzso model zzso of depression and zzso of zzso was used to detect the interaction zzso zzso analyses were restricted to the significant interaction zzso There were significant interactions between disease and zzso at two zzso left superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso And the zzso zzso zzso has zzso effects on the left superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the functional connection of zzso zzso zzso I and the zzso recall test scores zzso zzso in zzso group zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso can zzso the pathology of zzso and the status of geriatric depression and the zzso zzso may zzso induce altered resting state network activity, which could influence the cognitive function and increase the mortality risk for cognitive zzso
