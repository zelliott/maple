During an out-of-body experience zzso the zzso seems to be awake and to see his body and the world from a location outside the physical zzso A closely related experience is zzso zzso which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in zzso zzso Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of zzso and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable zzso theory zzso The present study describes zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and AS in six neurological zzso We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central zzso We show that zzso and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived zzso of one's own zzso These include zzso sensations (such as zzso flying, zzso and zzso visual zzso illusions (such as the zzso zzso transformation or movement of an zzso and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an zzso or zzso We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences zzso and zzso Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the zzso junction zzso These results suggest that the complex experiences of zzso and AS represent zzso disorders of body perception and zzso (or body zzso The processes of body perception and zzso and the unconscious creation of central zzso of one's own body based on zzso zzso visual and zzso zzso well as their integration with sensory information of zzso zzso a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our zzso Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of zzso and zzso and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt zzso We suggest that zzso and AS are related to a failure to integrate zzso tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body zzso in personal zzso and by a zzso dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal zzso space and zzso zzso zzso We argue that both zzso zzso zzso are necessary for the occurrence of zzso and zzso and that they are due to a zzso cerebral dysfunction of the zzso in a state of partially and briefly impaired zzso
