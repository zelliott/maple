zzso navigation of the social world relies on the correct interpretation of facial zzso This may be particularly important in formative zzso zzso literature examining the emergence of face processing in youth zzso and zzso has focused on the neural and behavioral zzso of processing adult faces, which are zzso different from youth participants, and whose facial expressions may convey different meaning than faces of their zzso During a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso we compared concurrent neural and behavioral responses as youth zzso viewed zzso emotionally varied zzso anger, fear, happy, and zzso adult and child face zzso We observed that participants made fewer errors when matching adult, compared to child, face zzso and that while similar brain regions were involved in processing both adult and child faces, zzso in the face processing neural network was greater for adult than child zzso This was true across emotions, and also when comparing neutral adult versus neutral child zzso Additionally, a zzso by zzso effect was observed within the zzso That is, within adult face zzso negative and neutral face stimuli zzso the largest effects, whereas within child face zzso happy face stimuli zzso the largest zzso zzso Thus, heightened engagement of the zzso was observed for happy child and angry adult faces, which may reflect zzso zzso of select emotions in early zzso This study provides evidence that the zzso age of the perceived face influences neural processing in zzso
