A combination of multiple zzso imaging and exploratory data analysis zzso zzso fuzzy cluster analysis zzso is proposed for separation and characterization of zzso zzso in zzso spiral functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments at 3 zzso zzso of functional zzso using zzso is performed by zzso zzso signal changes zzso as a function of echo time zzso Further vascular zzso is supported by the zzso of zzso and the comparison with a zzso zzso zzso In some subjects, an additional indication for large vessels within a zzso was found as zzso of the zzso signal difference vs echo time zzso Such large vessels may be separated from small vessel zzso and, therefore, our proposed procedure might prove useful if a more specific functional zzso is desired in zzso In addition to the signal change zzso zzso is significantly different between activated zzso zzso over all eight subjects zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with the highest signal change characterized as containing large vessels, whereas in zzso corresponding to zzso environment average zzso values are zzso zzso zzso zzso
