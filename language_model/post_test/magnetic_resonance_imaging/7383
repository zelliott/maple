zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso can provide detailed zzso structures and quantitative function information for chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso 

To zzso clarify characteristics of pulmonary function test zzso CT volume parameters and magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging in COPD patients with different high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients performed zzso CT and MR zzso zzso COPD was classified into three zzso according to zzso quantitative findings: A, E and M zzso Total lung volume zzso total zzso volume zzso and zzso index zzso were zzso by zzso In cases of zzso defects zzso the shape and size were zzso The contrast between the normal lung and zzso was zzso by calculating their signal intensity ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation was performed between zzso CT and MR zzso 

There were 42 A zzso 9 E zzso and 11 M zzso There was significant difference in forced zzso volume in zzso zzso vital capacity zzso between A and M zzso zzso zzso and zzso of A zzso zzso and zzso were lower than those of E zzso and zzso or M zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso images showed circumscribed or diffuse zzso zzso zzso of A zzso was higher than that of E zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso were moderate zzso correlated with diffusion function zzso zzso was strongly correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was strongly correlated with zzso or zzso zzso 

There were different features and correlations between zzso CT volume and MR zzso in different zzso indicating each zzso may have novel imaging method guiding clinical zzso
