There is growing debate on the use of drugs that promote cognitive zzso zzso drugs have been employed as cognitive zzso but they show important side effects and induce zzso In this study, we investigated the use of zzso which appears to have less side effects compared to other zzso zzso We analyzed effects on cognitive performances and brain resting state network activity of 26 healthy young zzso 

A single dose zzso zzso of zzso was administered in a zzso and zzso zzso Both groups were tested for zzso performances with the zzso Advanced Progressive zzso II set zzso before and three hours after administration of drug or zzso zzso state functional magnetic resonance zzso was also used, before and after three hours, to investigate changes in the activity of resting state brain zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso was employed to evaluate differences in structural connectivity between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso indicate that a single dose of zzso improves cognitive performance as assessed by zzso zzso showed that the drug produces a statistically significant increased zzso of zzso zzso Control zzso zzso and zzso Attention zzso zzso zzso No modifications in structural connectivity were zzso 

Overall, our findings support the notion that zzso has cognitive enhancing properties and provide functional connectivity data to support these zzso
