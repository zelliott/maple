We describe the imaging characteristics of giant zzso zzso spaces in a 37-year-old man who initially presented at the age of zzso years with vision change and headache and was found to have probable low grade zzso The patient was followed subsequently at 8 years and 17 years later at our institution with stable imaging and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated multiple zzso mass in the right frontal lobe which was stable in size and zzso The mass followed signal intensity identical to zzso fluid on all sequences and was consistent with a giant zzso zzso zzso This report illustrates the need to keep this entity in mind when imaging evaluation demonstrates a zzso zzso to zzso fluid on all zzso These zzso can actually be quite large and ominous appearing and many proceed to biopsy zzso
