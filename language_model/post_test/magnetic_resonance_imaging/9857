zzso direction discrimination zzso the ability to determine the direction of an zzso movement across the skin, is used clinically to detect and zzso tactile zzso We have previously identified a cortical network for zzso based on skin stretch information that includes the second zzso anterior insular and zzso prefrontal zzso In the present study we investigated cortical processing of zzso based on zzso zzso Sixteen healthy subjects (8 zzso mean age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso zzso rolling wheel on the right thigh during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The subjects were instructed to indicate the zzso or zzso rolling direction of the zzso The zzso contrast between rolling wheel stimulation and rest showed zzso in several areas which included the left zzso primary zzso bilateral second zzso bilateral anterior insular, and bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso We conclude that, zzso zzso is processed in a largely similar distributed cortical network as skin stretch zzso Further, zzso zzso activated primary zzso zzso whereas a role for this area in processing of skin stretch zzso has not been zzso
