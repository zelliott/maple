This brief review of magnetic resonance zzso summarizes the methods conceived in the zzso laboratory during the past several zzso This article shows how zzso oxygen zzso is zzso in large draining veins by field mapping and how this information, in concert with simultaneous measurement of cerebral blood flow, yields cerebral zzso rate of zzso the zzso rate of oxygen zzso The accuracy of this zzso approach in which the blood vessel is zzso as a long, straight cylinder, for which an zzso solution for the induced field exists, is zzso It is shown that the approach is remarkably zzso allowing for zzso zzso of zzso metabolism at rest and in response to zzso thereby providing detailed information on cerebral physiology in health and disease not previously amenable by zzso zzso
