We describe three cousins who presented with zzso zzso and/or coma, and developed zzso following initial onset of zzso Two cases followed minor head injuries, two were zzso and two were associated with zzso Two cases required zzso support on the intensive care zzso zzso resonance imaging in all three cases showed cortical zzso and one had evidence of restricted water diffusion on zzso imaging, suggestive of zzso A complete family history at the time of presentation would have led to an earlier diagnosis of profound zzso in familial zzso zzso which would have enabled better zzso of their clinical course and caused less distress for the zzso
