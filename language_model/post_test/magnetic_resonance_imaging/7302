zzso of brain activity zzso has been shown in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso using zzso functional connectivity zzso However, regional activity zzso has not been characterized in zzso The purpose of this study was to assess regional brain zzso by calculating regional data zzso of resting state functional zzso zzso as well as its correlations to clinical zzso Twelve ALS patients and 12 zzso and zzso healthy controls underwent zzso zzso zzso measurement was performed in the zzso network zzso a key brain network impaired by zzso zzso zzso was found in the superior zzso zzso which was surrounded by increased zzso in the peripheral zzso zzso zzso regional zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso was correlated with high disease severity as indicated by lower zzso zzso meanwhile, enhanced regional zzso in left zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso was related to longer disease zzso Finally, increased zzso in left zzso zzso zzso to fast disease progression zzso These zzso zzso regional zzso zzso suggest using regional zzso as a potential marker for studying ALS and its zzso
