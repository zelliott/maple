The zzso zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso is critical for DNA damage zzso zzso zzso complexes mediate repair during replication and can also resolve Holliday junctions formed during zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso of the zzso knockout zzso the mouse zzso of zzso which zzso many key features of the human genetic illness zzso zzso zzso animals are born at zzso ratios, have greatly reduced zzso are zzso compromised and are prone to blood zzso zzso cells prematurely zzso spontaneously accumulate damaged zzso and are particularly sensitive to DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a crucial requirement for zzso (also known as zzso to interact with the zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso The zzso knockout mouse therefore establishes a disease model for zzso anemia and genetically links a regulator of zzso incision complexes to the zzso anemia DNA zzso repair zzso
