We have developed a new interdisciplinary approach for removing large zzso and upper cervical spine zzso This approach is a combination of the Le Fort I zzso zzso zzso and median zzso zzso Our approach gives an excellent, wide surgical field from the zzso including the base of the skull, to the base of the tongue and permits sufficiently safe zzso of zzso and upper cervical spine tumors that may not be removed by zzso or zzso zzso Our approach not only incorporates the merits of each approach but also creates a larger surgical field that may be modified or expanded to accommodate the removal of more bulky tumors in this zzso This novel approach will facilitate more successful zzso of tumors arising between the zzso including the skull base, and the zzso zzso
