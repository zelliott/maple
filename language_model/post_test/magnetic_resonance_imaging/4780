zzso are lacking in zzso zzso zzso Their staging is defined by the zzso of the zzso This study aimed to zzso the zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan was performed in 12 patients suspected of having zzso and in nine zzso zzso visual interpretation was used to detect the zzso with zzso zzso higher than that of normal zzso zzso ratio zzso was calculated from the counts of zzso over the mass and over comparable normal lung tissue in zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso was calculated from the counts of zzso over the anterior zzso and lung in zzso The PET scan patterns of distribution of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were correlated with the zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings, and staging of the zzso zzso was performed in ten patients and zzso was done in two zzso The results revealed ten zzso zzso stage I zzso two stage II, four stage III and two stage IV, according to the Masaoka zzso and two cases of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso was also noted in four zzso zzso zzso studies showed zzso diffuse zzso in the widened anterior zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso confined focal zzso zzso in the zzso or less zzso stage I and II zzso and zzso multiple discrete zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso structures in stage III and IV advanced invasive zzso The zzso had the highest zzso followed by the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of control subjects zzso zzso No significant difference was found between zzso in different stages or between zzso with and zzso without zzso zzso In comparison with CT and/or zzso zzso detected more zzso in patients with invasive zzso and zzso the staging of zzso in four zzso Our preliminary results suggest that zzso is useful in the assessment of the zzso of zzso and may have the potential to differentiate zzso from zzso zzso
