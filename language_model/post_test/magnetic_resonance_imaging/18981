Despite recent advances in technology, parent vessel zzso zzso occasionally zzso successful zzso detachable zzso zzso particularly in zzso zzso We report zzso zzso deployment performed in two patients specifically to treat this zzso 

Two patients underwent zzso detachable zzso zzso of cavernous segment zzso Both developed zzso zzso into the internal carotid zzso In one patient, the zzso occurred during the initial zzso in the other, it was discovered in a delayed fashion during a follow-up examination for zzso zzso 

In both patients, zzso zzso deployment was performed to isolate the zzso portion of the zzso from the internal carotid zzso zzso zzso at 6 months demonstrated no aneurysm zzso and no zzso of the parent internal carotid artery in the zzso region in either zzso 

The use of zzso zzso has been reported to be a helpful technical adjunct to the conventional zzso treatment of zzso and balloon zzso One additional indication for the use of this technology is zzso zzso coils from the zzso of the parent artery to reduce potential zzso or zzso zzso
