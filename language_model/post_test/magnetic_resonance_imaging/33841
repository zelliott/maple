Prevention of stroke is aided by determination of the degree of carotid artery zzso and progression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new method for evaluating the degree of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of zzso with the zzso zzso conventional zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso zzso 

A total of 128 carotid zzso in 64 patients zzso men and 22 zzso mean age, zzso zzso were examined by zzso because of symptoms of cerebral zzso carotid zzso or findings suggestive of zzso carotid artery zzso on zzso zzso The following were used to compare zzso with conventional zzso zzso and zzso 1) zzso of the degree of zzso 2) depiction of irregularities in zzso walls, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 3) surgical planning for carotid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A strong correlation was found between the degrees of zzso estimated by conventional zzso and zzso zzso image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso was generally overestimated by zzso which, however, has the advantage of being able to scan the carotid siphon to the middle cerebral artery at one zzso zzso and zzso of the artery wall could be evaluated with zzso whereas with zzso progression of zzso sclerosis could be evaluated by differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso The anatomical relationships between the site of zzso and the internal jugular vein and zzso structures, which must be known before zzso were confirmed by observation of rotated images using the shaded surface reconstruction zzso zzso Because the zzso of cross and collateral flows cannot be clearly zzso with zzso standard zzso is needed to determine suitability for bypass zzso 

The current method used in our hospital for the diagnosis of zzso of the internal carotid artery includes zzso or US for initial zzso zzso for evaluation of the degree of zzso and for zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso and zzso and conventional zzso for evaluation of zzso and determination of the indications for a bypass zzso
