In an effort to define human cortical zzso areas we reviewed functional zzso data for which coordinates standardized in zzso zzso space were zzso We observed a wide distribution of zzso within the zzso and zzso and frontal zzso suggesting multiple zzso regions within this cortical zzso Multiple zzso also emerged in the zzso zzso However, only two peaks, both in the right hemisphere, were observed in the zzso zzso cortex, the region likely zzso to the secondary taste area described in zzso zzso significantly more zzso originated from the right zzso suggesting zzso cortical representation of taste favoring the right zzso
