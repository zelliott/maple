To study whether abnormalities of zzso function exist in patients with essential hypertension and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

We studied 25 zzso patients with essential hypertension (13 men and 12 women, zzso years zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso were used to detect zzso zzso ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure and zzso were performed, and the power spectrum of heart rate zzso was zzso On a separate day, various zzso activity tests, including mental stress, hand zzso cold zzso and zzso maneuver were zzso zzso sensitivity was calculated from changes of blood pressure and zzso zzso during zzso zzso A zzso suppression test was also performed, with measurement of plasma zzso zzso 

Fourteen of 25 patients zzso had zzso zzso group), and 11 patients did not have zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in age, sex, family history, or duration of hypertension between the C and NC zzso Average zzso zzso blood pressure was similar between the two groups, although zzso zzso blood pressure was higher in the C group than the NC zzso zzso zzso and zzso heart rate was significantly higher in the C group than in the NC zzso zzso low zzso frequency ratio was slightly higher in the C zzso Plasma zzso levels were significantly higher zzso zzso 217 versus 299 zzso 122 zzso and zzso sensitivity was slightly lower in the C group than in the NC zzso zzso of blood pressure and heart rate to mental stress, cold zzso hand zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion, and zzso tests were not significantly different between the two zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso was frequently found in patients with essential zzso Patients with zzso appeared to have enhanced sympathetic nervous activity compared with those without the zzso
