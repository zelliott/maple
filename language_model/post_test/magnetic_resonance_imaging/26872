zzso zzso in children with a birth zzso zzso injury zzso are caused by muscle zzso however, the underlying mechanisms are zzso The aim of this study was to assess the early interactions between shoulder muscles and shoulder joint zzso 

In a retrospective magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of 36 infants (21 zzso 15 zzso younger than 12 months zzso zzso zzso with unilateral zzso volumes and thicknesses of standardized segments of the zzso zzso and zzso muscles were measured in both shoulders and expressed as ratios of zzso zzso The relation between muscle ratios and zzso head zzso passive external zzso zzso version, and zzso was zzso 

Compared with the unaffected side, the muscles of the affected side were of significantly smaller volume and zzso The zzso was the most severely affected muscle, its volume being only zzso zzso zzso and its thickness only zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding values on the unaffected side zzso zzso zzso Severe zzso was predicted by the combination of low zzso and zzso volume ratios zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not by muscle thickness zzso zzso was related to passive external rotation zzso zzso zzso zzso version zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In infants with zzso muscle size is decreased during in the first months of life by both zzso and, zzso by a reduction in the number of zzso in zzso These effects are strongly related to shoulder joint zzso
