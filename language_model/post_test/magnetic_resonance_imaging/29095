zzso diffusion zzso with diffusion zzso that spans a cardiac cycle is complicated by zzso zzso This paper presents a method to obtain accurate diffusion data without strain zzso zzso to the zzso of normal cardiac motion, there are time points in the cardiac cycle, zzso zzso when the cardiac zzso zzso its zzso zzso If the diffusion is zzso then, the net effect of strain on the observed diffusion zzso zzso To test this, zzso diffusion and zzso movies are performed on zzso zzso gel zzso and in five normal zzso In zzso the sweet spots predicted from the strain time zzso agree with the times when the observed diffusion equals the true zzso In humans, the strain prediction of the sweet spots and the locations determined by the diffusion trace show a high zzso r zzso zzso In all subjects, diffusion zzso presents a fiber orientation pattern comparable to that obtained from a stationary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
