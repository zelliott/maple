zzso contact stress on the zzso zzso has been hypothesized to contribute to zzso cartilage wear and joint zzso However, given the limitations of using contact stress and areas from human zzso specimens to estimate zzso joint stress, there is need for an in zzso method to obtain such zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has been shown to be a valid method of zzso the human joint contact area, indicating the potential for in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to describe a method of zzso the zzso joint contact area using zzso The zzso of this technique was established in zzso zzso specimens by comparing the contact area obtained from zzso with the contact area obtained using pressure-sensitive film zzso In particular, we assessed the actual condition of contact by using the ratio of signal intensity of MR images of cartilage zzso Two fresh zzso zzso knees were zzso A custom loading apparatus was designed to apply a zzso load to the zzso zzso We measured the contact area by using zzso and zzso zzso When the ratio of signal intensity of the cartilage surface was zzso the error of the contact area between the MR image and zzso was about zzso These results suggest that this zzso method may be a valuable tool in zzso joint contact area in zzso
