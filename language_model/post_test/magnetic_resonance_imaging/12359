We report a detailed and extensive zzso study of an acquired dyslexic patient, zzso who suffered a zzso zzso as a result of a zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso reading errors stem from a deficit in visual letter zzso and we use her deficit as a basis for exploring a variety of issues concerning zzso representations and processes in zzso First, building on the work of other researchers, we present evidence that the zzso reading system includes an zzso level of representation that represents each distinct visual shape of a letter zzso zzso A, zzso for the letter zzso We extend a theory proposed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso representation of words in the brain implied by studies of a unilateral neglect zzso zzso zzso zzso to include an zzso level, and we probe the nature of the zzso representations in some zzso Next, we explore the implications of visual similarity effects and letter zzso in zzso reading performance, arguing that these effects shed light on zzso dynamics in the zzso reading system and on the genesis of zzso zzso We also probe the processing of letter case in the visual letter identification process, proposing that separate abstract letter identity and case representations are zzso Finally, we present evidence that the zzso level as well as the abstract letter identity level implement a zzso frame of zzso
