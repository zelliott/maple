A fast and zzso technique suitable for zzso zzso contrast imaging is zzso The method, termed zzso combines zzso zzso preparation with zzso free zzso zzso imaging for zzso relaxation mapping of the zzso in healthy zzso The zzso zzso ratio zzso was zzso with the use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with linear phase zzso zzso zzso zzso image was obtained within one zzso and a single slice zzso map of the zzso was obtained in under zzso zzso A respiratory zzso method was incorporated for serial zzso and signal zzso with the subjects breathing zzso The mean zzso zzso relaxation time measured in 12 healthy volunteers was 54 zzso zzso zzso Regional variations of zzso values across the zzso were zzso zzso variations across serial zzso zzso in a zzso region covering approximately zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso wall were zzso without signal averaging zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso with signal averaging zzso zzso zzso According to our preliminary results, the zzso method is expected to provide a robust and sensitive tool for clinical application of zzso zzso contrast zzso
