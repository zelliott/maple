zzso zzso injury zzso plays a major role in the development of cognitive dysfunction, emotional difficulties and behavioral disturbances in patients following closed head injury, even when they have no zzso abnormalities on conventional zzso This study aimed to develop a highly controlled and zzso model for zzso that simulates post-traumatic cognitive dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso rats were subjected to impact acceleration head injury, using a zzso impact targeted to a steel disc centered onto their zzso The severity of injury was graded as three levels by adjusting the driving pressure at 60, 70 or 80 pounds per square zzso In zzso zzso was obtained 2 days zzso zzso function was evaluated using the Morris water maze at 1 and 2 weeks zzso HE zzso and zzso were performed to assess zzso and zzso damages after 2 zzso zzso demonstrated that this model induced no gross structural modification in the zzso The degree and duration of cognitive dysfunction were dependent on the force of zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso damage of the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso damage was much less pronounced and was not linked to cognitive zzso This is the first report that precisely evaluates the threshold of impact energy to lead to zzso damage and cognitive dysfunction in zzso This model would be suitable for clarifying the complex mechanisms of post-traumatic brain damage and testing novel therapeutic approaches against post-traumatic cognitive dysfunction due to diffuse zzso zzso
