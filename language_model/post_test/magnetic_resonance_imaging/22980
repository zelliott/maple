The zzso and functional zzso of mental state attribution zzso of zzso zzso has been the focus of several recent zzso The literature contains opposing views on the functional specificity of zzso and on the zzso structures most relevant to zzso Studies with zzso patients have consistently found zzso deficits associated with unilateral right zzso damage zzso Also, functional imaging performed with zzso adults implicates several specific neural regions, many of which are located in the right zzso The present study examined the separation of zzso impairment from other deficits associated with brain zzso We tested 11 patients with unilateral right zzso damage zzso and 20 normal controls zzso on a zzso rating task, an emotion rating task, a graded zzso zzso zzso task with zzso control questions, and two ancillary zzso zzso Trails A and B, in order to assess overall level of impairment and zzso abilities associated with executive function, and zzso a zzso reading task to assess central zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso can result in a functionally specific deficit in zzso intentional states, particularly those involving zzso zzso Performance on zzso questions was not reliably related to measures of cognitive zzso however, performance on zzso control questions was reliably predicted by Trails A and zzso We also discuss individual zzso patients' performance with attention to zzso zzso Our findings suggest that damage to the areas noted as zzso in zzso studies may not affect zzso performance, and underscore the necessity of combining zzso and imaging studies in determining zzso zzso
