To determine if zzso resistance protein A zzso zzso is related to clinical disease activity in multiple sclerosis zzso 

zzso zzso zzso levels were measured in a prospective cohort of 116 zzso patients with early zzso and were related to clinical relapses and zzso at baseline and at zzso 

Low levels of zzso zzso were associated with the occurrence of relapses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, high baseline zzso zzso levels were related to a longer time to a first new zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Adding the absence of zzso to high zzso zzso the zzso value increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso clearly showing a cumulative value for combining both zzso 

zzso zzso is related to clinical zzso the number of zzso on zzso and is indicative for the time to a subsequent zzso If confirmed, zzso zzso has potential as a zzso for clinical disease activity in zzso
