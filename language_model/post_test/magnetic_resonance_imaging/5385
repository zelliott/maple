The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency and imaging features of zzso zzso fractures in a consecutive zzso patient population on long-term zzso treatment and search for distinguishing clinical and laboratory parameters in the subset of patients with zzso 

Two hundred zzso zzso in 100 zzso patients zzso women and seven zzso age range, zzso years; mean age, zzso zzso were zzso reviewed by two zzso All patients had received zzso treatment for at least 3 years and had no history of pain or recent zzso zzso studies were performed when a fracture was suspected on zzso Bone mineral density, serum zzso zzso zzso vitamin D, intact zzso hormone zzso serum zzso and urine zzso values were zzso 

Two of 100 patients zzso had three zzso zzso Both patients, 50 and 57 years old, were white, active, and had been receiving zzso therapy for 8 zzso The patient with bilateral zzso zzso fractures showed typical features of zzso incomplete zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso findings in both zzso The two patients with incomplete zzso zzso fractures were significantly younger than those without zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences among the fracture and zzso groups in terms of clinical or laboratory results, except for mean zzso which was significantly decreased in the fracture zzso 

The zzso frequency of incomplete zzso zzso fractures in zzso patients on long-term zzso therapy is higher than suggested in the zzso Aside from age and mean zzso there were no significant differences in clinical or laboratory data between the two zzso
