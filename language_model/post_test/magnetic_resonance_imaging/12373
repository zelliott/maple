To detect the functional networks of the red nucleus and zzso zzso during the resting state in normal subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Sixteen normal subjects were performed resting state zzso scanning and zzso weighted zzso The function connectivity networks base on seed regions of the red nucleus and zzso zzso were extracted from low frequency fluctuation signal in zzso data by using a zzso correlation zzso Individual functional maps were entered zzso zzso zzso test to determine brain regions with significant positive correlation to the zzso The statistic threshold was set at P zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso cluster connectivity criterion 5 zzso with zzso zzso 

Brain regions involved in the functional connectivity network of the red nucleus include: zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso nucleus of the thalamus, zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso red nucleus, zzso zzso nucleus, zzso Brain regions involved in the functional connectivity network of the zzso zzso include: anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso red nucleus, zzso zzso zzso The distribution of the networks of the red nucleus and zzso zzso presented zzso Although the functional networks of the red nucleus and zzso zzso over zzso largely with each other, the zzso network was slightly different with the zzso network, witch showed strong correlations with more zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The functional networks of the red nucleus and zzso zzso reflected strong interplay within the zzso zzso system, as well as correlations between some limited cerebral zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging is a potential powerful tool to explore the zzso zzso
