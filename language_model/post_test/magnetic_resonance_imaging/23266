zzso zzso which is defined as a relative decrease in zzso is increased by greater zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso affect taste zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso which results from energy zzso is expected to zzso taste zzso in reward zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the amount of zzso stimulation and energy content on zzso changes in taste zzso Ten men participated in a zzso zzso crossover zzso zzso were scanned twice using functional magnetic resonance zzso after zzso for at least zzso and after treatment, on four zzso Treatment consisted of the zzso of 450 zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso at 150 zzso with either small (5 zzso or large (20 zzso zzso During zzso subjects alternately tasted zzso milk and tomato juice and rated its zzso Before and after the scans, subjects rated zzso prospective consumption, desire to eat and sweetness for all zzso Main findings were that, before treatment, the zzso was activated more by zzso than by caloric zzso zzso zzso activated part of the zzso before, but not after zzso We observed no main effects of zzso size on taste zzso and no interaction between zzso size and caloric zzso In conclusion, the brain responds zzso to caloric and zzso versions of a sweet drink and consumption of calories can zzso taste zzso in the zzso Further research is needed to confirm that the observed differences are due to caloric content and not to zzso differences in the sensory zzso In addition, implications for the effectiveness of zzso zzso in decreasing energy intake need to be zzso
