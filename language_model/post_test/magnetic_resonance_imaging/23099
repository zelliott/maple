The idea of zzso zzso in white matter zzso is zzso Our recent work has used two different approaches to investigate whether there is evidence for zzso zzso The first approach used words and faces to elicit zzso transfer zzso in the zzso corpus zzso zzso zzso The second approach used zzso stimuli to elicit similar zzso in the anterior corpus zzso zzso zzso Using these different tasks, it has been possible to detect zzso zzso in different zzso In the current study, we report the results of a critical zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso can be zzso manipulated within the same set of zzso 

All subjects completed both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data were acquired at zzso using an zzso spin echo spiral zzso Data were analyzed with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso focused on group and individual zzso in zzso 

Corpus zzso zzso was zzso for both tasks, with zzso varying according to task zzso A statistical contrast of the two tasks revealed zzso zzso zzso for the zzso task and anterior zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso task showed zzso in the zzso and middle body of the corpus zzso at the group level and in zzso of zzso The zzso task showed zzso in the zzso and middle body of the corpus zzso at the group level and in zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso prior results, with the additional strength of functional mapping within the same group of zzso
