The zzso zzso dimensions of the corpus zzso the zzso zzso area of the lateral zzso at the level of the zzso and a three-dimensional estimate of zzso volume were derived from magnetic resonance brain images obtained from 45 zzso and 40 zzso male twin pairs aged 68 to zzso zzso genetic analyses indicated strong genetic influences contributing significantly to the zzso of each brain zzso The estimated proportion of genetic zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso volume, zzso for the zzso zzso area of the corpus zzso and zzso for lateral zzso zzso There was no evidence that shared environmental influences contributed significantly to zzso zzso We further used zzso genetic modeling to estimate the genetic and environmental correlation between correlated brain zzso zzso volume and corpus zzso area was highly zzso and this relationship was entirely due to shared genetic effects between these two brain zzso By contrast, the relationship between the height of the corpus zzso and the size of the lateral zzso was due to both genetic and environmental influences in zzso zzso genetic and environmental correlations were zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that more than half of the genetic and environmental influences on these two brain structures were zzso The manner in which the brain responds to the environment with advancing age is highly genetically determined, both for the lateral zzso which zzso with aging and disease, and for the corpus zzso which is zzso in shape by age-related zzso enlargement, whereas its zzso zzso area remains zzso
