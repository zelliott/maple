zzso zzso zzso are zzso detected by magnetic resonance zzso zzso in acute stroke patients or zzso zzso We investigated whether incidental CA influences stroke zzso and clinical outcome of patients with acute brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, frequency and zzso profile of incidental CA were compared between acute stroke patients and zzso healthy zzso We included consecutive zzso and zzso patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging and zzso within 7 days from clinical zzso CA diagnosis was performed by zzso zzso zzso zzso risk factors, stroke zzso and modified Rankin scale zzso at 3 months after stroke were zzso zzso CA was detected in 18 zzso of zzso stroke patients, 13 zzso of 374 zzso patients, 5 zzso of 107 zzso patients, and 146 zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed no significant differences in CA frequency between zzso zzso and control zzso Female sex was associated independently with incidental CA in the stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy control groups zzso No statistical differences in CA size and location between the 4 groups were zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites were not correlated with incidental zzso CA zzso or zzso zzso did not occur until 3 months after zzso The zzso zzso score did not differ between stroke patients with and without zzso zzso of incidental CA did not differ statistically among stroke, zzso zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso The zzso zzso score was not affected by incidental zzso Female sex was only an independent factor for incidental zzso Thus, we should pay more attention to incidental CA in female zzso patients treated with tissue zzso zzso
