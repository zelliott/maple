To determine the relation between baseline zzso and both conversion to multiple sclerosis zzso and development of disability in a cohort of patients with clinically isolated syndromes zzso 

From 1995 to 1998, 175 consecutive patients with zzso underwent brain zzso within 3 months of their first attack and again 12 months and 5 years zzso We studied the number and location of zzso at baseline and development of new zzso zzso We also analyzed conversion to zzso and development of disability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

We included 156 patients with zzso followed for a median of 7 zzso Compared to the reference group with 0 zzso criteria at baseline zzso patients with one or two zzso criteria showed an adjusted hazard ratio zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and patients with three to four zzso criteria of zzso zzso to zzso for conversion to zzso and differentiated patients with low, zzso and high conversion zzso zzso at year 5 correlated with baseline number of zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso When zzso by number of baseline zzso similar results were zzso Patients with a baseline zzso with three to four zzso criteria had an adjusted zzso of zzso zzso to zzso for reaching zzso zzso or zzso zzso Only zzso of the latter had disability at year 5, but zzso reached this at 8 zzso 

zzso zzso determines the risk for converting to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis and zzso with disability at 5 zzso The proportion of patients developing disability is low during the first 5 years but rapidly increases shortly zzso
