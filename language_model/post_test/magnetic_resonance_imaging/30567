Various zzso zzso techniques have been developed to treat zzso zzso zzso fixation of zzso poses a risk of injury to the zzso artery and internal carotid artery zzso zzso to the zzso caused by zzso screws is extremely rare, but has been zzso To characterize this risk, the authors studied the anatomical relationship of the zzso to the lateral mass of zzso 

The authors studied 100 patients who had undergone zzso zzso scanning and magnetic resonance imaging of the neck to assess the position of the zzso in association with the zzso lateral zzso Each zzso was classified into 1 of the following 4 zzso Zone 1 zzso to lateral zzso Zone 2 zzso half of lateral zzso Zone 3 zzso half of lateral zzso and Zone 4 zzso to lateral zzso For patients with an zzso zzso to the lateral mass, the shortest distance between the zzso and lateral mass was measured to determine the margin of error with an zzso zzso zzso 

Of the 100 patients, zzso had a left zzso in zzso 2 and 3 with a mean distance from the anterior zzso of zzso zzso zzso standard zzso and zzso had a right zzso in zzso 2 and 3 with a mean distance from the anterior zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso anterior to the lateral mass were noted in zzso of patients, and zzso had zzso 1 zzso anterior to the lateral zzso When the zzso was anterior to the lateral mass, it was more commonly in the lateral half zzso zzso in zzso and right zzso in zzso The left zzso was in Zone 1 in zzso and Zone 4 in zzso The right zzso was in Zone 1 in zzso and Zone 4 in zzso 

A high percentage of patients demonstrate an zzso directly zzso to the zzso lateral mass, which poses a risk of zzso injury caused by an zzso zzso zzso
