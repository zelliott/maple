zzso signal generation in zzso depends on the concentration and zzso of zzso or other zzso zzso and contrast depends on local differences in zzso In this zzso study, we explore the use of zzso solid-state devices for generating zzso signal and/or contrast in zzso and in zzso We introduce the concept of zzso devices zzso which are zzso zzso zzso using zzso systems zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to resonate at the zzso zzso frequency of zzso zzso zzso and were zzso using zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso spiral zzso The performance of zzso having final diameters of zzso 500, and 1000 zzso were characterized in saline using a radio frequency zzso scanning microscope and a clinical zzso MR zzso The measured zzso fields of 300 zzso to 1000 zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and their quality factors zzso ranged from zzso to zzso When implanted zzso in the flank of a zzso only zzso tuned to the resonant frequency of zzso generated a measurable in zzso zzso zzso This study lays the foundation for a new class of solid-state contrast agents for zzso
