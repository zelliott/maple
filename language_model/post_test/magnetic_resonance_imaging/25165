A zzso zzso system was used to grow zzso zzso cartilage tissue in zzso zzso resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso methods were used to characterize the flow and zzso profiles and the growth, distribution, and zzso of the zzso in the resulting zzso These zzso were correlated with each other and with subsequent zzso zzso The study has demonstrated that these zzso magnetic resonance methods will be useful for designing zzso operation strategies and cell scaffolds that lead to the production of zzso zzso cartilage zzso with properties resembling those of the native zzso
