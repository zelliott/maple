zzso attenuated inversion recovery zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso techniques have been widely used to evaluate white matter zzso zzso associated with aging, zzso and cerebral vascular zzso The relationship between zzso detected zzso zzso zzso and zzso detected zzso integrity changes, however, remains zzso To investigate this association, zzso correlations between 4 zzso zzso and zzso images from elderly subjects were performed by relating zzso volume and intensity in zzso to fractional zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso correlations were found in regions overlapping with the zzso of moderate zzso in zzso No significant correlations were detected in zzso regions where the zzso zzso are particularly zzso The findings are consistent with a transitional model for zzso zzso from normal zzso to zzso fluid zzso The results show that the correlation between zzso and zzso disappears when the zzso intensity of zzso reaches its maximum at a certain zzso severity, and that the correlations may zzso with reversed signs when the zzso severity is further zzso These results suggest that the different stages of zzso zzso in elderly subjects can be better characterized by regional zzso correlations than single zzso zzso
