To describe early results regarding efficacy and safety of magnetic resonance zzso focused ultrasound surgery zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso among a population of Japanese zzso 

In this single site study, 48 Japanese women, over 18 years of age, who were candidates for surgical intervention due to symptomatic zzso were zzso Fifty-five zzso zzso were treated by zzso and followed up for 12 zzso 

During the 12-month follow-up period, two patients zzso required surgical interventions, and two patients required additional drug treatment for zzso The average reduction in zzso volume determined by MR imaging at 6 months after treatment was zzso This volume reduction is correlated with the zzso treated zzso No serious complications were recorded during the treatments or follow-up zzso 

zzso can safely be used to zzso treat symptomatic zzso zzso and avoid the need for surgical intervention in the short zzso With large treatment volumes, zzso also results in significant zzso shrinkage in a relatively short zzso Additional follow-up is needed to determine the long-term durability of this promising zzso zzso
