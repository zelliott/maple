We investigated whether early activity in the zzso region, corresponding to human zzso is influenced by a face zzso and/or features such as the mouth using zzso zzso We used apparent motion as visual stimuli and compared four conditions as zzso zzso zzso A zzso face consisting of a face zzso two zzso and a horizontal Line zzso zzso The zzso and two zzso zzso zzso Two zzso and a horizontal Line and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso described a simple movement of dots for D, but eye movement for zzso DL and CD, though movement zzso were the same through all zzso We used a single equivalent current zzso zzso model within zzso zzso after stimulus onset and estimated the location, zzso moment zzso and peak zzso There were no significant differences in the peak zzso of the estimated zzso between each condition, but the activity was significantly stronger for zzso than for CD zzso DL zzso and D zzso in the right hemisphere, and DL and D zzso in the zzso These results indicated that there is specific information processing for eye movements in the zzso region, the human zzso zzso and this activity was significantly influenced by whether movements appeared with the face zzso and/or features, in other words, whether the eyes moved or not, even if the movement itself was the zzso
