This study explored effects of zzso load on stimulus processing in the presence and absence of an attended zzso Participants were presented with a bilateral or unilateral display and asked to perform a discrimination task at either low or high zzso zzso zzso responses to stimuli were then compared at the zzso and zzso As in previous studies, zzso load modified processing of attended and unattended stimuli seen at zzso scalp zzso Moreover, zzso load modulated attention effects when the attended stimulus was presented at high zzso load for unilateral zzso However, this was not true when the attended and unattended stimulus appeared simultaneously in bilateral zzso Instead, only a main effect of zzso load was zzso zzso in processing zzso to the unattended stimulus at the zzso provide support for zzso zzso theory of selective zzso
