To determine the precision with which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in term and zzso infants can be identified by zzso brain zzso 

This is a zzso study whose inclusion criteria were zzso born at zzso or zzso weeks gestation with a zzso gas at delivery, suspected neurological zzso and zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso zzso with zzso and major zzso zzso were zzso Brain imaging for zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and base deficit zzso 12 zzso at birth and zzso were zzso reviewed by a zzso blinded to their clinical course and zzso 

There were 54 zzso admitted to the zzso at a single university hospital between 1992 and 2006 that met these inclusion criteria of which 27 had zzso zzso at zzso There were 16 diagnosed clinically as having zzso at the time of zzso zzso 13 from the zzso group and 3 from the zzso zzso zzso signs of zzso zzso injury were significantly more common in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for zzso age showed that zzso signs of zzso zzso injury could identify the presence of zzso with area under the zzso curve of zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value of zzso 

zzso signs of zzso zzso injury on early zzso imaging are associated with zzso zzso and zzso but is not precise enough to serve as a gold standard in the identification of these zzso
