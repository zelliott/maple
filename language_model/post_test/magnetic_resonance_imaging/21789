It is not uncommon for zzso transformation of giant cell tumor zzso of bone to occur after radiation, but rarely does zzso transformation occur spontaneously, with less than 15 cases reported up to zzso Only four of these cases have been documented in zzso We report two additional cases of zzso of bone spontaneously transforming or zzso into zzso without radiation zzso The first case is absolutely unique and most interesting in that the zzso process occurred in one of multiple zzso lung zzso 6 years after successful zzso of a primary zzso zzso The right lung was zzso due to development of a large zzso and at zzso examination, demonstrated several small zzso of conventional zzso and a much larger, zzso mass composed of a mixture of zzso and high-grade zzso The second case involved a physician, who had a large tumor in the zzso with vague symptoms for 8 zzso Open biopsy revealed zzso benign zzso of bone with a secondary zzso bone zzso Complete zzso 2 weeks later revealed, in addition to areas of zzso benign zzso a second component of very high grade zzso Both patients died less than zzso years from zzso This report of zzso transformation of a conventional zzso of bone strengthens the theory that there is a zzso cell line in zzso that may spontaneously transform to zzso
