The study compared the presence of the high-intensity zone on magnetic resonance imaging with the results of awake zzso 

To see if there was a correlation between the results of awake zzso and the presence of a high-intensity zone on magnetic resonance zzso 

The evaluation of zzso pain has proved to be somewhat zzso Recent studies have indicated the high-intensity zone as being highly sensitive in the diagnosis of the painful zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate whether the presence of a high-intensity zone is associated with a zzso pain response on awake zzso 

zzso resonance images were obtained in 29 patients with low back pain with and without zzso zzso patients were considered for surgical intervention after falling to respond to conservative zzso The presence of a high-intensity zone was specifically looked for within the zzso zzso Each patient subsequently underwent awake zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was classified according to the Dallas zzso zzso and the presence of a zzso pain zzso zzso analysis was used to calculate the presence of a high-intensity zone versus disc disruption and the correlation of high-intensity zone and zzso pain zzso 

There was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of a high-intensity zone and a zzso pain response at any zzso The high-intensity zone was, however, never seen in a zzso normal zzso 

Although the high-intensity zone is present within the zzso zzso of some abnormal discs, it is not necessarily associated with a zzso pain zzso
