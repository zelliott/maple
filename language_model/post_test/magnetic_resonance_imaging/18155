zzso is a zzso anomaly of the brain that is sometimes associated with intractable zzso Patients that suffer from medically zzso zzso may be considered for surgical zzso 

Five patients with intractable zzso associated with zzso were zzso zzso methods included medical history assessment, neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging zzso with three-dimensional zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring with surface zzso and zzso grid electrodes, sodium zzso test, and zzso zzso zzso was performed close to the zzso zzso in two patients, and at an area distant from the zzso in one under the guidance of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in two zzso 

zzso revealed unilateral zzso in all five zzso zzso monitoring recorded simple partial zzso in two patients and complex partial zzso in three zzso The zzso zone was localized close to the zzso zzso in two patients, distant to the zzso in one patient, and in the zzso lobe in two zzso zzso one of two patients with zzso zzso and one of three patients with zzso were zzso at zzso zzso Three patients experienced marked seizure reduction but were not zzso at 1 year; however, at the follow-up periods of zzso years and zzso years, two of these three patients were seizure zzso One patient who underwent zzso zzso began to have very brief losses of consciousness lasting 1-3 s zzso times per zzso Neurological complications included temporary upper zzso in one and zzso in zzso 

The abnormal zzso lining zzso zzso and cortical zzso near the zzso may be zzso Areas distant to the zzso may also be the source of zzso zzso evaluation should be performed to define the zzso zone in patients with intractable zzso associated with zzso and meticulous zzso of the zzso zone can lead to good seizure zzso
