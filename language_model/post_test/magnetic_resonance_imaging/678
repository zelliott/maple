Recent functional imaging studies have shown that sounds with zzso pitch produce selective zzso in zzso zzso zzso This paper reports a zzso zzso study of the zzso dynamics of this zzso The cortical response specific to pitch was isolated from the zzso response in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso paradigm in which regular and irregular click trains alternate without zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso was 6, 12, 24, or 48 zzso the train length was zzso zzso The auditory sustained field serves as a zzso baseline that enhances the zzso ratio over previous zzso The onset of pitch was accompanied by a prominent transient field, followed by a strong sustained field, both of which were associated with sources in lateral zzso zzso The sustained field rose from baseline about 70 zzso after the onset of zzso zzso zzso at about 450 zzso and commenced its return to baseline about 70 zzso after pitch zzso The peak of the transient field occurred between 130 and 190 zzso after zzso onset depending on the zzso The zzso of the cortical pitch response are substantially longer than might be anticipated from zzso models of pitch zzso This finding suggests that the zzso integration associated with zzso processing occurs in a zzso structure, and that the cortical responses reflect subsequent processes involving the measurement of pitch values and changes in zzso
