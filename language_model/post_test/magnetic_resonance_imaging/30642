Two identical zzso such as a pair of electrical shocks to the skin, are readily perceived as two separate events in time provided the zzso between them is sufficiently zzso However, as they are presented progressively closer together, there comes a point when the two separate stimuli are perceived as a single zzso zzso to zzso zzso cortex, zzso motor area zzso and zzso zzso can disturb this form of zzso zzso Our aim was to zzso in healthy subjects, the brain areas that are involved in this zzso During functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso paired electrical zzso separated by variable zzso intervals zzso zzso were delivered to different sites on one zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso were required to simply detect the stimulus zzso zzso or to identify a stimulus zzso For zzso discrimination zzso subjects reported whether they felt one or two zzso For spatial discrimination, they reported whether the stimuli were located on the right or left side of the zzso zzso reported their choice by pressing a button with the opposite zzso Our results showed that discrimination, as opposed to simply zzso activated several brain zzso Most were common to both discrimination zzso These included regions of prefrontal cortex, right zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso and anterior zzso was found to be specific to the TD zzso This suggests that these two frontal regions may play a role in the zzso processing of zzso zzso
