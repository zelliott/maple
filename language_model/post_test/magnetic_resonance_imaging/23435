zzso of sensation and pain in healthy people are believed to be the net result of sensory input and descending zzso from zzso and cortical regions depending on emotional and cognitive zzso Here, the influence of attention on neural activity in the spinal zzso during zzso sensory stimulation of the hand was investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging by systematically varying the zzso attention focus across and within repeated zzso Attention states included zzso attention to the stimulus by rating the sensation and zzso attention away from the stimulus by performing various mental tasks of watching a movie and identifying characters, detecting the direction of zzso moving dots within a randomly moving visual field and answering zzso zzso zzso zzso results spanning the cervical spinal zzso and zzso consistently demonstrated that the attention state had a significant influence on the activity detected in the cervical spinal cord, as well as in zzso regions involved with the descending analgesia zzso These findings have important implications for the detection and study of pain, and improved characterization of the effects of injury or zzso
