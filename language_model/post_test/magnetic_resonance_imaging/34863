To compare the results of clinical assessment and zzso with zzso findings in the diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso associated zzso zzso 

A retrospective study of 35 patients infected with zzso who were examined at zzso between four and 70 zzso zzso days after neurological assessment and zzso 

Of the 35 patients, 19 had diffuse white matter zzso on zzso weighted zzso six of whom also had focal zzso Nine other patients had focal white matter zzso and seven had changes in cortical zzso zzso zzso in the 19 with diffuse white matter zzso showed zzso zzso zzso with encephalitis in 10, zzso encephalitis in three, both zzso encephalitis and zzso encephalitis in one, zzso in three, and zzso inflammation in zzso zzso in the 16 other patients without diffuse white matter zzso showed zzso encephalitis in six, zzso encephalitis (without zzso in two, zzso encephalitis and zzso encephalitis in one, zzso associated abnormalities in five, zzso zzso encephalitis in one, and zzso in zzso zzso DNA was detected in zzso of five of seven patients with zzso encephalitis and in two of two with zzso associated zzso but without zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso on zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and a positive zzso value of zzso for diagnosis of zzso 

zzso white matter zzso on zzso can be due to either zzso or zzso associated pathology or zzso zzso
