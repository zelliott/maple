We know that the contrast of MR images can be better than that of CT zzso In the spin echo mode, sequences with long zzso and long TE provide great contrast, while, conversely, sequences with short zzso and TE produce images with a greater anatomical zzso This dual performance, a notion that had never been expressed as explicitly in imaging, has led to distinguishing between the roles of zzso for detection and tissue characterization zzso and zzso While the choice of an appropriate sequence for characterization has apparently been made immediately with a zzso of zzso zzso the selection of a detection sequence is less zzso The number of parameters involved zzso and zzso ratios, spatial resolution, artifacts, imaging zzso and the compromise arrangements needed to take them into account explain the lack of consensus as to the optimal sequence for zzso Instead of becoming simpler with time, the issue is increasingly complex, as now fast imaging has been developed in addition to conventional spin echo imaging, and may even zzso zzso
