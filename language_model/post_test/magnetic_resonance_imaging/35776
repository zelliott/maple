Brain iron was zzso on a zzso zzso zzso scanner using a zzso pulse zzso zzso was zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen as decreased intensity on zzso zzso The zzso pulse sequences were improved for identification of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso the zzso to zzso zzso and the TE to zzso zzso zzso artifacts at the level of the zzso fissures caused increased noise, obscuring the brain iron in the zzso zzso with the TE of 120 zzso This artifact was substantially reduced or eliminated by lowering the TE to 80 zzso changing the zzso zzso to the Y zzso or using additional pulsing in the slice and read zzso Use of either the improved zzso or zzso pulse sequences on a zzso MR scanner provides improved evaluation of brain zzso
