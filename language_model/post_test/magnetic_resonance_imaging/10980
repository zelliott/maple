The zzso zzso Dixon zzso zzso technique has recently been proposed as a method for zzso zzso decomposition in spiral zzso It also zzso for zzso blurring artifacts using only two data zzso In the zzso zzso technique, several predetermined zzso zzso are tested to both separate water and fat signals and zzso the zzso zzso Unfortunately, the zzso is zzso quite intensive since the range of tested zzso must be set sufficiently large to span the full range of anticipated zzso variation over the scanned zzso The block regional zzso correction zzso zzso zzso for zzso blurring artifacts block by block through the reconstructed image and usually provides several times higher zzso efficiency than the conventional zzso zzso correction zzso This work shows that both zzso decomposition and blurring artifact correction can be performed block by block using two spiral images with different zzso and that this new technique zzso zzso significantly improves the zzso efficiency of other zzso zzso zzso opening new opportunities for spiral zzso
