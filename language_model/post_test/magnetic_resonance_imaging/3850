zzso zzso of the prostate reveals relative zzso levels that vary according to the presence or absence of zzso providing a sensitive method for the identification of patients with zzso Current interpretations of prostate data rely on zzso zzso that fit model zzso zzso to individual zzso zzso and calculate relative levels of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pattern recognition techniques can potentially improve the detection of prostate cancer, but these analyses are hampered by zzso and sources of noise in the data, such as variations in phase and frequency of zzso Phase and frequency variations may arise as a result of spatial field zzso or local zzso conditions affecting the frequency of zzso in particular those of zzso Thus, there are unique challenges in developing a peak alignment zzso for these zzso We have developed a frequency and phase correction zzso for automatic alignment of the zzso in prostate zzso zzso We zzso with a simulated zzso that alignment can be achieved to a phase standard zzso of zzso zzso and a frequency standard zzso of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Three parameters were used to assess the improvement in peak alignment in the zzso data of five zzso the percentage of zzso in all zzso zzso explained by their first principal zzso the zzso ratio of a spectrum formed by taking the median value of the entire set at each spectral zzso and the mean zzso between all pairs of zzso These parameters showed a greater similarity between zzso in all five zzso and the simulated data, demonstrating improved alignment for phase and frequency in these zzso This peak alignment program is expected to improve pattern recognition significantly, enabling accurate detection and zzso of prostate cancer with zzso
