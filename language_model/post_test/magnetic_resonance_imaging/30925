zzso protein plays a role in promoting the maturation of a variety of zzso in many different zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso transgenic mice and the chronic zzso of zzso in zzso syndrome and in schizophrenia suggest that zzso zzso is related to abnormal brain zzso zzso we believed that the zzso of zzso protein might be implicated in zzso brain zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serum zzso protein levels in patients with zzso brain dysfunction, such as cerebral zzso and delayed development, and to determine the clinical relevance of serum zzso protein in these zzso The mean values of serum zzso protein were significantly increased in both zzso Patients with cerebral zzso had a zzso protein level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and those with delayed development of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with a normal control level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso as the normal mean plus three standard zzso was found in zzso of the total patient group zzso development zzso and cerebral zzso zzso The frequency of zzso was not significantly related to clinical diagnosis, disease severity or to brain zzso zzso However, patients who had zzso zzso by brain zzso showed a wide range and very high levels of zzso exceeding 10,000 zzso in some zzso These findings suggest that the zzso implied by the zzso of zzso protein during brain development may play a role in zzso brain zzso
