zzso responses to alcohol represent a biologically based, genetically moderated, and clinically zzso marker of alcoholism zzso however, the physiology underlying this zzso remains zzso This study tested whether zzso responses during alcohol administration predict neural responses to alcohol cues in the scanner and whether these neural responses differ between zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso individuals were recruited (10 zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso for a zzso alcohol administration in the laboratory and a functional magnetic resonance imaging session consisting of an alcohol taste cues zzso Laboratory assessments of alcohol high, zzso zzso and positive and negative reinforcement during alcohol administration were entered as zzso of neural response to the presentation of alcohol cues versus water cues in the scanner and further tested for zzso zzso moderation zzso zzso at Z zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Alcohol craving during alcohol administration predicted less neural activity, whereas alcohol reinforcement predicted greater neural activity to alcohol cues versus water cues in regions including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Alcohol high predicted greater neural activity to alcohol cues in regions including the zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to moderate these zzso No results were observed for alcohol zzso 

This study provides initial evidence that zzso responses to alcohol, namely zzso high, and the reinforcing properties of alcohol, predict neural markers of alcohol cue zzso These results support the zzso of laboratory and zzso measures of zzso responses to alcohol and offer an integration of these methods in a sample of zzso zzso
