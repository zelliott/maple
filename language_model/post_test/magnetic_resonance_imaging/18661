Juvenile muscular zzso of the zzso upper zzso zzso is zzso to be a type of zzso zzso However, patients with typical clinical features of zzso but without evidence of zzso zzso have been zzso We recently reported a significant association of zzso with airway zzso Here we report the successful treatment by plasma exchange zzso of two patients with both airway zzso and zzso without evidence of zzso zzso Patient 1 had a zzso history of allergic zzso and high zzso of zzso zzso zzso and patient 2 had an zzso history of zzso and high zzso of cedar zzso zzso Both patients noted progressive zzso muscle zzso and weakness of the upper zzso patient 1 for 3 months and patient 2 for 3 zzso zzso both showed zzso intrinsic hand muscle zzso zzso zzso of the zzso muscles, and weakness and contraction zzso zzso of these muscles without any sensory zzso Neither had any evidence of zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a zzso zzso Both were subjected to zzso three zzso Soon after the zzso both showed improvement of zzso muscle weakness of the upper zzso and marked reduction of contraction zzso of the zzso zzso Patient 1 showed marked reduction in ongoing zzso zzso in the zzso muscles on needle zzso while patient 2 showed marked improvement of F wave persistence of bilateral median and zzso zzso zzso total and zzso zzso decreased after zzso in both zzso zzso was thus considered to be effective in these two patients having zzso without evidence of zzso zzso These observations may suggest the involvement of an zzso process in the neural damage of zzso without evidence of zzso zzso especially in patients with zzso zzso and may support the notion that zzso is zzso zzso
