A zzso man was admitted to our hospital because of left pure motor zzso zzso examination was performed after three hours of zzso but no apparent zzso responsible for the zzso was detected by CT and zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso however, demonstrated a high signal area with good contrast in the zzso limb of right internal zzso This zzso was compatible with patient's clinical zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso of the zzso was lower than that of normal control at the timing of zzso On the following day within 24 hours after the zzso it was revealed that both left zzso and high signal area on zzso had disappeared, and the zzso on the zzso zzso was restored to normal zzso Changes in the intensity on zzso corresponded well with zzso of zzso injury, which suggested that zzso was very useful for diagnosis of zzso
