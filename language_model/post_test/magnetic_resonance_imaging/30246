The common zzso zzso zzso a New World zzso has recently been used as a model of focal cerebral zzso Here, we sought to develop a stroke model in this species using an zzso approach to zzso the middle cerebral artery zzso This technically simple procedure allows both transient and permanent zzso with minimal zzso Ten common zzso underwent either transient (3 zzso or permanent zzso by the zzso of a nylon filament through the external carotid artery up to the origin of the zzso zzso blood flow zzso was monitored by the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions were regularly zzso and zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging analyses were performed 8 days after the zzso The surgical procedure was achieved zzso without zzso mortality or cerebral zzso All animals displayed a consistent decrease in zzso that remained stable over 3 zzso zzso affected both cortical and zzso zzso Although not statistically zzso the volume of zzso was smaller in zzso subjected to transient zzso compared to those permanently zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In all the zzso tests used, zzso zzso exhibited fewer zzso and functional zzso compared to permanently zzso zzso We show the feasibility of the induction of permanent or transient focal cerebral zzso in the zzso using an zzso approach with minimal zzso This model could be suitable as an advanced screening for potential stroke therapies in which zzso imaging, and zzso analyses can be zzso
