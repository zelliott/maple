The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of cerebral zzso in zzso scuba divers and explain the causes of them: potential risk factors zzso cardiovascular risk factors, low zzso capacity, or characteristics of diving zzso depth, ascent zzso zzso scuba zzso over 40 years of age, without any zzso sickness zzso history were zzso We studied 30 scuba divers zzso without any clinical zzso For all of them, we carried out a clinical examination with fatty body mass determination and we questioned them about their diving zzso A brain zzso zzso imaging zzso an assessment of zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso and zzso were systematically carried zzso zzso spots of high intensity were found at 33 % in the scuba diving group and 30 % in the control zzso In the diving group, abnormalities were related to unsafe zzso or zzso zzso In our study, we did not find a significant relationship between the zzso of the central nervous system, and the age, depth of the zzso number of zzso and zzso performances zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso serum level of blood zzso Nevertheless, we found a significant relationship between the zzso of the central nervous system and ascent rate faster than 10 meters per minute zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or presence of high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We found zzso results using the zzso zzso meaningful link between the number of brain zzso and the speed of zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso p zzso zzso We concluded that zzso can be explained by zzso nitrogen gas zzso and particularly in presence of cholesterol, when the ascent rate is up to 10 meters per zzso So, it was remarkable to note that zzso patients practicing scuba diving either professionally or zzso presented zzso of the central nervous zzso This survey permitted us to highlight in a population of professional zzso neurological and also cardiovascular abnormalities zzso zzso although none of them present any symptoms zzso It seems therefore important to us to propose in the future, for a better prevention of neurological injuries, a systematic follow-up by zzso oxygen consumption measure, brain zzso and zzso In the same way, our results suggest a modification of the diving tables with a zzso zzso rate at 9 m zzso zzso zzso
