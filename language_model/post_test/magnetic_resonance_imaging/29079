An improved zzso local zzso insert has been constructed and built into the patient bed to reduce its impact on bore size and setup zzso It allows the field of view to be reduced without introducing zzso zzso Image quality and artifacts were evaluated for pulse sequences relevant to cardiac zzso The utility of the insert is demonstrated by a zzso zzso study, in which the reduced field of view allowed a zzso increase in resolution and one more slice to be zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
