Identification of the motor strip on MR imaging studies is difficult in the presence of mass effect and zzso zzso because zzso landmarks are zzso We zzso that a difference in cortical thickness between the motor and sensory strips is readily apparent on zzso images in the presence of zzso zzso and reliably identifies the central zzso 

Thirteen patients with brain tumors resulting in zzso zzso near the central zzso were zzso The cortical thickness of the anterior and zzso banks of the central zzso as well as the neighboring zzso in the frontal and zzso zzso were measured from zzso zzso Similar measures were obtained from neighboring zzso in the frontal and zzso zzso zzso of the central zzso was confirmed with standard zzso landmarks in all patients and by zzso cortical mapping in 2 zzso 

A twofold difference in cortical thickness between the anterior and zzso banks of the central zzso uniquely identified the central zzso on zzso images in the presence of zzso zzso despite the marked distortion of zzso anatomy as a result of mass zzso This relationship was not present in neighboring zzso 

zzso differences in the motor and sensory zzso result in a markedly thicker zzso than anterior bank of the central zzso that is readily visible on routine zzso images in the presence of zzso zzso zzso the cortical thickness can serve as a complementary method in identification of the motor strip in patients with mass zzso
