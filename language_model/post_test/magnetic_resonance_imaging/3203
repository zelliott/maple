zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the internal auditory canal and the inner ear was zzso We used zzso fast zzso sequences to zzso the inner ear and the individual nerves in the internal auditory canal with high contrast in a short acquisition zzso zzso quantitative measurement of the nerves was performed to estimate the zzso areas and the diameters of the zzso The average diameters of the facial zzso the cochlear zzso and the zzso nerve of zzso individuals were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso angle, the average diameter of the eighth nerve was zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patients with unilateral and bilateral hearing loss were also zzso In the patient with unilateral deafness, the cochlear nerve of the diseased side was not identified and the eighth zzso nerve diameter was smaller than that of the normal zzso In the patient with bilateral deafness, zzso of the inner ear and zzso of the eight nerve were demonstrated in the ear with zzso zzso The present method may represent a new approach to the assessment of zzso processes involving the inner ear and the nerves in the internal auditory zzso
