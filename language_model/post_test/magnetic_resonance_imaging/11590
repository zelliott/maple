zzso zzso zzso studies designed for simultaneously measuring Blood zzso Level zzso zzso and zzso Blood zzso zzso signal often employ the standard zzso zzso zzso Recovery zzso zzso However, some sensitivity is lost in the zzso data due to inherent zzso zzso We sought to minimize the preceding problem by employing a modified zzso FAIR zzso technique, which (in zzso should provide identical zzso signal as FAIR with minimal degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso maps acquired from human subjects zzso zzso 8) showed significantly higher mean zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and number of activated zzso at zzso On the other hand, the corresponding FAIR zzso maps were superior to the zzso zzso maps as reflected in a higher mean zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and number of activated zzso The reduction in zzso sensitivity for zzso is attributed to increased motion sensitivity related to its higher background zzso and, zzso related losses from the use of an extra inversion zzso Data acquired at zzso demonstrating similar trends are also zzso
