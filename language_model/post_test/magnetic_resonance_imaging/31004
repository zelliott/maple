To understand the cause and prevention of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso the authors describe the value of zzso in predicting the surgical plane of zzso 

A prospective study of 100 zzso was performed, in which tumor size, absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and types of zzso zzso zzso is, zzso zzso or zzso were correlated with the type of dissection plane zzso zzso or zzso encountered at zzso A direct correlation was found between the tumor size identified on zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging sequences and the degree of zzso zzso surgical plane of zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar correlation was found with the grade of zzso zzso identified on zzso computerized zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso or zzso MR imaging sequences zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso as seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso interface on zzso zzso MR imaging sequences was not zzso of the surgical plane zzso zzso zzso The worst clinical outcome was found in the tumors located in eloquent areas and in which a zzso plane was encountered at surgery zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso on zzso CT and MR studies and tumor zzso zzso as seen on selective zzso can be used to predict the surgical plane of zzso in zzso The association between tumor size and a zzso surgical plane may be explained by a more zzso zzso seen on zzso zzso with a location in eloquent zzso and a zzso dissection plane should be considered a high-risk zzso
