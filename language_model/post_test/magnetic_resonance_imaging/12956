The prefrontal zzso zzso plays a crucial role in cognitive control and higher mental functions by maintaining working memory representations of currently relevant information, thereby inducing a mindset that zzso the processing of such zzso Using zzso we examined how the human zzso zzso mindsets for information at varying levels of zzso zzso solved zzso grouped into three kinds of blocks zzso moderately abstract, and highly zzso according to the degree of abstraction of their zzso zzso were induced by zzso subjects at the beginning of every block as to the degree of abstraction of solutions they should look zzso Different levels of abstraction were matched for accuracy and reaction time, allowing us to examine the effects of varying abstraction in the absence of variations in cognitive zzso zzso for concrete, moderately abstract, and highly abstract information were associated with stronger relative recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions, respectively, suggesting a functional topography zzso increasingly anterior regions are zzso associated with representations of increasing zzso Rather than being a structural property of the zzso in different prefrontal zzso this relative specialization may reflect one of the principles according to which lateral zzso zzso codes and organizes zzso zzso
