To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings to the clinical features in patients with middle ear zzso with labyrinthine zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso patients who underwent surgery for middle ear zzso with one or more labyrinthine zzso confirmed by CT were zzso zzso imaging analysis was performed using three-dimensional zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso size measured by CT and the signal intensity ratio zzso between the affected zzso in the inner ear and the zzso measured by zzso zzso were evaluated with respect to the clinical features and surgical zzso 

The zzso was not correlated with zzso zzso The hearing threshold determined by zzso bone zzso correlated with the zzso especially in patients with acute zzso hearing loss, but it did not correlate with zzso zzso Patients with zzso symptoms had a significantly higher zzso than those without symptoms, and similar findings were observed in patients with an active zzso Patients with a larger zzso or higher zzso tended to have a deeper zzso and a more adhesive zzso zzso at zzso 

zzso was more strongly correlated than CT findings to the clinical status of patients with labyrinthine zzso caused by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso labyrinth correlated with the zzso thus, zzso may accurately reflect the extent of inner ear dysfunction with a labyrinthine zzso
