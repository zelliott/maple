Few studies have investigated the function of the zzso zzso zzso This study zzso the three-dimensional zzso zzso of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso Eleven subjects were zzso using magnetic resonance zzso zzso plane images were outlined to create a zzso model of the zzso zzso and zzso and included the attachment sites of the zzso zzso Each attachment site was divided into central, zzso and lateral zzso Next, the subjects were zzso using zzso from two zzso directions while performing a zzso zzso The models and zzso images were used to reproduce the motion of the zzso zzso and zzso The apparent zzso zzso plane angle, and zzso plane angle of each third of the zzso zzso were measured from the relative motion of the attachment zzso All three portions of the zzso zzso zzso similarly with zzso The length of the zzso zzso significantly from full extension to 30 degrees zzso From 30 degrees zzso degrees , no significant change in the length of the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was oriented zzso at zzso angles less than 60 degrees and zzso zzso From full extension to 60 degrees , the zzso orientation of the zzso zzso decreased significantly with zzso These data may have important implications for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using zzso zzso zzso and for the design of rehabilitation regimens for patients of zzso zzso zzso
