The zzso is an excellent model for the developing human brain, and has been used increasingly in various centers for studies of traumatic brain injury and other zzso Unlike zzso or zzso models, however, there are few behavioral scales for the zzso and the available ones are used to test general responsiveness rather than specific functional zzso The differing behavioral zzso of animals of different ages provide an additional challenge when zzso injury responses are zzso To overcome these experimental limitations of zzso in brain injury research, the authors developed a functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging paradigm that can be used to track recovery in the zzso zzso over time in zzso animals of different zzso 

Fifteen zzso imaging studies in eight zzso were performed before and after scaled cortical impact injury to the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and imaging protocols enabled zzso of cortical zzso and comparison with zzso evoked zzso obtained before and after injury was zzso A zzso brain template for zzso analysis of these data was constructed, similar to the zzso imaging techniques used in humans, to allow for group comparisons and zzso change analysis over zzso 

Loss of function in a specifically traumatized cortical region and its subsequent recovery over time can now be demonstrated visually by zzso imaging in the zzso Besides its value in understanding intrinsic recovery mechanisms and plasticity at different ages, this functional outcome measure will enable the use of the zzso model in treatment trials specifically designed for the immature zzso
