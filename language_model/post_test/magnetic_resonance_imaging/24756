We combined quantitative relaxation rate zzso zzso zzso measure local zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso surfaces were reconstructed and used to sample zzso at different cortical zzso Like zzso zzso decreased from deeper to superficial zzso zzso decreased passing from zzso and zzso to immediately surrounding areas, then to the angular zzso High zzso was correlated across the zzso with convex local zzso so the data was first zzso By zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that many visual area borders were associated with significant zzso increases including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso occupied only the zzso portion of an zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were zzso within individuals and comparable between subjects without intensity zzso enabling zzso studies of development, aging, and disease zzso and zzso mapping in other zzso
