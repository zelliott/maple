Our goal was to zzso among normal elderly and individuals with mild cognitive zzso which zzso lobe zzso regions predicted decline to zzso of the Alzheimer's type zzso zzso received an zzso at baseline and a clinical and cognitive evaluation at baseline and zzso By using the baseline zzso we assessed the anatomical subdivisions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle and inferior zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso We studied two groups of carefully screened zzso and zzso elderly zzso 26 normal elderly zzso and 20 individuals with mild cognitive impairment zzso Fourteen individuals (12 from the zzso group and two from the NL zzso declined to zzso within the zzso follow-up zzso We used zzso zzso analyses to ascertain whether the baseline brain volumes were useful zzso of decline to zzso at follow-up after accounting for age, zzso individual differences in brain size, and other variables known to predict zzso After accounting for age, zzso and head size, adding the volume of the zzso zzso lobe (the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and an index of global zzso raised the accuracy of overall zzso to zzso However, the ability to detect those individuals who declined zzso was low at zzso When baseline zzso zzso and the combined middle and inferior zzso zzso were added to the zzso model, the overall zzso accuracy reached zzso and, most importantly, the sensitivity rose to zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso and the combined middle and inferior zzso zzso may be the first zzso lobe zzso sites affected in zzso zzso in these areas may herald the presence of future zzso among zzso zzso No other clinical baseline variables examined predicted decline with sensitivities above zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was not associated with zzso
