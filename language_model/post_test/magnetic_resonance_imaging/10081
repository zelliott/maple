zzso analysis related to visual object recognition is traditionally thought to zzso serially along a bottom-up hierarchy of zzso zzso Recent proposals gradually promote the role of zzso processing in recognition, but how such zzso is triggered remains a zzso We tested a specific model, proposing that low spatial zzso facilitate visual object recognition by initiating zzso processes projected from zzso to visual zzso The present study combined zzso which has superior zzso resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and a behavioral task that yields successful recognition with stimulus zzso Object recognition zzso differential activity that developed in the left zzso zzso 50 zzso earlier than it did in zzso areas in the zzso zzso This early zzso activity was directly modulated by the presence of low spatial zzso in the zzso Taken together, the dynamics we revealed provide strong support for the proposal of how zzso zzso of object recognition is zzso and our observations are used to derive predictions for future zzso
