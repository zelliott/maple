Delayed cerebral necrosis zzso is a significant risk for brain tumor patients treated with high-dose zzso Although zzso zzso from tumor progression is an important clinical question, the distinction cannot be made reliably by conventional imaging zzso We undertook a pilot study to assess the ability of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso to differentiate zzso between zzso or zzso tumor in a series of children treated for primary brain tumors with high-dose zzso 

Twelve children zzso 3-16 zzso who had clinical and MR imaging zzso changes that suggested a diagnosis of either zzso or zzso brain zzso underwent localized zzso MRS prior to planned zzso zzso or other zzso zzso zzso Prospective zzso MRS interpretations were based on comparison of spectral peak patterns and quantitative peak area values from zzso zzso a marked depression of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso compounds was hypothesized to indicate zzso and zzso zzso with easily visible zzso zzso zzso was labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso studies identified the brain zzso as zzso or zzso zzso 

The patient series included five cases of zzso and seven zzso tumor cases, based on zzso The MRS criteria zzso identified five out of seven patients with active zzso and four out of five patients with zzso proven zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the primary diagnostic information for zzso zzso from tumor lay in the zzso MRS peak areas for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance zzso shows promising sensitivity and selectivity for zzso zzso from zzso brain zzso A novel diagnostic index based on peak areas for zzso and zzso compounds may provide a simple zzso for zzso zzso from zzso or residual primary brain zzso
