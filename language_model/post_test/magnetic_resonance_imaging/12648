zzso reports regarding the detection of zzso currents have left the feasibility of zzso current zzso zzso an open zzso Most previous zzso studies in human subjects are suspect due to their inability to separate or eliminate zzso zzso In this study, we used a bloodless turtle brain preparation that eliminates zzso effects, to explore the feasibility of detecting zzso zzso signals at zzso zzso zzso turtle zzso with eyes zzso were dissected from the zzso and placed in artificial cerebral spinal zzso Light flashes were delivered to the eyes to evoke zzso zzso Local field potential zzso and zzso signals were measured in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals were observed in turtle zzso but no significant signal changes synchronized with zzso currents were found in the zzso zzso In this study, detection thresholds of zzso and zzso degrees were set for zzso magnitude and phase signal changes, zzso The absence of significant signal changes in the zzso images suggests that zzso zzso signals in the turtle brain are below these zzso zzso
