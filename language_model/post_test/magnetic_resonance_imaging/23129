It has been shown that varying the spatial versus symbolic nature of stimulus presentation and response production, which affects zzso zzso mapping requirements, influences the magnitude of implicit sequence learning zzso and Hoffman, zzso Here, we evaluated how spatial and symbolic stimuli and responses affect the neural bases of sequence zzso We selectively eliminated the spatial component of stimulus presentation zzso zzso zzso response execution zzso zzso zzso or zzso Fourteen participants performed the alternating serial reaction time task under these conditions in an zzso zzso with zzso acquisition to allow for recording of vocal response reaction zzso Nine regions of interest zzso were selected to test the hypothesis that the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso was zzso engaged for zzso cued conditions and zzso zzso zzso zzso I and II were associated with symbolically cued zzso We found that the left zzso zzso zzso was selectively recruited for symbolic learning and the percent signal change in this region was correlated with learning magnitude under the symbolic zzso In contrast, the zzso did not exhibit selective zzso for learning under spatial zzso The inferior zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso during learning regardless of the condition, supporting its role in forming an abstract representation of learned zzso These findings reveal different brain networks that are zzso engaged depending on the conditions of sequence zzso
