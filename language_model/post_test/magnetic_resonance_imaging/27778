High intensity focused ultrasound zzso under zzso guidance may provide minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate zzso In this study, ex zzso and in zzso experiments were performed using a zzso zzso phased array (16 circular elements arranged on a truncated zzso cap of radius 60 zzso and a zzso mechanical zzso in order to evaluate the zzso formation and the potential interest of zzso (electronic and zzso zzso displacement of the focus for zzso zzso zzso Different zzso zzso including elementary zzso line zzso slice sweeping and volume zzso were investigated with a clinical zzso T MR zzso Two zzso planes zzso and zzso were simultaneously monitored using rapid MR zzso zzso zzso and the temperature and zzso dose maps were displayed in real zzso No zzso zzso were detected in MR acquisition during zzso The shape of the zzso zzso in zzso was examined at day 5 zzso by zzso follow-up zzso sequence and zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study suggests that electronic displacement of the focus (along the ultrasound propagation zzso zzso with mechanical zzso translations and rotation around zzso can be a suitable zzso to treat zzso sizes and shapes of a zzso zzso The electronic displacement of focus zzso in less than zzso zzso is an order of magnitude faster than the mechanical motion of the zzso device (1 s zzso As an example, for an in zzso zzso zzso with zzso between 32 and 47 zzso (7 successive line scans, 11 zzso 4 zzso with applied powers between zzso and zzso zzso a total duration of zzso of zzso s was required to zzso a volume of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso measured at day zzso while the maximum temperature zzso reached was 30 zzso While electronic focusing is necessary to speed up the zzso one should consider as a potential drawback the zzso risk for generating secondary zzso with full steering in zzso zzso zzso zzso accurately removed the effects of zzso dynamic zzso in the vicinity of the moving zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso paradigm represents a cost-effective technological compromise to induce the desired shape of the zzso in the prostate through the limited zzso space, in a reasonable period of time and without side zzso
