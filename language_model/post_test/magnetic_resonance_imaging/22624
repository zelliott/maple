This pilot study compared the utility of immediate zzso zzso zzso with that of delayed enhanced zzso and CT or zzso in assessing the success of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Twenty-two zzso zzso zzso were studied in 19 zzso zzso zzso was performed before and within 1 zzso after zzso zzso At routine zzso follow-up CT or zzso additional enhanced zzso was zzso The findings of zzso CT or zzso and enhanced zzso were compared with those of zzso and follow-up enhanced zzso by three zzso experienced in these zzso The zzso were unaware of the follow-up CT or zzso results zzso zzso Technical zzso zzso zone zzso and identification of residual disease were assessed by each reviewer, and the results were analyzed by zzso 

One zzso zzso study was considered technically zzso zzso zzso predicted the follow-up CT or zzso results in zzso zzso of subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso negative zzso value, zzso zzso zzso CT or zzso identified accurate targeting in 17 of 22 zzso zzso zzso agreed with CT or zzso in zzso zzso of subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted the follow-up CT or zzso results in zzso zzso of subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT or zzso detected residual disease in six zzso zzso zzso agreed with CT or zzso in zzso zzso of subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso has the potential to guide completion of zzso zzso at the time of initial therapy when residual disease is zzso The procedure is less accurate in detection of residual disease than is either delayed enhanced zzso or CT or zzso
