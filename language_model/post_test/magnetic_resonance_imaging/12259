Currently, available methods for diagnosis of acute zzso (AP) are mainly dependent on serum zzso analysis and imaging techniques that are too low in sensitivity and specificity to accurately and promptly diagnose zzso The lack of early diagnostic tools highlights the need to search for a highly effective and specific diagnostic zzso In this study, we zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a diagnostic tool for the early identification of zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso were zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited low zzso and excellent zzso when characterized in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso induced a gradual increase in the intensity of the zzso zzso signal from 1 h to 36 h in zzso rat zzso The increase in signal intensity was most significant at 1 zzso 6 h and 12 zzso These results suggest that the zzso as an zzso contrast agent is highly efficient and specific to detect early zzso
