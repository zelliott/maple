zzso cerebral cavernous zzso zzso are characterized by an zzso dominant transmission with incomplete zzso We have previously reported a zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a Chinese family with zzso Here we report a novel deletion of zzso that zzso strongly with zzso formation in another zzso Ten affected family members were observed among the 25 participants, and multiple zzso zzso were detected in seven zzso zzso sequencing analysis in the index patient and other affected members showed a zzso deletion in zzso 12 at zzso zzso zzso We predict this deletion produces a premature stop code zzso at zzso zzso resulting in a truncated protein of 409 zzso zzso
