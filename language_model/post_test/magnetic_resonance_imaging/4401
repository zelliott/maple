To evaluate the utility of measuring zzso distance zzso as a reflection of the zzso system, we compared the zzso of 60 zzso patients with that of 10 normal zzso We also measured the zzso of the zzso compartment zzso and zzso to correct for differences in individual brain size, and calculated the ratio of zzso and zzso zzso could not separate patients with zzso from normal controls, but there were significant differences in zzso and zzso between patients with zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso score or zzso score in patients with zzso We conclude that zzso measurement is not helpful in distinguishing patients with mild stage zzso from normal aged people or as a scale for zzso However, we suggest that zzso and zzso can discriminate between cases of mild zzso and normal aged zzso
