We describe a standard set of quantity names and symbols related to the zzso of kinetic parameters from dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging data, using zzso agents such as zzso zzso zzso These include a) the volume transfer constant zzso zzso b) the volume of zzso zzso space zzso per unit volume of tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and c) the flux rate constant between zzso and plasma zzso zzso The rate constant is the ratio of the transfer constant to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Under zzso conditions zzso equals the blood plasma flow per unit volume of zzso under zzso conditions zzso equals the zzso surface area product per unit volume of zzso We relate these quantities to previously published work from our zzso our future publications will refer to these standardized terms, and we propose that these be adopted as international zzso
