Even after a mild traumatic brain injury zzso symptoms may be long lasting and never resolve zzso The zzso zzso for such lasting deficits remains zzso There is a lack of objective measures of early brain abnormalities following mild zzso which could shed light on the genesis of these lasting zzso 

Here we report findings in a previously healthy man tested 2 and 6 weeks after a well-documented zzso zzso were compared with 12 control zzso All subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso Testing included zzso evaluation and zzso assessment with zzso and zzso zzso balance and brain zzso 

While the zzso zzso and zzso evaluations showed no zzso zzso tests revealed zzso abnormalities in our zzso zzso zzso higher zzso zzso than the control group at both time points; zzso zzso zzso presumably zzso by zzso receptors was absent at week 2, but returned to normal value at week 6; zzso zzso mechanisms of plasticity at week 2, that zzso at week zzso 

These findings demonstrate a transient zzso of brain cortical physiology following concussion independent of anatomical findings and zzso zzso This case study suggests that zzso measures may serve as sensitive zzso of zzso brain abnormalities after zzso
