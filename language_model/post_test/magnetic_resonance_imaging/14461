The signal intensity in the region corresponding to the cerebral aqueduct was evaluated in three patients with zzso tension zzso zzso by zzso obstruction in two and type I zzso zzso in the zzso seven patients with suspected zzso zzso (three of whom subsequently underwent successful zzso and 10 patients with ex zzso zzso zzso A zzso MR zzso called fast zzso imaging, was zzso zzso images corresponding to different zzso of the cardiac cycle were zzso No zzso enhancement was observed over the entire cardiac cycle in the patients with zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso showed a higher zzso zzso signal intensity, consistent with increased zzso flow rates, than patients with ex zzso zzso When comparing the above two groups of patients with a control group of healthy volunteers, significantly higher and lower values of the zzso maximum zzso signal intensity were found in the zzso zzso patients and the ex zzso zzso patients, zzso Fast zzso MR evaluation of zzso zzso flow may help to differentiate patients with different types of zzso
