The pathology associated with late-stage zzso in human zzso virus zzso infection has been studied zzso zzso examination has demonstrated abundant zzso and infection of zzso termed zzso zzso For obvious reasons, less is known regarding the zzso of minor cognitive impairment seen in earlier stages of zzso zzso The authors examined the utility of the peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging to assess zzso zzso in the brains of zzso subjects with minor zzso impairment in a zzso study of 12 zzso infected individuals and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso were given a battery of zzso tests in addition to assessing zzso zzso count and peripheral zzso followed by contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso and PET with zzso followed by zzso Two of the six zzso impaired zzso subjects demonstrated plasma viral zzso whereas only one of six zzso individuals demonstrated plasma viral load near the limits of zzso zzso demonstrated no abnormal enhancement and although zzso was more prominent in impaired subjects, it was also present though to a lesser extent in zzso zzso None of the 12 zzso subjects demonstrated increased retention of zzso in the brain zzso compared to the 5 zzso These results suggest that either zzso PET assessment is insensitive to the degree of zzso zzso in zzso minor zzso impairment or zzso zzso is not the pathological zzso of this neurological zzso
