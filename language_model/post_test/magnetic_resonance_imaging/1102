Abstract zzso induced by gentle zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most zzso symptoms of zzso zzso The underlying zzso pathways are still a matter of zzso Here, we investigated the cortical zzso associated with zzso zzso in an experimental human pain model by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Large and stable areas of zzso zzso were induced in 11 healthy subjects by topical zzso zzso 30 zzso application following local heating zzso degrees C for 5 zzso thus combining both physical and chemical zzso During the zzso experiments, zzso was rekindled by local heat application (40 degrees C for 5 zzso immediately before the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association zzso zzso bilateral secondary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso skin was painful and the cortical responses were partially overlapping with those induced by the zzso brush zzso Additionally, the zzso inferior frontal zzso (IFC) and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso comparison between zzso brushing and zzso zzso revealed significant increases in blood zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso S1, zzso IFC and bilateral zzso during zzso This study highlights the importance of a cortical network zzso S1, zzso zzso and IFC in the processing of zzso zzso in the human zzso Furthermore, it demonstrates that the combined zzso model can be used successfully in the exploration of brain processes underlying zzso zzso
