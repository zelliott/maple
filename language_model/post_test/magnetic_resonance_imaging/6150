We hypothesized that some of the zzso of pulmonary blood flow present in the normal human lung in zzso is due to hypoxic pulmonary zzso zzso If so, mild zzso would decrease the zzso of pulmonary zzso whereas it would be increased by mild zzso To test this, six healthy zzso subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso during 20 zzso of breathing different oxygen zzso through a face mask zzso inspired zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in balanced zzso Data were acquired on a zzso zzso scanner during a breath hold at functional residual capacity from both zzso and zzso slices in the right zzso zzso spin labeling was used to zzso the spatial distribution of pulmonary blood flow in zzso per minute per cubic zzso and fast zzso shot to zzso the regional zzso density, allowing zzso to be expressed as zzso zzso in zzso per minute per zzso Neither mean zzso density zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso g zzso P zzso zzso nor mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were significantly different between conditions in either imaging zzso Similarly, zzso zzso as measured by relative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso dimension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso log normal shape zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and geometric standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was also not zzso We conclude that zzso does not affect pulmonary zzso zzso in zzso in the normal zzso human zzso
