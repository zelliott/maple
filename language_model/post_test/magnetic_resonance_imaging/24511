zzso evidence has suggested the presence of gray matter zzso and white matter zzso abnormalities in bipolar disorder zzso patients, including pediatric bipolar disorder zzso However, little research has been done in zzso patients that carefully zzso the mood zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the brain structural changes in zzso children and zzso 

zzso children and adolescents with bipolar mania zzso zzso aged zzso years old and 18 zzso and zzso healthy controls were included in the present zzso The zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso data were obtained on a zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso spatial statistics zzso analysis were conducted to compare the gray matter volume and white matter fractional zzso zzso value between patients and zzso zzso of the zzso data of each survived area with clinical characteristics in zzso patients were further zzso 

As compared with the control group, zzso children showed decreased gray matter volume in the left zzso Meanwhile, significant lower zzso value was detected in the right anterior zzso zzso in the patient zzso No region of increased gray matter volume or zzso value was observed in zzso The zzso volume was zzso associated with the Young zzso zzso zzso zzso score when controlling for clinical characteristics in zzso patients, however, there was no significant correlation of zzso value of the survived area with illness zzso the onset age, number of episodes, or the zzso score in zzso zzso 

The present outcomes require replication in larger samples and zzso in medication free zzso 

Our findings highlighted that extensive brain structural zzso (including zzso and zzso were existed in zzso The widespread occurrence of structural abnormalities mainly located in the anterior zzso network zzso which suggested that this network might contribute to emotional and cognitive zzso in zzso
