zzso identifying carotid plaque composition using MR imaging remains a challenging task in zzso The purpose of our study was to compare the detection and zzso of carotid artery zzso plaque components based on in zzso MR imaging data using manual and automated zzso 

Sixty patients from a zzso study were split into a training group (20 zzso and a study group (40 zzso Each MR imaging study consisted of 4 high-resolution carotid wall sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso Manual zzso was performed by zzso of the vessel wall and different plaque zzso zzso zzso was performed in the study group by a supervised zzso trained on images from the training group of zzso 

For the detection of plaque zzso the agreement between the visual and automated analysis was moderate for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and good for zzso zzso zzso and lipids zzso zzso For zzso of plaque volumes, the zzso correlation was high for zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso good for lipids zzso zzso and poor for zzso 

In 40 patients with carotid zzso our results indicated that it was possible to automatically detect carotid plaque components with substantial or good agreement with visual zzso and that the volumes obtained manually and automatically were reasonably consistent for zzso and lipids but not for zzso
