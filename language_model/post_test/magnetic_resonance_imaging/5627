To make proper management decisions, it is important to understand the cause of zzso zzso zzso in individual zzso Previous studies suggest that abnormal zzso and zzso structures as well as their ratios may contribute to zzso after primary zzso repair in some zzso The aim of the current study was to develop a new protocol to evaluate the zzso zzso mechanism and the zzso zzso zzso muscles at rest and during speech zzso A secondary goal was to investigate the correlations among VP zzso and zzso structures that may predict zzso motions during speech zzso 

zzso healthy adults were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Multiple zzso scans covered the zzso region, the VP zzso and the zzso zzso zzso muscles at rest and during sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and VP structures at rest and during speech productions were obtained using image analysis zzso 

The zzso effective VP ratio, zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso stretch ratio, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio were selected to represent the functional properties of the VP zzso The following zzso were found to partially explain the zzso of corresponding zzso rest effective VP ratio for the zzso effective VP ratio, zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso ratio, and rest and zzso effective VP ratios for the zzso zzso zzso These predicting effects had implications in VP surgery and in understanding VP zzso 

This study developed a practical imaging protocol to measure the VP mechanism at rest and during speech zzso New zzso such as the effective VP ratio, zzso zzso ratio, zzso stretch ratio, and zzso zzso ratio may help to identify the cause of persistent zzso after zzso zzso zzso on the VP surgery were zzso
