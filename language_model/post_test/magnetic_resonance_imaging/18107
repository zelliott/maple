The study aimed to determine a practical strategy for zzso between zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso in order to avoid unnecessary surgical zzso 

Altogether, 19 patients with zzso or other pancreatic diseases underwent routine examinations including liver function test and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso G zzso and/or zzso was determined in patients with clinically suspected or zzso proven zzso Patients with suspected zzso either received diagnostic steroid therapy or zzso (if zzso tumors could not be zzso Surgery was not performed in patients with a zzso diagnosis of zzso by fast zzso frozen zzso Those with confirmed zzso received steroid zzso 

In total, 15 cases were finally confirmed as zzso with eight diagnosed zzso five confirmed by surgical pathology zzso zzso and two by zzso zzso Of these 15 patients with zzso and one without zzso 14 had elevated serum zzso zzso It was proven by subsequent zzso tests that serum zzso or zzso were simultaneously zzso 

zzso serum zzso level can be used as a zzso zzso indicator for zzso between zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso or zzso tests should be further performed in those with elevated serum zzso level, which helps to identify zzso in order to avoid unnecessary zzso
