To determine whether zzso zzso zzso discrimination of zzso zzso or zzso constituents during zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of human zzso zzso 

zzso plaques that cause fatal zzso due to zzso have high content of zzso relative to zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso identifies zzso zzso and zzso components within zzso human arteries with favorable sensitivity and zzso zzso a zzso agent, selectively zzso the signal from zzso tissue on zzso weighted zzso surface zzso 

A zzso zzso diameter receiver zzso coupled to a zzso MR scanner was positioned in zzso arteries of nine subjects with zzso Previously validated zzso analysis of zzso and moderate zzso images identified 137 zzso zzso and zzso regions of interest within 37 zzso zzso zzso imaging was repeated following zzso zzso IV zzso zzso 

zzso mean gray value in zzso regions increased by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso regions showed only a zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The increase in mean gray value with zzso was greater for zzso than for zzso or zzso regions zzso 

zzso selectively enhances signal intensity of zzso constituents during zzso of human zzso arteries and thus identifies key tissue characteristics associated with plaque zzso These findings have important implications for the assessment of zzso therapies and ultimately for reducing cardiovascular zzso
