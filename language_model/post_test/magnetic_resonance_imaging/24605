zzso function in the zzso zzso circuit has been implicated in the zzso of major depressive disorder zzso This study evaluated zzso differences in zzso volumes between depressed subjects with zzso zzso subjects with zzso in zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso volumes were extracted using zzso Integrated Registration and zzso zzso zzso University of Oxford, zzso The depressed zzso subjects exhibited significantly smaller volumes in the bilateral zzso and zzso compared to control subjects, and the differences in the bilateral zzso remained significant after controlling for total zzso zzso In a smaller subset of healthy controls and depressed zzso subjects matched to the zzso zzso subjects, significant differences in volume were observed across groups in the bilateral thalamus, as well as the right zzso zzso zzso and zzso these were primarily accounted for by differences between the depressed zzso subjects versus both the zzso and healthy subjects, though none of these changes remained significant after controlling for total zzso volume zzso zzso reductions in the zzso and zzso may contribute to dysfunction within zzso networks, consistent with previous evidence of zzso and zzso abnormalities in these regions in zzso
