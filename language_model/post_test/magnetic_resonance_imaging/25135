It is well established in nonhuman primates that the zzso zzso lobe zzso structures, the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso are necessary for zzso memory zzso In humans, the zzso and zzso changes in early Alzheimer's disease zzso further support a role for the zzso zzso in the consolidation of new events into long-term zzso Little is known, however, regarding the function of the zzso zzso in humans in zzso To examine the participation of the interconnected zzso structures as well as the zzso network of activated brain areas in visual zzso long-term memory, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to determine the brain regions that are activated during zzso and retrieval of paired pictures in 12 young control zzso The most striking finding in the zzso zzso pattern was the consistent zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso comparisons with a strict statistical threshold zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso or zzso comparisons even with a low statistical threshold zzso zzso zzso The location of the zzso zzso area was in the zzso part of the zzso cortex, in the zzso bank of the collateral zzso The zzso and the more zzso zzso zzso were activated in both zzso and retrieval zzso During the zzso processing, zzso zzso were more consistent and the zzso zzso area located more zzso than during zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso association zzso were also activated in the zzso and zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso but not zzso of novel picture pairs activates the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso study reporting zzso zzso in this zzso part of the zzso cortex, the site of the very earliest zzso changes in zzso
