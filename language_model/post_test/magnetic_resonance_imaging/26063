In acute zzso stroke, the zzso core is surrounded by a zone of tissue that has decreased zzso Some of this tissue may be salvaged by zzso effective zzso zzso zzso is sensitive in detecting the zzso zzso whereas zzso also detects the zzso tissue around the zzso zzso We studied the potential of combined zzso zzso and zzso to predict zzso growth and clinical outcome in patients not receiving zzso zzso 

Sixteen patients with acute stroke were examined zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within 24 h of the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on the second day and after 1 zzso The volumes of zzso and zzso brain tissue were measured from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The volume difference between the zzso and zzso tissue on the first day was compared with the possible increase in zzso volume during the zzso Each patient's zzso status was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso 

The volume of zzso tissue increased from 48 zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso zzso on the first day to 88 zzso 93 zzso on the second day zzso zzso zzso and to 110 zzso 121 zzso at 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The volume of zzso tissue on the first day was significantly greater than the zzso volume zzso zzso 135 zzso P zzso zzso The volume difference between the zzso and zzso tissue on the first day correlated significantly with the zzso growth between the first day and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Between the first day and 1 zzso the increase of the zzso volume correlated significantly with the change in the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A large zzso zone around the zzso core in the acute phase of zzso stroke predicts the zzso growth during the first week, and this zzso significantly with the change in the zzso status of the zzso Combined zzso zzso and zzso performed within 24 h after the onset of symptoms can be useful in the evaluation of acute stroke to predict zzso zzso
