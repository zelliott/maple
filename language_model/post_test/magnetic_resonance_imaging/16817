To zzso and zzso assess the zzso sodium 23 zzso concentration in human zzso before and after oral administration of a water load by using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Fourteen healthy volunteers zzso age, 28 years; range, zzso zzso were included in this institutional review zzso study between July and December zzso For zzso MR imaging, a zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso echo sequence zzso time, zzso zzso repetition time, 120 zzso spatial resolution, 5 zzso 5 zzso 5 zzso was used with a dedicated zzso zzso zzso the zzso profile was assessed by using phantom zzso and the volunteer images were zzso corrected zzso Images of the volunteers were obtained before and 30 minutes after oral zzso of 1 L of zzso As internal reference, zzso concentration of the zzso fluid zzso was zzso zzso zzso complexes in each kidney were zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso assessed at various standardized zzso From these values, quantitative zzso zzso were zzso and the slopes of the linear portion of the concentration zzso were zzso zzso zzso tests were zzso 

Mean calculated zzso zzso of zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso and after water load zzso zzso zzso zzso fell within zzso ranges zzso zzso zzso An increase in average zzso concentration from zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso After the water load, this zzso was zzso although zzso zzso decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates the zzso evaluation of human zzso with zzso zzso MR zzso The zzso imaging technique used allows the zzso of the zzso zzso concentration and the assessment of its change with differing zzso zzso
