In pursuing our work on the organization of human visual cortex, we wanted to specify more accurately the position of the visual motion area zzso zzso in relation to the zzso and zzso pattern of the cerebral zzso We also wanted to determine the zzso variation of area zzso in terms of position and extent of blood flow change in it, in response to the same zzso We therefore used zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the zzso of relative cerebral blood flow increases produced when subjects viewed a moving zzso pattern, compared to viewing the same pattern when it was zzso We zzso the PET images from each subject with images of the same brain obtained by magnetic resonance imaging, thus relating the position of zzso in all 24 zzso examined to the individual zzso zzso of the same zzso This approach also enabled us to examine the extent to which results obtained by pooling the PET data from a small group of individuals zzso zzso chosen at random, would be representative of a much larger sample in determining the mean location of zzso after transformation into zzso zzso After zzso transformation of each individual brain, we found that the position of area zzso can vary by as much as 27 zzso in the left zzso and 18 zzso in the right for the zzso with the highest significance for blood flow zzso There is also an zzso zzso in blood flow change within it in response to the same visual zzso zzso nevertheless bears a consistent relationship, within each brain, to the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso It is situated zzso just zzso to the meeting point of the ascending limb of the inferior zzso zzso and the lateral zzso zzso In position it zzso almost precisely with zzso zzso 16, one of the areas that he found to be zzso at zzso
