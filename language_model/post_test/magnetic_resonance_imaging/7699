zzso the zzso visual rating scale for zzso cortical zzso zzso on magnetic resonance images zzso through quantitative zzso matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to justify its use in clinical zzso 

Two hundred zzso patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and 128 with zzso memory complaints underwent zzso zzso zzso was rated according to the visual rating zzso zzso volumes of six zzso structures and the total zzso region were extracted using zzso and compared among zzso zzso To determine which anatomical regions contributed most to the visual scores, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso compared local zzso density among zzso 

Patients were zzso according to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All structures except the zzso zzso differed significantly among zzso The inferior zzso zzso volume zzso the most between rating scale zzso zzso showed that zzso had a lower zzso volume than zzso in the zzso region and other brain regions, whereas between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was mostly restricted to zzso zzso 

The visual zzso rating scale is zzso validated and reliably reflects zzso zzso in zzso regions, making it a valuable tool for the daily zzso assessment of zzso 

zzso Visual rating scale reflects zzso matter zzso in zzso brain zzso zzso Different zzso scores corresponded well to different quantitative degrees of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume influenced assessment based on the visual rating zzso zzso This simple visual rating scale makes it useful for zzso zzso zzso
