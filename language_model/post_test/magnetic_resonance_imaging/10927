To better understand zzso airway mechanics as it relates to the zzso and treatment of zzso sleep zzso we have developed a novel application of magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso tissue tagging to measure zzso wall tissue motion during active zzso of the zzso Eleven zzso zzso rats were surgically prepared with platinum zzso for bilateral stimulation of the zzso branch of the zzso nerve that supplies motor output to the zzso and intrinsic tongue zzso Images of the zzso airway were acquired before and during stimulation using a gated zzso zzso zzso recalled zzso imaging protocol in a zzso T zzso The tag zzso applied before zzso created a grid pattern of zzso zzso dark lines that revealed tissue motion in images acquired during zzso zzso significantly increased zzso area, and zzso and lateral dimensions in the zzso and zzso airways when results were averaged across the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso software for tissue zzso and finite zzso showed that changes in airway size were associated with zzso displacement of zzso in the zzso zzso wall in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso displacement of the lateral walls in the zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso zzso In addition, principal maximum stretch was significantly increased in the lateral walls zzso zzso zzso in a zzso direction in the zzso and zzso zzso regions and principal maximum zzso zzso to zzso was significantly increased in the zzso walls in all regions zzso zzso zzso zzso did not cause lateral displacement of the lateral zzso walls at any zzso The results reveal that the increase in zzso airway size resulting from stimulation of the zzso branch of the zzso nerve is predominantly due to zzso displacement of the zzso and lateral zzso zzso
