zzso zzso zzso are commonly encountered on magnetic resonance imaging with significantly overlapped imaging zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and distinguishing imaging features of zzso zzso in the zzso in the largest patient series to zzso 

After institutional review board approval, consecutive head magnetic resonance images of zzso patients performed at zzso T between June 2010 and April 2011 were zzso reviewed for zzso zzso zzso zzso size, and signal characteristic of zzso zzso were zzso Electronic medical records were reviewed for patient zzso symptoms, and underlying zzso 

Among zzso patients, zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years old) and zzso had zzso retention zzso zzso zzso zzso years zzso A significant correlation between human zzso virus infection and zzso retention zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso 

The prevalence of zzso zzso was slightly higher than previously described in the zzso Additionally, younger and older patients had the lowest prevalence of zzso cyst, suggesting these zzso are acquired and subsequently zzso with zzso A significant correlation was observed between human zzso virus infection and zzso retention zzso
