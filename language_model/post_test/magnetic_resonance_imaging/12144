We report the characteristics of high field magnetic resonance imaging zzso of three siblings with zzso zzso zzso zzso probably of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was a 25-year-old woman who zzso slowly progressive zzso zzso mental deficit, decayed teeth since her zzso The siblings of the zzso zzso woman and 27-year-old man, also showed the same clinical course as hers, and the symptoms are more severe in elder zzso The zzso solely had zzso on her neck and lower zzso which suggested zzso zzso zzso and zzso slices of high field zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were zzso The cerebral zzso were observed in the frontal and the zzso zzso especially at the zzso and superior frontal zzso whereas the zzso zzso were relatively zzso The zzso of motor zzso seemed to be responsible for the disorder of voluntary zzso zzso demonstrated a diffuse zzso in the cerebral white matter, which suggested zzso zzso also showed remarkable zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The degenerative involvement in these regions was also zzso These abnormal zzso both zzso and zzso were stronger in elder siblings, which indicated the intensity changes to be of progressive zzso Severe zzso or zzso of corpus zzso was also observed, however the zzso zzso could be zzso We were not able to detect the zzso zzso syndrome, because of their severe mental zzso Spinal zzso was slender and its degenerative changes were zzso The high field zzso of a zzso family showed the extensive abnormal findings of the central nervous system in this zzso family, such as cerebral motor area, zzso system, corpus zzso and spinal zzso
