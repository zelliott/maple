Tracking of transplanted stem cells is essential to monitor safety and efficiency of zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso offers a very sensitive, repetitive and zzso in zzso detection of zzso labeled cells but labeling with commercial zzso iron oxide zzso zzso is still problematic because of low labeling efficiencies and the need of potentially toxic zzso zzso In this study, new experimental zzso zzso and commercial zzso and zzso zzso were investigated comparatively in terms of in zzso labeling efficiency, effects on stem cell functionality and in zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of human zzso stem cells zzso without zzso agents was only achieved with zzso zzso zzso labeling of human zzso did not affect cell zzso presentation of typical cell surface marker zzso and differentiation into the zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso differentiation and zzso were significantly impaired with increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso after intramuscular injection in rats by zzso and were retrieved ex zzso by zzso Blue and zzso zzso Though a careful zzso of zzso zzso cellular function and zzso zzso is essential, zzso zzso are very efficient zzso magnetic labels for in zzso stem cell tracking by zzso
