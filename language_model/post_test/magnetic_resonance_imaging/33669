A novel zzso method is described for measuring the effective diffusion zzso zzso zzso of water in zzso zzso zzso A simple zzso computer simulation was used to show how the value of D zzso when combined with zzso of water zzso relaxation times and zzso field zzso zzso zzso allows the pore size distribution and pore connectivity to be zzso
