zzso is characterized by deficits in zzso as well as visual zzso There have, however, been few magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of the zzso lobe as an zzso defined region of interest in zzso To examine whether or not patients with chronic schizophrenia show zzso lobe volume zzso we measured gray matter volumes for both the primary visual area zzso and the visual association areas zzso using zzso based zzso landmarks and three-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso gray matter volumes were measured using zzso resolution zzso in 25 male patients diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and in 28 male normal zzso zzso schizophrenia patients showed reduced bilateral zzso gray matter volume zzso compared with normal controls, whereas patients showed no group difference in zzso gray matter zzso These results suggest that reduced bilateral zzso may be a zzso zzso of some of the deficits observed in early visual processing in zzso
