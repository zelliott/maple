Because of concerns about direct zzso of the zzso nucleus zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso many functional zzso continue to rely on zzso coordinates to reach this zzso zzso zzso does allow direct zzso of the zzso In order to compare the coordinates of the target point within the zzso zzso with those obtained from standard brain zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso used to implant 55 deep brain stimulation zzso in the zzso zzso of 29 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease treated in two European zzso were zzso The coordinates of the directly zzso zzso were significantly different from those of the zzso zzso zzso of the position of the zzso may render direct zzso a more accurate means of targeting this zzso
