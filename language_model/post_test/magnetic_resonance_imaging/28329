The local determination of zzso is an extremely valuable target because of different applications in zzso In fact, obtaining a reliable profile of zzso or zzso could considerably improve the evaluation of transport properties of porous media, especially if applied to zzso flow test zzso for relative zzso zzso However, the best procedure to adopt for these kind of studies is currently under debate, involving different experimental choices both for acquisition and hardware zzso The choice of a reliable procedure could be particularly important especially if zzso samples zzso zzso or fractured zzso are zzso We have investigated selected zzso cores, zzso by fractures and large zzso using different instrumental solutions in order to assess usefulness of application of zzso imaging methods as a zzso measurement tool for zzso zzso Local zzso data have been obtained and discussed relative to conventional zzso and zzso aspects of rock zzso
