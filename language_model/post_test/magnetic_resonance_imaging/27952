The following contribution presents a continuous zzso analysis of the contraction and relaxation processes of healthy left zzso giving reference values for contraction and relaxation zzso For the total zzso we have zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso 59% zzso In relation to the zzso zzso volume zzso significantly greater changes in volume per unit of time were measured zzso compared to zzso zzso 411 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 261 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 810 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 245 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso minimal volumes of zzso zzso layers was delayed against the total zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso there was zzso a zzso of the proportions of volume from zzso to zzso
