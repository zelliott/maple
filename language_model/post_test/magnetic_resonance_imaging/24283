zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to directly coat zzso zzso zzso zzso by a facile but effective zzso zzso The obtained zzso zzso zzso were characterized by transmission electron zzso zzso scanning electron zzso zzso zzso infrared zzso and X-ray zzso zzso zzso the size and zzso zzso of zzso increased with increasing the mass ratio of zzso to zzso All these zzso could be zzso by zzso cells but show negligible zzso The zzso layer slowly zzso into less dangerous forms such as zzso zzso and zzso at neutral or acid zzso Considering their excellent water zzso zzso and chemical stability, magnetic zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso properties, zzso zzso have great potential in zzso diagnosis of zzso
