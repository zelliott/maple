The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso iron oxide zzso in the detection of focal zzso zzso on MR zzso 

The study included 21 patients with 115 focal zzso zzso and eight patients without focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images were obtained at zzso T before and 60 zzso after the end of injection of an zzso zzso zzso CT scans were obtained in all patients within 10 days after MR zzso The effect of zzso on the signal intensity of the liver and zzso was assessed by using quantitative analysis of the region of zzso zzso was evaluated by using multiple criteria and zzso and zzso zzso zzso included zzso assessment of image quality, counting the number of zzso zzso and statistical analysis of quantitative changes in the signal intensity of zzso and of normal zzso 

By all criteria, zzso zzso MR images were superior to zzso zzso images and to zzso CT zzso zzso by all criteria, zzso zzso MR images were worse than zzso zzso images and zzso CT zzso The mean zzso contrast on zzso images was zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso zzso For zzso the mean contrast was zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso is an zzso contrast agent for the detection of focal zzso zzso when zzso MR images are zzso
