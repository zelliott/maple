zzso zzso of zzso zzso spin labeling zzso methods such as zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso require the zzso of interactions between the inversion and imaging zzso For zzso the zzso slice thickness ratio zzso is usually at least zzso in order to fully contain the extent of the imaging zzso The resulting gap zzso the transit zzso So far, efforts to minimize the zzso have concentrated on the inversion zzso However, the imaging profile remains a limiting factor especially for rapid sequences such as zzso fast zzso shot zzso which uses short zzso This study reports the zzso of a zzso sequence with zzso inversion and imaging zzso zzso is achieved with a preparation module incorporating a pair of identical zzso frequency offset corrected inversion zzso zzso The optimum zzso zzso and zzso scheme for this pulse combination is zzso and the relaxation characteristics of the zzso scheme are zzso Phantom experiments demonstrate a reduction in the zzso to approximately zzso Implementation in an animal model is zzso and the benefit of the improved profile in probing the sensitivity of the flow signal to tagging geometry is zzso zzso to transit time effects can be minimized with this zzso and zzso zzso can be better explored as a result of the improved zzso with the ideal of square slice zzso
