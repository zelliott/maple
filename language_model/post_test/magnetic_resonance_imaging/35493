Several genes of the zzso and zzso neurotransmitter systems have been found to be associated with alcohol disease and related intermediate zzso Here, we evaluated genetic zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso genes in zzso patients and their association with zzso zzso of brain zzso By combined analysis of imaging data and zzso results, large numbers of variables are produced that zzso conventional statistical methods based on tests for group zzso zzso in assessment of zzso effects and multiple testing problems are zzso zzso we introduce a novel method for detecting associations between a set of genetic markers and zzso zzso based on machine learning zzso zzso volume was found to be associated with zzso effects of the zzso genes in zzso patients but not in zzso These data are in line with prior studies supporting a role for zzso interaction in zzso of alcohol zzso
