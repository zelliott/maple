Previous single zzso zzso MRS pilot studies of migraine patients have suggested that zzso energy metabolism or zzso deficiencies may be responsible for zzso of zzso tissue in migraine zzso These studies were extended to include multiple brain regions and larger numbers of patients by zzso zzso MR zzso zzso 

zzso with aura zzso migraine without aura zzso and zzso migraine patients were studied between attacks by zzso MRS imaging using a zzso zzso 

zzso were compared with those in healthy control subjects without zzso In zzso consistent increases in zzso concentration zzso were measured in most brain regions, with a trend toward increase in zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso concentration zzso was decreased to a minor degree in anterior brain regions and a trend toward decreased zzso was observed in zzso slice 1, but no consistent changes were found in zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso or zzso In zzso migraine patients, zzso had a tendency to be lower, and zzso was significantly lower than in the zzso brain regions of control zzso Trend analysis showed a significant decrease of brain zzso and zzso in zzso brain regions with increasing severity of zzso zzso 

Overall, the results support no substantial or consistent abnormalities of energy zzso but it is hypothesized that disturbances in zzso zzso zzso may contribute to brain zzso zzso and the zzso of migraine syndromes associated with zzso zzso In contrast, migraine patients without a zzso aura may exhibit zzso changes in zzso and membrane zzso that counteract cortical zzso
