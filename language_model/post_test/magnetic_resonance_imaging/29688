zzso muscles zzso reveal characteristic zzso patterns on magnetic resonance zzso imaging due to their rich vascular zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate zzso patterns of zzso in patients with zzso phase of Graves zzso zzso using zzso zzso MR imaging in comparison with normal zzso 

zzso of 15 patients with zzso phase of GO and those of 15 normal volunteers were evaluated using zzso zzso MR images with fat suppression before and after intravenous administration of zzso The image sequence was a fast zzso with chemical shift selective fat zzso The degree of contrast enhancement for zzso and zzso muscles zzso was assessed via a zzso grading system and by 2 zzso 

There were statistically significant differences for the degrees of contrast enhancement in all zzso between the patients with GO and normal zzso The degrees of contrast enhancement for all zzso were significantly decreased in patients with zzso phase of zzso 

The zzso within the zzso tends to be impaired during the progress of disease, and the MR imaging pattern gives a zzso measurement of the zzso impairment of the zzso during the zzso phase of the zzso
