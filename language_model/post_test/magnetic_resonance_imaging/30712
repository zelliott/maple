Several studies have shown the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating the reconstructed anterior cruciate zzso The purpose of the current study was to clarify the clinical usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for evaluating the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament in comparison with using zzso zzso patients who had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a zzso zzso were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso an average of 12 months after zzso There were 41 males and 28 females with an average age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso The zzso from surgery to the magnetic resonance imaging or zzso evaluation was a mean of 12 months zzso zzso zzso The magnetic resonance imaging findings of the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament were classified as either high, zzso or low zzso The zzso findings also were classified as either graft zzso at the zzso notch or no zzso In the 47 anterior cruciate ligament zzso that were not zzso the signal intensity remained low and did not increase during zzso zzso In contrast, 22 anterior cruciate ligament zzso that were zzso showed an increased signal intensity in the zzso area of the graft at the time of the zzso zzso Furthermore, no significant correlation was observed between the presence of a high signal intensity and zzso zzso The high signal intensity of the anterior cruciate ligament graft on magnetic resonance imaging was found to be caused by graft zzso These findings therefore show a clear association between graft zzso and the subsequent appearance of the graft on magnetic resonance zzso
