zzso of zzso or zzso origin presents management and therapeutic challenges to the zzso zzso in management and therapeutic approaches may be facilitated by understanding how the central nervous system controls zzso The purpose of this investigation was to zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine patterns of cortical activity during swallowing in normal, healthy adult zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed on eight healthy adult subjects using conventional zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso 

zzso performed three different swallowing tasks including dry and zzso zzso and performed a control finger movement zzso zzso maps of cortical zzso were generated using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso statistical analyses were performed to compare activated areas among the different tasks and to determine the effects of task zzso 

zzso during the three swallowing tasks occurred in the primary motor cortex, primary zzso cortex, and other cortical and zzso zzso zzso representation of swallowing and finger movement followed zzso zzso zzso distribution of cortical zzso was observed for the different swallowing zzso 

zzso of the primary motor and zzso zzso as well as other zzso areas, occurs with swallowing in normal zzso zzso distribution of cortical activity with different swallowing tasks suggests differential functional organization for different swallowing zzso zzso these mechanisms may facilitate improved management and therapeutic intervention for zzso and zzso zzso
