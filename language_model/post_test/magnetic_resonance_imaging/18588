Learning deficits are prominent among patients with chronic schizophrenia and are associated with poor everyday zzso Little is known, however, about the brain physiology underlying these difficulties with zzso new zzso 

The purpose of the current study was to compare the brain response during novel picture zzso between patients with chronic schizophrenia and healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Nine middle-aged patients with zzso or zzso schizophrenia and 10 zzso and zzso healthy individuals were zzso Using zzso the blood zzso level dependent zzso signal was measured during novel picture zzso zzso zzso and during presentation of a repeated picture zzso zzso zzso brain response was examined in both groups and compared between the patient and comparison groups in each zzso within four bilateral search regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso 

Despite comparable subsequent ability to recognize the presented pictures, patients with schizophrenia showed abnormal zzso brain response in regions of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso compared to healthy zzso In zzso zzso regions, patients showed greater zzso response during the control condition zzso zzso than during the experimental condition zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso brain systems examined in this study may zzso learning deficits in zzso Further research is needed to illuminate the role of these brain zzso in poor everyday functioning and their zzso to zzso
