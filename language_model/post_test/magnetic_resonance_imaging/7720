A growing interest in zzso function and its involvement in higher zzso have prompted much research in recent zzso zzso presence in a wide range of cognitive functions examined within an increasing body of zzso literature has been zzso We applied a zzso approach, which employed the zzso likelihood estimate method, to consolidate results of zzso involvement accumulated in different cognitive tasks of interest and systematically identified similarities among the zzso The current analysis included 88 zzso studies demonstrating zzso zzso in higher cognitive zzso involving emotion, executive function, language, music, timing and working zzso While largely consistent with a prior zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso our results extended their findings to include music and timing zzso to provide further insights into zzso involvement and zzso its role in higher zzso In addition, we conducted zzso and zzso comparisons for the cognitive zzso of emotion, language, and working zzso We also considered task differences within the domain of verbal working memory by conducting a comparison of the zzso with the zzso task, as well as an analysis of the differential components within the zzso zzso zzso showed a consistent zzso presence in the timing domain, providing evidence for a role in time zzso zzso clusters identified within the domain further refine the zzso organization of the zzso
