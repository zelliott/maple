Early studies suggest that zzso treatment can result in tumor shrinkage and hearing improvement for some patients with zzso type 2 zzso The aim of this study was to report extended follow-up in a larger cohort of similarly treated zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso referral center 

Thirty-one consecutive zzso patients who received zzso for progressive zzso zzso 

Hearing improvement, defined as an improvement in word recognition score above the zzso critical difference compared with zzso and zzso response, defined as a zzso or greater decrease in tumor volume compared with zzso 

The median age was 26 years zzso zzso zzso The median zzso tumor growth rate before treatment was zzso per zzso At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 14 months zzso zzso zzso with a total of 47 zzso of zzso A hearing response occurred in 57% zzso of zzso patients and a zzso response in zzso zzso of target zzso zzso The median time to response was 3 months for both end zzso The only clinical or zzso feature at baseline that correlated with change in tumor volume at 3 months was the mean apparent diffusion zzso value, a zzso marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of patients had stable or improved hearing after 1 year of treatment and zzso at 3 years; zzso of patients had stable or decreased tumor size after 1 year of treatment and zzso at 3 zzso Overall, treatment was well zzso 

zzso treatment was followed by hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage in more than 50% of progressive zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso or improved hearing was retained in the majority of zzso
