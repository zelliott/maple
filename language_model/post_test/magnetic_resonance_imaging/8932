The ability to accelerate the spatial zzso process during a chemical shift imaging zzso scan of zzso compounds is demonstrated through parallel zzso A hardware setup designed to simultaneously acquire zzso data from multiple receivers is presented zzso A system consisting of four zzso four gain zzso a transmit zzso and a four receive channel rat zzso was built for single channel zzso and simultaneous zzso detection of zzso zzso The hardware setup was integrated with commercial scanner electronics, allowing the system to function similar to a conventional zzso zzso setup, except at a different zzso The ability to perform parallel imaging is demonstrated in zzso zzso data from the accelerated scans are reconstructed using a zzso zzso parallel imaging algorithm, by using lower resolution zzso sensitivity maps obtained from the central region of zzso The advantages and disadvantages of parallel imaging in the context of imaging zzso compounds are zzso
