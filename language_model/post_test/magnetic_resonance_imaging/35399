Assessment of left zzso zzso is important in the selection of patients for cardiac zzso therapy zzso In this review, the role of nuclear imaging zzso gated zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for assessment of cardiac zzso is zzso In addition, the role of zzso zzso zzso for evaluation of effects of zzso is zzso 

Phase analysis of zzso yields accurate information on left zzso zzso zzso well with left zzso zzso as derived from tissue zzso zzso zzso studies have also demonstrated that left zzso zzso derived from zzso can predict response to zzso (for zzso bandwidth and phase standard zzso zzso was 70 and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso provides information on the location and extent of viable and zzso zzso which is also important for response to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso studies have enabled zzso of cardiac zzso zzso and zzso metabolism and efficiency before and after zzso 

zzso can provide important information for patients who are considered for zzso This technique permits assessment of left zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are important for response to zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging may have a role in evaluation of zzso effects after zzso including zzso zzso metabolism and zzso
