To investigate the association of zzso impairment on functional outcome and complications in stroke patients treated with IV zzso zzso 

In this zzso study, we compared the estimated zzso zzso rate zzso with poor zzso outcome zzso Rankin zzso scores zzso death, and symptomatic zzso zzso zzso based on the criteria of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II zzso zzso and adjusted odds ratios zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso were zzso Patients without zzso treatment served as a comparison zzso 

Among zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso had a low zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso decrease by 10 zzso zzso increased the risk of poor outcome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso was independently associated with poor zzso outcome zzso zzso zzso death zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso zzso zzso zzso and stroke severity zzso zzso zzso independently determined zzso Compared with patients who did not receive zzso treatment with zzso in patients with low zzso was associated with poor outcome zzso zzso zzso and with favorable outcome in those with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Renal function significantly modified outcome and complication rates in zzso stroke zzso Lower zzso might be a better risk indicator for zzso than zzso A decrease of zzso by 10 zzso zzso seems to have a similar impact on the risk of death or zzso as a zzso zzso Stroke zzso score measuring stroke zzso
