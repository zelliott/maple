zzso adaptation ensures movement accuracy despite continuously changing environment and zzso zzso of zzso eye movements is a classical model of zzso zzso zzso the well-established role of the zzso in the adaptation of zzso zzso zzso the cerebral zzso has been suggested to be involved in the adaptation of voluntary zzso zzso Here, we provide direct evidence for a zzso involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso First, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in each subject using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Then, a zzso adaptation paradigm was used to progressively reduce the zzso of zzso and zzso while zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso was applied over the right zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in impairment for the adaptation of zzso selectively when zzso was applied 60 zzso after zzso zzso In contrast, the adaptation of zzso was facilitated by zzso applied 90 zzso after zzso zzso The differential effect of zzso relative to zzso types suggests a direct interference with zzso activity for the VS adaptation and a remote interference with zzso activity for the zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the adaptation of zzso and zzso involves different zzso zzso
