Clinical and imaging abnormalities similar to those seen in zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso have been observed in patients with zzso It remains unclear whether both conditions are in fact the same disease zzso 

We zzso identified 21 patients with zzso and separated them into 2 groups: patients who were symptomatic during pregnancy, and a group of zzso zzso We recorded symptoms, zzso history and zzso investigations of both groups and compared them to each zzso 

We found 8 pregnant patients and 13 zzso patients with zzso There was no difference between both groups with regard to symptoms, cerebral imaging, or outcome, apart from a difference in age, the zzso history and a significantly higher occurrence of headache in the pregnant zzso All of our pregnant women were zzso zzso was done over a mean period of zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, there was a good clinical zzso 

We suggest that zzso in zzso patients and zzso presenting with zzso abnormalities similar to those seen in zzso represent the same disease entity, but are triggered by different zzso
