In order to diagnosis a zzso ligament zzso in the cervical spine, clinicians normally measure the zzso zzso by using CT scan zzso However, the impact of this tear on the head and neck complex zzso is not widely zzso The zzso ligament plays a very important role in stabilizing the joint and its zzso may have a substantial effect on the whole head and neck zzso 

A finite element model consisting of zzso structures along with cartilage, zzso discs and all ligaments was developed based on CT and zzso zzso The effect of head weights zzso zzso of 30 N to 57 N was investigated in the cases of intact and zzso zzso ligament zzso The model was validated based on experimental studies investigating the response of the cervical spine under the zzso zzso 

The predictions indicate a significant zzso of the zzso and load distribution at the facet zzso of the cervical spine with a zzso ligament zzso The zzso zzso the contact force at the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso increase with the zzso of the zzso ligament and are dependent to the head zzso 

A zzso ligament tear increases the zzso angle of the head and the zzso as well as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso reaches a critical value when the zzso loading exceeds 40 zzso Supporting the head after an injury should be considered to avoid zzso of the spinal zzso and permanent zzso zzso
