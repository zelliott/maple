In the human brain, the zzso of cortical zzso and zzso is complex and variable among individuals, and it may reflect pathological functioning with specific abnormalities observed in certain zzso and zzso zzso Since cortical folding occurs early during brain development, these structural abnormalities might be present long before the appearance of functional zzso So far, the precise mechanisms responsible for such zzso in the zzso pattern during zzso or zzso development are still poorly zzso Here we compared anatomical and functional brain development in zzso among 45 premature newborns who experienced different zzso zzso 22 normal zzso 12 twins and 11 newborns with zzso growth restriction zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and dedicated zzso tools, we investigated early disturbances in cortical formation at birth, over the zzso period critical for the emergence of zzso zzso weeks of zzso age), and defined early zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrated that twins have a delayed but harmonious zzso with reduced surface and zzso index compared to zzso whereas the zzso of zzso newborns is zzso to the normal zzso zzso with a more pronounced reduction of surface in relation to the zzso index compared to normal zzso Furthermore, we showed that these structural zzso of the brain at birth are zzso of zzso outcome at term equivalent age, for zzso cerebral volumes and zzso development evaluated with the assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso
