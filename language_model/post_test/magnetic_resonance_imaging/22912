To zzso evaluate the feasibility of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging at high magnetic field strength zzso zzso and to compare image quality between zzso and zzso MR imaging in terms of zzso zzso detection in patients with prostate zzso 

This study was institutional review board approved, and all patients gave written informed zzso Forty-eight consecutive patients aged zzso years zzso zzso zzso with prostate cancer were zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images of the pelvis were acquired in a zzso plane parallel to the zzso muscle 24 hours after zzso zzso A pelvic and body zzso zzso was used and yielded an zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso T and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso All images were evaluated by three readers for total image quality, zzso zzso border zzso zzso contrast, and zzso zzso zzso significance was calculated by using the zzso U zzso zzso the general linear mixed model was used to estimate the contributions of three zzso reader, and zzso the zzso of the imaging zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso better zzso contrast, zzso contrast, zzso zzso border zzso and total image quality were observed at zzso MR zzso The general linear mixed model revealed that the zzso of all results could be attributed to the use of zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging can be performed at high magnetic field strengths and result in improved image quality, which may lead to improved detection of small positive zzso zzso
