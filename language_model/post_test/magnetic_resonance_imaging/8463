The objective is to assess if tumor size after zzso in patients with zzso cancer can be assessed by a second magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso prior to surgery and to correlate changes observed on zzso with findings at zzso at zzso Twenty-five patients with zzso before and after zzso were zzso zzso studied were changes in tumor size, zzso and distance to the zzso zzso margin zzso zzso was measured as tumor volume at surgery zzso divided by tumor volume at the initial zzso zzso in zzso zzso was defined as the tumor volume at the second zzso zzso divided by zzso in zzso The zzso was the same or more favorable than the initial zzso zzso in 24 of 25 zzso The second zzso was not more accurately zzso than the initial zzso for zzso or distance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly to zzso as did zzso to zzso although the former was always smaller than the zzso zzso and zzso correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to correlate with zzso after zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The value of a second zzso after zzso for assessment of distance to zzso and zzso is, however, not zzso
