With the recent advent of integrated zzso hybrid systems, the need for simultaneous PET and MR phantom zzso zzso Phantom zzso that are used in zzso MR systems, especially in larger zzso and at a high magnetic field strength, are not necessarily zzso in PET imaging and vice zzso In this study, different approaches to fluid selection were considered and systematically evaluated with respect to their zzso for simultaneous zzso phantom zzso 

zzso water, water with increased electrical zzso a zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were investigated in MR and PET zzso using the most common PET zzso zzso As an alternative to zzso a modified PET zzso zzso zzso 222 zzso was investigated toward its ability to zzso in pure oil, which provides good signal zzso in MR zzso zzso were performed on a zzso T integrated zzso zzso system using a National zzso Manufacturers Association zzso zzso 

All tested zzso dissolved the zzso zzso zzso Regarding their suitability for MR at zzso zzso all zzso significantly improved the zzso compared to pure water zzso of zzso flip angle within the tested phantom by a factor of zzso When the use of zzso was zzso zzso zzso provided the best compromise zzso angle increase by a factor of zzso The potential alternative zzso zzso zzso 222 complex, dissolved in pure zzso however, it is not optimal in its tested composition because it accumulates at the bottom of the phantom during the time of zzso 

This study provides a systematic approach toward phantom fluid selection for imaging a given zzso body zzso zzso of comparable zzso zzso zzso For simultaneous zzso scans using the standard zzso zzso an alternative fluid to water and oil is proposed that serves as a viable option for both imaging zzso Nevertheless, when water is zzso ways to improve MR image zzso are zzso The tested alternative PET zzso enables the use of pure oil in combined scans, but the zzso composition needs to be zzso for phantom measurement zzso
