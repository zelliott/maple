To measure the effects of zzso drugs zzso on the development of cortical zzso zzso and cortical zzso in patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso were zzso to subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso (44 zzso three times zzso intramuscular zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso The reference population comprised 50 zzso zzso Clinical and zzso examinations were performed at zzso 12 months and 24 zzso 

One hundred and zzso treated patients completed the zzso After 12 months, zzso zzso of zzso patients developed zzso 1 new zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso p zzso zzso After 24 months, zzso 1 new zzso was observed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso p zzso zzso Mean zzso matter fraction decrease in zzso patients at 24 months ranged from zzso to zzso versus zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 

zzso drugs significantly decreased new zzso development and cortical zzso progression compared with zzso patients, with faster and more pronounced effects seen with zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso or zzso
