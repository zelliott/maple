The default mode zzso network is a major large-scale cerebral network that can be identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during resting zzso Most studies consider functional connectivity networks as stationary zzso zzso the transient behavior of the zzso network and its zzso is still largely zzso Most functional connectivity zzso studies assess the steady state of resting without any zzso To specifically investigate the recovery of the zzso network during the transition from zzso to rest, we implemented a cognitively demanding real-time zzso zzso task that targeted zzso of the primary auditory zzso Each of twelve healthy subjects performed 16 zzso zzso runs (4 runs per day repeated on 4 zzso resulting 192 runs in zzso The analysis included zzso independent component analysis zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso between the four components that corresponded to zzso of the zzso zzso These different zzso zzso after regulation with an average time lag or zzso and a time lag of zzso between the first and fourth zzso zzso the zzso recovery first shifts from anterior to zzso and then gradually focuses on the zzso part of the zzso zzso cortex, which is known to be implicated in internally directed zzso In addition, we found less zzso in the early anterior zzso as regulation strength increased, but more zzso with larger regulation for the late zzso that zzso the zzso zzso This finding confirms that the level of task engagement influences zzso the subsequent recovery of regions related to attention compared to those related to internally directed zzso
