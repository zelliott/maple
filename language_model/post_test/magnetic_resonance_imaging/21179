The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new method for direct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso size, using late enhancement magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a reference zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed on average 31 days after first-time zzso zzso in 58 zzso zzso was also performed on 35 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso size was based on automated selection and zzso of areas with zzso and zzso from zzso strain rate data, with manual correction based on visual wall motion zzso The left zzso zzso ejection zzso zzso zzso global strain, wall motion score index zzso zzso zzso motion and zzso and the ratio of early zzso inflow zzso to zzso zzso early zzso zzso were also measured by zzso The area under the zzso characteristic zzso for the identification of the zzso size zzso by zzso was zzso using the new method for direct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The new method showed significantly a higher correlation with the zzso size by zzso both at the global zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso level compared with other zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the percentage zzso size by strain rate imaging combined with wall motion analysis yields high diagnostic accuracy and better correlation to zzso compared with other zzso zzso of global zzso zzso zzso performed zzso month after zzso zzso showed ability to identify the patients with the zzso size zzso
