Our goal was to determine flow distribution in the zzso connections of patients with and without bilateral superior zzso zzso who had the zzso zzso No large series exists that establishes the flow zzso in zzso patients, which would be an important resource for everyday clinical use and may affect future surgical zzso 

We studied 105 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso phase contrast zzso mapping to determine flow rates in the inferior and superior zzso zzso and left and right pulmonary zzso Superior zzso zzso type included 40 zzso Glenn zzso (of which 15 were zzso and 53 zzso zzso zzso type included 69 zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso 

Total zzso flow was zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso with an inferior zzso zzso contribution of 59% zzso zzso Total pulmonary flow was zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso statistically less than zzso flow and not explained by zzso zzso The right pulmonary artery contribution zzso zzso zzso was statistically greater than the zzso In patients with bilateral superior zzso the right zzso accounted for zzso zzso zzso of the flow, with no difference in pulmonary flow splits zzso zzso zzso to the zzso Age and body surface area correlated with percent inferior zzso contribution zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso type did not significantly affect pulmonary flow zzso 

Total zzso cardiac index was zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal pulmonary flow splits zzso to the right zzso zzso zzso zzso contribution to total flow increases with body surface area and age, consistent with data from healthy zzso
