zzso low back pain in the young remains a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge for zzso Traditionally, chronic low back pain in this population has been attributed to either serious zzso pathology or zzso zzso This assumption may be incorrect because patients in this population may have underlying juvenile degenerative disc disease zzso an important pathological diagnosis in the adult zzso 

The purpose of this study is to report the zzso zzso findings, diagnosis, and treatment zzso of juvenile patients presenting with persistent low back pain for greater then 6 zzso 

This is a retrospective review of patients less than 21 years old referred to a spine specialty practice with persistent low back zzso 

The charts of zzso patients less than 21 years old referred to a spine specialty practice for the evaluation of spinal zzso 

zzso resonance images zzso were obtained and reviewed by a zzso and two orthopedic zzso 

Patients younger than 21 years old with persistent low back pain for greater that 6 months were zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bone disease were zzso Standard demographic information, relevant medical history and physical examination findings were zzso Patients were evaluated with an zzso of their spines to detect any potential underlying zzso The success of various treatment zzso used was zzso The findings of this study were correlated to those of the available literature following a thorough zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso 42 zzso with degenerative disc disease were identified on zzso The mean age was zzso years zzso zzso with a mean body mass index zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thirty-one had associated zzso There was 11 smokers, 20 involved in athletics, 17 with zzso and 9 with a zzso greater than zzso A distinct zzso of 13 patients with zzso concurrent spinal zzso was zzso Four of this zzso required surgical intervention for severe zzso or zzso zzso The majority of zzso patients were successfully treated with zzso zzso 

The findings of this study question whether zzso degenerative disc disease, commonly thought to exist only in an older population, in fact begins earlier in selected zzso Our study confirms the findings of others that there is a zzso population of juveniles that present with chronic low back pain who have degenerative disc disease identified on zzso Within this population is a zzso of patients with concurrent zzso spinal zzso Most patients with zzso appear to be well managed by traditional zzso treatment zzso
