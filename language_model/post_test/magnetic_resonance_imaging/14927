The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and inexpensive system for controlling body temperature in small animal experiments using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to investigate the effect of body temperature on the kinetic behavior of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso In our zzso system, body temperature was controlled using a zzso heated or cooled air flow generated by two zzso zzso The switches of the two zzso dryers were controlled using a digital temperature zzso in which the zzso temperature of a mouse measured by an optical fiber thermometer was used as the zzso In experimental studies, male zzso mice aged zzso old were used and allocated into 5 groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups, zzso in which the body temperature was maintained at 39 zzso 36 zzso 33 zzso 30 zzso and 27 zzso respectively, using our zzso The dynamic zzso zzso zzso data were acquired with an zzso system for animal experiments equipped with a zzso permanent zzso for approximately zzso after the injection of zzso into the tail zzso After correction of the image shift due to the zzso drift of the zzso frequency using the zzso image registration method with robust zzso of displacement zzso the kinetic behavior of zzso was analyzed using an empirical mathematical zzso With the use of this approach, the upper limit of the relative enhancement zzso the rates of contrast zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso related to the slope of early zzso zzso the area under the curve zzso the maximum relative enhancement zzso the time to zzso zzso and the elimination zzso of the contrast agent zzso were zzso The body temperature of mice could be controlled well by use of our zzso Although there were no significant differences in zzso zzso and zzso among groups, there were significant differences in A, zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that body temperature significantly affects the kinetic behavior of zzso in the zzso In conclusion, our system will be useful for controlling body temperature in small animal experiments using zzso Because body temperature significantly affects the kinetic behavior of zzso in the liver, the control of body temperature is essential and should be carefully considered when performing zzso studies in small animal zzso
