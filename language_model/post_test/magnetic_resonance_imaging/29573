We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of a visual target detection zzso task to investigate age differences in neural zzso for the detection of two types of zzso events: visually simple items requiring a response shift zzso and visually complex items that did not entail a response shift zzso zzso activated several prefrontal regions zzso middle frontal zzso as well as deep gray matter regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was similar for younger and older adults, whereas deep gray matter zzso was relatively greater for the older zzso zzso activated zzso regions zzso and lateral zzso zzso and this zzso was relatively reduced for older zzso The changes in behavioral performance across the task conditions were similar for the two age groups, although the older adults' responses were slower zzso zzso analyses of the relation between neural zzso and task performance zzso zzso indicated that whereas performance was zzso most directly by prefrontal zzso for younger adults, older adults' performance was influenced to a greater extent by deep gray matter zzso Older adults may place relatively greater emphasis on the zzso control of response regulation, in compensation for the age-related decline in visual processing zzso
