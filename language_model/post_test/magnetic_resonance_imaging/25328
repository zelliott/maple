The diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance zzso zzso has improved as a result of evolving zzso zzso has the advantage of negligible morbidity and mortality in contrast to zzso retrograde zzso zzso This study was performed to evaluate zzso as a replacement for diagnostic zzso for the suspicion of common zzso duct zzso zzso 

From 1998 to 2001, zzso was performed in 202 patients with a suspicion of zzso stones based on medical history zzso zzso liver function tests zzso both zzso and zzso or other zzso zzso was performed in all patients where zzso indicated the presence of zzso stones and in those patients with a persistent strong clinical suspicion for zzso stones despite a negative zzso 

In 25 patients, zzso suggested zzso stones which were proven with zzso in 24 zzso Despite a negative zzso 27 patients had a subsequent zzso None of these patients appeared to have zzso zzso In this group, zzso resulted in zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in detecting zzso zzso zzso of all patients revealed 5 more patients with persistent clinical suspicion or zzso liver function zzso Assuming zzso stones in these patients, zzso had a sensitivity of 83 % and a specificity of zzso for this zzso 

In the case of zzso stone suspicion, zzso should be the diagnostic procedure of zzso
