MR reporter genes have the potential to monitor zzso expression zzso in real time at high zzso These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to assess cellular zzso cell trafficking, and specific zzso activity, and also assess changes in the zzso Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for at least a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early zzso zzso This reflects the fact that there are potential zzso caused by the low sensitivity of zzso the need for zzso with their associated zzso zzso and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal zzso Nevertheless, significant progress has been made during the last few zzso Whereas zzso reporters were initially applied to zzso zzso monitoring of changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches are now emerging that rely on: zzso zzso zzso of functional groups that block water zzso exchange or protein binding of MR contrast zzso zzso expression of surface receptors that enable binding of specific MR contrast zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso involved with iron zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso After an introduction to the basic principles of designing zzso expression zzso and cloning of zzso a fresh look is provided on the use of reporter genes for optical (including zzso and nuclear imaging, with which MR reporter genes zzso Although progress in the use of MR reporter genes has been slow, newer strategies that use zzso or alternative contrast mechanisms, with no need for zzso promise rapid growth potential for this zzso
