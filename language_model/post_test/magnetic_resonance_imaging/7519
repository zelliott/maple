Poor insight in schizophrenia has been zzso to reflect a cognitive deficit that is secondary to brain zzso localized in the brain regions that are implicated in higher order cognitive functions, including working memory zzso This study investigated zzso neural zzso of preserved and poor insight in zzso 

Forty stable schizophrenia zzso 20 with preserved and 20 with poor insight zzso data obtained from 18 preserved and 14 poor insight zzso and 20 healthy participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during a zzso zzso zzso The three groups were zzso to match on age, education and predicted zzso and the two patient groups to have distinct insight zzso Performance and zzso data were zzso to determine how groups of patients with preserved and poor insight differed from each other, and from healthy zzso 

Poor insight patients showed lower performance zzso relative to healthy participants zzso and preserved insight patients zzso the two patient groups were comparable on symptoms and zzso zzso insight patients, relative to poor insight patients, showed greater activity most consistently in the zzso and zzso (both zzso during zzso they also showed greater activity than healthy participants in the zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso Group differences in brain activity did not zzso significantly with performance zzso 

The zzso and zzso function contribute to preserved insight in zzso zzso insight as well as zzso zzso capacity in schizophrenia zzso may be achieved via zzso neural activity in the frontal zzso and zzso
