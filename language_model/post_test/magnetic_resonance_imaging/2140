For many zzso therapies, it would be desirable to accurately monitor and zzso tumor response early in the treatment zzso This would allow zzso to continue effective therapies or zzso ineffective therapies early in the course of treatment, and zzso reduce zzso This is especially true for zzso therapies, which have reduced response rates and increased zzso Previous works by others and ourselves have shown that water mobility, measured by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso increases early in tumors destined to respond to zzso In the current communication, we further characterize the utility of zzso to predict response of prostate cancer zzso to zzso in zzso mice in a zzso zzso The current data illustrate that tumor volumes and zzso zzso zzso both respond strongly to zzso in a zzso manner, and the apparent diffusion zzso of water zzso increases significantly by 2 days even at the lowest doses (10 zzso The zzso data were parsed by zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso can be used for early detection of prostate zzso zzso response to zzso zzso
