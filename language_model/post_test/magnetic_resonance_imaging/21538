The primary role of zzso imaging in dental health has been the detection and zzso of disease as a guide for surgical zzso In this role, it appears to differ from the primary role of zzso skeletal zzso evaluation of the structural integrity of the zzso However, in both cases, the zzso information ultimately is used in an attempt to restore or maintain function in the affected zzso zzso This zzso relationship can be used as a framework within which the potential of new technologies developed for evaluation of the zzso skeleton can be assessed relative to zzso zzso Within this context, I treat first the use of newer imaging zzso followed by methods to assess bone properties, and finally the zzso of these technologies with other zzso tools to obtain direct information about the zzso relationship in the zzso
