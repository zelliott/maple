The high zzso of zzso and the recent advent of several new surgical and zzso treatment approaches have motivated the development of quantitative techniques to assess cartilage zzso Although magnetic resonance zzso imaging is the most accurate zzso diagnostic zzso for evaluating zzso cartilage, improvements in spatial resolution, zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso would be zzso zzso presents an imaging challenge due to its short zzso relaxation time and its low water content compared with surrounding zzso Current methods sacrifice cartilage signal brightness for contrast between cartilage and surrounding tissue such as bone, bone zzso and joint zzso A new technique for imaging zzso cartilage uses driven equilibrium zzso transform zzso a method of enhancing signal strength without waiting for full zzso zzso Compared with other methods, zzso imaging provides a good combination of bright cartilage and high contrast between cartilage and surrounding zzso Both theoretical predictions and images show that zzso is a valuable method for imaging zzso cartilage when compared with zzso zzso acquisition in the steady state zzso or fast spin echo zzso The cartilage zzso for zzso is as high as that of either zzso or zzso while the zzso fluid zzso of zzso is as much as four times greater than that of zzso or zzso zzso as a three-dimensional zzso zzso can achieve coverage comparable to that of other sequences in a similar scan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
