To evaluate zzso the zzso significance of zzso zzso parameters assessed on zzso magnetic resonance zzso images for development of distant zzso in patients with head and neck zzso cell zzso 

zzso MR images of 311 patients were zzso reviewed for the presence of zzso zzso at specific neck zzso levels as well as the size and the presence of a number of zzso zzso characteristics including zzso spread, central necrosis and number and volume of zzso and zzso zzso Of these patients, 174 zzso had zzso zzso zzso as zzso with minimum zzso diameter zzso and zzso zzso for zzso level and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso free survival rate zzso for patients without zzso zzso was zzso compared to zzso for those patients with zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso results of zzso analysis with the Cox zzso model yielded statistical significance for presence of zzso spread zzso detected on zzso as the only independent zzso factor associated with the zzso zzso zzso Based on the analysis, three risk groups regarding the zzso could be zzso zzso group zzso consisted of patients without zzso zzso zzso group zzso consisted of patients with zzso zzso without zzso zzso group zzso consisted of patients with zzso zzso and zzso as shown on zzso zzso zzso separation for different tumor locations showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oral zzso zzso zzso triangle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso oral zzso zzso to be significant zzso with regard to zzso 

Especially patients with on zzso demonstrating zzso spread and with suspicious zzso at zzso triangle zzso zzso or zzso level zzso zzso or with zzso enlarged zzso zzso and oral cavity zzso are at high risk for developing distant zzso and this subset of patients might benefit from supplementary imaging screening zzso zzso
