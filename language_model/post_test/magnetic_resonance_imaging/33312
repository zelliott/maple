The aim of this work was to study anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso in relation to zzso zzso knee abnormalities and cartilage zzso relaxation times in subjects with symptomatic zzso 

Two zzso screened the right knee zzso of 304 randomly selected participants in the zzso Initiative cohort with symptomatic zzso for zzso zzso Of the 52 knees with zzso 28 had zzso zzso 12 had partially torn zzso and 12 had completely torn zzso zzso randomly selected subjects with normal zzso served as zzso zzso knee abnormalities were graded using the zzso zzso zzso was segmented and zzso zzso values were zzso 

Compared to normal zzso knees, those with zzso abnormalities had a greater prevalence of, and more zzso cartilage, zzso bone zzso zzso cyst, and zzso collateral ligament zzso (all zzso zzso zzso did not significantly differ by zzso zzso 

zzso abnormalities were associated with more severe degenerative changes, likely because of greater joint zzso zzso zzso may not be well suited to assess advanced cartilage zzso
