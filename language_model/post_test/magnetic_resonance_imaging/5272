To zzso determine whether magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso cancer is a zzso method for predicting zzso survival zzso in patients with locally advanced low or zzso tumors who undergo combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy zzso before total zzso zzso 

The institutional review board does not require approval for the use of patient data obtained for an zzso retrospective zzso zzso patients were included in the study; 42 patients had zzso zzso Two zzso independently measured tumor volumes before and after zzso with use of zzso zzso The zzso were blinded to the clinical information for each zzso The tumor volume reduction ratio, zzso zzso margin, T stage, and occurrence of zzso were compared with the zzso response and zzso The threshold of tumor volume reduction for predicting zzso was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso was estimated with the zzso method and compared between groups with the zzso zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso between the two zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso A tumor volume reduction of at least zzso was significantly associated with good zzso zzso zzso zzso grade zzso 3 or 4) zzso zzso compared with a volume reduction rate of less than zzso zzso was studied in 51 zzso The mean follow-up of survivors at the time of analysis was 52 months zzso 20 zzso zzso Patients with a volume reduction ratio of at least zzso had a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso volume reduction was an independent zzso zzso in zzso analysis for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that zzso zzso are reliable markers of zzso cancer zzso enabling the prediction of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso is an easy zzso to use as a surrogate for clinical response to predict both zzso and zzso
