The aim of this study was to investigate spinal zzso injury zzso on the basis of diffusion zzso imaging zzso in patients with zzso electrical zzso We recruited eight zzso electrical injury patients and eight healthy subjects matched for age and zzso zzso and central motor zzso time were acquired in both the patient and control zzso We obtained zzso zzso according to the spinal zzso levels (from C2 to zzso and zzso locations zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared between the two zzso zzso they were compared in relation to spinal zzso level and zzso zzso In the patient group relative to the control group, the zzso value decreased and the MD and zzso values increased in all of the regions of interest zzso with statistical significance zzso In the patient group, particularly in the zzso of the anterior spinal zzso compared with the lateral and zzso spinal zzso the zzso value decreased with statistical significance zzso The zzso zzso did not differ by zzso zzso revealed the change of diffusion in the spinal cords of patients with zzso electrical injury, and zzso the zzso zzso and typical anterior spinal zzso location of zzso electrical zzso already reported in the zzso
