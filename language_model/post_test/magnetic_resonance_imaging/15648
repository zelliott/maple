To examine reductions in performance on auditory tasks by zzso and zzso intact individuals as a result of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner zzso 

Four tasks together forming a zzso of linguistic complexity were zzso They included zzso pitch discrimination, zzso discrimination of minimal pair zzso zzso decision, and sentence zzso Each task was performed by persons with zzso zzso and by zzso The stimuli were presented in silence and also in the noise recorded from within the bore of a 3 zzso zzso scanner at 3 zzso zzso zzso 

Across the 4 tasks, the zzso scored lower than the controls, and performance fell as a function of decreased zzso However, the rate at which performance fell was not different across the 2 listener groups in any zzso 

Depending on the relative levels of the signals and noise, the intense noise accompanying zzso scanning has the potential to severely disrupt zzso However, zzso are no more susceptible to the disruptive influence of this noise than are zzso individuals usually employed as zzso Thus, functional zzso data from zzso and control individuals may be interpreted without complications associated with large interactions between scanner noise and performance zzso
