The influence of zzso zzso zzso pulse on the zzso appearance of zzso cartilage in MR images was zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed on bovine cartilage plugs on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and on human knee cartilage in zzso on a zzso zzso clinical zzso When the normal to the surface of cartilage was parallel to zzso a typical zzso appearance was exhibited in zzso images of cartilage plugs, but was absent in zzso images of the same zzso At the zzso zzso orientation (when the normal to the surface of cartilage was zzso degrees with respect to zzso neither the zzso nor the zzso images demonstrated zzso At the same time, zzso values were greater than zzso at both zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso the dependence of the relaxation rate on the zzso frequency zzso was observed, which reached a zzso value of close to 2 zzso in both parallel and zzso zzso These results suggest that residual zzso interaction from zzso water and relaxation zzso such as chemical exchange, contribute to zzso zzso in zzso Further, one can reduce the zzso appearance in human zzso cartilage by applying zzso zzso zzso which may lead to a more accurate diagnosis of degenerative changes in zzso
