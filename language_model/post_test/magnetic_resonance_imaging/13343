A flow model was used to study the appearance of zzso flow on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On zzso extensive signal void zzso to the zzso was observed even with low flow zzso zzso with short echo time and zzso zzso demonstrated zzso loss of signal intensity only with high flow zzso On zzso the zzso signal loss increased with the severity of the zzso if total flow across the zzso was zzso The lower limit of the mean flow zzso within the zzso for which signal void was observed, appeared essentially independent of the degree of the zzso The results demonstrate the capability of zzso zzso to assess zzso turbulent zzso
