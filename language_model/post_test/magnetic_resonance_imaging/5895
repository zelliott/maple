We sought to perform the first systematic study of the natural history of chronic total zzso zzso zzso in an experimental zzso 

zzso of zzso has low success zzso The structural and zzso changes during zzso zzso which may adversely affect zzso outcome, have not been systematically zzso 

zzso were created in 63 rabbit zzso arteries by zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, relative blood volume zzso index, and zzso zzso imaging were analyzed at 2, 6, 12, and 18 to 24 zzso 

Early changes were characterized by an acute inflammatory response and negative zzso zzso with zzso reduction of zzso zzso area zzso from 2 to 6 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso occurred with a zzso increase in total zzso + zzso zzso zzso from 2 to 6 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a zzso increase in zzso index zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However at later time zzso there were significant reductions in both zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging demonstrated a zzso zzso channel at the zzso end at 6 weeks that zzso at later time zzso These vascular changes were accompanied by a marked decrease in zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso particularly at the entrance zzso zzso zzso 

This study is the first to systematically analyze compositional changes occurring during zzso zzso which may zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso channels, and zzso zzso together with the zzso of dense zzso may represent important targets for novel therapeutic zzso
