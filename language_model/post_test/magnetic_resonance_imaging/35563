The evaluation of zzso zzso methods based on magnetic resonance imaging have been usually hindered by the lack of realistic gold standard data against which to judge these methods or to help refine zzso Recently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Crum, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ridgway, zzso Cash, zzso Hill, zzso Fox, zzso zzso zzso model of diffuse global and regional zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging 25, zzso we presented a technique in which zzso is realistically simulated in different tissue compartments or zzso structures with a zzso zzso In this study, we have generated a cohort of realistic simulated Alzheimer's disease zzso images with known amounts of zzso mimicking a set of 19 real controls and 27 probable zzso subjects, with an improved version of our zzso simulation zzso This database was then used to assess the accuracy of several well-known zzso anatomy methods which provide global zzso and zzso or local zzso zzso estimates of zzso zzso in brain structures using MR zzso zzso and zzso results correlated very well with gold standard data zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively), achieving small mean absolute differences with respect to the gold standard zzso change from baseline zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso integration was guided by both fluid and zzso registration techniques and resulting deformation fields and associated zzso were zzso region by region, with gold standard zzso The zzso technique outperformed the fluid one in all evaluated structures zzso absolute differences from the gold standard in percentage change from baseline zzso whole brain, zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso The largest errors for both local techniques occurred in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For large structures such as the whole brain, these mean absolute differences, relative to the applied zzso represented similar percentages for the zzso zzso and zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For small structures such as the zzso these percentages were larger, especially for controls where errors were approximately equal to the small applied changes zzso zzso zzso However, these apparently large relative errors have not prevented the global or zzso measures from finding significant group separation in our zzso The evaluation framework presented here will help in zzso whether the accuracy of future zzso developments is sufficient for zzso change in smaller or less zzso local brain zzso zzso obtained in our experiments with realistic simulated data confirm previously published estimates of accuracy for both evaluated global zzso Regarding zzso zzso methods, the zzso one demonstrated promising results and potential for being used in clinical studies alongside (or in place zzso the more common global zzso The generated gold standard data has also allowed us to identify some stages and sets of parameters in the evaluated zzso brain extraction step in the global techniques and the number of zzso levels and the stopping criteria in the zzso zzso are critical for their zzso
