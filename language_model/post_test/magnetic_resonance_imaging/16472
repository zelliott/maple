To determine the volume and degree of asymmetry of zzso zzso and zzso muscles zzso in tennis and soccer zzso 

zzso and zzso volumes were determined using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in male professional tennis zzso and soccer players zzso and in zzso control subjects zzso zzso 15 and 6, zzso 

The dominant and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso (24 and zzso respectively, zzso and SP (32 and zzso respectively, zzso In zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso greater volume in the zzso than in the dominant zzso zzso reversed the zzso relationship observed in zzso zzso greater volume in the dominant than in the zzso zzso zzso whilst soccer players had similar volumes in both sides zzso The degree of zzso asymmetry decreased zzso from the first zzso disc to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso SP zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The slope of the relationship was lower in SP due to a greater zzso of the zzso segments of the dominant zzso Soccer and zzso had similar zzso volumes in both sides zzso and zzso for the dominant and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso volume was zzso greater in zzso than in zzso zzso whilst zzso and zzso had similar dominant zzso volumes zzso 

Tennis elicits an zzso zzso of zzso and reverses the normal zzso balance observed in zzso controls, while soccer is associated to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso muscles are zzso zzso in zzso while SP display a similar size to that observed in zzso It remains to be determined whether the different patterns of zzso and zzso zzso may influence the risk of zzso
