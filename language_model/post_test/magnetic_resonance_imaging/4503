A new technique for measuring tissue cellular volume zzso based on an improved modeling of the dynamic distribution of zzso and the effect of zzso exchange, is zzso This technique uses peak zzso enhancement and blood zzso concentration to zzso tissue cellular volume zzso The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated with computer simulations that explore the limits of the simplifying assumptions zzso vascular space, slow zzso zzso zzso and by direct comparison of MR and zzso cell fraction zzso made in muscle, liver, and tumor tissue in a rat zzso The computer simulations demonstrate that with slow to intermediate vascular zzso exchange and vascular zzso less than zzso the error in our cell fraction zzso typically remains less than zzso zzso with this zzso a direct comparison between MR and zzso zzso of cell fraction demonstrates mean percent differences of less than zzso in muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso zzso 1) and zzso in tumor zzso zzso zzso Similarly, for all rats zzso the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whole tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agree with the cell fraction values reported in the zzso In general, the zzso results demonstrate the feasibility of a simple method for measuring tissue cell fraction that is robust across a broad range of vascular volume, flow, and exchange zzso zzso this method may prove to be an important means for evaluating the response of tumors to zzso
