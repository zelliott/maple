The zzso zzso zzso area zzso is located at the anterior aspect of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and the zzso It is zzso interconnected with the zzso via zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso zzso is damaged in human zzso lobe zzso zzso The volume of the zzso zzso was measured using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 36 patients with zzso zzso and in 21 zzso The mean volumes of the zzso zzso on the focal side did not differ from zzso In 11 of 36 patients, however, the zzso zzso volume was reduced by zzso zzso volume correlated with zzso volume in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso damage had zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, right focal zzso patients with zzso zzso had a zzso volume reduction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The volume of the zzso zzso correlated with the duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study indicates that the zzso zzso might be damaged in a zzso of patients with zzso zzso In most cases, volume reduction was associated with zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso damage contributes to the zzso in zzso
