This study was aimed at assessing the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance zzso in spinal diseases amongst observers having several levels of zzso 

A selection was made of 20 MR exams which were classified as being normal zzso or altered zzso such zzso was called zzso and then compared to a second zzso made by 15 observers having varying levels of experience, called zzso 

The Kappa index was zzso zzso % sensitivity and zzso % zzso for identifying zzso A zzso Kappa index was obtained for disk zzso when diagnostic correctness was considered, zzso for degenerative disk disease, zzso for infectious zzso and zzso for zzso 

The authors concluded that MR is an image exam having high sensitivity and moderate specificity for identifying anatomical zzso of the spinal zzso however, it does not allow zzso having little experience to zzso explain an zzso zzso It is thus believed that routine requests for this exam by zzso leads to an unnecessary increase in costs and frequent diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
