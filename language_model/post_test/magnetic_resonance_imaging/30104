A challenging goal in zzso is to be able to read out, or zzso mental content from brain zzso Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have zzso orientation, position and object category from activity in visual zzso However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, zzso or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, zzso and decoding was based on previous zzso of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or zzso To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative zzso models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and zzso activity in early visual zzso These models describe the tuning of individual zzso for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural zzso We show that these zzso models make it possible to zzso from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an zzso Identification is not a mere consequence of the zzso organization of visual zzso simpler zzso models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification zzso Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from zzso of brain activity zzso
