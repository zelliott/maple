Although zzso zzso is able to reliably detect brief changes in brain activity and is now widely used throughout systems and cognitive zzso there have been no previous reports of zzso spinal zzso zzso This is likely attributable to the various technical challenges associated with spinal zzso zzso imaging a suitable length of the cord, reducing image artifacts from the zzso and zzso discs, and dealing with zzso noise from spinal zzso zzso However, with many of these issues now zzso the largest remaining impediment for zzso spinal zzso is a deprived understanding of the spinal zzso zzso signal time zzso zzso in this study, we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso with functional contrast based on signal enhancement by zzso water zzso zzso and a zzso zzso analysis to zzso characterize the zzso response function in the human cervical spinal zzso and zzso demonstrate the feasibility of zzso spinal zzso This was achieved by applying very brief (1 zzso epochs of zzso zzso stimulation to the palm of the hand and measuring the impulse response zzso Our results suggest that the spinal zzso zzso response zzso to peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and probably lacking zzso and zzso zzso is slower than previous estimates of zzso or zzso responses in the brain, but faster than previously reported spinal zzso zzso zzso Finally, by detecting and mapping consistent zzso changes within and across subjects, and zzso these regions with a zzso experiment, this study represents the first successful demonstration of zzso spinal zzso
