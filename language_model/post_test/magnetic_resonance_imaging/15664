zzso zzso zzso is caused by either zzso zzso or long-standing zzso factors such as inflammation or zzso Multiple zzso events over time are thought to contribute eventually to cerebral zzso Our objective was to examine whether the immediate response of the fetus to an acute zzso event determined the motor deficits associated with cerebral zzso 

zzso zzso imaging were performed on zzso gestation New Zealand white rabbits using a zzso magnetic resonance scanner during 40 minutes of zzso zzso 20 minutes of zzso and at 4, 24, and 72 zzso Individual fetuses were tracked to near term, and the delivered kits were divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and control groups zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso group had significantly less of a zzso in apparent diffusion zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and slower and incomplete recovery of zzso during zzso compared with the zzso zzso All fetuses in the zzso and zzso groups had an zzso zzso of less than zzso zzso zzso decrease from zzso whereas zzso of control animals had an zzso zzso greater than this zzso The difference between outcome groups was the largest at 4 hours zzso and persisted for 24 zzso 

zzso fetal brain scans indicate that the immediate response of a fetus to zzso is crucial to the development of zzso If the fetal brain can be scanned at the time of zzso zzso changes can predict which fetuses will have an zzso zzso
