To evaluate the feasibility of in zzso zzso imaging of the zzso zzso zzso and to measure zzso zzso relaxation times zzso in human zzso 

In this zzso zzso study, eight healthy volunteers (4 female, 4 zzso mean age zzso zzso were examined on a zzso zzso MR system using a zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso a zzso zzso echo zzso sequence with a variable echo time scheme zzso was zzso zzso times were calculated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were given on a zzso basis for a zzso section from the zzso in the direction of the zzso zzso maps were calculated by fitting the zzso signal zzso zzso on a zzso basis, using least squares zzso 

Mean zzso zzso increased from the zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso The zzso increase ranged zzso from zzso to zzso Mean zzso relaxation times differed statistically significantly zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and to measure the zzso zzso relaxation times of human zzso at 7 zzso 

zzso High field MR offers new insights into zzso anatomy and zzso zzso (23) Na zzso of healthy human zzso is feasible at zzso zzso zzso Renal (23) Na concentration increases from the zzso in the zzso pyramid zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso (23) zzso times are demonstrated at zzso zzso
