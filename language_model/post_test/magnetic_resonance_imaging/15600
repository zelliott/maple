To compare different methods for zzso of zzso nerve and nerve sheath zzso To apply a novel magnetic resonance protocol using zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences to analyze zzso nerve zzso 

zzso were taken in right eyes of 33 subjects whose median age was 25 zzso zzso zzso was repeated three times in straight zzso zzso zzso was repeated three times in straight gaze and zzso zzso sequences were applied in straight zzso analyzed twice by two different zzso and completely repeated in a subset of 10 zzso zzso confidence intervals and zzso of variation were zzso 

zzso sequences yielded high contrast between zzso fluid and zzso nerve zzso Acquisition time for each sequence was zzso seconds per zzso zzso nerve diameters decreased from zzso zzso at 5 zzso to zzso zzso at 15 zzso behind the zzso zzso diameters decreased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso A- and zzso zzso yielded significantly smaller zzso For zzso zzso the zzso of variation ranged from zzso to zzso and were significantly smaller than those obtained with zzso zzso zzso 

The precision of magnetic resonance imaging exceeds that of zzso methods for determining zzso nerve and nerve sheath zzso zzso sequences appear particularly appropriate for investigating the zzso zzso nerve complex and may be useful in future studies zzso zzso loss within the zzso zzso
