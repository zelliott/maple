The purpose of the study was to evaluate a semiautomatic analysis tool for assessing global left zzso zzso function with zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined 33 patients with zzso using zzso zzso detector zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed using semiautomatic zzso analysis software zzso zzso zzso This software tool automatically creates zzso and zzso contours that can be manually corrected on all zzso slices at all reconstructed time points within the cardiac cycle, based on a zzso and zzso zzso All global left zzso function parameters assessed with the semiautomatic zzso software were highly correlated with the results of zzso zzso analysis showed minor systematic zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso zzso and zzso of ejection fraction zzso with zzso as compared with zzso The zzso time was moderately but significantly longer with the zzso software zzso zzso than necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly as a result of the longer time required for uploading of the zzso zzso which were on average 54 times larger zzso zzso In conclusion, it appears feasible to accurately assess global left zzso function with zzso in a reasonable zzso time using a semiautomatic software zzso
