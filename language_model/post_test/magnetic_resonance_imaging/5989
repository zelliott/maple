Heart failure zzso is accompanied by zzso zzso and cognitive deficits, indicating brain zzso zzso gray matter volume and isolated white matter zzso occur in zzso but the extent of damage is zzso Using magnetic resonance zzso zzso we evaluated the extent of injury across the entire brain in zzso 

zzso and zzso images were acquired from 13 zzso (age zzso zzso zzso years; zzso male, left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso and 49 controls zzso zzso zzso years, 59% zzso Whole brain maps of zzso relaxation times were compared at each zzso between groups using analysis of zzso zzso age and zzso Higher zzso relaxation values, indicating injured brain areas zzso zzso zzso emerged in sites that control zzso zzso zzso and cognitive functions zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, deep zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insular, cingulate, and zzso frontal zzso corpus zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso No brain areas showed higher zzso values in control zzso zzso zzso 

Brain structural injury emerged in areas involved in zzso pain, mood, language, and cognitive function in zzso zzso zzso conditions accompanying zzso may result from neural injury associated with the zzso
