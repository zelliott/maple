Despite numerous reports on the morbidity and mortality of deep brain stimulation zzso cerebral zzso zzso has rarely been zzso We present four cases of zzso zzso secondary to zzso zzso 

The diagnosis of zzso zzso was based on 1) delayed onset of new zzso deficits on zzso day 1 or 2; 2) significant zzso surrounding the superficial aspect of the implanted lead, with or without zzso zzso on CT zzso 

Four cases zzso per lead, zzso per zzso of symptomatic cerebral zzso zzso were identified out of 500 zzso lead zzso procedures between July 2002 and August zzso All four patients had Parkinson's zzso Their zzso leads were implanted in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso review of the targeting confirmed that the planned trajectory passed within zzso of a cortical vein in two cases for which zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging was zzso In the other two cases, contrasted targeting images were not obtained zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a potentially zzso but serious zzso To minimize its zzso we propose the use of zzso zzso zzso MR images to delineate cerebral zzso zzso along with careful zzso planning of the lead trajectory to avoid injury to zzso zzso
