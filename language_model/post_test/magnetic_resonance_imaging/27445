It is commonly believed that pelvic organ zzso zzso is associated with cervical zzso However, cervical lengths have not been formally compared between women with zzso and those with normal zzso 

zzso and zzso corpus lengths were measured on magnetic resonance images in a zzso study of 51 women with zzso and 46 women with normal support determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Group matching ensured similar demographics in both zzso zzso for normal cervical lengths were determined from the values in the control group in order to evaluate for cervical zzso amongst women with zzso 

The zzso is zzso % zzso zzso longer in women with zzso than in women with normal pelvic support zzso zzso zzso Linear zzso modeling suggests the feature most highly associated with cervical length is the degree of zzso descent zzso point zzso zzso 40 % of women with zzso have cervical zzso 57 % of cervical zzso in zzso can be explained by a zzso zzso model including zzso point C, body mass index, and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is found in one third of women with zzso with the extent of zzso increasing with greater degrees of zzso zzso
