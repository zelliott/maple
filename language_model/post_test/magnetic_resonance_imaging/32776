This study zzso zzso zzso that are affected by zzso zzso magnetic fields zzso within a zzso magnetic stray field zzso of a 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using a zzso zzso crossover design, 31 healthy volunteers were tested in a sham zzso zzso low zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso head movements were made before every zzso task to induce zzso 

Of the six tested zzso zzso we demonstrated that attention and concentration were zzso affected when exposed to zzso within an zzso zzso from zzso to zzso per zzso exposure, zzso particular in situations were high working memory performance was zzso In addition, zzso orientation was affected after exposure zzso per zzso exposure, zzso 

zzso functioning is modulated when exposed to zzso zzso within an zzso of a 7 T zzso zzso zzso that were affected include zzso and zzso zzso Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms and possible practical safety and health implications of these acute zzso zzso
