zzso resonance imaging zzso is a key technology in the zzso evaluation of patients with zzso Already at early zzso stages it can contribute to the identification of patients who are, in the case of zzso good candidates for zzso zzso Yet, zzso zzso zzso examinations often fail to displaying zzso relevant zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to identify an zzso zzso zzso which is likewise sensitive for even small zzso zzso and economical enough to be applied outside specialized zzso zzso 

Based on a large European zzso zzso program zzso zzso patients we identified the spectrum of common zzso zzso and determine the set of zzso sequences that are required for their reliable zzso Relying on a series of small, zzso particularly relevant zzso we determined the required slices zzso slice zzso and zzso for an zzso zzso zzso 

zzso for early zzso zzso specific zzso are fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Slice thickness for zzso and zzso must not exceed 3 zzso The zzso image should be acquired in three-dimensional technique at 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso at least two slice zzso each must be demanded in zzso zzso We suggest no zzso to a clinical focus zzso The resulting zzso zzso sequence protocol allows the detection of virtually all common zzso zzso zzso 

The creation of a broadly accepted and abundantly applied zzso protocol for zzso zzso can contribute to improved and earlier identification of potential candidates for zzso zzso Our systematic analysis of zzso requirements for the detection of zzso zzso can serve as basis for protocol negotiations between zzso zzso and health care zzso
