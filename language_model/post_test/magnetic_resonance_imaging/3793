Many studies have shown that zzso zzso interacts with exposure to stress in zzso risk for zzso However, the specific neural mechanisms through which this zzso interaction zzso risk remain largely unknown, and no study to date has directly examined the zzso effects of zzso on zzso circuit responses during exposure to acute zzso 

An acute laboratory zzso was administered to 51 healthy women during zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso In this task, participants were threatened with electric shocks of uncertain intensity, which were unpredictably delivered to the wrist after a long anticipatory cue period of unpredictable zzso 

Relative to women carrying the L zzso those with the SS zzso showed enhanced zzso during threat anticipation in a network of regions, including the amygdala, zzso anterior zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso with the SS zzso also displayed enhanced positive zzso between zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and anxiety experience, whereas enhanced negative zzso between zzso zzso and perceived success at regulating anxiety was observed in individuals carrying the L zzso 

These findings suggest that during stress exposure, neural systems that enhance fear and zzso zzso attention toward threat, and zzso on emotional zzso of the threat may be engaged zzso in individuals with the SS zzso This may be one mechanism underlying the risk for zzso zzso by the S zzso upon exposure to life zzso
