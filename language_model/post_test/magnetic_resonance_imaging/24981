To assess the feasibility of combined zzso and viability testing by using magnetic resonance zzso imaging in one setting in patients with zzso zzso acute coronary zzso 

The data of 13 patients zzso age, 68 years; range, zzso zzso at high risk for zzso zzso who underwent MR imaging at zzso T were zzso zzso factors were increased zzso T levels in seven, zzso ST depression on an zzso in four, history of zzso zzso in two, and presence of heart failure in zzso zzso imaging of the left zzso was performed with a zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso sequence to assess the regional zzso contraction and ejection zzso After injection of zzso zzso per zzso of body weight of zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained by using an zzso zzso sequence at rest and during infusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and stress images were assessed zzso for abnormal regional zzso zzso The zzso was divided into three zzso segments corresponding to the three coronary artery zzso Delayed (after 15 minutes) contrast zzso images were acquired with use of a segmented zzso fast zzso shot zzso Conventional coronary zzso were compared with the zzso zzso A more than 50% zzso in diameter in any coronary artery was considered zzso zzso test was used to assess any significant difference between the left zzso ejection fraction zzso in patients with and those without zzso zzso 

Mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso stress zzso studies depicted 25 segments of zzso in 11 zzso zzso of zzso zzso defects with findings on coronary zzso indicated an overall sensitivity of zzso (24 of 26) and specificity of zzso (12 of zzso in detection of substantial coronary artery zzso zzso detected from zzso on delayed zzso images were present in eight segments (four were zzso in five zzso No significant difference was noted in the zzso between patients with and those without zzso zzso zzso 

Combined stress zzso and viability MR imaging was feasible in patients with acute coronary zzso zzso MR zzso defects compare well with the presence of substantial coronary artery zzso on conventional zzso
