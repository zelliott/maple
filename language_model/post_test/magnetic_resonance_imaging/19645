The objective of this paper is to find the relatively zzso zzso zzso mode shapes of a zzso zzso zzso cylinder with intermediate wall zzso The dynamic behavior of a zzso zzso cylinder plays a crucial role in determining and controlling the zzso performance of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso cylinder were carried out under different boundary conditions to obtain the various mode zzso zzso zzso predicted by using modified zzso governing zzso and zzso modes simulated using a finite element method show close agreement with experimental modal results and reveal the mode shapes for both zzso and zzso boundary zzso These results were further compared to in zzso zzso of the mode shapes of the zzso zzso cylinder insert during scanning in a 4 zzso zzso The general agreement among the zzso zzso and experimental mode shapes indicates that a linear combination of basic beam zzso and ring zzso patterns occupy the dynamic zzso modes in the low frequency zzso The in zzso zzso zzso show that the forcing function developed by the distributed zzso forces on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso results in predominantly zzso zzso mode patterns in the low frequency zzso
