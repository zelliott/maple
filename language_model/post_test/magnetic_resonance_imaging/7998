zzso zzso is thought to be an zzso factor with respect to the development of zzso zzso Although previous studies have suggested that the geometry of the zzso zzso and the height of the zzso play an important role in determining zzso zzso no investigation has systematically examined these relationships during weight zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso height and/or zzso geometry predicts zzso alignment zzso zzso displacement and lateral zzso zzso during weight zzso 

MR images of the zzso joint were acquired from 36 participants during weight bearing zzso of body zzso at 4 knee zzso angles zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using the zzso images, zzso alignment zzso displacement and zzso and zzso zzso geometry zzso angle and inclination of the lateral zzso zzso were zzso zzso height zzso zzso was measured on reconstructed zzso plane zzso 

zzso zzso analysis revealed that at zzso of knee zzso the height of the zzso was the best predictor of lateral zzso tilt while the lateral zzso inclination angle was the best predictor of lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso inclination was the best predictor of zzso lateral displacement and tilt at zzso zzso and zzso of knee zzso 

Similar to a previous study performed under zzso bearing condition, our findings suggest that lateral zzso inclination is an important zzso of zzso alignment in weight zzso
