The zzso artery is made up of four zzso one of which zzso is connected to highly mobile cervical zzso This connection zzso the common assumption that persons with zzso histories of mechanical neck movements, such as cervical spine manipulation zzso should experience increased zzso zzso 

Two of the largest case series of zzso artery dissection describing subjects with and without a specific history of zzso were zzso to determine which zzso of the zzso artery was most commonly zzso 

The zzso segment was the most commonly involved zzso artery segment in both the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso prevalence ratio zzso zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso vulnerability was zzso by the effect of zzso The joint effect of zzso location and exposure to zzso was greater than if each effect were simply zzso In zzso site zzso were significantly more common than single sites in both the zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In prior studies which identified zzso artery compromise, those with a history of zzso were more likely to have involvement of the zzso zzso Although this study does not identify a mechanism which relates zzso artery dissection and exposure to zzso these data are compatible with a greater than additive relation between compromise of an zzso segment thought to be mechanically vulnerable and history of a mechanical zzso
