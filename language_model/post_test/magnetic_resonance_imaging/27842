The bulk of spinal imaging is still performed with conventional two-dimensional zzso This study zzso the suitability of three-dimensional sampling perfection with zzso contrasts using a different flip angle evolutions zzso sequence for routine spinal zzso 

62 zzso examinations of the spine were evaluated by 2 examiners in consensus for the depiction of anatomy and presence of zzso We noted zzso that might be missed using the SPACE sequence only or the SPACE and a zzso zzso weighted zzso The reference standards were zzso and zzso zzso weighted and zzso weighted zzso At a later date the evaluation was repeated by one of the original examiners and an additional zzso 

There was good agreement of the single evaluations and consensus evaluation for the conventional zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso For the SPACE zzso depiction of anatomy was very good for zzso of cases, with high zzso agreement, but there was poor zzso agreement for other zzso For zzso assessment of zzso zzso zzso The SPACE sequence was superior to conventional sequences for depiction of anatomy and zzso zzso The SPACE sequence occasionally missed bone zzso zzso In conjunction with zzso zzso weighted zzso no zzso was zzso The zzso SPACE sequence was superior to conventional sequences in imaging difficult anatomy such as in zzso and zzso 

The SPACE sequence allows excellent assessment of anatomy zzso to high spatial resolution and resistance to zzso The sensitivity for bone zzso abnormalities is zzso
