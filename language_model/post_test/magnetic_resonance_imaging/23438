Research on the functions of the human brain requires that functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso moves towards producing images with less distortion and higher zzso and spatial zzso This study compares zzso balanced zzso free zzso zzso acquisitions with and without parallel imaging zzso to investigate whether combining zzso with this pulse sequence is a viable option for functional zzso Such a novel combination has the potential to offer the zzso advantages of zzso with the reduced acquisition time of zzso zzso were done on a Philips zzso zzso using the installed zzso pulse zzso both with and without the sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso The task was a visual flashing zzso and the viewing window covered the visual zzso zzso comparisons with and without zzso were done using the same manually drawn region of interest for each time course of the subject, and comparing the zzso summary statistics: number of zzso with zzso the mean of those zzso their 90th zzso and their maximum zzso We show that zzso greatly improves the zzso resolution in zzso reducing the volume acquisition time by more than half in this study to zzso s with zzso zzso zzso At the same time, a statistically significant increase was found for the maximum zzso using zzso with zzso as compared to without it zzso This improvement can be understood in terms of zzso noise, as demonstrated by noise zzso This produces observed increases in the overall zzso signal to noise of the functional time series, giving greater sensitivity to functional zzso with zzso This study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of combining zzso with zzso to achieve zzso functional images without loss of sensitivity and with high zzso zzso
