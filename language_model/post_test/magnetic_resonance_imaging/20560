Working memory has traditionally been viewed as independent of the zzso and related zzso zzso lobe zzso Yet zzso patients with zzso zzso lobe damage are sometimes impaired at remembering zzso information zzso an object and its zzso across delays as short as a few zzso This observation has raised the possibility that zzso zzso lobe structures are sometimes critical for maintaining zzso information, regardless of whether the task depends on working or long-term zzso An alternative possibility is that these structures are critical for maintaining zzso information only when the task exceeds working memory capacity and depends instead on long-term zzso To test these ideas, we drew on a method used previously in a classic study of zzso span in patient zzso that distinguished immediate memory from long-term zzso In two experiments, we assessed the ability of four patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso to maintain varying numbers of zzso associations across a 1 s retention zzso In both experiments, the patients exhibited a similar pattern of zzso They performed similarly to controls when only a small number of zzso associations needed to be zzso and they exhibited an abrupt zzso in performance with larger set zzso This pattern of results supports the idea that maintenance of zzso information in working memory is intact after damage to the zzso and related zzso zzso lobe structures and that damage to these structures zzso performance only when the task depends on long-term zzso
