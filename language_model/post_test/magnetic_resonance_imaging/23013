Diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascular zzso In particular, type 1 diabetes compromises the cardiac function of individuals at a relatively early age due to the protracted course of abnormal zzso zzso The functional abnormalities of diabetic zzso have been attributed to the pathological changes of diabetic zzso 

In this study, we used high field magnetic resonance imaging zzso to evaluate the left zzso functional characteristics of zzso treated diabetic zzso rats (8 weeks disease zzso in comparison with zzso matched zzso 

Our analyses of zzso gated cardiac zzso scans of the left zzso showed a zzso decrease in the zzso volume and zzso increase in the zzso volume of diabetic hearts compared to zzso Mean stroke volume and ejection fraction in diabetic rats were decreased zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso Further, zzso changes were suggestive of phase sensitive differences in left zzso zzso across the cardiac cycle between diabetic and control zzso 

Thus, the zzso analyses of diabetic left zzso suggest impairment of zzso and zzso zzso in this rat model of diabetic zzso Our studies also show that in zzso zzso could be used in the evaluation of cardiac dysfunction in this rat model of type 1 zzso
