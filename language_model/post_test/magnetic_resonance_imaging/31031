Magic angle effects are well recognized in MR imaging of zzso and ligaments, but have received virtually no attention in MR zzso We investigated the hypothesis that signal intensity from peripheral nerves is increased when the zzso orientation to the constant magnetic induction field zzso approaches 55 degrees (the magic zzso 

Ten volunteers were examined with their peripheral nerves at different zzso to zzso to detect any changes in signal intensity and provide data to estimate zzso Two patients with zzso arthritis also had their median nerves examined at 0 degrees and 55 zzso 

When examined with a short zzso zzso sequence with different zzso the median nerve showed a zzso increase in signal intensity between 0 degrees and 55 degrees and an increase in mean zzso from zzso to zzso zzso When examined in 5 degrees to 10 degrees increments from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, the median nerve signal intensity changed in a manner consistent with the magic angle zzso No significant change was observed in skeletal zzso zzso and zzso nerves also showed changes in signal intensity depending on their orientation to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso at about 55 degrees to zzso and showed a higher signal intensity than that of nerves in the upper arm that were nearly parallel to zzso A reduction in the change in signal intensity in the median nerve with orientation was observed in the two patients with zzso zzso 

Signal intensity of peripheral nerves changes with orientation to zzso This is probably the result of the magic angle effect from the highly ordered, zzso zzso collagen within zzso zzso in signal intensity with orientation may simulate disease and be a source of diagnostic zzso
