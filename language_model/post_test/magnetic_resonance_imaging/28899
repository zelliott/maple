After conventional doses of 55 to 65 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso usually zzso at its original zzso This institutional phase II study was designed to assess whether dose escalation to 90 zzso gray equivalent zzso with zzso zzso and photons in accelerated zzso would improve local tumor control and patient zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in this zzso zzso criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, zzso Performance zzso score of greater than or equal to 70, residual tumor volume of less than 60 zzso and a zzso unilateral zzso zzso survival rates at 2 and 3 years were zzso and zzso zzso The median survival time was 20 months, with four patients alive 22 to 60 months zzso Analysis by zzso zzso Oncology Group zzso criteria or Medical Research Council zzso showed a zzso to zzso increase in median survival time over those of comparable conventionally treated zzso All patients developed new areas of zzso enhancement during the follow-up zzso zzso examination of zzso obtained at zzso zzso or autopsy was conducted in 15 of 23 zzso zzso necrosis only was demonstrated in seven patients, and their survival was significantly longer than that of patients with zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso regrowth occurred most commonly in areas that received doses of 60 to 70 zzso or less; zzso tumor was found in only one case in the zzso zzso 

A dose of 90 zzso in accelerated zzso prevented central recurrence in almost all zzso The median survival time was extended to 20 months, likely as a result of central zzso zzso will usually recur in areas immediately peripheral to this zzso volume, but attempts to extend local control by enlarging the central volume are likely to be limited by difficulties with radiation zzso
