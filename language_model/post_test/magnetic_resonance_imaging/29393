This study validated zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso modeled zzso of calf and arm zzso water volume and volume changes during 72 h of simulated zzso and caloric restriction by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso muscle volume as a criterion zzso zzso and zzso zzso of calf and upper arm segments were made in 18 healthy men and women zzso 29 zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso mass, 71 zzso 16 zzso before and after the zzso Muscle volume of arm and leg segments by zzso was on average 15 zzso 10 and 14 zzso zzso lower, respectively, than the estimated total water volume by zzso zzso zzso zzso but their correlations were excellent zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume changes were a decrease of 49 zzso 68 zzso 41 zzso 62 zzso in the calf and a decrease of 18 zzso 23 zzso 11 zzso 24 zzso in the arm, respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso detected the zzso water shifts in the calf resulting from the zzso tilt treatment, but the zzso protocol was not of sufficient duration or intensity to produce limb zzso water changes zzso by zzso zzso was highly correlated with zzso muscle volume and tracked changes associated with zzso zzso Further research, however, is needed to determine whether zzso can accurately access separate changes in zzso and zzso zzso
