zzso resonance imaging zzso is increasingly used in patients, but it is zzso in those with cardiac zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso This study examined circumstances in which potentially life-threatening zzso may be triggered in patients with zzso undergoing zzso and whether these problems can be avoided by zzso of these zzso 

Eight zzso and seven zzso were investigated in a phantom at zzso zzso zzso and imaging zzso 

A decrease in battery zzso was found in four zzso after zzso zzso for zzso zzso Additionally, three showed changes in programming zzso zzso changes did not appear in the tested zzso but periods of zzso were recorded in all types of devices during zzso depending on the pulse sequence zzso 

zzso electromagnetic fields as used in routine zzso can induce severe zzso device zzso Device programming approaches are unreliable for prevention of patient zzso as programming changes or zzso are one of the primary malfunctions during zzso
