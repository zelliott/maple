Because the recovery of zzso function and the avoidance of positive surgical margins are important but competing zzso the decision to preserve or zzso a zzso bundle zzso during radical zzso zzso should be based on the most accurate information concerning the location and extent of the zzso In the current study, the authors determined the incremental value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in making this zzso 

zzso was performed in 135 patients zzso For each zzso tumor extension to the zzso and the need for zzso zzso was judged by a surgeon on a scale from 1 zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso before and after reviewing zzso with a zzso zzso findings were used as the standard of zzso The value of zzso was assessed using zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis adjusted for multiple observations per patient, and a mixed effects zzso zzso model was used for risk zzso 

zzso examination determined that zzso zzso was warranted in 44 of zzso zzso zzso because of zzso zzso extension zzso zzso 29), positive surgical margins zzso zzso zzso or both zzso zzso zzso The areas under the zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso surgical planning zzso zzso zzso zzso findings suggested altering the surgical plan in zzso of zzso (106 of zzso zzso When the surgeon judged that the zzso zzso was definitely not necessary zzso zzso zzso confirmed that decision in 138 zzso zzso the zzso decision was correct in zzso of the cases zzso of 138 zzso In 36 high-risk patients zzso or zzso zzso probability of zzso zzso zzso findings changed the surgical plan for 28 zzso zzso the change was found to be appropriate in 26 cases zzso 

zzso was found to significantly improve the zzso decision to preserve or zzso the zzso during radical zzso
