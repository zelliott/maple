zzso integration in the brain rests on anatomical connectivity (the presence of zzso zzso and effective connectivity (the zzso influences zzso by these zzso The deployment of anatomical connections provides important constraints on effective zzso but does not fully determine it, because synaptic connections can be expressed functionally in a dynamic and zzso zzso Although it is generally assumed that anatomical connectivity data is important to guide the construction of zzso realistic models of effective zzso the degree to which these models actually profit from anatomical constraints has not yet been formally zzso Here, we use diffusion weighted imaging and zzso zzso to specify zzso informed zzso for dynamic zzso models zzso of zzso zzso We constructed 64 alternative zzso which embodied different zzso between the probability of an anatomical connection and the prior zzso of the corresponding of effective zzso and fitted them to empirical zzso data from 12 healthy zzso Using zzso model selection, we show that the best model is one in which anatomical probability increases the prior zzso of effective connectivity parameters in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso This means that the higher the likelihood that a given connection exists zzso the larger one should set the prior zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso hence making it easier for the zzso to zzso from zero and represent a strong effective zzso To our knowledge, this study provides the first formal evidence that zzso knowledge of anatomical connectivity can improve models of functional zzso
