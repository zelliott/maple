Childhood emotional zzso zzso has been associated with disturbances in emotional and behavioral zzso and with changes in regional brain zzso However, whether zzso has any effect on the intrinsic organization of the brain is not zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso functional connectivity zzso using seeds in the zzso network, the zzso network zzso and the zzso network, and the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso Using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso functional zzso zzso scans were zzso We defined seeds in the bilateral amygdala, the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso and used these to examine whether individuals reporting zzso zzso differed from individuals reporting no zzso zzso in zzso with other brain zzso The two groups were matched for age, zzso zzso and the presence of zzso 

zzso was associated with decreased zzso between the right zzso and the bilateral zzso and a cluster extending from the left zzso to the zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was associated with decreased zzso between the zzso and the zzso and also frontal regions of the zzso 

We found that zzso has a profound effect on zzso in the zzso network and the zzso zzso zzso that show zzso connectivity are related to episodic memory zzso retrieval and zzso zzso
