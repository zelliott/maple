zzso cells zzso play an important role in zzso plaque formation, but the mechanism has not been zzso zzso This study is designed to establish a method for tracing zzso zzso zzso the investigation of the zzso specific roles in zzso zzso zzso labeled by different zzso of ultra small zzso iron oxide zzso were injected into zzso rabbit model and traced with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso showed that zzso labeling nearly have no zzso to zzso in low zzso zzso but induced some decrease of cell viability at high zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso from 200 to zzso caused a zzso decrease of the zzso membrane potential in zzso The high labeling concentration zzso triggered necrosis instead of zzso in zzso By zzso and zzso zzso sequence imaging comparison, zzso were found to exist in rabbit abdominal artery plaques after zzso of transplantation and in zzso after one week detected by zzso blue zzso of tissue zzso We concluded that about zzso zzso is ideal to effectively label zzso for zzso tracing zzso without a threat to cell zzso Combining zzso labeling and zzso to track the movement of injected zzso zzso is a feasible zzso
