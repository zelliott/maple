zzso the internal dynamics of prostate injections, particularly injection pattern distribution is a key step to developing new therapies for prostate disease that may be best served with a direct injection zzso Due to excellent properties involving liquid contrast agents, zzso can be used for targeting and monitoring of injections into zzso and zzso 

Eleven zzso injections were performed in zzso with zzso using a custom zzso guiding and imaging system for use in a standard zzso T MR zzso In addition, 25 injections were performed on excised zzso human zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to guide the injections and monitor zzso injection zzso 

zzso and zzso MR images were correlated with zzso to produce three-dimensional data sets that can be used to analyze trends in injection zzso This analysis was used to develop strategies for injection prediction such as zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso In addition, a rough model of prostate injections is zzso and a preliminary injection guide is developed that takes into account the individual zzso goals for zzso 

MR zzso of injected therapeutic agents allows for prediction and monitoring of drug zzso possibly improving efficacy and reducing side zzso zzso analysis and modeling may be used to assist in zzso clinical treatments that require or would benefit from focal zzso injections into the zzso
