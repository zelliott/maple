zzso are widely used to examine zzso mechanisms under experimental zzso The purpose of our study was to zzso the visual zzso of zzso using visual stimulation in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Five male zzso zzso were studied with zzso during visual stimulation with series of light impulses conducted into the MR cabin via zzso optical wave guides zzso zzso block design, zzso T clinical routine zzso Statistics were performed using zzso All zzso showed zzso of the visual zzso due to light zzso The zzso could be superimposed to zzso structural images with good spatial resolution revealing the exact location of the visual zzso We were able to zzso the visual zzso in zzso for the first time utilizing zzso on a routine zzso However, this may be useful for precise positioning of zzso or implants or be used as a further uncomplicated zzso method in zzso zzso
