To examine the differential features of combined zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

Forty patients with zzso proven combined zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso who had undergone zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso MR images were analyzed for the shape of zzso zzso or zzso areas on the zzso image zzso rim enhancement during early dynamic zzso and central enhancement with zzso rim (target zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso phase zzso The significance of these findings was determined by the zzso zzso 

zzso shape and strong rim enhancement during early dynamic zzso and absence of target appearance on zzso favored combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shape, weak peripheral rim enhancement, and the presence of complete target appearance on the zzso and zzso zzso favored zzso zzso zzso zzso However, 10 zzso type of combined zzso showed complete or partial target appearance on zzso zzso 

The shape of tumors, degree of rim enhancement during early dynamic zzso and target appearance on zzso were valuable for zzso between combined zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso
