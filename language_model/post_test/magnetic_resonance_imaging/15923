The zzso method using two and three recovery times is studied for conditions in which the sum of recovery times is zzso to zzso where zzso is the zzso relaxation zzso These conditions can reduce scan time considerably for long zzso species and make zzso relaxation rate zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping for body zzso clinically zzso zzso Carlo computer simulation is carried out to determine the ideal set of recovery times under various constraints of the sum of recovery zzso The ideal set is found to be approximately zzso to the zzso zzso For the zzso method, two of the recovery times should be set the same or approximately the same and should be shorter than the third zzso Only marginal improvements in accuracy and precision can be achieved by the zzso method over the zzso method under a common constraint of the sum of recovery zzso zzso high resolution, zzso zzso scans on volunteers with a zzso technique zzso and completed in a scan time of 10 zzso generated zzso zzso of zzso fluid zzso approximately 4 zzso in agreement with the computer simulation and literature results, which demonstrates the clinical feasibility of applying the zzso zzso method for zzso mapping for long relaxation zzso
