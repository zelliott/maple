zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disorder that typically presents with zzso zzso low cerebral spinal fluid pressures and distinct abnormalities on magnetic resonance zzso 

We present a case of a rare presentation of zzso 

A zzso man presented with a two week history of zzso headaches that rapidly progressed to zzso and coma, requiring zzso zzso revealed abnormalities typical of zzso zzso enhancing zzso zzso fluid collections, and descent of the zzso Treatment with an zzso blood patch reversed his coma within zzso Following a second blood patch, the patient became zzso No cerebral spinal leak could be identified on magnetic resonance imaging or on a nuclear medicine zzso cerebral spinal fluid flow zzso At six month zzso he remained symptom zzso
