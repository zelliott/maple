zzso contrast zzso was investigated zzso and clinically for a class of magnetic resonance zzso pulse sequences we call zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison to traditional zzso sequences zzso 90 zzso zzso the zzso sequence is of the form alpha zzso zzso where 90 degrees zzso alpha zzso 180 zzso zzso analysis shows that appropriately designed zzso sequences can selectively boost the MR signal by zzso in substances whose spin lattice zzso relaxation values equal or exceed the sequence repetition time zzso This unique contrast behavior potentially allows one to reduce zzso (and hence imaging zzso by zzso to 50% while maintaining constant zzso contrast or zzso within an zzso 

zzso clinical testing of zzso sequences was performed in 60 patients with a wide range of zzso zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso images zzso zzso were blindly and zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Principal diagnoses were zzso between the readers in all cases, although minor zzso in detail features were noted in 6 zzso of 60 zzso zzso sequences revealed small zzso areas in two cerebral zzso and in a zzso disk which were not apparent on the standard zzso zzso However, the zzso images were rated to be zzso by visual assessment in 43 of 60 cases, the exception being for abdominal zzso where respiratory and zzso artifacts were judged more severe on the standard zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging is an interesting technique capable of improving image contrast and signal from zzso with long zzso values when the sequence repetition time zzso is zzso
