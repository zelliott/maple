The purpose of this study was to evaluate regional zzso zzso in a zzso manner using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso effect of intravenous zzso was evaluated on the zzso on zzso undergoing zzso 

Ten randomly selected patients were evaluated for regional zzso blood flow in the zzso and zzso with zzso zzso studies within 2 weeks before and 4 hours after zzso Five of these patients were treated with 500 zzso of intravenous zzso 45 minutes prior to zzso Renal zzso were assessed utilizing relative zzso zzso zzso calculated from signal zzso zzso obtained from regions of interest zzso The zzso choice was based on the zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso of zzso and zzso studies were compared in the first group of zzso Relative zzso of the treated kidney were compared with those of the zzso kidney in the second group of patients, who received zzso 

In the group not treated with zzso there was no significant difference in cortical zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso However, after zzso there was a reduction of cortical flow zzso zzso zzso in the treated zzso In the group treated with zzso zzso zzso study after zzso revealed no significant difference in relative zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso of the zzso were small for all patients, but standard errors were large, indicating a wide range of zzso 

This study helps to establish reduced cortical flow after zzso and demonstrates that zzso attenuated this response in the zzso subjected to zzso It appears that zzso administration causes no zzso in zzso blood zzso
