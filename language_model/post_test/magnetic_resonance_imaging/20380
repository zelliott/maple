zzso identification of the zzso in MR images is crucial to properly and zzso assess the zzso zzso zzso computerized zzso of the zzso in zzso is necessary to produce zzso and accurate results with minimal user zzso 

A zzso zzso method was developed to identify the zzso in zzso on the basis of intensity differences compared with the zzso The method was validated by zzso computer-generated images with a known zzso The method was tested by using 63 MR images of rabbit zzso zzso which were segmented to detect disk zzso An zzso was used to assess the zzso of this method compared with manual zzso 

The error in the detected area of the rabbit zzso by using zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso by using manual zzso Moreover, the method was capable of detecting disk zzso in a known rabbit puncture model of disk zzso Finally, this method had an zzso of zzso and zzso in regard to zzso the area and calculating the MR imaging index of the zzso zzso it highly zzso 

The zzso method is a zzso computer method able to segment the zzso of the rabbit disk and detect disk zzso In addition, it could assist in clinical zzso assessment, and monitoring of early zzso in human zzso
