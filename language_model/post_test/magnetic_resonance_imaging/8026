Acute bouts of high-intensity exercise zzso peripheral appetite regulating hormones to zzso suppress zzso However, the effects of physical activity on central appetite regulation have yet to be fully zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare neural responses to visual food stimuli after intense exercise and zzso 

Fifteen lean healthy men zzso zzso zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso body mass index (in zzso zzso zzso zzso completed two zzso zzso zzso running at zzso maximum zzso zzso and a resting control trial zzso a zzso zzso After each trial, an zzso assessment was completed in which images of zzso and low-calorie foods were zzso 

zzso significantly suppressed zzso appetite responses while increasing thirst and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso and significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to images of zzso foods significantly increased zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso compared with zzso After zzso low-calorie food images increased zzso and zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso compared with zzso Furthermore, left zzso activity was significantly elevated after zzso when low-calorie images were viewed and was suppressed when zzso images were zzso and these responses correlated significantly with zzso 

Exercise increases neural responses in zzso regions of the brain in response to images of low-calorie foods and suppresses zzso during the viewing of zzso zzso These central responses are associated with zzso changes in peripheral signals related to zzso and zzso zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
