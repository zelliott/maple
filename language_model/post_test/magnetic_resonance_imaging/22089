The signals in zzso spin echoes which are refocused by 90 degrees zzso are zzso zzso The spatial zzso is not normally observed in images or profiles obtained using zzso or zzso zzso but may cause errors if the sample structure varies on the distance scale of the zzso zzso zzso measured using zzso echoes will also show errors under these zzso zzso zzso arguments show that conditions which allow the zzso to become visible in an image or profile have the effect of introducing a second echo into the zzso acquisition zzso Phase cycling may be used to remove the spatial dependence of the zzso
