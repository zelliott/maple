We sought to analyze the zzso volumes of the zzso pole, zzso segment of the zzso zzso amygdala, zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso due to zzso proven zzso zzso lobe sclerosis zzso seizure free for zzso years of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, operated on between 1996 and 2001, with zzso diagnosis of zzso and a zzso follow-up of zzso years, had their zzso lobe structures manually zzso measured, and compared with those of 23 normal volunteers, paired as groups for sex, age, and zzso 

The mean volumes of the zzso zzso pole, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso patients were significantly lower than those in zzso 

zzso zzso data show that the damage in zzso due to zzso may be more widespread and zzso even in patients with unilateral zzso by clinical and zzso zzso Our results are relevant to the discussion of zzso mechanisms in zzso
