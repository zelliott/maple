Language skills continue to develop rapidly in children during the school-age years, and the zzso view of the neural zzso of language provided by current zzso studies cannot capture the dynamic changes associated with brain zzso The aim of this study was to conduct a zzso zzso investigation of language development using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy zzso 

Thirty subjects enrolled at ages 5, 6, or 7 were examined annually for 5 years using a zzso magnetic resonance imaging scanner and a verb generation zzso Data analysis was conducted based on a general linear model that was modified to investigate zzso changes whereas minimizing the potential for missing zzso 

With increasing age, there is progressive participation in language processing by the zzso zzso middle zzso and angular zzso of the left zzso and the zzso and inferior zzso zzso of the right zzso and zzso of participation of the left zzso zzso cortex, left superior frontal and right anterior zzso zzso and left zzso 

The age-related changes observed in this study provide evidence of increased zzso of language in this age group and may have implications for further investigations of normal and zzso language zzso
