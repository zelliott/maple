The preliminary results of zzso transfer zzso imaging on a whole body zzso T system are zzso zzso egg zzso and several volunteers were zzso on zzso and zzso T magnets zzso to GE zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso signal difference to noise ratio zzso and contrast parameters were measured at both fields and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was used to characterize the frequency dependence of the zzso zzso The results show that zzso imaging can be safely performed at zzso T without exceeding limitations of radio frequency zzso The zzso effect is more pronounced at the higher field, leading to better quality images with higher contrast and zzso The zzso are not markedly different at the higher field although the zzso is zzso The potential applications of this technique to study neurodegenerative diseases, as well as, zzso imaging and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
