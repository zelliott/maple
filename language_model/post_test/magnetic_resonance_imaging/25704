Permanent zzso of the internal carotid artery may be required for en bloc zzso of a neck tumor or to treat certain zzso The risk of zzso zzso is usually assessed with carotid balloon test zzso and concurrent zzso zzso pressure zzso However, up to zzso of patients who tolerate the test zzso have delayed zzso zzso We propose enhanced MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso signs of zzso and zzso as zzso to the balloon test zzso to identify patients at risk for delayed zzso 

We zzso examined 12 patients referred for balloon test zzso of the carotid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso internal carotid pressure were zzso zzso was injected IV after 2 zzso of zzso test zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data acquisition was done zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed zzso zzso after completion of the zzso test zzso Signs of decreased zzso or zzso on these tests were compared with the mean zzso zzso pressure and zzso status of the patient during test zzso 

Seven zzso of 12 patients had abnormal findings on zzso zzso or zzso MR zzso Only one patient had zzso deficits that corresponded to abnormal MR zzso The other 11 patients zzso remained zzso during the zzso test zzso Of these 11 zzso patients, five zzso had areas of decreased zzso on zzso and three zzso had abnormal MR contrast enhancement suggesting residual focal zzso as a result of the test zzso Mean zzso pressures in the zzso zzso artery did not correlate well with the imaging zzso 

zzso zzso can show clinically silent areas of decreased zzso while enhanced MR shows signs of acute zzso zzso significant zzso associated with zzso balloon test zzso zzso such patients would be at increased risk for permanent zzso after permanent carotid zzso
