Image contrast between tissue types can be generated based on their zzso ratio using zzso zzso zzso An interesting application of such a concept would be to generate contrast in tissue with tissue relaxation times modified using zzso contrast zzso An zzso zzso zzso has been shown in the past to perform zzso zzso However, zzso of this zzso may not prove to be efficient and practical in research or a clinical setup due to high zzso power zzso Recent advancement in software and hardware MR technology allows zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on MR zzso The aim of this work was to explore role of zzso zzso in performing zzso imaging and demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 independent zzso zzso zzso can be used to distinguish materials that differ in zzso zzso 

MR simulation was performed using computer routines implemented in zzso environment zzso zzso zzso zzso Bloch equations with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to perform MR zzso zzso zzso were only used for comparison to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 10) were used as examples of contrast agents due to their routine use in clinical and research zzso and more zzso because they provide good examples of materials differing in zzso zzso zzso of spin zzso using zzso zzso agree very well with the previously published results, thereby zzso the computer routines used in this MR zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso offset frequency show distinct zzso for these materials differing in zzso for the three zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso difference in zzso ( approximately 150 zzso for the zzso Rate of spin lock with zzso zzso zzso was rapid compared to other zzso 

MR simulation using contrast agents zzso and zzso provided a useful way to demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be used to perform zzso zzso Future work involves zzso of these zzso on MR scanners and performing in zzso imaging to generate tissue contrast based on relaxation times zzso
