zzso is a new muscular zzso caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cause zzso and zzso zzso We report here a follow-up muscle zzso study on five patients affected by zzso form of zzso zzso weighted scans showed subsequent involvement of zzso zzso and zzso hip zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscles, and later on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and biceps zzso muscles, zzso The STIR weighted images showed in the early stages widely distributed zzso signals, zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso muscles, which at that time have normal zzso zzso All patients showed asymmetry of muscle involvement both clinically and on muscle zzso The progression of muscle involvement was relatively zzso We conclude that the pattern of muscle involvement seen in patients with zzso zzso with zzso 5 zzso zzso is typical and can thus be useful during the differential diagnosis process allowing for a more targeted molecular zzso
