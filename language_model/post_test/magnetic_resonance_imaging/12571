zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso measures of specific brain structures may serve as excellent zzso in future clinical trials of Huntington disease zzso 

zzso of the clinical significance of these measures is an important step in determining their appropriateness as potential outcome zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso volumes and zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, nucleus zzso zzso were obtained from zzso scans of 516 individuals who tested positive for the HD gene expansion, but were not yet exhibiting signs or symptoms severe enough to warrant diagnosis zzso zzso volumes zzso for zzso zzso were correlated with zzso zzso zzso and functional measures known to be sensitive to subtle changes in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes consistently correlated with cognitive and zzso but not psychiatric or functional measures in zzso Volumes of white matter, nucleus zzso and thalamus, but not cortical gray matter, also correlated with some of the motor and cognitive zzso 

zzso of zzso analyses suggest that volumes of zzso zzso structures contributed more highly to the prediction of most motor and cognitive variables than volumes of other brain zzso These results support the use of zzso measures, especially of the zzso zzso as outcome measures in future clinical trials in zzso zzso may also assist investigators in selecting the most appropriate measures for treatment trials that target specific clinical features or regions of zzso
