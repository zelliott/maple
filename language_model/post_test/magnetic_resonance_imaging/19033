zzso as a symptom of zzso and its apparent zzso aspiration pneumonia, are common consequences of a stroke in the zzso Previous reports that focused on zzso due to a zzso zzso were studies of single cases or a relatively small number of patients with multiple zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso between the onset of stroke and the evaluation time of swallowing was not controlled and varied largely among zzso Thus, prediction of the swallowing status of patients with a zzso zzso has not been zzso 

To investigate the relation between the zzso of pure zzso zzso and zzso to examine swallowing function over time, and to explore clinical variables that can predict zzso 

We investigated 23 patients with pure zzso zzso using the zzso swallowing study and compared the airway status findings with the zzso location as determined with magnetic resonance zzso The patients were classified by 6 zzso zzso categories zzso zzso middle, zzso zzso and zzso and by 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso and zzso From the results of the zzso swallowing studies, 2 patient groups were zzso one with aspiration and the other without zzso The clinical variables related to aspiration and outcome measures were also zzso 

Ten zzso of the 23 patients zzso aspiration on zzso 9 zzso of 13 with only zzso zzso or zzso in zzso including the middle zzso 1 zzso of 3 with only upper-level zzso and 0 zzso of 7 with only zzso zzso zzso A zzso running the length of the middle and the lower zzso levels always resulted in zzso When an upper-level zzso was additionally involved, the zzso of aspiration depended on the horizontal extension of the zzso We were able to discriminate the 2 patient groups with zzso accuracy using such variables as zzso soft zzso dysfunction, and facial zzso Most of the patients with aspiration symptoms due to a pure zzso zzso recovered rather zzso 

zzso zzso often cause zzso but the occurrence may depend on the levels along the zzso and zzso zzso zzso When different zzso levels and zzso and their related clinical findings are considered as possible zzso aspiration becomes zzso The outcome data prove that systematic control of evaluation time of swallowing was critical as we engaged in this study, since many zzso with pure zzso zzso resolve their swallowing difficulties rather zzso
