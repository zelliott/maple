To establish zzso of selected zzso parameters in cases with normal zzso zzso in zzso or zzso 30 year old selected samples from zzso 

A total of 220 subjects of zzso or zzso 30 years of age with normal zzso zzso were evaluated by using zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso height zzso and shape of the superior surface of the zzso was observed on zzso zzso Data was zzso into six groups on the basis of age and sex to observe the zzso 

After the second month of life, the zzso height increased gradually to achieve its peak in the second decade of life in the females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the third decade of life in the males zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased gradually there zzso zzso difference was observed in zzso in different age groups in both zzso zzso was significantly higher in females than males in the second zzso Higher zzso of convex superior surface followed the same zzso 

This study provided the reference values for the zzso height and the shape of the superior surface of the zzso zzso which may contribute to establish credible reference zzso
