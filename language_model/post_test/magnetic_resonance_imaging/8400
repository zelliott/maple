Although zzso commonly occurs in children, there is still a poor understanding of the imaging characteristics of zzso and lack of agreement regarding its imaging findings and zzso zzso 

To characterize the zzso appearance of zzso on zzso CT, and MR and to correlate the imaging findings with zzso zzso 

The imaging findings of 47 zzso on US zzso zzso 17), CT zzso zzso 31), and MR zzso zzso 5) were zzso zzso zzso specimens of all cases were reviewed and compared with imaging zzso 

All zzso were zzso subcutaneous zzso with partial attachment to the zzso zzso On zzso the zzso were mostly zzso with zzso acoustic zzso and zzso zzso On CT, they appeared as enhancing zzso masses with varying amounts of zzso MR findings were internal zzso and zzso areas on zzso images and zzso zzso images, corresponding to zzso zzso on zzso zzso inflammatory changes and zzso capsule on pathology were well correlated with imaging zzso 

zzso should be considered when US or CT shows a zzso zzso or zzso zzso in subcutaneous fat attached to the skin in zzso MR images may be helpful in zzso zzso findings are well correlated with imaging zzso
