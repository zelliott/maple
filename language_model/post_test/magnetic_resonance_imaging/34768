To study how zzso cells are affected by development of chronic cerebral zzso after zzso zzso zzso the changes in zzso zzso during development of zzso were evaluated by in zzso localized zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso was produced by introduction of a blood zzso around the right middle cerebral artery and the right side of the circle of zzso MRS experiments were performed before zzso and on Days 7 and 14 after zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were obtained to locate the volume of interest zzso zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso The peak areas for zzso compounds, the sum of zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso revealed approximately 50% reduction of vessel caliber for the right main cerebral arteries on Day zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed no apparent cerebral zzso even in the zzso zzso MRS revealed a significant zzso zzso zzso reduction of the zzso and zzso ratio on Days 7 and 14 and a significant increase in the zzso and zzso ratio on Day 7, in the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso animals, there were no significant changes in these ratios in the bilateral zzso region on Days 7 and 14 after the zzso 

The results suggested that the development of cerebral zzso after zzso caused zzso injury in a zzso of zzso cells, even when no apparent cerebral zzso was zzso zzso MRS may be useful to evaluate how zzso cells are affected by the zzso insult during development of zzso in clinical zzso
