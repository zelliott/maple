The effect of section alignment and distance in zzso determination of zzso mass by means of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso was studied in 19 isolated pig zzso Double zzso views taken through the short axis of the heart with a slice thickness of 10 zzso and slices at a distance of 0 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso and 5 zzso produced accurate left zzso zzso with cardiac zzso zzso in the long axis of the heart resulted in a marked zzso of zzso zzso depending on slice zzso there was an error between zzso and zzso In zzso zzso in 35 subjects confirmed the effect of section zzso zzso in the long axis of the heart produced results of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly less than zzso in the short axis of the heart of zzso zzso zzso zzso
