To compare the performance of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in conjunction with an zzso contrast agent with that of zzso with respect to detection and zzso of gastrointestinal zzso in zzso in zzso 

zzso bleeding sites were surgically created in the small zzso and colon of six zzso The animals underwent zzso with zzso zzso red blood cells and zzso zzso following administration of an zzso contrast agent zzso at five minute intervals over 30 zzso For analysis, the zzso tract was divided into six zzso Based on the two evaluated methods, each segment was zzso on a five point scale regarding the presence of a zzso At autopsy, the surgically manipulated zzso segments were inspected for the presence of zzso 

zzso was confirmed at autopsy in zzso zzso zzso zzso with subsequent movement through the zzso could be documented on zzso data zzso All segments were correctly zzso resulting in zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso Based on zzso interpretation of seven segments zzso was false zzso of zzso zzso in diagnostic performance were evident in the receiver operator characteristic zzso analysis, with an area under the zzso curve of zzso and under the zzso curve of zzso 

In conjunction with an zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso permits accurate detection and zzso of gastrointestinal zzso The extent and evolution of zzso bleeding can be determined with repeated data zzso
