The primary purpose of this investigation was to assess the neural zzso of implicit zzso during an zzso task in schizophrenia when performance accuracy was matched with healthy comparison zzso 

We compared 17 individuals with chronic schizophrenia zzso zzso zzso average years of zzso and 17 healthy comparison subjects zzso matched for hit and false alarm rates, age, and education on a visual zzso task during functional magnetic resonance zzso In this task, one of the go stimuli also served implicitly as a cue zzso of a subsequent zzso zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that even when matched for overall performance zzso individuals with zzso exhibit difficulties with zzso and cue processing that may relate to core deficits in cognitive control and stimulus zzso In particular, these findings point towards an important role of the zzso zzso for cued zzso processes in healthy zzso
