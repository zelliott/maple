Prior studies of mind wandering find the default network active during mind zzso but these studies have yielded mixed results concerning the role of cognitive control brain regions during mind zzso Mind wandering often interferes with reading zzso and prior zzso studies of discourse comprehension and strategic reading comprehension have shown that there are at least two networks of brain regions that support strategic discourse zzso a zzso control network and a network of regions supporting zzso comprehension zzso The present study was designed to further examine the neural zzso of mind wandering by examining mind wandering during strategic reading zzso Participants provided ratings of mind wandering frequency that were used to investigate interactions between the strategy being performed and brain regions whose zzso was modulated by wind zzso The results support prior findings showing that cognitive control regions are at times more active during mind wandering than during a task with low control demands, such as zzso This result provides an initial examination of the neural zzso of mind wandering during discourse comprehension and shows that the processes being engaged by the primary task need to be considered when studying mind zzso The results also zzso in a different learning domain, prior findings of key brain areas associated with different reading zzso
