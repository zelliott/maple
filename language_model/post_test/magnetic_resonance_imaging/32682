We examined interactions between zzso zzso and zzso systems during a zzso zzso zzso healthy young adults solved multiple zzso problems requiring hypothesis testing while functional magnetic resonance images were zzso zzso in the head of the zzso peaked early after the beginning of each problem and then dropped zzso In contrast, activity in prefrontal zzso areas reached peak values zzso These results are in accordance with theories suggesting that the zzso identifies the behavioral context necessary for the frontal lobe to select an appropriate zzso zzso and zzso systems showed zzso patterns of activity: zzso in the anterior zzso zzso whereas zzso activity zzso Good learners showed higher activity in the body and tail of the zzso than poor zzso whereas learning success correlated zzso with activity in the zzso zzso in the head of the zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso indicating a potential mechanism for zzso activity zzso
