We examined the processing of verbal and zzso auditory stimuli using an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study to reveal the neural zzso of rapid zzso information processing and it's relevance during speech zzso In the context of a clustered zzso zzso data collection eight right-handed native German speakers zzso zzso an auditory gap detection zzso and zzso a zzso syllable discrimination zzso A tone perception task served as a zzso control zzso Here we aimed to research to what extent the left zzso zzso processes zzso relevant zzso information available in speech and zzso zzso Furthermore, we sought to find out as to whether a left zzso preference for zzso relevant zzso information is specifically constrained to verbal zzso or if zzso zzso information may also activate these zzso We collected zzso responses from three time points of acquisition zzso with varying zzso distance from stimulus onset to gain an insight on the time course of auditory zzso zzso show exclusively zzso zzso of primary and secondary auditory zzso associated with the perception of rapid zzso zzso Furthermore, the data shows an overlap of zzso evoked by zzso sounds and speech stimuli within primary and secondary auditory zzso of the left zzso The present data clearly support the assumption of a shared neural network for rapid zzso information processing within the auditory domain for both speech and zzso signals situated in left superior zzso zzso
