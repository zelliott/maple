To use zzso to determine which structures are critically involved in the generation of zzso fast activity zzso and slow spike and wave zzso zzso zzso the characteristic zzso zzso of zzso syndrome zzso 

We studied 13 zzso patients with zzso using structural imaging and zzso at 3 zzso Ten patients had cortical structural zzso zzso and zzso were considered as separate events in the zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso was recorded in 6 patients and zzso in 9 (in 2, both were zzso zzso events showed almost uniform increases in blood oxygen zzso zzso signal in zzso cortical areas, as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a different pattern of zzso signal change with many areas of decreased zzso zzso mostly in primary cortical zzso Two patients with prior zzso had zzso as well as generalized zzso The zzso zzso was associated with a zzso version of the zzso pattern we report zzso 

zzso is associated with activity in a diffuse network that includes association zzso as well as an unusual pattern of simultaneous zzso of zzso structures zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso By comparison, the zzso pattern is quite different, with cortical and zzso zzso and zzso Regardless of zzso it appears that 2 key, but zzso patterns of diffuse brain network involvement contribute to the defining zzso features of zzso
