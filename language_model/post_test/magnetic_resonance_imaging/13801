The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effects of zzso several currently used drugs: local zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso administered using continual zzso in zzso back zzso The association of an zzso and a solution of local zzso through infusion increases the zzso effect and allows smaller quantities of both drugs to be zzso The addition of another drug, like zzso may allow the dose of the single drugs to be reduced even further, thus resulting in fewer zzso side zzso We know that at least two of the zzso zzso systems and at least three zzso zzso the painful sensory zzso The zzso can act as both zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso 

All the patients in this study were zzso after varying periods of home therapy or in other zzso The case histories of zzso patients were studied on admission using routine zzso and laboratory tests, and also based on a chart divided into zzso the first showed the marks for zzso of a patient with zzso and the second contained zzso zzso This was measured both directly, using the zzso visual parallel and a language card, and indirectly zzso activities, drug zzso zzso The scale of the analog used defines slight pain with values of less than 44 zzso moderate pain with values between zzso zzso strong pain with values between zzso zzso and very strong pain above 88 zzso 

The following results were obtained from this zzso successes zzso partial successes zzso failures zzso Of the 48 failures, 31 were operated within a few days, whereas the remaining 17 cases were not operated because the patients declared that they were satisfied with the improvement obtained or gave other zzso The zzso effect was frequently zzso The improvement usually increased after the second block so that some patients did not require a third zzso 

The results confirm that continual zzso therapy is the most successful and also the most rapid treatment available for pain of zzso zzso At present we share zzso opinion that the same general indications are still zzso 1) zzso with negative zzso 2) zzso with medical zzso to zzso 3) zzso of zzso and/or zzso origin with zzso to multiple zzso and no reliable signs of a specific zzso 4) for symptomatic purposes while waiting for diagnosis and zzso
