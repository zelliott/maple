Evaluate the clinical outcome of surgical intervention for post-traumatic zzso 

Progressive post-traumatic zzso zzso zzso or zzso can occur after spinal zzso zzso The authors present their surgical treatment protocol and treatment outcome of a series of patients with post-traumatic zzso 

The medical records of 53 patients with zzso undergoing surgical treatment were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso For patients with no focal zzso and only a zzso zzso on zzso a zzso shunt zzso was zzso For patients with both zzso and a zzso zzso cyst, an zzso procedure was performed zzso When a zzso showed significant size reduction zzso after zzso no shunt was zzso When the zzso size persisted on zzso images, a short zzso shunt was zzso The mean follow-up was zzso months for the 45 patients available for follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso between the zzso event and the operation was from 5 months to 37 years zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most frequent zzso followed by motor deterioration and zzso zzso improvements in zzso of the patients were noted in those presenting with worsening motor function or zzso In 19 of 28 patients with associated zzso spinal cord, zzso alone caused significant collapse of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso collapse in zzso of the patients with zzso alone and zzso of the patients with a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can occur with or without zzso zzso zzso alone for patients with zzso zzso and zzso formation can reduce zzso size and alleviate the symptoms and signs of zzso in the majority of these zzso zzso with expansion of zzso space with an zzso zzso may be a more zzso way of treating a zzso zzso with associated zzso zzso treating the cause rather than the zzso
