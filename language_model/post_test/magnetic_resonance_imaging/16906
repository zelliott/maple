We applied advanced magnetic resonance imaging and zzso based zzso analysis to assess brain tissue density in patients with zzso 

Forty eight patients with zzso without overt zzso zzso (17 Child A, 13 Child B, and 18 Child zzso and 51 healthy subjects were matched for age and zzso zzso patients had history of overt zzso zzso eight of them had minimal zzso zzso at zzso 10 other patients had minimal zzso zzso at inclusion but without history of previous overt zzso zzso and 21 patients had none of these zzso 

Patients with zzso presented decreased brain density in many areas of the zzso and white zzso The extension and size of the affected areas were greater in patients with alcoholic zzso than in those with zzso zzso and correlated directly with the degree of liver failure and cerebral dysfunction (as estimated by zzso tests and the zzso of overt zzso zzso Twelve additional patients with zzso who underwent liver transplantation were explored after a median time of zzso zzso after liver zzso At the time of liver zzso three patients belonged to class A of the zzso zzso five to class B and four to class zzso Compared to healthy subjects, liver transplant patients showed areas of reduced brain density in both zzso and white zzso 

These results indicate that loss of brain tissue density is common in zzso zzso during the course of the disease, is greater in patients with history of zzso zzso and persists after liver zzso The significance, zzso and clinical relevance of this zzso cannot be zzso from the current zzso
