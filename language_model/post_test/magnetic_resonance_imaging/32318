zzso fractures are subtle unstable injuries that are often associated with zzso zzso zzso observations made during routine interpretations revealed involvement of a burst component to this fracture pattern and a clue on the zzso images to its zzso The purpose of this review was to determine how often these features occurred in a retrospective study of a large sample because these findings influence diagnosis and zzso 

A retrospective review of all patients identified from the University of Maryland zzso zzso Center trauma registry and zzso system diagnosed with zzso injuries of the zzso spine over an zzso period was zzso Three trauma zzso assessed the admission spinal zzso CT studies with zzso images, and available zzso zzso Imaging findings were confirmed by zzso zzso CT studies and surgical reports were reviewed for evidence and type of zzso zzso A literature review of previous similar series was zzso 

zzso patients were identified for inclusion in the zzso Associated zzso injury occurred in zzso and most commonly involved the zzso and zzso A close examination of the fracture patterns on CT revealed that a zzso fracture with zzso zzso zzso or zzso was a common finding zzso Also, serial zzso CT images often zzso showed a gradual loss of definition of the zzso that we refer to as the zzso zzso zzso The study showed that the zzso oriented fracture planes through the zzso elements can often be recognized zzso but these fractures can be very zzso 

zzso injuries occurred in zzso of zzso zzso fractures in our study zzso which is slightly lower than previously zzso About half of the patients with this injury displayed a zzso component that could have a significant influence on surgical zzso The zzso zzso sign can assist in recognition of this often subtle injury on zzso zzso
