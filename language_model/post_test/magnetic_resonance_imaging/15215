The main purpose of this study was to investigate effects of motor fatigue on brain zzso in humans, using zzso First, we assessed brain zzso that correlated with muscle activity during brief zzso at different force levels zzso zzso Second, a similar analysis was done for sustained zzso inducing motor zzso Third, we studied changes in brain zzso due to motor fatigue over zzso And fourth, we investigated zzso effects of fatigue by comparing brain zzso before and after the fatiguing condition during simple and zzso motor tasks zzso time zzso Several motor areas in the brain showed increased activity with increased muscle activity, both during force zzso and motor zzso Interestingly, the zzso showed a smaller increase in zzso during zzso zzso due to fatigue, while additional zzso was found in the zzso motor area and in a frontal zzso During motor fatigue, there was a decrease in force production, an increase in force zzso and an increase in muscle zzso Brain areas comparable with the aforementioned areas also showed stronger zzso over zzso After fatigue, reaction time task performance remained the same zzso to before zzso while increased zzso in zzso areas was zzso Furthermore, there was a reduction in subjects' zzso voluntary contraction force, accompanied by a decrease in zzso of the supplementary motor area zzso These results suggest that especially the activity in the zzso and frontal areas is affected by motor zzso
