The zzso of generalized spike wave zzso zzso is not completely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in the generation of zzso yet the specific role of each structure remains to be zzso In six children with idiopathic generalized zzso zzso we performed combined zzso to identify zzso changes in blood oxygen zzso zzso signal in the zzso zzso In all patients, zzso analysis demonstrated zzso signal changes that preceded the zzso An increase in zzso signal in the zzso zzso started 6 s before the onset of the zzso zzso in cortical zzso signal were mainly found in zzso areas and zzso starting 6 to 3 s before the zzso All patients showed a decrease in zzso signal in the head of the zzso nucleus with a variable zzso The zzso pattern of zzso signal changes suggests that zzso on the cortical surface is preceded by a sequence of zzso events in the zzso zzso zzso 6 s before the zzso the zzso shows an increase in zzso activity along with regional decreases in cortical zzso These changes in zzso activity are followed by a zzso of the zzso zzso These early changes in zzso signal may reflect changes in zzso activity that contribute to the generation of zzso and may contribute to the transition from a normal to a generalized zzso pattern of zzso zzso Our preliminary findings warrant further studies on a larger number of patients to explore the influence of age, medication and type of zzso zzso
