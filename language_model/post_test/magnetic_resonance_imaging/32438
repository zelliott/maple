To determine observer performance in the detection of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso images of the brain and to assess the dependence of observer performance on zzso size, zzso location, pulse zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso 

This zzso protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and previously acquired MR data from a healthy volunteer and a patient with zzso were used to derive zzso zzso with waiver of informed zzso zzso maps and image simulator software were used to generate 320 phantom brain images with simulated zzso and zzso zzso zzso Images were displayed with zzso or zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso Four readers independently evaluated the images, rating zzso on a zzso certainty zzso Observer performance was measured by using the area under the alternative zzso receiver operating characteristic curve zzso and significance was determined with the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso scores were significantly better for zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but were similar for zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scores for zzso deep white matter, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso MR zzso zzso scores were significantly higher than zzso scores for cortical zzso Linear correlation was found between zzso and zzso size zzso zzso zzso 

zzso performance was better with zzso imaging than with zzso MR zzso zzso performance was moderate with both zzso zzso did better with zzso imaging in the detection of cortical zzso and performance improved with increasing zzso zzso
