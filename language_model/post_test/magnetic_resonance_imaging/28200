Recent improvements in magnetic resonance imaging techniques now allow the developing brain to be zzso in sufficient detail to perform zzso zzso zzso In this study we compared the cortical zzso in six children with zzso and four with zzso zzso These two syndromes are of special interest because, although they are both caused by deletions in the same region of zzso 15, zzso children are far more severely affected, and do not zzso We measured the length of the banks of the zzso zzso in a zzso series of thin zzso zzso zzso children had a significantly larger proportion zzso of anomalous fissures than the zzso children zzso zzso cortical growth could result from zzso expression and recognition of zzso involved in zzso guidance, target recognition, and zzso We zzso that zzso of long projection zzso may be related to the zzso zzso anomalies and the language disorder in zzso zzso
