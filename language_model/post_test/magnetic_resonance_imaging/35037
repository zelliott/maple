zzso magnetic resonance zzso has excellent capabilities to assess zzso zzso zzso Current clinical scenarios warrant routine evaluation of zzso zzso function for complete zzso especially in zzso heart failure zzso To our knowledge, no systematic assessment of zzso function over a range of zzso has been performed using zzso 

Left zzso zzso function was assessed in 31 subjects (10 zzso who underwent zzso and compared with zzso zzso zzso evaluation of zzso valve zzso and pulmonary vein zzso blood zzso Blood flow in the zzso and zzso were successfully zzso by zzso for all cases zzso while zzso evaluated flow in all zzso zzso but only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso flow zzso and zzso measured by zzso correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but demonstrated a systematic zzso by zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso ratio and zzso time zzso calculated from each zzso showed excellent agreement zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso When assessing zzso using zzso zzso correctly identified patients as having normal or abnormal inflow zzso 

We have shown that there is zzso between zzso and zzso for the assessment of zzso inflow over a wide range of conditions, including normal, impaired relaxation and zzso There is excellent agreement of quantitative zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso blood flow assessment by zzso can be performed in a single zzso with times ranging from 20 zzso to 3 zzso and we show that there is good indication for applying zzso to assess zzso conditions, either as an zzso test when evaluating zzso function, or even as a primary test when zzso data cannot be zzso
