Response conflict and random response selection have both been associated with zzso on the zzso frontal zzso Random response selection was typically studied using a zzso zzso zzso in which subjects have to select between equally legitimate responses which are in competition with each zzso zzso one interpretation is that the generation of spontaneous actions is merely a special case of the induction of response zzso It has been reported that the generation of spontaneous actions is tightly associated with activity in the zzso motor area zzso Most studies of response conflict, on the other hand, suggest that zzso in a different and more zzso area, the anterior cingulate, reflect response zzso Nonetheless, contradictory results have also been zzso To clarify this issue, in this experiment, we have put together a version of the zzso zzso task and a free selection task to allow for a direct zzso We confirmed our hypothesis that free selection is associated with the zzso whereas response conflict is associated in the anterior zzso The two clusters of zzso do not zzso and the zzso of them were about 30 zzso zzso We conclude that the activity in the zzso is related to the zzso generation of action rather than response zzso
