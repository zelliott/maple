As an attempt to better understand the zzso basis for the previously reported increases in zzso metabolism in the visual zzso of zzso blind subjects, cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption and zzso zzso were investigated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out in three subjects who became blind early in life and in three zzso blindfolded zzso Regional analysis of cerebral blood flow, zzso rates for oxygen and zzso zzso revealed that these parameters were relatively higher in the visual zzso in case of early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were slight differences, albeit statistically not zzso between early blind and control subjects in terms of zzso zzso zzso The relatively preserved zzso in the visual areas of blind subjects points to the lack of variation in the yield of zzso zzso in this zzso Those observations suggest that the high level of energy metabolism disclosed in early blind visual zzso is related to neural zzso
