To describe the zzso anatomy of the zzso zzso mechanism relevant to magnetic resonance imaging zzso and ultrasound zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso sections of female zzso were reviewed from six zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso Fetal anatomy was studied in zzso zzso sections from 19 and 26 zzso zzso Images of the zzso zzso were obtained by zzso in six and by ultrasound using an zzso technique in 12 zzso zzso 

The internal zzso zzso is clearly visible in zzso sections central to the external zzso and is visible in zzso and ultrasound zzso The external zzso zzso can be subdivided into a subcutaneous and a deep zzso On zzso sections and on zzso the subcutaneous part shows as two parallel muscle strips in the zzso zzso the deep portion presents with a characteristic zzso form in the section perpendicular to the axis of the zzso zzso The zzso muscle and the external zzso zzso form a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso muscle can be identified by its fiber orientation in zzso sections but is not clearly visible in imaging zzso 

This information should make it possible to identify accurately zzso zzso anatomy in two-dimensional zzso images of the zzso zzso
