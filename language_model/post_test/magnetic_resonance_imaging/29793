We applied zzso fluid dynamics zzso analysis to assess zzso digital zzso zzso findings in a patient with a giant zzso aneurysm to simulate and compare the consequences of left and right zzso artery zzso The balloon zzso test suggested that zzso of the right zzso artery is the better way to treat this patient's aneurysm from the point of view of zzso zzso and isolation from the zzso The computer simulation supported this conclusion, at the same time indicating that from the point of view of pressure distribution on the wall of the aneurysm, the right zzso zzso may be also accompanied by an zzso zzso A zzso area on the aneurysm wall in zzso was zzso This high pressure potentially could lead to subsequent zzso growth, which indeed occurred, as was revealed by a follow-up examination 6 months zzso This study is a good example of possible future applications of zzso in patients with cerebrovascular disease before therapeutic zzso
