zzso zzso refers to the sense of what one knows and is a component of the human zzso zzso We investigated the neural zzso of the zzso induced by zzso associations using the zzso zzso Data were gathered using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We analyzed the zzso data with zzso analyses of six zzso ratings while zzso for the effects of unbalanced response zzso among trials zzso duration zzso zzso zzso showing a significant linear relationships with the zzso ratings zzso zzso were the bilateral zzso zzso and anterior prefrontal zzso the zzso frontal zzso the zzso surface zzso the left zzso zzso the bilateral superior zzso and nearby zzso the right anterior zzso zzso and the bilateral zzso zzso Most of the active areas in the prefrontal regions were common to those found in our previous zzso studies of general knowledge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso 36, zzso However, in this study, we found robust zzso of the zzso regions near to the regions that were related to the zzso information processing of face images or semantic information processing of the zzso zzso Those results suggest that the information related to the zzso visual features of a face, which was represented in the zzso cortex, was activated by the zzso signal from the prefrontal cortex, and that this cooperation between the zzso and prefrontal zzso may contribute to the zzso
