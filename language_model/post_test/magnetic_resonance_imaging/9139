zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with thin corpus zzso zzso is genetically zzso and approximately zzso of patients carry zzso in either of the zzso or zzso zzso Disease onset is during the first three decades of life with zzso zzso and mental zzso zzso zzso and zzso may zzso zzso syndrome is characterized by central retinal zzso in addition to zzso and the disease is associated with zzso in the zzso zzso We identified five patients in four unrelated zzso with zzso zzso and mental zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed zzso zzso elsewhere in the brain and increased zzso signal intensity in the zzso white zzso zzso from the four zzso were screened for zzso in the zzso zzso All patients were found zzso or compound zzso for zzso zzso zzso of which four are reported for the first zzso zzso investigations revealed that the four index cases have central retinal zzso consistent with zzso zzso PET examinations with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed in two patients with zzso zzso We observed a reduced zzso zzso in the zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso indicating zzso loss, and an increased zzso binding in the zzso and zzso which suggests zzso From our results we extend the zzso associated zzso to comprise also zzso syndrome, previously found to be associated with zzso in the zzso zzso We anticipate that zzso of the central zzso is a common and previously zzso feature in zzso related zzso
