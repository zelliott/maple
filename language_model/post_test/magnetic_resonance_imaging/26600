zzso organization is known to be a robust and consistent network architecture, and is a hallmark of the structurally and functionally connected human zzso However, it remains unknown if the same organization is present in directed influence brain networks whose connectivity is zzso by the transfer of information from one zzso to zzso Here, we aimed to reveal the network architecture of the directed influence brain network using zzso zzso causality analysis and graph theory on zzso zzso zzso We found that some regions acted as pivotal zzso either being influenced by or influencing other regions, and thus could be considered as information convergence zzso In addition, we observed that an zzso truncated power law fits the zzso distribution for the degree of total incoming and outgoing zzso Furthermore, we also found that this directed network has a modular zzso More importantly, according to our data, we suggest that the human brain directed influence network could have a prominent zzso zzso zzso
