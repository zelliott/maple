the zzso profiles of the effects of zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration were investigated in the canine zzso zzso zzso zzso 

cerebral zzso was induced using the zzso model in seven female zzso On day 7, zzso zzso of 15 zzso zzso in zzso solution was injected into the zzso zzso zzso was performed on day 1 zzso zzso and before and 1, 3, and 6 h after the zzso injection on day zzso zzso zzso was measured at the same zzso 

the diameters of the zzso artery zzso zzso artery zzso and superior zzso artery zzso before the zzso injection on day 7 were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso compared with the baseline diameters on day zzso The BA diameters at 1 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 h zzso zzso zzso zzso the VA diameter at 1 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso diameter at 3 h zzso zzso zzso zzso after the injection were significantly increased zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso at 1 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 h zzso zzso zzso zzso after the injection compared with the baseline value zzso zzso zzso zzso 

the zzso effect of zzso zzso solution injection on the zzso artery depends on maintenance of the optimal zzso zzso zzso
