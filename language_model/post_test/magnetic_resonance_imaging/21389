The aim of this prospective study was to compare the painful zzso gliding limitation of the zzso zzso zzso during dynamic zzso the features of magnetic resonance zzso zzso and the maximum zzso injection volume to predict decreased joint capacity of the shoulder zzso 

Between January 2003 and August 2011, 67 patients zzso underwent zzso including dynamic examination and zzso zzso and zzso injection of contrast medium was performed before zzso and each zzso was compared with injected contrast volume, which was assumed as the maximum joint capacity and zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso were revealed as zzso and 20 patients zzso were revealed as zzso by dynamic zzso zzso correlation zzso between zzso and the injection volume was zzso zzso The value between zzso and zzso features was zzso zzso The mean injected volume of the zzso zzso and negative group zzso was significantly different zzso 

zzso at zzso correlated well with zzso features and the maximum zzso injection zzso This sign could predict the decreased capacity of the shoulder joint, an important feature of adhesive zzso and increase the usefulness of dynamic zzso 

zzso Dynamic ultrasound is increasingly used in the evaluation of the zzso zzso This can assess zzso gliding limitation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared zzso zzso to the maximum volume of zzso zzso zzso Dynamic zzso findings correlated well with MR zzso features of adhesive zzso
