We describe the early manifestation and sequential assessment of the central and peripheral nervous system in a Japanese girl with zzso zzso muscular zzso She showed severe zzso zzso zzso and suffered mild respiratory failure zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated to zzso zzso The muscle biopsy showed zzso changes with negative expression of zzso zzso zzso thereby confirming zzso zzso muscular zzso Her motor milestones were severely delayed, but she could sit without support at the age of 3 zzso After 3 years, her motor ability deteriorated and by the age of 5 years, she could not sit and control her zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso at 2 months of age revealed patterns that were appropriate for her zzso At 1 year of age, the zzso weighted images showed diffuse high signal zzso throughout the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso white matter of the frontal and zzso zzso while the U zzso the corpus zzso and the internal capsule were zzso At the age of 7 years, these white matter abnormalities zzso MR zzso zzso revealed normal values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios as well as slightly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motor nerve zzso zzso zzso and compound muscle action potential zzso of the median nerve were in the normal range at the age of 2 zzso After the child reached 1 year of age, the zzso and zzso lagged behind those of healthy controlled zzso The sensory nerve zzso zzso of the median nerve demonstrated a mild delay at the age of 15 zzso It improved to normal range at the age of 6 years but decreased at 7 years of zzso These sequential findings suggest not only that muscular zzso and zzso had occurred but also that various other factors, including zzso and the zzso system, may influence the pathology of zzso
