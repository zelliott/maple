Using functional zzso zzso we investigated 13 upper limb amputees with phantom limb pain zzso during hand and lip movement, before and after intensive zzso training in mental zzso Prior to training, zzso zzso during lip purse showed evidence of cortical reorganization of motor zzso and zzso zzso zzso expanding from lip area to hand area, which correlated with pain zzso In addition, during imagined movement of the phantom hand, and executed movement of the intact hand, group maps demonstrated zzso not only in bilateral zzso and zzso hand area, but also lip area, showing a zzso process of zzso In healthy participants, zzso during lip purse and imagined and executed movement of the zzso hand was confined to the respective cortical representation areas zzso Following training, patients reported a significant reduction in intensity and zzso of constant pain and zzso with a corresponding elimination of cortical zzso Post hoc analyses showed that intensity of constant pain, but not zzso correlated with reduction in cortical zzso The results of this study add to our current understanding of the zzso of zzso underlining the zzso of zzso changes in this patient population while offering a novel, simple method of pain zzso
