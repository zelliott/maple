The aims of this study were to assess the utility of zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso in the differential diagnosis of brain zzso and to zzso the relationship between zzso zzso zzso and degree of zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso Early (15 zzso and delayed (3 zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso were performed before and after zzso enhancement in 101 (41 zzso and 60 zzso zzso brain zzso The zzso zzso ratio zzso brain count zzso for both the early and delayed zzso studies and the retention index (the ratio of delayed to early zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were separated from benign zzso with zzso accuracy based on the assumption that zzso with a zzso retention index zzso zzso or no abnormal zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso were differentiated from other benign zzso by their characteristic pattern on zzso The degree of zzso of the zzso on zzso was zzso with the early zzso zzso ratio for most zzso zzso However, zzso and cavernous zzso showed a low zzso zzso ratio in spite of a high degree of zzso on zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso provides additional information that helps in the differential diagnosis of brain zzso
