zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is commonly applied to study the neural zzso of language in clinical research and for zzso zzso zzso language mapping is used to assess language zzso or determine zzso dominance, and to zzso regions of the brain involved in zzso zzso zzso has been introduced in the zzso Unit at zzso zzso to contribute to the current functional mapping procedures used in zzso zzso 

In this paper we describe the language zzso used in these routine studies as well as the results from 22 consecutive zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed to assess the reliability of zzso patterns generated by two language mapping zzso namely a verb generation task and passive listening zzso zzso from a zzso task are also zzso 

The zzso generate reliable and robust signal changes, enabling both the zzso of language and zzso of expressive and receptive language zzso 

The zzso results are meaningful at the group and individual level and can be recommended for language mapping in zzso zzso
