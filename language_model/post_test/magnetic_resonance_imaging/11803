Three zzso MR zzso zzso can detect tumor extension more accurately than zzso or zzso There are two shrinkage patterns observed by zzso after zzso zzso zzso shrinkage is a good indication for breast zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso pattern was represent zzso zzso zzso we developed zzso guided mapping to aid zzso for tumors showing a zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients consisting of 8 stage II zzso zzso zzso zzso cases and 7 stage zzso cases aged 39 to 61 years zzso zzso zzso were treated with AT zzso chemotherapy with the aim of performing breast zzso zzso All patients were examined by zzso before and after zzso zzso Breast zzso surgery indications were determined by tumor volume reduction and shrinkage patterns on zzso zzso position mapping using zzso was performed for zzso type zzso zzso was simultaneously performed for one case with bilateral breast zzso 

Breast zzso surgery was performed for 13 of the 15 zzso One case underwent zzso and mastectomy because of a positive zzso One case had microscopically positive margin and received boost zzso zzso 11 of 15 cases zzso underwent zzso and achieved negative margins under zzso zzso PET scanning can detect residual tumor and zzso zzso but it is not suitable for mapping because of its spatial zzso 

zzso is a useful zzso to select appropriate cases for breast zzso surgery after zzso zzso zzso can also detect residual tumor or zzso zzso but it may not be suitable for zzso Because both examinations have potential, further evaluation of their clinical efficacy is zzso
