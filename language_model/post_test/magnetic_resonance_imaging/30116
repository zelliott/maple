The purpose of our study was to evaluate the utility of zzso zzso of the lung for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the usual and zzso types of zzso zzso 

The subjects were 26 patients (10 men, 16 zzso mean age, 57 zzso 9 zzso years; 16 with zzso zzso zzso 10 with usual zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso of the lung and surgical zzso A total of 54 biopsy sites were classified zzso into two groups: inflammation zzso and zzso zzso After a zzso zzso black blood zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso was performed with a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso images with zzso slice zzso before and 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after zzso contrast zzso The zzso test was used to compare differences in signal intensity on zzso zzso black blood zzso MR images and visually assessed enhancement patterns at dynamic zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso specimens were obtained from zzso (17 of zzso of the biopsy zzso zzso biopsy sites had an early enhancement pattern zzso 14 of 17 sites, p zzso zzso on dynamic studies and high signal intensity zzso nine of 17 sites, p zzso zzso on zzso zzso black blood zzso zzso 

zzso dynamic enhancement studies with a zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso black blood zzso images on zzso zzso appear to be useful for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
