zzso in executive functioning have been described as a core feature of schizophrenia and have been linked to patterns of zzso brain zzso To date, such zzso relationships have not been explored in a clinically defined zzso mental state zzso for psychosis using zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso zzso in 40 zzso and 30 matched healthy control zzso individuals to investigate whether gray and white matter volumes zzso correlated with the performance in the zzso Test B zzso an established measure of executive zzso and zzso were zzso linked to the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso found to be associated with zzso in the zzso during the first analysis zzso We found the zzso subjects to be specifically impaired in their zzso performance versus zzso zzso associations involving the insular zzso were observed in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations in the zzso the zzso the zzso white matter were detected in the zzso but not the HC zzso The zzso was linked to the zzso zzso in zzso whereas the connectivity pattern in the zzso involved the left zzso and zzso prefrontal cortex, the zzso the right zzso and extended portions of the zzso white zzso These findings suggest that executive deficits are already present in the zzso for psychosis and may be zzso by structurally altered networks of interconnected cortical and zzso brain regions in line with the zzso hypothesis of zzso
