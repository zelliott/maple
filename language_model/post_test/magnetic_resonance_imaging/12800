The goal in this study was to highlight the potential of currently available imaging techniques for surgical planning of procedures in and around the zzso zzso 

The authors review traditional and newer imaging techniques as applied to zzso zzso Today MR imaging techniques play a zzso zzso The various applications of functional techniques such as diffusion zzso diffusion zzso zzso and functional MR imaging methods are zzso 

In addition to the high-resolution studies of anatomy that can be acquired, especially at higher field strengths zzso 3 zzso MR imaging now also offers the possibility of acquiring functional, zzso zzso and molecular information on normal and pathological brain zzso 

The knowledge obtained using the various imaging techniques contributes substantially to understanding the disease processes in a way that drastically improves surgical zzso
