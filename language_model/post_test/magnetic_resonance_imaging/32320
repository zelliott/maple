zzso of the shoulder has been found to be highly sensitive and specific for detection of zzso zzso zzso tears at zzso or lower field strength compared with zzso zzso of the shoulder at zzso T has not been specifically zzso This study zzso the sensitivity and specificity of zzso at zzso T for zzso zzso tears compared with zzso 

Two experienced musculoskeletal zzso zzso reviewed MR images of the shoulder in 150 consecutive patients who had subsequent zzso All patients had zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso The zzso interpreted the MR images by consensus without knowledge of the zzso zzso zzso were interpreted for zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso zzso zzso tears were seen on zzso the zzso noted whether the zzso tear was zzso or zzso in zzso The zzso also separated the zzso zzso tears into small zzso 1 zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and large zzso 1 zzso zzso from the zzso zzso All 150 patients went on to zzso After consensus review of the MR images, zzso results were compared with consensus MR zzso 

zzso of the 150 patients had zzso zzso zzso tears at zzso Twenty-six of the 150 patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these 26 zzso tears were along the zzso surface and nine were along the zzso zzso zzso of 98 zzso tears seen at zzso were seen on consensus zzso zzso All 26 zzso tears seen at zzso were seen at consensus MR zzso however, two of the zzso zzso surface tears seen at zzso were interpreted as zzso tears on consensus zzso zzso zzso of the 98 zzso zzso zzso tears were small tears zzso 1 zzso zzso from the zzso zzso on zzso Two of these 28 small tears seen on zzso were not seen on consensus zzso zzso Twenty-six patients had intact zzso zzso on both retrospective consensus zzso interpretation and at zzso 

zzso of the shoulder at zzso T is highly sensitive and specific compared with zzso in the detection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
