The authors examined the magnetic resonance zzso appearance of zzso zzso to determine if this zzso benign zzso could be distinguished from zzso of the zzso zzso MR images in 10 patients with zzso proved zzso zzso were zzso zzso The signal intensity of zzso zzso on short repetition time zzso images was zzso to slightly zzso to muscle in all 10 zzso zzso zzso had intermediate signal intensity on the long zzso time zzso zzso The tumors were zzso or slightly zzso to fat on long zzso TE zzso In the seven patients who received zzso zzso all zzso zzso showed solid zzso zzso A review of eight zzso zzso showed no distinctive signal intensity or enhancement characteristics to help differentiate zzso zzso from various zzso zzso The authors conclude that there is no signature MR appearance for the benign zzso zzso The main utility of MR imaging is in defining the extent of the zzso
