The purpose of this case presentation is to demonstrate zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso as a cause of traumatic zzso inversion zzso In a 42-year-old woman, severe pain, zzso and zzso over the zzso aspect of her left ankle developed after she twisted it while playing zzso zzso inversion weakness developed zzso zzso The strength of all other muscle groups of the lower zzso was zzso Her pin and light touch sensation were normal in the left lower zzso Deep zzso zzso were equal and active at both knees and zzso A magnetic resonance image of the left leg, ankle, and foot performed 1 month after injury demonstrated an intact zzso zzso zzso behind the zzso zzso and zzso increased signal intensity in the zzso on the zzso image consistent with zzso On zzso testing, there were continuous zzso and positive sharp wave zzso in every site tested in the zzso without any voluntary motor unit zzso The left zzso zzso left zzso and zzso zzso muscles were zzso In conclusion, combined magnetic resonance imaging and zzso studies supported zzso of the zzso as the cause of zzso inversion zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso
