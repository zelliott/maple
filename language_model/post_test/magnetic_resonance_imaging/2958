zzso expansion starts within hours to days after zzso zzso zzso Previous zzso and left zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso inhibitor therapy limits left zzso zzso particularly in patients with anterior wall acute zzso zzso zzso or impaired left zzso zzso zzso patients with an acute zzso zzso were zzso within 24 hours of symptom onset to intravenous zzso (1 zzso or zzso Patients were then given corresponding oral therapy and followed for 1 zzso zzso and zzso gated blood pool scans were obtained in 32 patients to evaluate changes in cardiac volumes and ejection zzso zzso patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month to evaluate left zzso zzso zzso Blood pressure decreased at 6 hours but returned to baseline in both groups after 1 month of zzso The change in cardiac volumes from baseline to 1 month differed between the zzso zzso volume zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso volume zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso zzso 9 zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso 7 zzso groups zzso zzso zzso vs zzso Global and zzso zone ejection zzso improved significantly at 1 month in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and 19 zzso zzso zzso but did not change over 1 month in the zzso zzso zzso segment length and zzso expansion index by magnetic resonance imaging were significantly less in those treated with zzso suggesting less zzso expansion in this zzso Thus, early administration of zzso to patients presenting with a first zzso zzso prevents cardiac zzso and zzso zzso
