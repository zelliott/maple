The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging zzso characteristics of zzso zzso in patients who had undergone zzso of primary head and neck zzso with zzso zzso 

MR examinations obtained from 25 patients who had undergone zzso and zzso zzso surgery for zzso were zzso zzso zzso recurrence was confirmed by biopsy in 22 patients, and clinically in 3 zzso The features of the zzso zzso in the scars were zzso 

zzso patients had a locally zzso mass, while 4 had a locally zzso mass in addition to regional zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were localized in the recipient zzso beds, near the zzso zzso In 9 of 25 zzso patients, the zzso zzso extended zzso either directly, or through the zzso at the skull zzso 

zzso recurrence after zzso reconstruction most often occurred at or near the zzso zzso zzso is useful for detection of recurrence after zzso zzso surgery in patients with head and neck zzso
