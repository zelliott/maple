Recent studies observed an association between the structural integrity of the zzso structure and the manifestations of clinically significant psychotic symptoms in participants at high risk for zzso The present study sought to investigate the zzso trajectory of the zzso volume and its zzso among a sample of participants affected by zzso deletion syndrome zzso a zzso disorder associated with elevated risk for zzso We specifically investigated possible correlations between zzso volumes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the manifestation of positive psychotic symptoms zzso and zzso Regional zzso volumes were measured twice with cerebral zzso obtained at zzso intervals in 30 healthy participants and 31 zzso zzso zzso carriers aged 6 to zzso We examined potential associations between psychotic symptom manifestations and zzso parameters at both time zzso We found a zzso zzso significant reduction in zzso volume among patients with zzso compared to zzso No significant group by time interaction for the total or the zzso volumes were zzso In patients, larger zzso head at baseline was associated with the presence of hallucinations at zzso We first discuss the reduced zzso body finding in light of potentially abnormal zzso zzso We further discuss the association between baseline zzso head volume in participants with zzso as a possible marker related to the later unfolding of psychotic zzso
