A retrospective study of zzso artery injury diagnosed during the last 6 years in our zzso 

To determine the clinical and zzso features of zzso artery zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso artery associated with cervical spine fracture is uncommon and can cause serious and even fatal zzso deficit due to back lifting and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso are extremely helpful in the examination of acute injuries of the cervical zzso 

zzso resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso were performed at the time of zzso 

The authors reviewed six patients with cervical spine fractures who were diagnosed with a unilateral zzso of the zzso artery by means of magnetic resonance zzso resonance zzso One patient had signs of zzso zzso and another with complete zzso zzso had zzso and back lifting zzso zzso anterior spinal fusion was performed in five patients, and one was treated by traction and zzso At the time of zzso five patients had no zzso symptoms, and the patient who experienced zzso territory zzso showed no progression of the zzso zzso 

zzso artery injury should be suspected in cervical trauma patients with facet joint dislocation or zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso resonance zzso is a helpful test to rule out vascular zzso zzso artery injury affects the zzso segment at the same level as the cervical zzso This is a retrospective review that did not permit drawing conclusions about the effects of early surgical stabilization in the treatment of cervical spine injuries with associated zzso artery zzso however, surgical stabilization may avoid propagation and zzso of the zzso located at the site of the zzso
