The aim of this study was to determine the value of zzso imaging zzso of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging for the evaluation of focal zzso tumors compared with zzso imaging and early dynamic phase zzso The MR images were obtained in 48 patients with 98 focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging obtained before and 30, 60, and 1 h after administration of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Each image set was analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhancement pattern on zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso contrast during the dynamic phase imaging was observed compared with zzso zzso The zzso showed a homogeneous enhancement of liver zzso and distinctive enhancement features of focal liver zzso zzso zzso showed a target shaped enhancement, and zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso or homogeneous enhancement zzso The zzso showed better performance for the detection of zzso than other images by increasing zzso zzso ( zzso The absolute zzso of zzso measured from periphery of the tumors on zzso was greater than zzso and zzso phase imaging ( zzso The zzso during both dynamic and delayed zzso provides valuable information for the characterization of focal liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso contributed to the improved detection of liver zzso compared to zzso and early dynamic zzso
