Increased signal intensity zzso on zzso inversion recovery zzso magnetic resonance zzso images in the zzso cavity is sometimes observed after partial zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso cavity of 44 high-grade zzso was zzso zzso Twelve of 35 patients with progressive disease zzso showed zzso increase in the zzso zzso and zzso increase preceded zzso in 6 of these 12 zzso None of nine patients without zzso showed zzso increase during the follow-up zzso The analysis of zzso on zzso images in the zzso cavity had a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of zzso Higher sensitivity was found in grade IV tumors than in grade III zzso zzso increase is thus considered as a potent highly specific hallmark for subsequent or zzso tumor zzso which is clinically useful since MR imaging is easily performed during routine clinical zzso
