This review comprises an overview of the current knowledge on experimental partial unilateral zzso obstruction zzso and a summary of our latest original experimental zzso studies in zzso Neonatal zzso is the type of obstruction that is most often encountered in pediatric clinical zzso However, the zzso of zzso is still incompletely zzso Most of our knowledge on zzso has been derived from experimental studies in a variety of animal zzso Although progress has been made, the natural history of zzso zzso is still incompletely zzso The effects on kidney functions of long-term urinary tract zzso especially zzso have been less zzso zzso Recently, we created models with mild and severe zzso in young rats by embedding the upper one fourth or the upper two thirds of the left zzso into the zzso muscle, zzso zzso the technique was used to create mild and severe zzso in newborn rats and magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that both mild and severe obstruction caused a zzso decrease in zzso blood zzso zzso increase in total kidney volume and zzso vein blood flow in zzso zzso zzso was not zzso when functional deterioration in the partially zzso zzso was zzso Finally, we investigated the dynamic changes in zzso relative signal intensity zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso using magnetic resonance imaging in rats with zzso complete unilateral zzso obstruction and zzso zzso The results showed that changes in zzso zzso are compatible with the known zzso and anatomical changes in zzso in response to zzso obstruction and useful for distinguishing an zzso from a zzso collecting system and also for zzso a partially zzso from a completely zzso collecting zzso
