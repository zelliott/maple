We examined dynamic interactions between zzso and zzso during zzso and feedback processing zzso of zzso First, we zzso zzso processing from feedback processing using zzso intervals of time between response and feedback to examine how each recruits the four primary zzso zzso zzso executive, zzso and zzso Second, we examined dynamic interactions within and between zzso zzso using zzso causality zzso On each trial, subjects viewed one of six abstract visual zzso pressed a button indicating category membership, and then received feedback as to whether the decision was right or zzso zzso processing was associated with greater activity in the visual loop, whereas feedback processing resulted in activity in the executive loop that was sensitive to feedback zzso zzso causality mapping showed patterns of directed influence within zzso zzso and between zzso from the motor to the executive, to the zzso and finally to the motivational zzso These patterns of interaction are consistent with functional integration of motor processing in the motor loop with feedback processing in the executive loop and maintenance of zzso history for future responses in the motivational zzso
