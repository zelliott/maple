Here, we used diffusion zzso imaging zzso and showed that the strength of an zzso zzso identified between the zzso and prefrontal zzso predicted individual differences in trait zzso A functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso functional zzso that has been shown to produce reliable zzso zzso was collected in 20 zzso healthy zzso zzso zzso analyses using this zzso zzso zzso as a zzso were performed on fractional zzso images derived from zzso This analysis identified a white matter zzso between the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso Individual differences in the structural integrity of this putative zzso zzso were zzso correlated with trait anxiety levels zzso higher zzso strength predicted lower zzso More generally, this study illustrates a strategy for combining zzso and zzso to identify individual differences in structural pathways that predict behavioral zzso
