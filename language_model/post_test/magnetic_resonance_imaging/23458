Fast zzso zzso zzso allows switching of the magnetic field during an imaging zzso zzso takes advantage of the zzso zzso properties of contrast agents to improve contrast, thus enabling more sensitive detection of the zzso A new contrast agent designed specifically for use with zzso was zzso using both a zzso zzso system and a 3 T Philips clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained using a commercial zzso which showed large changes in relaxation rate between zzso A model of zzso zzso was used to predict optimum evolution times for the maximum zzso contrast between samples at each zzso Images were processed and zzso to create maps of zzso values using a set of images at each zzso The zzso maps produced at two different fields were then zzso from each other in order to create a map of zzso in which zzso values depend on the change in zzso of the sample between the two zzso The zzso properties of the agent resulted in higher contrast in a zzso image compared with a standard zzso zzso
