The zzso of mismatch zzso zzso in schizophrenia is thought to be associated with zzso zzso and cognitive zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the change of the normal functional zzso zzso in schizophrenia by employing the equivalent current zzso zzso model of auditory zzso with individual zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso resulting from auditory stimuli with passive oddball paradigm in a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso and also a group of zzso zzso and zzso normal controls, were recorded by 128 channel zzso The location and power of zzso sources at the peak point were zzso Individual 3-D brain magnetic resonance images zzso were used for realistic head modeling and for source zzso For both groups, the zzso source was determined to be located in the superior zzso zzso zzso However, the normal functional zzso asymmetry of zzso power was significantly altered in the zzso zzso test zzso zzso p zzso zzso Left zzso zzso power and the asymmetry zzso zzso were zzso correlated with the positive scores from Positive and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso especially with the hallucinatory behavior zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso These findings support the deficits in zzso automatic processing of auditory zzso especially in the left hemisphere, and indicate the correlation between positive symptoms, especially auditory zzso and left zzso lobe dysfunction in zzso
