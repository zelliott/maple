We review here those zzso of the cerebral zzso which are most often observed in zzso patients, for which a genetic basis has been zzso or is suspected and give indications for genetic zzso There are three forms of zzso zzso resulting from zzso of known zzso which can be distinguished because of their distinctive imaging zzso They account for about zzso of all zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso of the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso males and zzso band zzso zzso in zzso females are caused by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the coding region of zzso were found in all reported zzso and in most sporadic female patients with zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso genes have been observed in some of the rare male patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso has been associated with zzso of the zzso zzso With few exceptions, children with zzso have severe zzso delay and infantile spasms early in zzso Patients with zzso have a mild to severe mental zzso with zzso of variable severity and zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of typical zzso with focal zzso in females and prenatal zzso in zzso About zzso of patients have focal zzso zzso A zzso zzso have been reported in some families and in sporadic zzso zzso possibly zzso zzso zzso are likely to be involved in causing zzso zzso to zzso zzso sclerosis zzso is a dominant disorder caused by zzso in at lest two zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cases are zzso Most patients with zzso have zzso zzso spasms are a frequent early manifestation of zzso zzso zzso zzso has a wide zzso spectrum, including focal zzso in most zzso zzso occurrence is zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been reported in some zzso However, at present, there is no clear indication on the possible pattern of inheritance and on the practical usefulness that zzso detection in an individual with zzso would carry in terms of genetic zzso zzso several syndromes featuring zzso bilateral zzso zzso had familial occurrence on several zzso zzso zzso is zzso including zzso zzso zzso dominant, zzso zzso inheritance and association to zzso zzso FISH analysis for zzso is zzso in all patients with zzso zzso Parents of an affected child with normal zzso should be given up to a zzso recurrence zzso
