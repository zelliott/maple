This zzso study investigates the influence of a rating procedure on zzso signals in common zzso cortical brain zzso zzso and zzso mechanical impact stimuli were applied to the left hand of healthy zzso zzso performed ratings of the perceived intensity during every second stimulation period by operating a visual analogue scale with the right zzso During every other stimulus period the subjects rested zzso zzso and touch stimuli were found to activate the same cortical areas previously defined as the zzso pain zzso General Linear Models were used to calculate contrasts between cortical zzso during the zzso and zzso zzso In most brain regions zzso following pain and touch was stronger during zzso compared to zzso zzso Only the responses in the zzso projection field of the zzso hand following pain were not influenced by the rating zzso Furthermore, zzso in the right and left zzso insular zzso and in the left superior frontal zzso showed an opposite pattern, namely a stronger zzso signal during zzso We zzso zzso zzso areas regularly activated by painful stimuli may also be activated by touch zzso zzso Enhancement of the zzso contrast by a rating procedure is probably an effect of closer stimulus evaluation and attention zzso zzso In contrast to most other cortical regions, the zzso insular cortex, which is crucial for the integration of zzso zzso zzso shows stronger responses in the absence of ratings, which points to a unique role of this region in the processing of zzso zzso
