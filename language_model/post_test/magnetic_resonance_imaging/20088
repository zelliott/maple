The objective of our study was to determine the optimal TE for zzso iron oxide zzso zzso echo zzso zzso for the detection of focal zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso performed on a zzso MR system, were used to evaluate 131 zzso zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso 21 zzso 7 zzso 15 zzso and 13 zzso zzso at four different zzso 9, zzso 18, and zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso ratio zzso was compared among the four zzso sequences by paired zzso zzso tests and among zzso types by an independent samples zzso zzso zzso The zzso test was used to compare the sensitivity for the detection of focal zzso zzso zzso signed rank test was used to compare the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso on zzso images obtained at a TE of zzso milliseconds zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso 24) were significantly zzso zzso zzso higher than those at zzso of 9 (55 zzso 23), 18 (55 zzso zzso and zzso milliseconds zzso zzso zzso The zzso was highest at a TE of zzso milliseconds for zzso zzso and was comparable on images obtained with zzso of 18 and zzso milliseconds for zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a significantly higher zzso than the zzso zzso at a TE of zzso milliseconds zzso zzso zzso The overall sensitivity for zzso detection was not significantly different among the four zzso zzso and the zzso ratings of zzso zzso were comparable for images obtained using zzso of 8, zzso and 18 zzso but the ratings of zzso zzso were significantly lower for images obtained using a TE of zzso milliseconds zzso zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso zzso zzso was highest on images obtained using a TE of zzso zzso but the sensitivity and zzso zzso were comparable at zzso of 9 and 18 zzso The zzso of liver zzso varied according to the zzso potential capability of taking up zzso zzso
