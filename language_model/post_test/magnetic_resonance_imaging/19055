A novel method is presented for acquiring zzso zzso zzso The method zzso zzso inversion zzso followed by a series of zzso zzso zzso is divided into a number of segments equal to the number of zzso zzso segments of zzso are assigned to successive zzso zzso and the order in which the slices are excited is manipulated to ensure that images of each slice have identical contrast and point spread function zzso This method is applied to the zzso experiment, a particular version of the inversion recovery zzso The implications of this acquisition scheme on the zzso are zzso and it is shown that, provided the zzso zzso function does not change sign, a good zzso is zzso For a given maximum number of zzso the total experimental duration depends only on zzso and the number of zzso zzso A method of accelerating the experiment by multiply exciting each slice is zzso An experimental demonstration of the proposed sequences is given by imaging the human head at 3 zzso
