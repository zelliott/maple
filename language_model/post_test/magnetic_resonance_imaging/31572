Several prior imaging studies of healthy adults have correlated volumes of the zzso and zzso with measures of general intelligence zzso with variable zzso In this study, we assessed correlations between volumes of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso scores zzso using a method of image analysis that permits detailed regional mapping of this correlation throughout the surface zzso of these brain zzso We delineated the zzso and zzso in high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the brain from 34 healthy zzso We then correlated zzso with overall volumes and with the surface zzso of each of these zzso zzso volumes correlated significantly and zzso with zzso independently of zzso age, socioeconomic status, and whole brain zzso Left and right zzso volumes correlated respectively with verbal and performance zzso zzso Higher zzso were significantly associated with large inward zzso of the surface of the anterior zzso zzso These findings suggest that a smaller anterior zzso contributes to an increased efficiency of neural processing that zzso overall zzso
