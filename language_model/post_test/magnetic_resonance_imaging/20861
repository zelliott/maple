The aim of this study was to evaluate the serial signal changes in zzso enhancement on zzso zzso zzso acid or zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance imaging and its correlation with clinical zzso 

Under institutional review board approval, zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 77 subjects (21 healthy volunteers and 56 zzso chronic zzso zzso and the signal zzso of the liver and common zzso ducts zzso were measured every 2 minutes up to 50 minutes zzso The associations among zzso and zzso signals, zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity index, and zzso scores were analyzed with zzso correlation and multiple linear zzso zzso The zzso ability of contrast enhancement index zzso of the liver with zzso activity index and zzso scores at different time points were studied using zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso 

Among the clinical zzso body weight and body mass index had the highest negative correlation with zzso enhancement between 2 and 50 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso showed that zzso level, body weight, and body mass index were independent zzso for both mean zzso and zzso signal intensity zzso zzso zzso Patients with more severe zzso or moderate necrosis tended to have lower zzso than other patients zzso The zzso ability of zzso for the best differentiation between no zzso and any zzso zzso zzso 1) was at 10 minutes zzso zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso 

Delayed zzso enhancement with zzso could be possibly used for staging liver zzso zzso enhancement index of the liver at 10 minutes is useful for zzso between no zzso and any degree of zzso in chronic zzso zzso
