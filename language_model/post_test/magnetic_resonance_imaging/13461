A fast imaging technique, missing pulse zzso free zzso zzso is zzso zzso is one of a class of zzso free zzso techniques in which every zzso zzso pulse is zzso zzso has been implemented for the case where every third zzso pulse is zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso echo forms at the time of the missing zzso This echo is less sensitive to field zzso than the zzso echoes used in most fast imaging zzso An zzso expression is obtained for the signal strength as a function of the flip angles zzso 1 and zzso 2, the zzso zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso The expression shows that zzso 1 and zzso 2 provide two degrees of freedom to zzso the zzso ratio and improve tissue zzso Two different cases, zzso 1 zzso zzso 2 and zzso 1 zzso zzso 2, are described to demonstrate the difference in zzso The first case gives a strong signal from spins with short zzso and short zzso while the second case has contrast very similar to a conventional zzso zzso The theoretical expression predicts that the signal consists of multiple components which may be observed zzso by adjusting the zzso zzso
