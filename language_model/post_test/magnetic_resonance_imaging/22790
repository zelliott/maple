To evaluate the potential of a zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition with relaxation zzso sequence in fetal zzso magnetic resonance zzso examinations compared with zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso 

zzso sequence is rapid and provides very heavily zzso zzso zzso fetal zzso MR imaging examinations were performed at zzso weeks using our conventional zzso This included thin zzso zzso zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence and zzso GE zzso zzso zzso images with a zzso MR zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was added to all MR zzso The acquisitions were obtained with the mother zzso The zzso heavily zzso images were compared with zzso sequence images and with zzso imaging in all zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence did not show additional abnormalities compared with the conventional protocol but displayed an overall view of the urinary zzso zzso tract and small zzso It gave information that was highly correlated with zzso imaging, such as abdominal plain films, chest film or zzso The quality of the zzso zzso images was considered as good in 13 cases zzso moderate in 12 cases zzso and poor in two cases zzso 

Although zzso zzso sequence does not show additional abnormalities compared with the conventional zzso it illustrates very nicely zzso zzso such as those in urinary zzso the esophagus and small zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is very rapid (5 zzso to perform, allows fetal zzso and zzso well with zzso zzso
