This article presents zzso evidence bearing on zzso versus zzso theories of zzso zzso Ten participants were scanned at 4 zzso as they covertly generated the past zzso of real and zzso zzso zzso presented zzso Regular past zzso zzso zzso zzso and irregular past zzso zzso took, zzso produced similar patterns of zzso in the zzso zzso lobe in both zzso In contrast, there was greater zzso in left and right inferior frontal zzso for regular past zzso than for irregular past zzso Similar previous results have been taken as evidence for the zzso theory of the past tense zzso & zzso zzso However, additional analyses indicated that zzso that were zzso similar to regulars zzso slept, fled, zzso produced the same level of zzso as did regulars, and significantly more zzso than did zzso that were not zzso similar to regulars zzso took, zzso Thus, zzso patterns were predicted by zzso characteristics of the past tense rather than by the zzso versus exception distinction that is central to the zzso zzso The results are consistent with a constraint satisfaction model in which zzso semantic, and other zzso constraints jointly determine the past tense, with different degrees of involvement for different zzso
