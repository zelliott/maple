zzso reorganization in multiple sclerosis zzso has been recently suggested as an additional potential contributor to the recovery or maintenance of function in the irreversible tissue zzso zzso cortical changes have been demonstrated in all zzso zzso using motor zzso zzso Data from available studies suggest that zzso cortical reorganization in patients with zzso seems to vary across individuals at different stages of zzso zzso reorganization may play a role in limiting the impact of structural tissue damage in zzso patients and, conversely, its progressive exhaustion with disease progression may be one of the factors contributing to the zzso of irreversible zzso The enhancement of any beneficial effects of this cortical zzso plasticity should be considered as a potential target of therapy for zzso
