We asked which brain areas are engaged in the coordination of our hands in zzso object zzso where they cooperate for achieving a common zzso zzso right-handers steered a zzso on a screen to hit successively displayed targets by applying zzso forces and zzso to a rigid zzso In two zzso conditions, the object was held freely in the air and the hands thus generated coupled opposing zzso Yet, depending on the mapping rule linking hand forces and zzso movements, all subjects selected either the left or the right hand as prime zzso In two zzso conditions, the subjects performed the same task with either the left or the right hand operating on a fixed zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging revealed common zzso across all four conditions in a zzso zzso network biased to the left zzso and in bilateral zzso zzso zzso to the notion that zzso wall zzso areas are especially active in complex zzso actions, their zzso depended on acting hand (left, right) rather than on grip type zzso zzso We observed effects of grip type only in the primary zzso zzso zzso In particular, with either hand as prime actor, zzso actions zzso activated zzso of the zzso zzso to the acting zzso A zzso zzso with preference for zzso activity was found only in the left zzso in our right-handed zzso zzso these results indicate a zzso asymmetry for the zzso and that partially different neural populations support the control of zzso versus zzso object zzso
