MR phase contrast zzso zzso imaging is a promising tool for zzso blood flow zzso in zzso PC zzso imaging is, however, susceptible to artifacts that result from the displacement of spins during the finite duration pulse zzso Such displacement artifacts can lead to errors in zzso zzso especially in the presence of zzso and accelerating flows, which are common throughout the cardiovascular zzso By tracking particles (representing zzso through a zzso zzso field, and assuming that spatial and zzso zzso occur at discrete times during the pulse zzso we simulate the separate and combined effects of zzso and acceleration artifacts on PC zzso zzso We zzso both by simulation and MR zzso the errors associated with such artifacts in PC zzso zzso in a representative flow zzso Using example particle zzso we provide a fluid dynamic basis for characteristic zzso image zzso that can arise when imaging complex, zzso relevant zzso
