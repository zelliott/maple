The lattice zzso zzso method is a zzso method based on kinetic theory and statistical zzso The main advantage of the LB method is parallel computation, which increases the speed of zzso In the past decade, LB methods have gradually been introduced for image processing, zzso image zzso However, a major shortcoming of existing LB methods is that they can only be applied to the processing of medical images with intensity zzso In practice, however, many medical images possess intensity zzso In this study, we developed a novel LB method to integrate edge and region information for medical image zzso In contrast to other zzso methods, we added edge information as a relaxing factor and used region information as a source zzso The proposed method zzso the zzso of medical images with intensity zzso and it still allows parallel zzso zzso tests of the proposed method are presented in this zzso
