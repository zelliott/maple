zzso zzso zzso zzso is the active component of zzso zzso injection zzso a new contrast medium for magnetic resonance zzso A high performance liquid zzso zzso method was developed for the simultaneous determination of zzso and its five major zzso in human zzso zzso the zzso products zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding substances obtained after zzso with zinc zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood samples from patients receiving zzso zzso injection were immediately mixed with solid zzso zzso zzso to obtain pH zzso zzso zzso in order to inhibit further in zzso zzso and zzso The plasma thus obtained was zzso prior to zzso zzso The zzso separation was obtained using a zzso zzso with both zzso exchange and zzso functions zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso detection at 310 zzso With an injection volume of 50 zzso the limit of zzso zzso values were zzso zzso for the zzso compounds and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso accuracy of spiked plasma samples was in the range zzso with a precision in the range zzso The best fit zzso zzso were obtained using zzso zzso according to the equation Y zzso A + zzso in the concentration range from zzso to 100 zzso zzso storage of spiked plasma samples for three months at zzso degrees C demonstrated the required stability with recovery values within zzso of zzso and its five zzso
