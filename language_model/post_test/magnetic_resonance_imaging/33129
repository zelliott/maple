In this study, we investigated whether fully zzso zzso with low current density and varying zzso burst impulse train enhances functional recovery and promotes brain zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso Adult rats received zzso of the right middle cerebral artery for zzso One week after zzso zzso were implanted to rats with zzso lasting 2 weeks followed by zzso observation zzso After zzso stimulation and zzso observation period, body weight zzso of the rats in zzso group was higher than that in no stimulation zzso zzso zzso placement test, zzso test and beam walking test demonstrate that zzso significantly enhanced functional zzso zzso study has shown that zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso and suppressed inflammatory response in the zzso zzso zzso also promoted zzso zzso and suppressed inflammatory response in the zzso zzso These results suggest the stimulation protocol is safe, and greatly improves functional recovery and brain zzso in the 4 weeks following 2 weeks zzso
