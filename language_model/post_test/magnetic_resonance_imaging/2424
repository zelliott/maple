To determine the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso zzso to zzso the zzso timing, and prognosis of the cerebral zzso zzso 

Thirty one term zzso with clinical zzso underwent zzso between days zzso zzso zzso zzso and a high field zzso zzso scan on days zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which were repeated at 3 months of zzso zzso investigation zzso as far as possible, infection, zzso and zzso causes as causes of the zzso zzso 

Brain zzso was demonstrated by zzso in zzso of infants and zzso in zzso zzso brain zzso zzso in zzso were associated with high mortality zzso and morbidity zzso whatever the zzso In contrast to a better short term prognosis for zzso with focal zzso where no infants died, zzso had a zzso and the rest were normal at a mean follow up age of 2 1/2 zzso zzso zzso were presumed to have zzso origin in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was considered to be zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso disturbances and cerebral zzso in zzso and unknown in zzso 

zzso detected a remarkably high zzso of brain zzso in zzso zzso Almost half of these were of prenatal origin and zzso may essentially be attributed to hypoxic and/or zzso zzso
