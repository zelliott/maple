White matter zzso zzso are common on brain zzso of the zzso Their size ranges from zzso to early zzso to zzso zzso While this increase in extension is frequently seen as evidence for a zzso of changes, zzso data and clinical follow-up suggest differences in underlying pathology and their zzso 

We tested this hypothesis by exploring the zzso of punctuate and zzso zzso using zzso probability maps zzso generated from zzso scans of 189 participants zzso age zzso zzso in the Austrian Stroke Prevention zzso We zzso zzso according to the zzso by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso early zzso and zzso zzso to run zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso To test alternative zzso we created similar zzso for age and zzso zzso 

We observed significant differences in the spatial distribution of zzso for the two zzso groups zzso zzso zzso were more zzso distributed throughout the cerebral white matter zzso probability approximately zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso probability zzso zzso zzso had greatest likelihood of being found in zzso zzso zzso These differences in distribution could not be explained by differences in age or hypertension only, as both greater age and the diagnosis of hypertension were associated with zzso abutting the zzso zzso 

zzso and early zzso to zzso zzso show distinguishable differences in their spatial distribution within a normal elderly zzso The pattern of zzso zzso is probably a consequence of mixed zzso zzso zzso of the more zzso zzso with zzso watershed areas implies a stronger zzso component in their zzso
