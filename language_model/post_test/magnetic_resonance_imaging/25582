In a retrospective review of 94 consecutive patients with past spinal zzso injury referred for magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the evaluation of new neurological symptoms, 59% were found to have zzso spinal zzso zzso Twelve of these patients underwent surgical zzso zzso half having presented with increased zzso and half with ascent of the neurological zzso All of the operated zzso were greater than 2 zzso in diameter zzso zzso zzso and 4 had areas of signal void indicating turbulent zzso All 12 patients had clinical improvement following zzso The future prospective use of zzso in patients with longstanding spinal zzso injury may prove valuable in the identification of patients with zzso formation, at risk of developing neurological zzso who may benefit from early zzso zzso At present, however, the decision to operate on these patients should be based primarily on clinical zzso
