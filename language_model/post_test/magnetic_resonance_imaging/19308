The studies described here use functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether common or distinct cognitive and/or neural mechanisms are involved in zzso object structure from the different image cues defining an zzso shape, such as zzso zzso and zzso depth zzso We found overlapping zzso in the lateral and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the lateral zzso complex zzso for objects defined by different visual cues zzso zzso photographs and line zzso when each was compared with its own zzso zzso In a second experiment we found a reduced response when objects were zzso independent of whether they appeared in the same or a different format zzso zzso images vs line zzso A third experiment showed that zzso in the zzso was no stronger for three-dimensional shapes defined by contours or zzso depth cues, such as zzso than for two-dimensional shapes, suggesting that these regions are not selectively involved in processing three-dimensional shape zzso These results suggest that common regions in the zzso are involved in zzso and/or representing information about object structure from different image zzso
