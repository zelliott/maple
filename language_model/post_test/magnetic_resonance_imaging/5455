The neural zzso of cognitive control and social processing functions, as well as the characteristic patterns of anomalous brain zzso patterns in psychiatric conditions associated with impairment in these functions, have been well zzso However, these zzso have primarily been examined in zzso The present study used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain areas recruited during a zzso task designed to evaluate responses to both zzso zzso shape) and social zzso zzso target zzso Both shape and face targets activated a similar brain network, including the zzso zzso the anterior and zzso zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso whereas face targets additionally activated the thalamus, zzso and zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to social and zzso target events revealed that a small portion of the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso area zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso activated to face zzso These findings indicate that zzso and social stimuli embedded within a cognitive control task activate overlapping and distinct brain zzso Clinical cognitive zzso research of disorders characterized by cognitive dysfunction and impaired social processing would benefit from the use of tasks that evaluate the combined effects of deficits in these two zzso
