One hundred consecutive patients with zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso fusion and followed up to 16 1/2 years zzso zzso 4 1/2 zzso The mean age at surgery was zzso zzso At the time of zzso 45 patients had died, mostly due to zzso zzso Out of the 100 patients, zzso showed a major improvement and in an additional zzso there was a slight or moderate zzso Some patients with a stable fusion later developed zzso zzso zzso an anterior fusion which in patients with zzso is difficult due to poor bone zzso zzso revealed zzso formation around the zzso peg in many patients, in several to such a degree that zzso zzso was zzso Following the zzso zzso the zzso disappeared or was reduced which may at least partly explain the generally zzso operative outcome following the fixation zzso Early zzso fusion appears to prevent further vertical dislocation or zzso migration of the zzso which is a more severe condition, and does not appear to result in increased zzso of subsequent zzso zzso Such zzso pose a technically difficult problem since the quality of the patients' own bone usually does not permit a common anterior fusion procedure with zzso zzso In such cases with zzso zzso acrylic cement may be used to obtain a zzso zzso
