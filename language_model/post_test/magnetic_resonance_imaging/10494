Performing an accurate zzso of sources of zzso spikes from zzso scalp zzso is of particular interest during the zzso investigation of zzso The purpose of this paper is to study the ability of six distributed source zzso methods to recover extended sources of activated zzso Due to the frequent lack of a gold standard to evaluate source zzso methods, our evaluation was performed in a controlled environment using realistic simulations of zzso zzso zzso involving several anatomical locations with several spatial zzso zzso data were corrupted by zzso zzso zzso zzso involving pairs of sources with the same zzso were also zzso In addition to standard validation criteria zzso zzso distance or mean square zzso we proposed an original criterion dedicated to assess detection zzso based on receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso Six source zzso methods were zzso the minimum norm, the minimum norm weighted by zzso source zzso zzso cortical zzso with or without additional minimum norm zzso and two zzso of the maximum zzso on the mean zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso methods were able to accurately recover sources of different spatial zzso with the exception of sources in zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso sources were generated by those methods, however, whereas methods using the MSP always located very accurately the maximum of activity but not its spatial zzso These findings suggest that one should always take into account the results from different zzso methods when analyzing real zzso zzso
