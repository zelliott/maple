The location of corpus zzso injury was investigated using magnetic resonance imaging in 92 zzso The anatomical relationships in the region around the corpus zzso were also evaluated to clarify involvement in the mechanism of corpus zzso injury in 20 normal zzso zzso in the zzso half of the corpus zzso accounted for zzso of corpus zzso zzso The zzso was increasingly zzso toward the zzso portion of the corpus zzso and the corpus zzso was thinnest at the zzso junction in the normal zzso The mechanism of corpus zzso injury apparently involves the following zzso The zzso half of the zzso is closer to the corpus zzso than the anterior zzso zzso the anterior part of the corpus zzso easily moves with lateral movement of the cerebral zzso and the strain is likely to be concentrated in the zzso half of the corpus zzso because the zzso greatly limits lateral movement of the zzso in the zzso zzso The corpus zzso is easily distorted at the thinnest part of the zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso injury predominantly occurs in the zzso half of the corpus zzso
