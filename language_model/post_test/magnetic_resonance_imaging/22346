A recent human therapeutic trial using zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso was abruptly zzso partly due to safety concerns raised by the finding of zzso zzso in monkeys given high-dose zzso 

zzso resonance images from nine zzso patients participating in this trial were analyzed to determine whether subtle zzso or intensity changes could be detected in the zzso or elsewhere following zzso treatment for over 1 zzso zzso images were compared to a reference standard zzso map constructed by using zzso paired scans from 25 normal zzso In a separate zzso group zzso zzso analysis of the same patient images, zzso matter intensity was compared between zzso and zzso infusion scans using a repeated measures zzso with zzso error threshold of P zzso zzso Two expert readers independently reviewed serial zzso images from all zzso 

zzso There were no significant zzso differences in any of the nine individual zzso patients zzso image zzso zzso there were no significant zzso differences between zzso and zzso scans zzso and zzso there were no signal abnormalities in the zzso detected on the zzso images in zzso patients zzso scan zzso 

In concert with lack of evidence of zzso dysfunction on clinical examination, we find no imaging evidence of zzso injury in human subjects undergoing chronic zzso zzso zzso
