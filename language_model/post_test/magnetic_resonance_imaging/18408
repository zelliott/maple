It is sometimes difficult to differentiate a zzso from an accompanying cholesterol zzso zzso fluid and, especially, zzso zzso This study was designed to assess the reliability with which zzso can be differentiated from such accompanying zzso by zzso MR zzso zzso patients with zzso were studied with magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso had intermediate to high signal zzso similar to those of zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso On zzso images, however, there was marked enhancement of all zzso zzso while the zzso showed no such zzso zzso images distinguished zzso from zzso zzso and permitted determination of the exact extent of the zzso zzso zzso showed high signal zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can, therefore, be distinguished from zzso and zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging is a valuable tool in the evaluation and management of zzso
