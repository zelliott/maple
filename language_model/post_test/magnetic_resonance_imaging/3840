zzso resonance zzso of the liver requires input from a physicist or physician at the time of acquisition to insure proper zzso selection, while in zzso chemical shift imaging, numerous regions of interest must be manually selected in order to ensure analysis of a representative portion of the liver zzso A fully automated technique could improve zzso by selecting representative portions of the liver prior to human zzso Complete volumes from three-dimensional zzso zzso acquisitions with zzso Dixon reconstruction acquired at zzso and 3 T were analyzed in 100 subjects, using an automated liver sampling algorithm, based on ratio pairs calculated from signal intensity image data as zzso and zzso on a zzso zzso Using different zzso variations of the algorithm, the average correct liver volume samples ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The average percentage of sample located within the liver ranged from zzso to zzso whereas the average incorrect volume selected was zzso zzso zzso Average run time was zzso zzso The zzso consistently selected large samples of the zzso zzso with small amounts of erroneous zzso zzso and run times were feasible for execution on an zzso system console during exam zzso
