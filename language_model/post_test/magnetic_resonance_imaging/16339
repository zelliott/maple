The purpose of this study was to introduce newly zzso zzso as an alternative to zzso zzso based particles zzso and thus to launch a new platform for highly zzso zzso cancer therapy and zzso The new material that forms the basis for this article is zzso zzso particles with silver zzso inserted into the zzso zzso zzso zzso the silver doping level, it is possible to control the zzso temperature zzso in the zzso range of interest zzso degrees zzso A new class of zzso based on zzso zzso zzso is zzso New zzso are stable, and their properties were not affected by the typical ambient conditions in the living zzso It is possible to monitor the particle zzso and retention by zzso When these particles are placed into an alternating magnetic field, their temperature increases to the zzso value near zzso and then remains constant if the magnetic field is zzso During the zzso zzso the temperature can be zzso thereby preventing the necrosis of normal zzso A new class of zzso based on zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso particles clearly demonstrated the effect of adjustable zzso temperature necessary for highly zzso cellular zzso The magnetic relaxation properties of the particles are comparable with that of zzso and so we were able to monitor the particle movement and retention by zzso Thus, the new material combines the zzso contrast enhancement capability with targeted zzso zzso
