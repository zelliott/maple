This functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates the effects of nicotine in a cued target detection task when changing cue zzso Fifteen zzso volunteers were studied under zzso and nicotine zzso zzso gum 1 and 2 zzso zzso and zzso cued trials were arranged in blocks with high, middle and low cue zzso Two effects of nicotine were zzso its influence on zzso zzso zzso activity underlying the processing of invalid zzso valid trials zzso zzso zzso and zzso neural activity in the context of low, middle and high zzso value of the cue zzso cue reliability zzso zzso did not affect behavioral zzso However, nicotine reduced the difference in the blood zzso level dependent zzso signal between invalid and valid trials in the right zzso zzso The reduction of zzso activity in invalid trials was smaller in the low cue reliability zzso The same zzso zzso region exhibited a zzso zzso of zzso activity in valid trials which was dependent on cue zzso zzso specifically enhanced the neural activity during valid trials in the context of low cue zzso zzso when subjects are already in a state of low zzso We speculate that the right zzso zzso might be part of two networks working in zzso one responsible for zzso attention and the other for the zzso zzso of cue zzso By reducing the use of the zzso nicotine zzso zzso activity related to zzso attention in conditions with higher cue zzso On the other hand, nicotine increases zzso activity in states of low zzso This enhanced zzso might influence brain regions, such as the zzso cingulate, directly involved in the processing of cue zzso
