Brain regions in zzso zzso lobe have seen a shift in emphasis in their role in long-term zzso memory to an appreciation of their role in cognitive zzso beyond zzso memory, such as implicit memory, working memory, and zzso Recent theoretical accounts emphasize the function of zzso zzso in terms of its role in the zzso visual zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance adaptation zzso to show that brain structures in the visual processing stream can bind item features prior to the involvement of zzso binding zzso Evidence for zzso binding was assessed by comparing zzso zzso responses between fused objects and zzso of the same object as different, zzso forms zzso physically separate zzso zzso of the neural response to zzso but not zzso objects was in left zzso zzso and left zzso cortex, indicating the involvement of these regions in the zzso binding of item zzso
