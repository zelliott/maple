Identification of the zzso of the zzso joint zzso is essential for three-dimensional zzso upper limb motion zzso A number of convenient, yet zzso methods are routinely used to estimate the zzso location in preference to the International Society of zzso zzso recommended zzso The current study developed a new zzso model, and simple zzso offset method for zzso location zzso employing easy to administer measures, and compared the estimates with the known zzso location measured with magnetic resonance imaging zzso The accuracy and reliability of the new zzso and simple zzso offset techniques were compared with six established zzso zzso Twenty subjects wore a zzso motion analysis marker set that was also visible in zzso Immediately following imaging, they underwent zzso motion analysis zzso The zzso and anatomical landmark positions of 15 participants were used to determine the new zzso and simple zzso generic offset zzso These were compared for accuracy with six established methods using 10 zzso zzso A cross validation on 5 participants not used for zzso model development was also zzso Finally, 10 participants underwent a further two zzso and subsequent zzso motion analysis analyses for zzso and zzso reliability zzso When compared with any of the other established methods, our newly developed zzso model found an average zzso location closer to the actual zzso location, having an zzso location error of zzso zzso and had significantly lower zzso reliability error, zzso zzso zzso
