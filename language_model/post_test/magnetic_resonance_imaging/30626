We investigated the changes in the zzso joint zzso after bilateral zzso split zzso of the zzso for zzso surgery and the influence of positioning of the zzso process in the zzso of the zzso zzso before and during the operation for preventing changes in the zzso zzso 

A total of 28 patients with zzso zzso had bilateral zzso split zzso for zzso zzso In one group of 14 patients zzso zzso the zzso were placed in the zzso of the zzso zzso before and during the operation, and in the other group they were zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso were calculated and the results were zzso 

The main differences were found at zzso mouth zzso zzso zzso zzso that had not been positioned changed the position of the disc from zzso to anterior disc zzso with and without reduction zzso In the 28 that had been zzso changes were found in only 3 zzso zzso zzso 

Fixing the zzso process in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso before bilateral zzso split zzso is a factor in preventing zzso structural changes in the zzso zzso
