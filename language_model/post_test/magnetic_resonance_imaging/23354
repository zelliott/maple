zzso zzso zzso reporter gene is an authentic marker for surviving stem zzso However, it is unable to zzso the zzso delivery of stem cells or their impact on cardiac zzso The investigators demonstrate that zzso imaging zzso combined with magnetic resonance imaging zzso allows better assessment of cell delivery and the impact on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso embryonic stem cells zzso million) were zzso with zzso and zzso iron oxide particles and injected into the zzso border zone of zzso rat zzso zzso and zzso were performed serially up to 2 months after injection, followed by zzso 

zzso imaging was able to verify the initial zzso delivery of the cells and their survival zzso Over time, zzso signal increased in seven of nine hearts and disappeared in the other two zzso The divergence of zzso signal over time was supported by zzso zzso Left zzso ejection fraction and fractional zzso estimated by zzso suggested that cell zzso zzso a positive impact on zzso zzso zzso Two months after zzso injection, zzso iron zzso signals facilitated the zzso of the injection zzso 

zzso imaging has the unique ability to monitor cell delivery, survival status, graft zzso and impact on zzso zzso zzso
