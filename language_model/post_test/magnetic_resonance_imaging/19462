A study comparing magnetic resonance imaging findings of degenerative changes in zzso discs in young patients with previous zzso zzso fracture and zzso and zzso control zzso 

To find out the role of fractures in disc zzso and to assess the clinical outcome of the zzso 

Several experimental studies have zzso that trauma is one of the major reasons for disc zzso zzso zzso fractures in zzso of children have been considered zzso but this has not been verified in the zzso 

Fourteen patients zzso to zzso years of age zzso zzso zzso with a history of zzso zzso zzso fracture at least 1 year previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso healthy control subjects were studied by zzso spine magnetic resonance zzso The patients also underwent a clinical zzso 

Eight zzso of the 14 patients had disc zzso and seven of them had it at the trauma zzso Of these 7 subjects, 6 also had zzso damage at this zzso The association between zzso damage and adjacent zzso disc zzso was significant zzso zzso zzso Only 2 of the patients were zzso In the control group, only 1 subject had disc zzso with zzso changes and disc zzso 

The patients had more disc zzso than did those in the control zzso zzso injury was strongly associated with disc zzso No correlation between previous zzso fracture and back pain was seen in this zzso
