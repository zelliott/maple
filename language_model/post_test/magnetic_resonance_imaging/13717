A method is presented for the rapid acquisition of temperature maps derived from phase difference zzso The zzso chemical shift zzso zzso of various zzso of zzso zzso and zzso compounds were zzso The largest zzso calculated was for 100 zzso zzso which had a zzso of zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso These zzso chemical shifts zzso result in phase changes in the MR signal with changing zzso zzso zzso were constructed with each zzso zzso A fast zzso zzso MR image was acquired to serve as the baseline zzso A zzso zzso procedure was then performed on the zzso Immediately afterwards, a second zzso MR image was acquired, serving as the probing zzso Proper image processing as a phase difference map between the probing image and the baseline image resulted in an image which zzso described the temperature increase of the phantom in response to a particular zzso imaging zzso zzso of this technique in assessing the safety of pulse sequences and MR coils are zzso
