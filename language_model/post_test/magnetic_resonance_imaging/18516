With the development of fast spin echo zzso zzso techniques, zzso images of the brain may be obtained much more quickly than when using conventional spin echo techniques zzso because made the individual echoes on the zzso pulse sequence are phase zzso allowing acquisition of the same spatial information as in zzso with less zzso The pulse sequence parameters zzso train zzso zzso echo zzso are zzso Images were obtained on four volunteers using both zzso and zzso while varying repetition time, echo time and zzso zzso for signal intensity zzso zzso fat and zzso zzso zzso and vascular resolution showed that zzso images comparable in quality to those of zzso can be obtained in less than half the zzso A practical choice of zzso parameters is recommended for clinical zzso However, artifacts, possibly related to zzso and vascular zzso of which the zzso should be aware, were identified on the zzso zzso
