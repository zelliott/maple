The way in which input noise zzso the behavior of a system depends on the internal processing structure of the zzso In visual zzso there is a long tradition of using external noise methods zzso adding noise to visual zzso as tools for system zzso Here, we demonstrate that external noise affects processing of visual scenes at different cortical areas along the human zzso visual pathway, from zzso regions to higher zzso areas implicated in visual shape zzso We found that when the contrast of the stimulus was held constant, the further away from the retinal input a cortical area was the more its activity, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso depended on the zzso ratio zzso of the visual zzso A similar pattern of results was observed when trials with correct and incorrect responses were analyzed zzso We interpret these findings by extending signal detection theory to zzso data zzso This approach reveals the sequential ordering of decision stages in the zzso by exploiting the relation between zzso response and stimulus zzso In particular, our findings provide novel evidence that zzso areas in the zzso visual zzso form a cascade of decision stages with increasing degree of signal uncertainty and feature zzso
