zzso has been associated with abnormal zzso brain zzso in sensory and motor regions as well as social zzso zzso Recently, two studies investigated zzso correlation between zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso in schizophrenia but reported mixed zzso This may be due to the different frequency bands used in these zzso Here we zzso zzso to measure the zzso of zzso fluctuations zzso and fractional zzso zzso in three different frequency bands zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and typical band: zzso zzso in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 62 healthy zzso We showed that there were significant differences in zzso between the two bands zzso and zzso in regions including zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso we also identified significant interaction between frequency bands and groups in inferior zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results suggest that the abnormalities of zzso in schizophrenia is dependent on the frequency band and suggest that future studies should take the different frequency bands into account when measure intrinsic brain zzso
