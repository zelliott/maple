zzso zzso ultrasound therapy offers a minimally invasive approach for the treatment of localized prostate zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso with active MR temperature feedback can enable three-dimensional zzso zzso therapy of a target region within the prostate zzso while sparing surrounding normal zzso Continuous measurement of the temperature distribution in tissue enables dynamic compensation for unknown changes in blood flow and tissue properties during zzso The main goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using active temperature feedback on a clinical zzso T MR zzso for zzso zzso zzso MR zzso was performed during heating in both gel zzso and excised tissue with a zzso heating zzso and the rotation rate and power were varied based on the zzso zzso The capability to produce a region of zzso damage that matched a target boundary was zzso The influence of a cooling zzso (to simulate cooling of the zzso or zzso on the desired pattern of zzso damage was also investigated in gel zzso zzso showed high correlation between the desired target boundary and the 55 degrees C zzso generated during heating with an average distance error of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) in turkey zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) in gel zzso without zzso cooling and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) in gel zzso with zzso zzso The results were obtained using a zzso update rate of 5 zzso a spatial resolution of 3 zzso 3 zzso 10 zzso for the control point, and a temperature uncertainty of approximately 1 degrees zzso The performance of the control zzso under these conditions was comparable to that of simulations conducted previously by our zzso Overall, the feasibility of generating targeted regions of zzso damage with a zzso heating zzso and active MR temperature feedback has been demonstrated zzso This method of treatment appears capable of accounting for unpredictable and varying tissue properties during the zzso
