Patent zzso zzso zzso remains common in zzso zzso but uncertainty over optimal management is zzso by zzso inability to zzso its true zzso zzso Our aim was to develop a technique to zzso zzso shunt volume and the effect of zzso on systemic blood flow volume in zzso Phase contrast zzso sequences were zzso to zzso left zzso output zzso and blood flow in the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso vein zzso descending zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total systemic flow was measured as zzso + zzso zzso Echo measures were included and correlated to shunt zzso 75 infants with median zzso corrected gestation zzso zzso zzso ) weeks were zzso zzso was present in zzso In 60 infants without zzso zzso matched total systemic flow zzso difference zzso zzso zzso index zzso In zzso zzso zzso shunt volume was zzso of zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis correcting for zzso age showed that there was a significant association between zzso shunt volume and decreased upper and lower body flow zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso However, upper body blood flow volumes were within the control group zzso confidence limits in all 15 infants with zzso and lower body flow volumes within the control group limits in 12 infants with zzso zzso assessment of reversed zzso flow in the descending zzso had the strongest correlation with zzso shunt zzso We have demonstrated that zzso of shunt volume is feasible in zzso In the presence of high volume zzso zzso the upper and lower body flow volume are somewhat reduced, but levels remain within or close to the normal range for zzso zzso
