A preliminary study to investigate the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso volume using an zzso and linear dimension measurement zzso 

Prospective blinded zzso by two observers (one a consultant and one a zzso zzso in zzso 

Ambulatory patients with known zzso zzso attending a zzso referral zzso 

zzso patients with 26 zzso zzso aged zzso years zzso 

zzso of the zzso in measured volume due to zzso and zzso measurement differences, expressed as reliability zzso within which zzso of repeated zzso are calculated to lie from each other in relative percentage zzso 

For the linear measurement method, zzso zzso was calculated to have a reliability zzso of zzso and for zzso zzso this was zzso For the area tracing method, the corresponding zzso were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso 

Volume zzso in zzso zzso are variable even when the zzso are made by the same observer on identical zzso The area tracing method, commonly regarded as the gold standard, is less variable than a linear method but still introduces more zzso than commonly realized (for zzso of patients, repeated zzso by the same observer lie within around zzso of each zzso Manual area tracing is not widely used in practice because it is time consuming and reliable automated methods are eagerly zzso
