To evaluate the feasibility of single zzso zzso zzso of the liver using the zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 63 focal zzso zzso underwent liver MR examinations that included the three-dimensional zzso zzso Three or six zzso were obtained for zzso phase scanning during a single zzso Central zzso data were collected for each phase but the remaining peripheral zzso data were collected only zzso The enhancement pattern of each zzso zzso was analyzed according to the specific zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 24) enhancement patterns zzso rim enhancing zzso zzso zzso homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso A late zzso rim was observed in four zzso of the zzso zzso Most zzso (17 of 18; zzso demonstrated peripheral rim zzso The progressive zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso 6) was clearly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) showed early homogeneous enhancement and one zzso demonstrated a central zzso 

The zzso technique can be used to acquire single zzso zzso images depicting improved enhancement characteristics of focal zzso zzso This technique will allow accurate timing of zzso scanning with zzso acquisition and high zzso zzso
