To determine associations between zzso measures of plaque burden, and compositional features of carotid zzso including high-risk features of zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso 

Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent for all participants were obtained before study zzso Patients with either carotid zzso zzso by duplex ultrasound or suspected coronary artery disease underwent zzso carotid zzso at zzso zzso For each artery, zzso percent wall volume zzso zzso vessel zzso and mean wall thickness zzso were zzso zzso or absence of a zzso zzso core, zzso zzso and surface disruption were zzso 

One hundred zzso patients were included in the final zzso The area under the curve zzso calculated from zzso analysis found the presence of zzso was similarly classified by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in the lowest category of each zzso zzso of zzso in arteries with zzso zzso was zzso In arteries with zzso zzso prevalence was zzso in arteries with zzso zzso zzso prevalence was zzso zzso of zzso for surface disruption was similarly classified by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of plaque burden do not substantially improve disease assessment compared to zzso The finding of zzso in all categories of zzso and plaque burden suggests that direct characterization of plaque composition and surface status is necessary to fully discriminate disease zzso
