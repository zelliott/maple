To investigate whether zzso zzso deletions or zzso can be zzso of unclear zzso zzso we analyzed ten patients with zzso abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract or zzso combined with important zzso anomalies by zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso In a 14-year-old girl presenting with zzso zzso mental zzso zzso zzso hearing loss, zzso and zzso we detected a zzso in zzso zzso This deletion was verified and characterized by zzso in zzso zzso and multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso found to be de zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of a kidney biopsy showed zzso basement membrane thinning and zzso splitting of the zzso zzso compatible with zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance and diffusion zzso imaging detected a severe zzso migration disorder with double zzso formation and pronounced reduction of the zzso tract zzso Thus, in one of ten patients with unclear zzso zzso we identified a previously zzso zzso gene syndrome at zzso The zzso contains the zzso zzso syndrome gene zzso the MR genes zzso and zzso and parts of the zzso zzso gene zzso associated with double zzso formation in girls, zzso and zzso The zzso in our patient combines features of the zzso zzso gene syndrome with zzso
