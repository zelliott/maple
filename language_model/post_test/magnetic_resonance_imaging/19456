This article presents a technique to automatically measure changes in the volume of a structure of interest in successive zzso magnetic resonance zzso images and its application in the study of the brain and lateral cerebral zzso The only manual step is a zzso of the structure of interest in the first zzso The analysis zzso first, precise rigid zzso of the time series of zzso second, zzso of residual zzso between pairs of zzso third, automatic zzso of the volume change, obtained by propagation of the zzso of the structure of interest through the series of MR zzso This approach has been applied to monitor changes in the volume of the brain and lateral cerebral zzso in a healthy subject and a patient with primary progressive zzso zzso zzso are consistent with those obtained by application of the boundary shift integral zzso and by zzso in the same zzso
