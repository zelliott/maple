zzso cerebral blood flow zzso response after zzso administration may indicate increased cerebral blood volume zzso zzso to reduced zzso pressure from major cerebral artery zzso zzso However, decreased cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso caused by zzso damage or zzso may also decrease the zzso response to zzso which adds complexity to the assessment of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso response to zzso and zzso or zzso in a pure form of zzso crossed zzso zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso zzso to study 17 patients with unilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso was assessed by measuring baseline zzso and zzso 10 minutes after an intravenous injection of zzso zzso analysis was used to test the independent zzso value of the zzso and zzso at baseline with respect to the change of zzso during zzso zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that in zzso zzso was significantly and independently associated with the percent change of zzso during zzso administration zzso zzso whereas zzso was zzso 

In zzso changes in zzso may account for variations in zzso response to zzso and decreased zzso may not affect zzso response to zzso expressed as the percent zzso
