zzso changes induced by cerebral zzso or by zzso and zzso of the internal carotid artery have been previously described in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These changes are essentially characterized by decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Little is known about the zzso changes observed in the three days following a transient zzso attack zzso in the absence of zzso or zzso of the internal carotid artery, and without visible zzso on zzso zzso Imaging zzso We studied five patients with a zzso lasting between 30 zzso and 3 zzso affecting the sensory and motor functions of the zzso territory with or without zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso cervical zzso ultrasound and zzso with zzso magnetic resonance zzso were performed on the affected cerebral area and on the normal zzso zzso cerebral area within three days of the onset of zzso None of the five patients had zzso or zzso of the internal carotid artery on zzso zzso or cerebral zzso on zzso From zzso MRS ratio zzso we did not observe any significant changes in the zzso zzso However, a rise in zzso ratio was observed in the symptomatic zzso area compared with the normal cerebral zzso During the first three days following a transient zzso attack, there is an increase in zzso zzso This change may reflect transient local zzso which could be long enough to stimulate zzso production, but short enough not to induce zzso This region could be at risk from zzso in the long zzso
