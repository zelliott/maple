The aim of this study was to zzso evaluate the ability of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to differentiate between zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso by analyzing their signal zzso zzso 

After the zzso zzso was performed using a zzso zzso system, zzso was performed four times following intravenous administration of contrast zzso We set the volumes of interest zzso on the tumor and normal zzso zzso and obtained the zzso in these zzso We calculated the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and four zzso scans zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the first, second, third and fourth scans, zzso using the volume zzso method, and the zzso zzso and zzso rates zzso according to the zzso Reporting and Data System developed by the American College of zzso We also calculated the early slope zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso in the tumor and normal zzso We evaluated the usefulness of the above parameters for zzso between zzso and zzso using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

There were significant differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso The average zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We evaluated the usefulness of various parameters calculated from zzso obtained by zzso for zzso between zzso and zzso Our results suggested that zzso is more useful than zzso zzso and zzso
