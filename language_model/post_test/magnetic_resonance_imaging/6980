Since the beginning of the 20 zzso century, the zzso was regarded as a brain region which may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso analyzed with qualitative methods with an emphasis on the zzso zzso However, the reported results were zzso After the introduction of quantitative zzso methods, it became obvious that the volume and cell reductions are not only present in the association zzso but also in the zzso zzso zzso and motor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The involvement of distinct zzso zzso is supported by structural zzso studies which have shown a moderate but significant volume reduction of the whole zzso in this zzso The majority of zzso and PET studies reported a reduction of the zzso activity or blood flow in the zzso in patients with zzso The similarity between the structural changes in animal models of zzso plasticity and the structural zzso zzso in schizophrenia suggest an involvement of zzso mechanisms in the zzso of these zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso studies suggest altered zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms within zzso pathology in zzso On the zzso level, there is a similarity between some of the psychic manifestations of zzso zzso and symptoms of the schizophrenic zzso There are also reports on volume reduction of the whole zzso in zzso zzso zzso It appears unlikely that the zzso medication plays an zzso important role, since no significant correlations were found between the volume and cell reductions and the zzso treatment zzso The reviewed data suggest that distinct zzso zzso and therefore distinct zzso circuits are involved in the zzso of zzso
