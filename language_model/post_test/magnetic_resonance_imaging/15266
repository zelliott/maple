To investigate the presence and evolution of zzso relaxation time abnormalities in zzso white matter zzso and zzso matter zzso early in the course of zzso multiple sclerosis zzso 

zzso patients with early zzso zzso and 14 healthy controls were zzso six monthly for up to three zzso Mean follow-up was 26 months for zzso patients and 24 months for zzso zzso zzso echo and zzso zzso and zzso data sets zzso the calculation of a zzso zzso were acquired in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were produced and a zzso zzso model was used to investigate changes in zzso over zzso 

At zzso significant zzso differences were seen, both in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso At zzso there was no evidence for a serial change in either mean zzso or zzso for either zzso or zzso There was weak evidence for a decline in patient zzso zzso and also evidence for a decline in control zzso zzso 

There are significant and persistent abnormalities of zzso and zzso zzso in early zzso zzso Further studies should address whether such zzso measures have a role in prognosis or therapeutic zzso
