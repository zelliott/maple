zzso of zzso traumatic injuries by using MR imaging is frequently zzso This study investigates the zzso of zzso and signal intensity of zzso ligaments in healthy volunteers so that pathology can be more accurately zzso 

Fifty healthy volunteers were examined on a zzso MR imaging scanner with zzso zzso sequences in 3 zzso zzso of the zzso ligaments in 3 planes and zzso characteristics on zzso planes were analyzed by using a 4-point grading zzso zzso of courses and zzso characteristics were zzso 

zzso of zzso ligaments was best viewed in the zzso plane, followed by the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso view, zzso of zzso ligaments appeared zzso zzso zzso signal intensity in up to one-third of the zzso area was present in zzso of zzso in up to two-thirds of the zzso area, in zzso of zzso and in more than two-thirds of the zzso area, in zzso of zzso Of zzso ligaments, zzso ascended zzso zzso ran zzso and zzso descended zzso The zzso area was round in zzso oval in zzso and zzso in zzso 

On zzso MR imaging, the zzso ligaments can be delineated best in the zzso and zzso zzso Our data indicate a remarkable zzso of zzso and course as well as signal zzso This finding is contradictory to former publications assigning such zzso exclusively to patients with zzso
