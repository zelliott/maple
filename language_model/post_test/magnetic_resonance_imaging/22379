We developed a new flexible approach for a zzso of zzso brain imaging data using a zzso zzso In this approach, results from separate analyses on different zzso are combined using a combining function and assessed with a zzso zzso This approach identifies several zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso without explicitly modeling the correlation between zzso We applied our approach to structural and zzso zzso data from an Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso Our approach identified areas of zzso where both gray matter zzso density and zzso decreased together, and areas of zzso where zzso density and zzso did not decrease zzso In conclusion, these results demonstrate the utility of this new zzso method to zzso assess the relationships between multiple zzso
