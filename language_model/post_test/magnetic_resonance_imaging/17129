zzso recovery has been used to correct the loss of zzso and tissue contrast at 3 T versus zzso T but has not been formally investigated in the spine after IV administration of zzso contrast zzso The purpose of this study is to compare two sequences for zzso spine imaging at 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso zzso evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

After IV administration of zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were obtained in 156 zzso scans of 143 patients at 3 zzso Three experienced zzso compared these sequences for zzso differences in bone zzso disk zzso other zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso visual rating scale was used, with lower numbers indicating increased zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher numbers indicating increased zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A slight increase in the zzso of zzso bone zzso zzso score, zzso p zzso zzso disk zzso zzso score, zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso score, zzso p zzso zzso was seen on zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso A higher degree of contrast between the spinal zzso and zzso was seen on zzso zzso zzso by a large margin zzso score, zzso p zzso zzso All enhancing zzso seen on zzso zzso zzso images were also seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso contrast at 3 zzso as seen on zzso zzso can be regained by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may increase zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso
