zzso zzso due to zzso zzso is usually a severe condition encompassing both zzso zzso and an zzso zzso associated with behavioral and cognitive zzso Here we report the effects of zzso zzso in the treatment of this generally zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso years of age, 7 women, mean age zzso years, mean duration of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso and a minimum follow-up period of 1 year were included in this zzso Treatment was performed by zzso zzso using zzso implanted zzso zzso zzso of treatment on seizure frequency and possible side effects were assessed zzso zzso influencing outcome and side effects were analyzed zzso 

After a mean zzso follow-up period following the last zzso treatment, zzso patients were seizure free or had seizure reduction of at least zzso zzso class I and zzso in some cases only after repeated zzso The duration of zzso prior to zzso zzso influenced zzso Treatment was well tolerated in most zzso zzso fatigue, and lethargy were transient side effects associated with the development of brain zzso extending from the zzso site in five zzso Four patients had a weight gain of more than 5 zzso which was severe in two zzso The majority of those patients whose cognitive functions initially deteriorated showed subsequent recovery of cognitive functions, but episodic memory in two patients showed persistent decline at 1 year zzso zzso disease duration increased the risk for cognitive side effects, and larger zzso size and eccentric seed positioning increased the risk for zzso brain zzso Neither zzso mortality nor zzso zzso visual field zzso or zzso disturbances were encountered following zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso in significantly improving zzso zzso in about half of the patients treated in this zzso Weight gain may occur as a side effect, whereas other severe side effects reported following zzso removal of the zzso were zzso The study results strongly suggest early zzso treatment, as chances for seizure control are higher and the risk for cognitive side effects is lower in patients with shorter disease zzso
