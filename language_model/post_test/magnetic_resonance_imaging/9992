The introduction of new flat-panel detector technology often forces us to accept too high dose levels as proposed by the zzso We need a tool to compare the image quality of a new system with the accepted zzso The aim of this study was to obtain a comparable image quality for two zzso zzso plates and a flat-panel system using intravenous zzso zzso as a clinical zzso The image quality figure was calculated using a zzso phantom zzso for the two evaluated zzso This allowed us to set a dose for the flat-panel system that gave equivalent image quality to the storage zzso zzso This reduced detector dose was used in an evaluation of clinical images to find out if the dose reduction from the phantom study indeed resulted in images of equal clinical image zzso The image quality was assessed using image criteria of the European guidelines for zzso with visual grading zzso zzso image quality in image pairs was achieved at zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso phantom makes it possible to find dose levels that give equal image quality using different imaging zzso
