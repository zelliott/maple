zzso as a neural network disorder, zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso may cause widespread deficits in human brain zzso zzso in cognitive functions such as memory and language have been well zzso but zzso deficits have only been considered in terms of behavioral zzso Little imaging research on zzso deficits in zzso has been zzso The present study is expected to reveal zzso in the zzso networks in patients with zzso using zzso The zzso independent component analysis zzso was applied to 33 patients with zzso and 33 matched healthy zzso In light of the zzso networks zzso corresponding to the zzso functions of zzso zzso and zzso systems, the zzso data of functional connectivity within these zzso were compared between the patients and zzso Compared with the controls, the zzso patients presented decreased functional connectivity within the regions of the auditory and zzso networks, as well increased functional connectivity in the primary visual zzso and decreased functional connectivity in the bilateral zzso areas of the visual zzso Our zzso results are in agreement with the previous findings that specific zzso functions are impaired in zzso Furthermore, our findings in the visual network support the belief that the primary visual function is not impaired and that there may be deficits in the zzso visual function in zzso Our zzso study may contribute to the understanding of zzso mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in zzso
