To investigate the effects of zzso erythropoietin, a modified zzso lacking zzso activity, on brain zzso and functional recovery in a model of diffuse traumatic brain zzso 

Adult male zzso zzso 

zzso and physiology zzso 

Thirty minutes after diffuse traumatic brain injury zzso zzso rats were zzso administered with either a saline solution zzso brain zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso traumatic brain zzso zzso A third group received no traumatic brain injury insult zzso 

Three series of experiments were conducted to zzso 1) the effect of zzso zzso on brain zzso before and 1 zzso after traumatic brain injury using zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso of apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 10 rats per group), and the zzso level of brain zzso zzso was also determined to indicate the presence of an activated cell signaling zzso 2) the time course of brain zzso using magnetic resonance imaging between 4 and 6 zzso zzso and the zzso technique at 6 zzso zzso zzso 10 rats per zzso and 3) motor and cognitive function over 10 days post traumatic brain injury, testing acute zzso zzso adhesive paper zzso and zzso active avoidance zzso zzso 8 rats per zzso Compared to traumatic brain zzso rats, rats receiving traumatic brain zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in brain zzso formation at 1 zzso that was sustained until 6 zzso when results were comparable with zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso zzso was possibly zzso through an early zzso of zzso zzso zzso Compared to traumatic brain zzso rats, traumatic brain zzso zzso rats showed improved functional recovery of the acute zzso zzso post traumatic brain injury, took less time to remove adhesive from the zzso and showed higher percentages of correct avoidance zzso 

Our findings indicate that early zzso administration of zzso zzso reduces brain zzso development until at least 6 zzso zzso and improves zzso zzso zzso zzso can thus be considered as a potential agent in the treatment of traumatic brain zzso diffuse zzso
