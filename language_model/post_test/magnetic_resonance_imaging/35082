zzso zzso is a benign zzso proliferation that is frequently zzso as a zzso This article describes a case of zzso zzso of zzso duration located in the zzso which zzso and spontaneously zzso after zzso The zzso was fixed to the zzso but was free from the zzso zzso The mass was zzso zzso in diameter and demonstrated high signal intensity on zzso magnetic resonance zzso A small part of the zzso was zzso zzso and zzso examinations identified the zzso as zzso zzso with zzso zzso One month after the zzso the mass showed decreased signal intensity on zzso images and measured zzso zzso in zzso The signal on zzso images showed zzso zzso and the mass continued to reduce in size throughout the follow-up zzso The zzso presented as zzso to the surrounding muscles on zzso images and was zzso zzso in size at 2 years of zzso This case demonstrates that zzso zzso with zzso zzso can change to that with zzso appearance gradually with time, thus bringing about spontaneous zzso zzso may be involved in the spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso The mechanism of regression, zzso at present, should be further zzso
