To describe our experience with the application of an zzso ultra low field magnetic resonance imaging system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Technologies, Louisville, USA during zzso control of zzso zzso 

zzso patients were operated on a zzso zzso (1 zzso 43 zzso mean size zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso system was used for navigation and zzso control after zzso zzso zzso zzso removal using standard instruments and standard zzso If any accessible zzso remnant was suspected surgery was continued for navigation guided zzso and if necessary continued zzso 

The applications of the scanner integrated navigation system, with a zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso enabled the surgeon to safely approach and remove the zzso The quality of zzso zzso zzso with the ultra low field zzso in patients with zzso is very good and has a good zzso with the zzso zzso T zzso For zzso the zzso zzso is poor and very difficult to zzso In seven patients zzso zzso control showed residual zzso leading to further zzso After final zzso zzso the zzso scan documented adequate zzso of the zzso zzso in all zzso However, the zzso image interpretation was zzso in four patients in whom it was difficult to distinguish between small zzso zzso remnants and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is a safe, helpful and feasible tool for navigation guided zzso zzso zzso Image interpretation is requires some experience, but zzso of the zzso system can be reliable shown in cases with zzso zzso This system is of limited value for zzso control of zzso zzso
