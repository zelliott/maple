In working memory zzso functional imaging studies demonstrate zzso involvement indicating a cognitive role of the zzso These cognitive contributions were predominantly interpreted as part of the zzso loop within the zzso model of zzso However, those underlying investigations were performed in the context of visual verbal zzso which could pose a bias when interpreting the zzso The aim of this zzso study was to address the question of whether the zzso supports additional aspects of zzso in the context of higher cognitive zzso Furthermore, zzso effects were investigated to further zzso the zzso role in the context of the zzso loop and the zzso zzso A direct comparison of verbal and abstract visual zzso was performed in 17 young volunteers by applying a zzso paradigm and zzso the % change in zzso signal from the zzso zzso To minimize potential verbal strategies, zzso and zzso shapes of zzso objects were chosen for the abstract zzso The analyses revealed no significant differences in verbal zzso abstract zzso Moreover, no zzso effects were demonstrated in both verbal and abstract zzso These results provide further evidence of a broader cognitive involvement of the zzso in zzso that is not only confined to the zzso loop but also supports central executive zzso The fact that no zzso effects are found might be attributed to the characteristics of the zzso paradigm which emphasizes central executive zzso over the subsidiary slave zzso
