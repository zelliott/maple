To evaluate the maturation of tactile processing by recording zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso from healthy human zzso 

zzso to tactile stimulation of the left index finger were measured from the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in five age groups: zzso 6- and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the measured signals and equivalent current zzso zzso were analyzed in awake and sleep states in order to separate the effects of age and vigilance state on zzso 

There was an orderly, systematic change in the measured and zzso source zzso of the initial cortical responses with zzso The broad zzso response in newborns zzso shifted to a zzso response with emergence of a notch by 6 months of zzso The zzso response with zzso and zzso components was present by 2 zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were oriented zzso and that of zzso zzso These zzso changes were independent of vigilance zzso 

The most significant maturation of short zzso cortical responses to tactile stimulation takes place during the first 2 years of zzso 

The zzso changes of zzso processing can zzso be evaluated with zzso already in zzso
