The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there were differences in zzso features, including zzso zzso and zzso volumes, between patients with zzso zzso with and without mild cognitive impairment of the vascular type zzso 

A total of 40 patients with zzso zzso were studied within 1 month after zzso 

zzso was found in 22 patients, who in comparison with patients without cognitive impairment were significantly older and had fewer years of formal zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly more frequent in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso study, patients with zzso showed more zzso zzso in the middle zzso zzso right and left frontal and zzso bilateral zzso regions including the zzso zzso as well as in the zzso A region of interest analysis restricted to the zzso and zzso showed further reduced bilateral zzso zzso and right zzso volume reductions in this group of zzso Finally, the amount of zzso zzso among zzso showed negative correlations with zzso volume in frontal and zzso areas as well as with the zzso and zzso 

The present findings provide support for an anatomical zzso of the zzso entity in patients with zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso changes seem to contribute to the cognitive impairment of such zzso
