This study investigated the neural systems that may make necessary contributions to the retention in working memory of location zzso Particularly controversial in this regard have been the roles of various regions of frontal zzso The task featured a zzso zzso procedure designed to isolate zzso zzso activity that would be sustained across zzso distracting zzso This property is necessary for zzso signal from a brain area to be considered necessary for successful retention of zzso zzso Across zzso analyses and two different group zzso the zzso Eye Fields zzso zzso Eye Fields, and zzso zzso were most reliably found to support zzso sustained activity, and effects tended to be more robust in left than right zzso Such activity was not found zzso however, in the Superior zzso zzso anterior to the zzso nor in zzso prefrontal zzso These results are interpreted as inconsistent with memory systems accounts holding that certain frontal regions are specialized for spatial working memory zzso They are consistent, however, with the view that spatial working memory functions are the product of the operation of spatial selective attention and motor zzso zzso
