zzso zzso vascular zzso is associated with cortical zzso and zzso and this reduced cortical metabolism or blood flow can be detected with functional imaging such as zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso by means of MR imaging and zzso MR zzso the structural and zzso brain changes that occur among patients with zzso zzso vascular zzso compared with those of elderly control volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cognitive impairment and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy zzso control volunteers zzso zzso zzso underwent MR imaging and zzso MR zzso zzso MR zzso data were zzso with zzso segmented MR images to account for zzso and tissue zzso 

Compared with healthy control volunteers, patients with zzso and zzso had zzso lower zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lower zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso In white matter, patients with zzso and zzso showed a zzso zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso compared with control zzso zzso in the frontal zzso was zzso correlated with the volume of white matter signal zzso among patients with cognitive impairment and zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso but not patients with zzso and zzso showed a zzso zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in the zzso compared with healthy control zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso have reduced zzso and zzso in both cortical and white matter zzso zzso changes may result from cortical zzso retrograde or zzso injury (or zzso secondary to zzso zzso loss, or concurrent Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to zzso among patients with zzso zzso
