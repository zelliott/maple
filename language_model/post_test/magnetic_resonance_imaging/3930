This study was undertaken to assess the capabilities of zzso zzso performed while inflating the zzso cavity with fluid and magnetic resonance imaging as a means to assess the depth of zzso invasion by zzso cancer zzso Twenty women with zzso disorders underwent zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso We introduced the probe and zzso simultaneously into the zzso cavity and observed both the zzso cavity surface and zzso zzso zzso We classified the depth of zzso invasion as none, superficial (less than half of the zzso or deep (more than half of the zzso The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso in assessing the depth of zzso invasion was zzso In two cases, zzso zzso was able to demonstrate superficial zzso invasion that could not be diagnosed by magnetic resonance zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was unable to diagnose zzso invasion in two cases in which magnetic resonance imaging could diagnose zzso zzso zzso may be useful for zzso of zzso invasion of zzso zzso
