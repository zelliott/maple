zzso zzso painful zzso zzso and painful zzso disorders zzso are chronic zzso pain conditions that are thought to have fundamentally different zzso zzso zzso and zzso are thought to arise from damage to or pressure on the zzso zzso whereas zzso results primarily from peripheral zzso zzso This study sought to assess the volume and zzso of the zzso nerve in these 3 zzso In 9 zzso 18 zzso 20 zzso and 26 healthy controls, the zzso root entry zone was selected on high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance images and the volume zzso zzso Additionally, using zzso images zzso the mean zzso and fractional zzso values of the zzso nerve root were zzso zzso zzso patients displayed a significant zzso decrease in nerve volume but no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects displayed a significant zzso increase in nerve volume but again no change in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso subjects displayed no change in volume or zzso zzso The data suggest that the changes occurring within the zzso nerve are not uniform in all zzso pain zzso These structural and volume changes may have implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of chronic zzso zzso 

This study reveals that zzso zzso pain conditions are associated with changes in zzso nerve volume, whereas zzso zzso pain is not associated with any change in nerve zzso
