A number of authors have suggested that cerebrovascular disease may zzso zzso or perpetuate some geriatric depressive zzso These zzso zzso may result from damage of zzso pathways which frequently occurs in cerebrovascular zzso 

We have searched the English and French literature published between 1996 (when the zzso zzso hypothesis was first zzso and December 2004 through the zzso computer database and examined the zzso of the concept of zzso zzso thanks to four levels of zzso face zzso descriptive zzso construct zzso and zzso zzso The face zzso is the extent to which experts agree about the existence of a zzso zzso 

The reviews published in this field broadly support the concept of zzso zzso as a specific zzso However many authors highlighted the fact that depression has been shown to zzso vascular diseases and that depression and vascular diseases may both share some zzso or genetic zzso These interactive and zzso relationships between depression and cerebrovascular diseases are difficult to zzso The descriptive zzso refers to the degree of the clinical specificity of a zzso It appears only moderate regarding the clinical studies carried out on this zzso However, a zzso the absence of a family history of mental illness, the lack of insight, zzso zzso zzso a greater disability and particular zzso zzso may be associated with vascular zzso The construct zzso which refers to the degree to which the zzso processes involved in an illness are zzso appears difficult to establish because of the complex interactive relationships between cerebrovascular disease and zzso However, cerebrovascular diseases may contribute to the occurrence of depressive symptoms independently of its zzso zzso The zzso zzso refers to the degree to which a syndrome is characterized by a specific response to treatment or a specific natural zzso As regards response to treatment, vascular depression appears rather specific in the sense of a worse response to zzso and zzso zzso The studies on the natural history of vascular depression lead to inconsistent zzso According to some authors, this relative resistance to treatment may be explained by structural rather than functional, and thus potentially irreversible disruption in neural zzso 

In conclusion, the systematic review of the zzso of vascular depression broadly supports this zzso However, further studies are needed to decipher the relationships between depression and cerebrovascular zzso Finally, we suggest that it could be more relevant for future researches in this field if the diagnostic criteria for vascular depression were narrowed and required the presence of both zzso changes and cerebrovascular zzso
