The zzso traditionally has been viewed as a neural device dedicated to motor zzso Although recent evidence shows that it is involved in zzso operations as well, an important question is whether this involvement is independent of motor control and motor zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate that attention and motor performance independently activate distinct zzso zzso These findings support a broader concept of zzso function, in which the zzso is involved in diverse cognitive and zzso zzso systems, including the attention and motor systems, in order to anticipate imminent information zzso analysis, or zzso
