zzso zzso depends not only on the zzso of zzso but also on cerebral zzso There are relatively few data regarding cerebral processing of zzso zzso 

Thirteen healthy subjects underwent zzso zzso to cause urge increasing to discomfort during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In addition, a painful heat stimulus was applied to the skin of the anterior abdominal wall in the zzso corresponding to the zzso Voluntary contraction of the zzso zzso was also zzso zzso rating of stimulus intensity was zzso zzso of the data used a general linear model with Brain zzso zzso 

zzso sensation of discomfort increased during repeated zzso zzso and caused zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and secondary zzso zzso seen on zzso zzso of zzso urge and discomfort activated the same cerebral regions with differing zzso Application of a painful zzso stimulus in the corresponding zzso showed a modification of the zzso Voluntary contraction of the zzso zzso led to zzso of the motor zzso and increased activity in the supplementary motor zzso and the zzso 

zzso representation of the zzso as mapped by zzso is intricate and reflects the complexity of the zzso zzso
