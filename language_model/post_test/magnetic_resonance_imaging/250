To demonstrate the imaging features of zzso zzso outside the zzso 

A retrospective database review was made from 1989 to 2007 of patients diagnosed with zzso zzso in zzso zzso below 12 months of zzso 

There were nine patients (six boys and three zzso The age at presentation varied from 1 to 11 months zzso 6 zzso zzso were located in the zzso zzso liver zzso neck zzso shoulder zzso and zzso zzso The imaging zzso used included US zzso CT zzso and zzso zzso Bone scan was positive in one patient, while zzso at the time of diagnosis occurred in four zzso On zzso the zzso tended to show zzso zzso on zzso images and zzso zzso on zzso images, with zzso zzso 

This is the largest zzso series of zzso zzso outside the zzso in zzso In our series no imaging features were found specific to the zzso A tendency towards large size and zzso location were zzso A zzso solid component on CT and a zzso zzso on zzso MR images suggest that this zzso should be considered in the routine differential diagnosis of zzso zzso in zzso in addition to zzso
