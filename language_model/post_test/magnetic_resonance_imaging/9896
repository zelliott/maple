: To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used in clinical routine to detect inflamed arteries in patients with zzso with high resolution dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in its ability to measure inflammation in carotid and zzso zzso 

: This study was performed with written informed zzso Health Insurance zzso and Accountability Act zzso compliance, and institutional review board zzso zzso of the carotid and zzso arteries of 17 patients with suspected zzso was acquired at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in plane resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso using a dedicated zzso carotid zzso Patients underwent zzso zzso within 1 week of the zzso zzso The blood zzso mean standardized zzso value zzso zzso ratio zzso was measured on zzso images at the identical location as the zzso in the magnetic resonance zzso zzso signal intensity data was analyzed to generate estimates of the tissue extraction fraction and zzso volume using a zzso zzso 

: zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in patients with than without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients diagnosed with zzso had significantly higher extraction zzso as measured by zzso than patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly with the extraction fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded the same sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was good with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

: zzso is able to measure zzso inflammation reliably and zzso with good correlation to zzso zzso in patients suffering from zzso of the zzso zzso
