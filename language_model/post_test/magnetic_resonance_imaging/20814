We investigated the role of variation in putative psychosis genes coding for elements of the white matter system by examining the contribution of zzso variation in three zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso to white matter volume in patients with psychotic disorder and their unaffected zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and blood samples for zzso were collected on 189 participants including patients with schizophrenia zzso or bipolar I disorder zzso unaffected first-degree relatives of these patients and healthy zzso The association of zzso variation with white matter volume was assessed using zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were associated with abnormal white matter volume in the zzso group in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso risk zzso was associated with lower white matter volume in the zzso zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso and the anterior limb of the internal zzso Healthy zzso of the zzso zzso had greater white matter volume in areas of the zzso and zzso this relationship was absent in those with a psychotic disorder and the unaffected relatives zzso The zzso zzso did not contribute to white matter volume variation in the diagnostic groups zzso Variation in the genes coding for structural and protective components of zzso are implicated in abnormal white matter volume in the emotion zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in psychotic zzso
