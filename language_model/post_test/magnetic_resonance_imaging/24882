zzso assessment of zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The present study evaluated the accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso as the reference zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso With color zzso zzso zzso effective zzso orifice area zzso was calculated using the zzso zzso surface area zzso From the zzso zzso zzso zzso data, zzso was calculated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso volumes zzso were obtained by zzso the zzso and zzso by the zzso integral of zzso jet and compared with that obtained using zzso For the entire population, zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a strong correlation and good agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso respectively), whereas zzso zzso zzso showed a modest correlation and large limits of agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso jets were noted in 16 patients zzso In these patients, zzso zzso demonstrated an excellent correlation zzso zzso zzso with zzso a small bias zzso zzso and narrow limits of agreement zzso to zzso zzso Finally, the zzso agreement between zzso zzso and zzso for grading of zzso severity was good zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso agreement between zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso is accurate, and its advantage over zzso zzso is particularly evident in patients with eccentric zzso
