zzso anterior cervical zzso surgery and fusion effectively treats cervical zzso that is caused by severe cervical spinal zzso but degenerative changes at adjacent zzso levels frequently result in long-term zzso The authors performed a modified zzso zzso procedure in which zzso bone and titanium zzso were used to treat cervical zzso in younger patients with zzso canal zzso while maintaining functional cervical motion zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized zzso zzso were performed to assess changes in cervical spinal canal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared to determine the residual motion of the targeted operative zzso 

Twenty younger patients zzso age zzso zzso underwent modified zzso zzso for treatment of zzso or zzso related to significant cervical spinal zzso with or without associated central or lateral disc zzso or zzso zzso These surgeries were performed during a zzso period and follow-up review remains ongoing zzso follow-up period zzso zzso zzso procedures were performed on an average of zzso levels zzso zzso zzso time averaged 186 minutes zzso zzso zzso Average blood loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No cases were complicated by neurological zzso infection, wound breakdown, graft zzso or hardware zzso The patients' zzso zzso grade improved from a zzso average of zzso to a zzso average of zzso zzso and zzso zzso spinal diameter averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The spinal canal area increased an average of zzso zzso zzso In patients in whom zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso residual neck motion was zzso No patient developed increased neck or shoulder zzso Neurological symptoms improved in all patients, with total relief of zzso in 50% and partial improvement in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with zzso bone and titanium zzso effectively treats neurological deficits in younger patients with zzso and spinal zzso Although long-term results are unknown, short-term results are good and there is a low zzso of zzso
