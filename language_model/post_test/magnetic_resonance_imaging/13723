zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso of water in the rat brain were zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso h after middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Upon zzso average zzso fell from about zzso zzso to below zzso zzso in cortical areas and the amygdala, and below zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in some of the zzso zzso areas also decreased by zzso Average zzso decreased from about 8 center dot zzso to 5 center dot zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso were lower in the frontal zzso and negligible in the zzso cortex, suggesting that the zzso threshold for zzso decrease may be different for different brain regions in the same zzso The area of decreased zzso correlated well with the zzso area revealed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of brain slices in zzso A better understanding of the mechanisms linking zzso and zzso changes to zzso cell disorders may prove useful in characterizing the degree of tissue damage, and in developing and evaluating treatment zzso
