Leigh syndrome is a zzso zzso zzso frequently ascribed to zzso respiratory chain zzso This condition is genetically heterogeneous, as zzso in both zzso zzso and nuclear genes have been zzso Here, we report the zzso transition in the zzso zzso gene in three unrelated children with complex I zzso and a peculiar zzso aspect distinct from typical Leigh zzso Brain zzso consistently showed a specific involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sparing the zzso zzso zzso degrees of zzso were found in all zzso tested and a high percentage of zzso zzso was observed in zzso The zzso mothers presented low levels of zzso zzso in blood zzso This zzso which affects an evolutionary zzso zzso acid zzso has been previously reported in adult patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso the clinical zzso of zzso DNA zzso Since the zzso zzso was found in zzso of our patients with Leigh syndrome and complex I zzso zzso it appears that this zzso represents a frequent cause of zzso syndrome, which should be systematically tested for molecular diagnosis in affected children and for genetic zzso in their maternal zzso
