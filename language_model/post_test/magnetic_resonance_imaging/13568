zzso sometimes occurs after zzso that selectively involve the zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso zzso Some reports have zzso that the loss of zzso nucleus control on the internal segment of the zzso zzso followed by the zzso of the zzso may contribute to zzso However, the zzso is poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated and a comparison of the zzso status of the zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

Six patients presenting with acute onset of zzso were zzso zzso studies, including zzso and zzso examinations in addition to detailed zzso tests, were zzso A zzso analysis was performed by comparing the ratio of blood flow between patients and normal zzso In addition, the ratio of zzso asymmetry was calculated as the ratio between each area zzso to the zzso and that zzso to the zzso The comparison was made with a two sample zzso zzso 

The causes of zzso found consisted of four cases of acute stroke, one zzso zzso and one systemic lupus zzso Brain zzso indicated zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso A significant decrease in the ratio of blood flow in the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and a significant increase in the zzso was found when comparing the zzso zzso which were calculated as the ratio of cerebral blood flow zzso for each region to that in the zzso zzso area zzso 

An zzso in zzso in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso reflect the loss of zzso zzso input from the zzso to the zzso This change in zzso may be one of zzso which implicates an occurrence of zzso in zzso
