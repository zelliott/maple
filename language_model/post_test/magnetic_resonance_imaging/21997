We measured zzso and zzso changes in the portal flow of normal volunteers and patients with liver zzso using MR imaging and examined how to zzso portal flow to evaluate liver zzso 

Three groups were zzso middle aged normal volunteers zzso age zzso zzso 5 zzso aged normal volunteers zzso age zzso zzso 6 zzso and patients zzso age zzso zzso 7 zzso We used zzso and the zzso method to measure portal flow zzso zzso and vertical zzso area zzso zzso We repeated zzso of zzso and PA in turn for about 60 minutes after a zzso 

There were no significant differences in zzso between the three groups before the zzso Study after the meal also indicated no significant difference between the two normal zzso In the normal group, zzso and portal flow volume zzso increased by about zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso liver group, zzso and zzso increased by about zzso and zzso zzso A significant difference was seen between the normal and patient groups after the zzso zzso therefore considered that the changing rate of zzso might be a sensitive zzso for evaluating liver function, including zzso
