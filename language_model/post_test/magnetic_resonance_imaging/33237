The risk of type 2 diabetes zzso is zzso among obese zzso zzso that discriminate zzso or diabetes risk within this population have not been well zzso A dysfunctional zzso zzso characterized by excess visceral fat and insulin resistance, may contribute to diabetes development in those with zzso 

To investigate associations between zzso zzso and risk for incident zzso and diabetes in a zzso zzso cohort of obese zzso 

Among zzso obese participants zzso mass index zzso aged 30 to 65 years without diabetes or cardiovascular disease enrolled between 2000 and 2002 in the Dallas Heart zzso we measured body composition by dual energy zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso circulating zzso and zzso of insulin resistance, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and cardiac structure and function by zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of diabetes through a median zzso years zzso range, zzso of zzso In a zzso of 512 participants with normal zzso zzso values at zzso zzso of the composite of zzso or diabetes was zzso 

Of the zzso participants zzso age, 43 years; zzso zzso zzso zzso 84 zzso developed zzso In multivariable analysis, higher baseline visceral fat mass zzso ratio zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family history of diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso per 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and weight gain over follow-up zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently associated with diabetes, with no associations observed for body mass index, total body fat, or abdominal subcutaneous zzso Among the 512 participants with normal baseline zzso values, the composite outcome of zzso or diabetes occurred in zzso and was independently associated with baseline zzso of visceral fat zzso levels of zzso zzso insulin, and zzso older zzso nonwhite race; family history of zzso and weight gain over follow-up zzso zzso zzso for each) but not with zzso of general zzso 

Excess visceral fat and insulin resistance, but not general zzso were independently associated with incident zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso in obese zzso
