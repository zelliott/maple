To compare the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso zzso in stress fractures of the zzso zzso 

zzso and clinical data from 57 adolescents and young adults with a diagnosis of stress injury of the zzso spine were zzso zzso All cases had undergone both zzso T zzso and zzso CT zzso All zzso and CT images were zzso reviewed and evaluated in separate zzso The fracture zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were noted at both the CT and zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso was also determined at zzso 

In total, 73 complete and 32 incomplete stress fractures were detected with zzso zzso complete, 24 incomplete fractures and eight stress reactions were detected using zzso in the same study zzso zzso zzso was also seen in eight of the complete and 20 of the incomplete zzso The zzso sensitivity, and accuracy of zzso in detecting fracture lines were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was more accurate at the lower zzso levels in comparison to upper zzso zzso 

zzso has a similar diagnostic accuracy to CT in determining complete fractures with or without accompanying zzso zzso and incomplete fractures with accompanying zzso zzso especially at the lower zzso levels, which constitutes zzso of all zzso At upper zzso levels and in the incomplete fractures of the zzso zzso with marked surrounding zzso zzso has apparent limitations compared to CT zzso
