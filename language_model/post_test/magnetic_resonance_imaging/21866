zzso zzso testing was carried out on a patient with a central zzso zzso involving the trapezoid body, who presented with a deficit in sound zzso and sound movement zzso A deficit in the analysis of time and intensity differences between the ears was found, which would explain the deficit in detection of sound zzso The impaired detection of sound movement, due to a zzso interfering with convergence of auditory information at the superior olive, suggests this structure to be critical for human sound movement zzso
