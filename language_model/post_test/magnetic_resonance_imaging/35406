zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is useful to study the zzso of cells in zzso This research adopts zzso zzso iron oxide zzso particles as contrast zzso zzso particles administered zzso can be zzso by circulating immune cells, in particular, zzso zzso zzso are labeled with zzso zzso When a transplanted heart zzso zzso immune cells will zzso the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso display dark zzso zzso zzso these labeled cells in the image zzso the identification of acute heart zzso This paper develops a zzso to detect the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso in the framework of spectral graph zzso First, we describe a zzso heart image with a zzso zzso becomes equivalent to zzso the graph into two zzso zzso We use the zzso constant of the graph as an objective functional to derive the zzso We represent the zzso as a linear combination of basis functions given from the spectral analysis of the graph zzso zzso of the zzso constant based functional leads to the optimal zzso Experimental results and comparisons with other methods suggest the feasibility of our approach to study the rejection of hearts zzso by zzso zzso
