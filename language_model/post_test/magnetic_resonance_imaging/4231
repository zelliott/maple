zzso measurement of zzso load on zzso density or zzso weighted brain zzso in multiple sclerosis is a widely used marker of disease progression in treatment trials and natural history zzso However, it has proved difficult to obtain highly zzso zzso Several factors account for this, one of which is uncertainties in zzso zzso particularly very small white matter zzso This paper aims to ascertain the significance of very small white matter abnormalities in the measurement of zzso load in multiple zzso 

All visible zzso areas identified by an experienced observer on zzso density weighted spin echo brain zzso with 5 zzso thick slices were measured by using a zzso technique in 15 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso and 13 with zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso The size distribution of these zzso was zzso 

zzso of the number of the zzso were smaller than 80 zzso zzso that were smaller than 10 zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso made up nearly zzso of all zzso their relative contribution to the total zzso load varied from zzso zzso zzso in individual patients, and was larger when the total zzso load was smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso Median zzso size was significantly smaller in the zzso group than the zzso zzso 

The results suggest that it is prudent to identify and measure small zzso in evaluating treatment effects, and that measures are undertaken (for example, using thinner slices such as 3 zzso to improve their zzso
