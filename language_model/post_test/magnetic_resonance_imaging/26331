To investigate specificity and significance of dynamic changes of the cervical zzso zzso and spinal zzso during neck zzso in juvenile muscular zzso of the zzso upper zzso 

The disorder affects young zzso zzso is progressive for several zzso One autopsy case showed zzso necrosis of the cervical anterior horn, suggesting that the disorder is a type of cervical zzso Some authors zzso it as zzso zzso zzso that it is a focal motor zzso zzso

A distinctive finding in the disorder was forward displacement of the cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the lower cervical zzso during neck zzso The forward displacement was significantly greater in patients with disease duration less than 10 years than in zzso control subjects and patients in a late, zzso zzso
