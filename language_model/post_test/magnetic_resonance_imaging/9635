The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes between a primary dislocation group zzso P) and a zzso dislocation group zzso zzso with combined zzso of zzso and type II SLAP zzso zzso V SLAP zzso and to evaluate zzso of type V SLAP zzso In addition, the authors evaluated clinical outcomes of these patients by dividing two groups according to the sequence for zzso and SLAP zzso zzso 

From May 2000 to May 2005, 310 patients who gave informed zzso underwent the diagnostic zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso One hundred and ten patients met the following criteria: zzso post-traumatic primary or zzso anterior shoulder instability, zzso a normal zzso shoulder, zzso a type V SLAP zzso and zzso minimum follow-up of two zzso Group P included 42 patients, and group zzso 68 zzso Among all patients, 58 patients who had zzso zzso zzso first were included in group B, and 52 who had their SLAP zzso zzso zzso group zzso Visual analogue scale, range of motion, Rowe and zzso score were used to compare results between group P and group zzso also group B and group zzso 

The zzso rates of type V SLAP zzso were zzso in group P and zzso in group zzso The overall treatment results in our study were zzso Even if the difference between the two groups was statistically zzso group P showed greater recovery of range of motion than group R in external zzso No significant difference was found between the two different operative methods according to zzso zzso 

The zzso rates of type V SLAP zzso were zzso in the primary dislocation group and zzso in the zzso dislocation zzso The overall treatment results in our study were zzso Although there was no statistical significance in surgical time between the two groups, when both SLAP and zzso zzso are present, the zzso zzso must be zzso first to reduce surgical zzso
