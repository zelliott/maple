The use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso have emerged as a valid diagnostic tools for prostate cancer zzso 

Men with zzso levels below 10 zzso were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and underwent combined zzso and zzso and zzso zzso prostate zzso Imaging was performed using a zzso T MR scanner zzso zzso Siemens, zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflated with 60 zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso data were acquired by using water and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso for quantitative detection of both zzso and zzso Dynamic zzso zzso sequences were obtained with zzso zzso zzso images before and during rapid zzso administration of intravenous zzso contrast medium zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, positive zzso value, negative zzso value, and accuracy were zzso considering patients, each of the 2 zzso each of the 6 zzso and each 12th part of the prostate zzso as single zzso 

Overall, 106 patients were included in the zzso Median age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso and median zzso level at study entry was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected at biopsy in 24 patients zzso % of the zzso with a median zzso score of 8 zzso zzso zzso accuracy of combined zzso and zzso was zzso sensitivity was zzso and specificity was zzso considering patients as single zzso with a negative zzso value of zzso but a positive zzso value of only zzso Positive zzso value of the examination improved to zzso for patients who repeated zzso 

Although this study confirms the potential usefulness of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso the positive zzso value obtained was unacceptably low due to the high number of false zzso zzso Nevertheless, the high negative zzso value of the examination may serve to avoid unnecessary zzso Future research should be directed at assessing the value of combining zzso techniques with novel zzso markers for the diagnosis of zzso in patients with low zzso zzso
