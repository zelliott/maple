To determine whether middle-aged and older individuals with impaired zzso zzso zzso but no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease, exhibit abnormal changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso or left zzso zzso mass when compared with healthy zzso 

From the Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso subjects with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with diabetes, all aged 45 to 85 years and without zzso coronary artery disease, underwent zzso zzso of total zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence or absence of other factors known to influence zzso zzso was zzso 

After adjustment for clinical factors known to modify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not increased in those with zzso compared with those with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso After accounting for clinical factors known to influence zzso mass, zzso mass was increased in those with diabetes relative to those with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in those with zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso and older individuals with the zzso state of zzso do not exhibit abnormal zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso relative to individuals with zzso For this reason, an opportunity may exist in those with zzso to prevent zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso that is observed in middle-aged and older individuals with zzso
