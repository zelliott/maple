The skeletal elements zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso they are composed of zzso zzso zzso and contain in a central zzso canal the zzso filament which consists of the zzso zzso The zzso filament, that zzso the zzso in its zzso axis exists also in the center of the spines which decorate the zzso During growth of the zzso new serially arranged zzso which are formed from zzso arranged zzso zzso are added at the tip of the zzso X-ray analysis revealed that these serial zzso are separated from each other by zzso zones zzso We describe that the zzso zzso of zzso of a new module originate from the zzso of the earlier module from where they zzso A cross section through the zzso axis shows that the bundle rays are organized in a concentric and radiate zzso High resolution magnetic resonance zzso studies showed that the zzso spheres of the zzso in the cone region contain high amounts of zzso zzso We conclude that the radiate zzso growth pattern of sponges is initiated in the zzso region zzso by newly growing zzso which are characterized by high amounts of zzso zzso subsequently zzso zzso are formed zzso around the zzso
