zzso is an important risk factor for brain zzso zzso in zzso stroke zzso However, beyond the qualitative label zzso little is known about the association with ambulatory blood pressure zzso zzso 

In 123 zzso zzso stroke patients we performed 24-hour ambulatory zzso monitoring after the acute zzso We counted zzso on zzso zzso MR zzso Because a different zzso for zzso according to location has been suggested, we distinguished between zzso in deep and zzso zzso 

zzso were seen in 36 zzso zzso After adjusting for age, sex, number of zzso drugs, zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso we found zzso day, and night zzso and zzso zzso levels to be significantly associated with the presence and number of zzso zzso ratios zzso to zzso per standard zzso increase in zzso zzso between different locations, various zzso characteristics were significantly associated with the presence of deep (or combined deep and zzso zzso but not with purely zzso zzso 

Our results underline the role of a high 24-hour zzso load as an important risk factor for zzso The association of zzso levels with deep but not purely zzso zzso is in line with the idea that different zzso might be zzso Deep zzso may be a particular marker of zzso small vessel disease, but zzso and larger studies are now warranted to substantiate these zzso
