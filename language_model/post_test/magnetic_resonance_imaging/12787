zzso corporal punishment zzso during childhood is a zzso zzso zzso associated with depression, aggression and addictive zzso Exposure to traumatic zzso such as sexual abuse, is associated with zzso in brain structure, but nothing is known about the potential zzso consequences of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso was associated with discernible zzso in gray matter volume zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso young adults zzso zzso were screened to identify 23 with exposure to zzso zzso 3 years zzso 12 episodes per year, frequently involving zzso and 22 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained using zzso 3 T trio zzso 

zzso was reduced by zzso in the right zzso frontal zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected cluster zzso by zzso in the left zzso frontal zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso and by zzso in the right anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso of zzso zzso There were significant correlations between zzso in these identified regions and performance zzso on the zzso 

zzso children to harsh zzso may have zzso effects on zzso of brain zzso However, it is also conceivable that differences in prefrontal cortical development may increase risk of exposure to zzso
