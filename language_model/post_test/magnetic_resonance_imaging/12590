Combining human functional zzso with other forms of zzso zzso including zzso monitoring, provides an empirical basis for understanding zzso zzso This approach can be applied to characterize unwanted zzso noise, examine the neural control and representation of bodily processes relevant to health and zzso and index covert expression of affective and cognitive processes to enhance the interpretation of zzso regional brain zzso In recent years, human zzso has been dominated by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The zzso information of zzso regarding central neural activity is zzso zzso by parallel zzso monitoring, yet such studies still remain in the zzso This review article highlights zzso studies that employed zzso zzso zzso zzso gastrointestinal and zzso zzso zzso to address specific questions regarding interaction between brain and bodily state in the context of experience, zzso emotion and zzso zzso monitoring within the zzso environment presents specific technical issues, most zzso related to zzso Mechanical and electrical hazards may present dangers to scanned subjects, operator and/or zzso Furthermore, zzso monitoring may interfere with the quality of zzso data, or itself be compromised by zzso induced by the operation of the zzso We review the sources of these potential problems and the current approaches and advice to enable the combination of zzso and zzso monitoring in a safe and effective zzso
