The aim of this study was to investigate the progression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso We studied 12 patients with early zzso and 11 healthy controls with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The PET scan was carried out twice with an average zzso of zzso zzso The regions of interest zzso and zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso were drawn on individual magnetic resonance imaging zzso images, matched with the PET images, and copied onto the PET zzso At the first PET scan in zzso patients, the zzso zzso in the anterior zzso was zzso zzso zzso which was zzso of the control mean, and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being only zzso of the control zzso For the zzso nucleus the corresponding figure was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the control zzso The zzso ratios had declined significantly by the time of the second PET scan and the absolute annual rate of decline of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso There was a statistically significant difference of the decline in the zzso zzso between the anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the rate of progression was calculated compared to the normal control mean, the rate of annual decline was zzso in the anterior zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso nucleus, without significant changes among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso and zzso sides were analyzed zzso the absolute decline of zzso zzso in the zzso was higher in the side zzso to the zzso symptoms than in the zzso side zzso zzso zzso for anterior zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso zzso In the zzso nucleus the absolute decline was not different between zzso and zzso sides zzso zzso zzso In healthy controls, no significant decline of zzso zzso was zzso The results are suggestive of slower progression in the zzso zzso where the disease is more advanced, but studies to follow up the same patient at several time points are needed to resolve this zzso zzso zzso zzso
