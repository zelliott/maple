zzso viability and left zzso zzso are important zzso of long-term outcomes in patients with zzso left zzso zzso The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that assessment of zzso viability and left zzso zzso will predict zzso mortality in high-risk patients with zzso left zzso dysfunction having coronary artery bypass zzso 

The study consisted of 79 consecutive patients with zzso zzso (age 65 zzso 9 years; zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso and zzso European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation zzso zzso having coronary artery bypass zzso zzso viability was assessed by delayed zzso magnetic resonance zzso Left zzso zzso was calculated using tissue zzso from zzso of regional zzso zzso times in left zzso zzso segments before coronary artery bypass zzso 

Twenty zzso patients died within 30 days following coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a larger extent of viable zzso zzso zzso zzso viable segments vs zzso zzso zzso viable zzso P zzso zzso and smaller left zzso zzso (75 zzso 5 zzso vs 179 zzso 83 zzso P zzso zzso than zzso The presence of significant zzso zzso zzso and absence of zzso viability zzso viable zzso independently predicted 30-day mortality with hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All but 2 patients zzso with viable zzso and without left zzso zzso survived coronary artery bypass surgery as compared with only 12 zzso patients with zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In high-risk patients with zzso left zzso dysfunction having coronary artery bypass surgery, both zzso viability and left zzso zzso are important zzso of zzso zzso Assessment of zzso viability and left zzso zzso should be a routine part of the zzso evaluation of these zzso
