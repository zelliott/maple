zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso measures using dynamic zzso contrast are extremely useful for identification of zzso zzso tissue in acute zzso However, errors in the measurement of cerebral blood flow zzso and mean transit time zzso can zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso measures enable better zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data were acquired from 19 acute stroke zzso zzso abnormalities were manually defined on zzso zzso maps zzso zzso zzso and corrected zzso zzso and on maps derived from an zzso input function placed within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso middle cerebral zzso zzso zzso volumes were correlated with 30-day zzso zzso zzso volumes and with clinical outcome using the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso 

zzso correlation zzso for comparing zzso volumes delineated on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps with 30-day zzso zzso volumes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively (all zzso The analogous correlation zzso for comparing 30-day National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso scores were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso volumes overestimated the extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso measures zzso correlated more accurately with final zzso volume and clinical zzso Such measures offer an improved zzso of the final zzso size in acute zzso
