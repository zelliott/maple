This study aimed to zzso through functional zzso zzso the zzso zzso associated with the consolidation process of two motor zzso motor sequence learning zzso and motor adaptation zzso Four groups of young healthy individuals were assigned to either zzso a zzso condition, in which they were scanned while practicing a finger sequence learning task or an zzso adaptation pointing task in the evening zzso and were scanned again 12 h later in the morning zzso or zzso a zzso condition, in which they were scanned on the zzso or the MA tasks in the morning and were zzso 12 h later in the zzso As expected and consistent with the behavioral results, the functional data revealed increased zzso changes of activity in the zzso for the zzso group compared with the zzso group in the zzso zzso By contrast, the results of the MA task did not show any difference in zzso activity between the zzso and zzso zzso When the two MA task groups were combined, however, increased zzso activity was found in zzso VI of the zzso zzso Together, these findings highlight the presence of both functional and structural zzso reflecting the zzso consolidation processes of zzso and zzso They suggest that zzso consolidation is sleep dependent and reflected by a differential increase of neural activity within the zzso system, whereas MA consolidation zzso either a period of daytime or sleep and is associated with increased zzso activity within the zzso zzso
