Previous research suggests that genetic variations regulating zzso zzso mediate individual differences in the neural network underlying impulsive and aggressive zzso Although with conflicting findings, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso have been associated with an increased risk to develop impulsive and aggressive zzso Double zzso mice studies have also demonstrated that zzso and zzso genes strongly interact in the zzso zzso leading to the zzso zzso however, their potential interactive effect in human brain remains zzso We used blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the independent and interactive effects of both zzso and zzso zzso on the brain activity zzso by a response zzso task in healthy zzso zzso analysis demonstrated an individual effect of both zzso and zzso zzso and a strong zzso interaction in the anterior zzso zzso zzso a key region implicated in cognitive control and in the zzso of impulsive and aggressive zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso interaction exerts a significant zzso on the zzso response associated with response zzso and contribute to validate zzso models as useful tools for a better understanding of the zzso underlying complex cognitive zzso
