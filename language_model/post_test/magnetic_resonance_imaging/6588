The use of Cartesian feedback is proposed to solve the problem of using an array of coils for the purposes of transmission in magnetic resonance zzso The difficulties caused by direct and zzso zzso interactions are briefly zzso and the known solutions of using zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is then shown that, without loss of zzso efficiency, a high effective zzso may be created in series with each zzso in the array by the use of Cartesian negative zzso A bench experiment is described that confirms the zzso The solution is also viable for signal reception and is more zzso than zzso zzso albeit over a smaller zzso
