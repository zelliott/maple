zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to investigate the changes in blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso accompanying zzso zzso Eight healthy volunteers performed a periodic right-hand pinch grip every second using zzso of their maximum voluntary contraction zzso a paradigm previously shown to produce robust zzso zzso zzso To simultaneously zzso zzso and zzso signals, an zzso zzso zzso zzso spin labeling zzso and zzso zzso echo sequence was zzso The zzso was calculated using the zzso dilution model, zzso by data measured during graded zzso In all subjects, zzso zzso and zzso signals increased in the zzso and decreased in the zzso primary motor zzso zzso The relative changes in zzso and zzso were zzso zzso with a slope of approximately zzso The zzso ratio thus established for both positive and negative zzso and zzso changes is in close agreement with the ones observed by earlier studies investigating zzso zzso and oxygen consumption zzso These findings characterize the zzso and zzso zzso accompanying zzso zzso and thereby establish the sustained negative zzso response as a marker of zzso zzso
