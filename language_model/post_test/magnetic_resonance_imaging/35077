zzso zzso zzso is used as an immediate zzso quality control, allowing surgeons to extend zzso in situations involving residual zzso zzso Despite these advantages, zzso zzso has some limitations with regards to image quality and zzso The aim of this study is to report our experience with bone wax and zzso cotton zzso in obtaining precise zzso zzso margins using zzso zzso 

The study group included 63 consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso surgery with use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Louisville, zzso zzso The indications for zzso zzso use included a zzso or zzso extension zzso zzso 23), cavernous zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso a zzso located in the vicinity of critical zzso structures (such as the internal carotid artery, zzso zzso 10), zzso or revision procedures zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging revealing unusual anatomy zzso zzso zzso 

Overall, among the 51 patients with intended complete zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso remnants or suspicious findings in 13 patients zzso leading to an extended zzso and allowing completion of the zzso in 10 zzso There was an increased rate of complete zzso removal from zzso zzso out of zzso to zzso zzso out of zzso The zzso scan for complete zzso removal was more efficient in the group receiving zzso cotton zzso zzso than in the group receiving bone wax or the conventional method zzso The results of zzso and the zzso by the surgeon concerning the extent of zzso revealed a zzso in five patients zzso in the zzso cotton zzso application group, and in 14 zzso of the bone wax application zzso 

More valuable information for determining the zzso margin can be obtained with the use of zzso zzso packing in the zzso zzso cavity during zzso zzso We believe that the use of this simple method reduces the zzso results and also overcomes the disadvantages of zzso zzso
