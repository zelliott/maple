Although animal data are zzso evidence for an zzso of the zzso zzso system in human focal zzso is zzso 

To zzso zzso density, we studied seven patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso and nine zzso controls with zzso zzso zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suitable for imaging zzso zzso zzso was defined by zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso and was due to zzso sclerosis zzso based on zzso in all zzso zzso analysis was based on regions of interest zzso defined on individual zzso For each patient, binding potential zzso was calculated by using the simplified reference tissue model, and the zzso was compared with the unaffected zzso in each zzso To confirm the results, an additional zzso group analysis was performed by using statistical zzso zzso 

Compared with controls, zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso zzso lobe in all zzso On zzso analysis, this reduction was evident in areas surrounding the zzso zone at the pole zzso and lateral aspects zzso of the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR volume zzso were significantly reduced, no significant decrease of zzso zzso was zzso Reduction of zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso 

zzso binding is reduced at the pole and in lateral aspects of the zzso zzso lobe in patients with zzso zzso and zzso This area might zzso to zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso receptors might play a specific role in the zzso of zzso zzso
