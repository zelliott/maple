zzso resonance imaging zzso has been proven capable of showing inflammatory and structural changes in patients with zzso zzso and has become widely used in the diagnosis of zzso Despite this, no systematic reviews evaluate the diagnostic utility of zzso for zzso zzso the objective of this systematic review was to determine the evidence for the utility of zzso in the clinical diagnosis of zzso The aims were to identify which zzso findings are associated with the diagnosis of zzso and to zzso this zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso criteria were zzso or zzso zzso or cohort zzso zzso The studies required a group with either zzso or inflammatory back pain zzso and a zzso group without zzso or zzso Each group required a minimum of 20 zzso The included articles had to report results containing raw numbers suitable for the construction of zzso tables or report results by sensitivity and specificity for zzso studies or odds ratios, relative risk ratios, or likelihood ratios for zzso zzso zzso quality was assessed by using criteria based on the zzso zzso 

In total, zzso articles were identified in zzso and zzso before November zzso All articles were reviewed by title and zzso zzso articles were reviewed by full text, and 10 met the inclusion zzso Two were considered of high zzso one evaluated the zzso zzso and the other, the zzso Because of the small number of high-quality studies, a zzso was not zzso The two high-quality studies found a positive association between zzso findings zzso zzso zzso zzso fat zzso global assessment of zzso and zzso and the diagnosis of zzso and zzso 

In this review, several zzso findings were found to be associated with zzso However, because of the small number of high-quality studies, the evidence for the utility of zzso in the diagnosis of zzso must be considered zzso zzso caution should be taken to ensure that inflammatory and structural zzso findings are not interpreted as being more specific for zzso than is supported by zzso
