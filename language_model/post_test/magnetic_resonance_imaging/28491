An accurate knowledge of cerebral anatomy is important in order to evaluate the precise location of a cerebral zzso zzso structures are identified by knowledge of the adjacent zzso and zzso however, white matter tracts are difficult to differentiate from one another due to the lack of clear zzso zzso zzso even if zzso shows obvious white matter zzso in some cases it is difficult accurately to zzso the zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate the location of the main white matter tracts by using three-dimensional MR zzso zzso study was performed by zzso zzso zzso General zzso Computer assisted analysis with zzso software zzso zzso was used to generate both surface brain and zzso zzso The exact zzso basis of white matter signal abnormalities is important when analyzing patients with zzso syndromes or zzso deficits such as zzso zzso zzso deficit zzso This preliminary attempt at constructing a three-dimensional zzso white matter zzso of the brain may be helpful for evaluating the zzso correlations in these patients, and also as teaching materials for the clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
