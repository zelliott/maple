A new zzso zzso echo zzso registration technique is zzso This technique starts by collecting a set of zzso templates at a reference zzso These templates are acquired by rotating the zzso system to result in rotation angles that zzso cover a zzso range of zzso The rotation angles between an unknown physically transformed position and the reference position are subsequently determined by finding the template with the lowest sum of squared differences with zzso at the transformed zzso zzso are calculated from the phase differences between the zzso zzso template and the zzso acquired at the transformed zzso In comparison with the conventional zzso registration technique, the proposed technique is zzso zzso and can detect zzso rigid body motion in less than 50 zzso The technique was verified with phantom and in zzso experiments, which demonstrated zzso zzso and zzso zzso accuracy over a range of simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
