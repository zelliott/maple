The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of this novel zzso zzso scaffold to treat partial zzso zzso 

zzso patients (11 men and 7 women, mean age: 45 zzso affected by zzso acute zzso tears requiring partial zzso or chronic prior loss of zzso tissue were enrolled in the zzso They underwent zzso zzso zzso scaffold zzso (13 zzso and 5 zzso and, in case of presence of other zzso concurrent procedures were also zzso Patients were zzso evaluated up to 2 years of follow-up through zzso objective, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso evaluation of the zzso scaffold was zzso 

No major adverse events were zzso A statistically significant increase in all the clinical parameters considered was zzso The zzso objective score increased from 61 % of normal or nearly normal knees at zzso evaluation to 94 % at 2 years of follow-up zzso zzso zzso There was also a significant increase in the zzso zzso score both at zzso months of follow-up zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso which was confirmed at 24 zzso The zzso score also showed a significant increase from the zzso level zzso value 2, range zzso to final evaluation zzso value 3, range zzso p zzso zzso albeit not reaching the zzso sports activity zzso 

The zzso of this novel zzso scaffold proved to be a safe and potentially effective procedure to treat partial zzso loss with encouraging results at short-term zzso Further high-quality studies with larger numbers of patients and longer evaluation times are needed to confirm these preliminary zzso
