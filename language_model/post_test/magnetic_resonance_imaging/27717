The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of zzso and quantitative zzso magnetic resonance imaging in the differentiation of adrenal zzso and zzso 

One hundred eight patients zzso men and 63 zzso mean age, 57 zzso with 126 adrenal masses were zzso evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging in this zzso Signal intensity and apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images and on zzso images, zzso zzso signal intensity index zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso values were assessed zzso The threshold values of more than zzso for zzso and less than zzso for zzso were regarded as highly suggestive of zzso zzso We also investigated whether a zzso value for zzso could be found in distinguishing zzso from zzso Final diagnoses of adrenal zzso were based on follow-up imaging, zzso proof, and adrenal zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso values of zzso and zzso were compared by using the Student zzso test, and zzso and zzso values of the zzso were compared by using the zzso U test, and a P zzso zzso was accepted as statistically zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis and sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values, and overall zzso were zzso 

Final analysis yielded 96 zzso and 30 zzso With the commonly used zzso threshold value for zzso we obtained a zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, and zzso negative zzso zzso The overall accuracy was found as zzso When we applied a zzso threshold value for zzso it yielded a zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, and a zzso negative zzso zzso The overall accuracy was zzso The mean zzso values were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The difference between the groups with these zzso values was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The receiver operating characteristic analysis could not determine a clear zzso value for the differentiation of zzso from zzso 

We can advocate that a zzso magnetic resonance imaging using quantitative parameters zzso zzso and zzso zzso has an important role in the distinction of zzso from zzso These 2 techniques seem to provide close sensitivity, zzso and accuracy zzso But zzso imaging using quantitative zzso zzso is not of value in this differential diagnosis because of the substantial overlapping of zzso values between zzso and zzso
