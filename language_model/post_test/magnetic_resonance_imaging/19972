The human zzso vocal tract develops to form a unique zzso zzso with equally long horizontal and vertical zzso This anatomy contributes greatly to the zzso foundations of human zzso It is believed to depend on the reduced growth of the zzso and on the zzso descent of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso the descent of the zzso is accomplished through both the descent of the zzso skeleton relative to the zzso and the descent of the zzso relative to the zzso We have studied the development of three living chimpanzees using magnetic resonance zzso Our previous study showed that, as in humans, chimpanzees show rapid zzso zzso with changes in the relative proportion of the vocal tract during early zzso However, this is not accompanied by the descent of the zzso relative to the zzso although it is achieved with the descent of the zzso skeleton relative to the zzso Here, we show that subsequently the zzso zzso also descends to maintain the rapid descent of the zzso similarly to zzso We argue that the descent of the zzso probably evolved in a common zzso of extant zzso originally to zzso an advantage via a function unrelated to zzso Thus, the descent of the zzso per zzso is not unique to humans, and facial zzso was probably the major factor that paved the way for speech in the human zzso
