To compare the structure and function of the zzso zzso and the zzso support in zzso black and white zzso 

zzso black women zzso age zzso zzso and 17 white women zzso age zzso zzso completed this zzso zzso The following assessments were made: zzso function using zzso zzso and zzso pressure zzso pelvic muscle strength using an zzso zzso zzso mobility using the zzso test and zzso zzso and pelvic muscle bulk using magnetic resonance zzso 

Black women demonstrated a zzso higher average zzso closure pressure during a maximum pelvic muscle contraction zzso zzso zzso versus 119 zzso zzso in the white zzso P zzso Although not statistically zzso black women had a zzso higher maximum zzso closure pressure at rest zzso zzso zzso versus 95 zzso zzso P zzso and a zzso larger zzso volume zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso In addition, there was a zzso greater zzso neck mobility measured with the zzso test zzso 49 degrees versus whites 36 zzso P zzso and a zzso difference in zzso measured zzso neck mobility during a maximum zzso effort zzso zzso zzso zzso versus whites zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso and zzso differences exist in the zzso zzso and support system of zzso black and white zzso
