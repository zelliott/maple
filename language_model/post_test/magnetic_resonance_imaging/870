Clinical zzso embolism shows both zzso and irreversible zzso We used MR imaging to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso induced with a zzso technique and to evaluate the zzso zzso 

A fat emulsion was made with zzso zzso of zzso and 20 zzso of normal saline and vigorous zzso movement through a three-way zzso In 50 zzso the internal carotid artery was infused with the fat zzso Cats were divided into six groups on the basis of time delay after zzso 1 hour; 1 and 4 zzso and 1, 2, and 3 zzso MR imaging and zzso examination were performed at these zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso on zzso images, zzso or mildly zzso on zzso images, zzso on apparent diffusion zzso zzso and enhancing on zzso zzso images at 1 zzso These MR imaging findings were less evident at day 1 and reverted to normal after day 4 zzso on all zzso zzso zzso showed minimal findings in the cortical zzso in groups 1 and 2 zzso 1 at 1 hour and group 2 at 1 hour and 1 zzso Light microscopic findings revealed evidence of zzso focal zzso and zzso in the zzso white zzso only one zzso The number of zzso fat zzso was not significantly different between groups, as zzso by oil red O zzso 

zzso embolism induced by a zzso emulsion revealed zzso MR findings and minimal zzso zzso
