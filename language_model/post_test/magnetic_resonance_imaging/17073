zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso decomposition of iron zzso must be rendered zzso for their application as zzso contrast zzso This process requires zzso the surface of the zzso with a zzso organic coating such as zzso zzso Two parameters were found to influence the magnetic behavior and zzso of the resulting zzso iron oxide zzso the functionality of the zzso group and the protocol followed for the zzso zzso coated with zzso via a zzso zzso zzso maintain the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso decrease the zzso and zzso of the contrast zzso The protocol for zzso the zzso also influences the magnetic behavior of the zzso zzso zzso according to a direct zzso protocol exhibit higher zzso than those zzso according to a zzso procedure which first involves stripping the zzso This research presents the first systematic study of both the binding zzso and the zzso protocol on the zzso and zzso of zzso coated iron oxide zzso used as zzso contrast zzso
