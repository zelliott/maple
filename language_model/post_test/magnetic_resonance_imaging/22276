We have treated patients with brain surface tumors by using video registration of a three-dimensional image to the surgical field, to identify eloquent zzso zzso the zzso and define the tumor zzso zzso registration using the skin surface to produce alignment was performed earlier but was difficult in areas with few prominent registration zzso For this reason, zzso registration using the cortical vessels as zzso was applied to 17 cases, to improve zzso This article presents the advantages and limitations of zzso zzso as determined from the data for these zzso The accuracy is also zzso 

A three-dimensional model was reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging data, and a two-dimensional projection was superimposed on the video image of the actual surgical zzso The tumor was zzso with guidance from the registered video zzso The two-dimensional projection accuracy of zzso registration was compared with that of zzso registration by using a phantom zzso 

All 17 tumors underwent gross total zzso and the patients experienced no major permanent neurological zzso In the phantom study, the zzso projected, target registration error of a tumor with zzso registration was estimated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and that with zzso registration was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Video registration using cortical surface vessels is practical and improves two-dimensional projection accuracy significantly, compared with skin zzso
