This study evaluated the accuracy of zzso to predict the prognosis of Bell's zzso and zzso zzso 

A retrospective, institutional review zzso zzso 

A secondary referral and a zzso zzso 

The patients had been treated for a sudden onset unilateral facial paralysis over the past 10 years zzso This retrospective study included only those patients who had been followed up for at least 3 months or if they had reached a complete recovery before zzso 

zzso grade versus zzso zzso 

The recovery rates to zzso grade II or better were zzso in those with Bell's zzso and zzso in those with zzso zzso zzso The zzso value of the recovery and zzso groups from those with either Bell's zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso model between the zzso values and the probability of recovery showed no correlation in those with Bell's zzso or with zzso zzso zzso This study did not identify the proper zzso value that had enough appropriate sensitivity and specificity to predict the prognosis of paralysis accurately in Bell's zzso or in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso performed between day 7 and 10 for Bell's zzso or day 10 and 14 for zzso zzso zzso does not provide accurate information on the prognosis or recovery rate of the facial zzso
