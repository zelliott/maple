Thirty-four rats undergoing 90 minutes of temporary middle cerebral artery zzso were randomly and blindly assigned to vehicle or zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 30 minutes after zzso zzso followed by a 5 zzso zzso infusion for zzso hours zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed before treatment and repeatedly after zzso zzso analysis was used to define zzso zzso The size of the zzso zzso including the zzso core and zzso was not different between the two groups before zzso However, a significant difference in zzso zzso size was detected beginning zzso hours after zzso The size of the zzso core was significantly smaller in the treatment group, while the size of the zzso zzso was similar in the two groups at 85 minutes after zzso zzso zzso zzso size at 24 hours was significantly smaller in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can reduce zzso zzso size, which is probably attributable to zzso of expansion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
