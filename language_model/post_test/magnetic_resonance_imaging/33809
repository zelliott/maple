The authors sought to compare zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso from extracts of zzso and high-grade zzso especially with respect to the signals of zzso zzso 

zzso acid extracts of six high-grade and six zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso MRS at zzso zzso 

The signals of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso were identified in both types of zzso The absolute zzso of all zzso compounds zzso + PC + zzso in high-grade and zzso zzso were significantly zzso The relative contributions of each of the zzso compounds to the total zzso signal were also statistically zzso For high-grade zzso the zzso signal is composed of zzso PC, and zzso in a well-balanced contribution, whereas in zzso zzso the signal is largely due to zzso with a small involvement of PC and zzso 

The differences in the concentration and the zzso of zzso compounds seem to be a marker of high-grade zzso They could also help to discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso in some difficult cases, especially if there is zzso uncertainty between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
