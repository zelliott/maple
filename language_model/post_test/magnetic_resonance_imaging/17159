zzso surgery of the human zzso is a zzso achievement of the zzso zzso Our purpose was to provide a clinically oriented study focused on the detailed zzso anatomy of the zzso with great respect to its zzso We tried to offer a guide of zzso zzso targeting for zzso 

For our imaging study, we used cerebral magnetic resonance images zzso from 26 zzso patients zzso zzso The material of our zzso study consisted of 32 cerebral zzso (32 zzso from 18 normal human zzso which we have in our Department zzso of zzso from zzso zzso We measured and analyzed the X, zzso Y, zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates of the zzso at specific clinically important zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our principal findings contain a zzso guide for in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso a standard for the zzso specific zzso zone of the human brain zzso two specific standard zzso areas zzso zzso and the most reliable zzso standard area of the human zzso zzso 

We provide a zzso zzso guide for some common targeting zzso of the zzso zzso surgery, resulted from detailed analysis and careful combination of the measured data of our clinically oriented zzso We hope that our work will be a really useful guide for zzso applying deep brain stimulation of the zzso
