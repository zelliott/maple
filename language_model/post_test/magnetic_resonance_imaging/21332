An Alzheimer's zzso study has motivated us to evaluate zzso correlations during rest between zzso We apply generalized zzso equation zzso models to test for differences in regional correlations across zzso Both the zzso marginal model and zzso transition model are evaluated and compared to the standard pooling zzso approach using simulation zzso Standard errors of all methods are estimated both theoretically zzso and zzso zzso Of all the methods, we find that the transition models have the best statistical zzso Overall, the zzso standard errors and zzso standard errors perform about the zzso We also demonstrate the methods with a functional connectivity study in a healthy cognitively normal population of zzso participants and zzso participants who are recruited from the Adult Children's Study conducted at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research zzso
