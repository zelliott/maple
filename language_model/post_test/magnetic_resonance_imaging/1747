In this study, we propose a quality control program for zzso focused ultrasound zzso zzso treatment to assess zzso beam positioning zzso zzso power delivery zzso MR imaging quality, and zzso zzso system zzso A total of 353 zzso points in Lucite cards were measured, the average placement errors were zzso zzso in the zzso direction and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was calculated from MR phase difference images and the measured water zzso chemical shift zzso temperature zzso zzso temperature zzso for zzso yielded a temperature zzso of zzso zzso zzso Sixteen experiments were conducted using six different zzso to test the reliability of zzso power zzso zzso and zzso power calculated from phantom images were analyzed and stored at the MR zzso A computer program was developed to integrate the system power delivery and the MR image quality control into one automated zzso In the clinical trial at our institution, we expect this quality control program to be carried out before each patient zzso If measured quality control values exceeds or below the zzso values, a system service and zzso should be conducted before the zzso
