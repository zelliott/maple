This report describes a zzso simulation and zzso zzso system for use with three-dimensional functional images in zzso zzso The system, which produces three-dimensional functional images by zzso of the generators of zzso evoked zzso derived from zzso zzso was applied in the zzso zzso of central zzso in 12 patients with zzso zzso The zzso zzso of central zzso was assessed by zzso cortical recording of zzso evoked zzso in three zzso In six patients, three-dimensional computer graphics were reconstructed from magnetic resonance images and allowed zzso of the zzso through the zzso views of the scalp surface and the zzso The three-dimensional functional images were created by zzso the generators of zzso evoked zzso on three-dimensional computer zzso This combined technique provided zzso data regarding the three-dimensional relationship between the zzso zzso and the zzso We also developed a three-dimensional zzso that incorporates a mechanical arm and a laser zzso for use in zzso information obtained in the zzso simulation into the surgical zzso zzso zzso can be performed in real time on the three-dimensional computer graphics in combination with the functional images created from zzso zzso This system was applied in five patients who underwent surgical brain tumor zzso with minimal damage to the normal brain zzso The use of this system for zzso zzso increased the safety of the surgery by zzso zzso simulation and zzso zzso with the three-dimensional functional zzso Two illustrative case reports are zzso
