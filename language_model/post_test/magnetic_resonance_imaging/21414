To determine optimal zzso in the 3 zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, and zzso based on zzso zzso 

In 78 consecutive zzso patients operated for zzso zzso features were classified as zzso type 1 zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso or type 3 zzso zzso zzso poor zzso zzso matter zzso zzso between zzso zzso findings, and surgical outcome were established for each zzso zzso 

Type 1 zzso zzso cases, in zzso and zzso zzso always corresponded to simple or complex zzso Type 2 zzso zzso cases, predominantly in zzso zzso and type 3 zzso zzso cases, mainly in the zzso zzso zzso corresponded to zzso zzso The zzso zone zzso differed significantly according to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It zzso with the tumor in type 1 zzso included zzso zzso in type 2 zzso and involved extensive areas in type 3 zzso zzso zzso was predominantly found in type 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso The main zzso factors for zzso outcome zzso were complete tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Other factors favorably influencing the outcome were a short zzso duration zzso zzso zzso and absence of zzso damage at the zzso site zzso zzso zzso Age at surgery was not related to zzso however, zzso damage was correlated with old age zzso zzso zzso Treatment zzso was correlated with young age at surgery zzso zzso zzso and short zzso duration zzso zzso zzso 

We propose that zzso might be restricted to the tumor in type 1 zzso and be more extensive in other zzso zzso especially in type 3 zzso Early surgery and clean surgical margins are crucial for curing zzso
