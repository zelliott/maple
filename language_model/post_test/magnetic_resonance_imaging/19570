To determine the appropriate use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging for zzso staging of prostate zzso 

Literature review was performed by using the principles of evidence-based medicine and medical technology zzso A decision zzso model was used to compare zzso the strategy that radical zzso is performed on the basis of clinical staging with zzso the strategy that zzso disease detected at MR imaging zzso radical zzso in patients who were considered surgical candidates on the basis of clinical zzso 

After review of the literature, expert panel opinion did not recommend MR zzso No studies in which therapeutic efficacy was addressed were zzso The decision zzso model indicated that the strategy including MR staging decreased costs zzso imaging, zzso radical zzso zzso and resulted in almost equal life expectancy zzso imaging, zzso years; radical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging, zzso radical zzso zzso zzso of sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the MR strategy was both more effective and less costly if the prior probability of zzso disease was at least zzso when considering zzso and 50% when considering zzso life zzso 

It is not yet zzso determined whether zzso MR staging is appropriate, but results of decision analysis suggest that MR staging is cost-effective for men with moderate or high prior probability of zzso zzso
