This paper describes zzso particles that are designed to induce zzso contrast zzso zzso in zzso The contrast agents consist of discrete zzso complexes zzso to 10 zzso diameter silver zzso The zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso undergo zzso to particle surfaces through zzso or zzso groups, respectively, to form two new contrast zzso The resulting zzso zzso are characterized on the basis of their zzso zzso zzso and contrast enhancing zzso The average zzso zzso of the of the surface bound complexes zzso at zzso T and 25 degrees zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, as compared to zzso zzso zzso for the clinical agent zzso zzso the respective whole particle zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso
