An image patch can be locally zzso into zzso waves of different zzso spatial zzso zzso and zzso The local phase information is essential for perception, because important visual features like edges emerge at locations of zzso local phase zzso zzso of phase zzso requires integration of spatial frequency information across multiple spatial zzso Models of early visual processing suggest that the visual system should implement zzso pooling of spatial frequency information in the identification of broadband zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso adaptation to look for zzso neural responses in the human visual zzso We found sensitivity to the phase difference between spatial frequency components in all studied visual areas, including the primary visual zzso zzso Control experiments demonstrated that these results were not explained by differences in contrast or zzso Next, we compared zzso responses for broadband compound grating stimuli with zzso and random phase zzso All studied visual areas showed stronger responses for the stimuli with zzso phase zzso In addition, selectivity to phase zzso increased from zzso to zzso visual areas along both the zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that human zzso already shows zzso pooling of spatial zzso but only zzso visual areas might be capable of pooling spatial frequency information across spatial scales typical for broadband natural zzso
