Over the last several years, neuroscientists have been increasingly using zzso techniques to unravel the zzso underlying cognitive aging, and in more recent years to explore the role of genes on the zzso of the aging zzso One of the primary goals of this research is to identify proteins involved in cognitive aging with the hope that this would facilitate the development of novel treatments to combat cognitive zzso Further, it is likely with early identification of susceptible individuals, early intervention through zzso changes and other methods could increase an zzso resilience to the effects of zzso
