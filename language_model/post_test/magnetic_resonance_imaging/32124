Brain zzso is widely used for evaluating tissue zzso however, the zzso methods are rarely validated and use arbitrary planes to mark boundaries of brain zzso The goal of this study was to zzso zzso and apply an MR imaging tracing method for the zzso of 3 major zzso of the frontal zzso which uses only local landmarks intrinsic to the structures of interest, without the need for global zzso or the use of dividing planes or zzso 

Studies were performed on 25 zzso controls and subjects diagnosed with zzso body zzso and zzso zzso significant variation in the underlying zzso anatomy and state of zzso The protocol was evaluated by using multiple observers tracing scans of subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease and those aging zzso and the results were compared by spatial overlap zzso To confirm the results, observers marked the same locations in different zzso We illustrated the zzso of the key boundaries that pose the greatest challenge to defining consistent zzso across zzso 

The resulting zzso volumes were zzso and their consistency across zzso was used as an additional assessment of the zzso of our marking zzso The agreement on a scale of zzso was found to be zzso spatial and zzso zzso for the same zzso and zzso spatial and zzso zzso for 2 different zzso The results revealed that the protocol remained consistent across different neurodegenerative zzso 

Our method provides a simple and reliable way for the zzso evaluation of frontal lobe zzso and can be used as a resource for larger comparative studies as well as a validation procedure of automated zzso
