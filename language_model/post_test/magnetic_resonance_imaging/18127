Studies have shown that both high and low blood pressure zzso may play a role in the zzso of brain zzso High zzso in zzso has been associated with more brain zzso later in life, whereas studies in older populations have shown a relation between low zzso and more brain zzso Yet, prospective evidence is zzso and the relation remains unclear in patients with manifest zzso zzso 

To examine the associations of baseline zzso and change in zzso over time with progression of brain zzso 

The Secondary zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Study is a prospective cohort study with baseline zzso in zzso and follow-up zzso in zzso The mean follow-up time was zzso zzso 

University Medical Center zzso the zzso 

A total of zzso patients zzso zzso age, 57 zzso years; zzso zzso with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal zzso aneurysm were zzso 

Using automated zzso at baseline and zzso change in brain zzso zzso cortical gray matter zzso and zzso fraction zzso were zzso as indicators of progression of zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso 

zzso adjusted zzso analysis showed that patients with lower baseline zzso zzso zzso or mean zzso pressure had more progression of zzso zzso The mean differences in the change in zzso fraction between low and high zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and between low and high mean zzso pressure was zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in patients with higher baseline zzso zzso mean zzso pressure, or zzso zzso those with declining zzso levels over time had less progression of zzso zzso compared with those with rising zzso zzso 

In patients with manifest zzso disease, low baseline zzso was associated with more progression of zzso zzso irrespective of the zzso course during zzso Furthermore, in patients with higher baseline zzso declining zzso levels over time were associated with less progression of zzso zzso This could imply that zzso lowering is beneficial in patients with higher zzso levels, but caution should be taken with further zzso lowering in patients who already have a low zzso
