zzso chronically abusing organic zzso have been reported in the medical literature for almost four decades to have a variety of neurological zzso Most have been single case reports or studies in small numbers of zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso and zzso effects of chronic zzso abuse in a larger group of individuals and compare the results to a control group of other drug zzso Attempts to estimate a zzso relationship between zzso abuse and either zzso tests or magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities were also zzso 

A sample of 55 zzso abusers was compared to a sample of 61 users of other drugs, especially cocaine and alcohol, on a battery of cognitive and zzso zzso Fifty of the zzso abusers and 51 members of the comparison sample also underwent zzso of the zzso Comparisons were made by means of zzso analysis of zzso and zzso 

Compared to the general population, both groups performed poorly, scoring below the mean on most zzso zzso zzso abusers performed more poorly than the comparison sample on measures of working memory and executive cognitive zzso Both groups showed evidence of abnormal zzso findings, but a greater percentage of the zzso abuse group showed such zzso No clear zzso relationship was seen between zzso abuse and abnormalities on zzso tests, but a strong zzso relationship was seen in the presence of zzso zzso 

The findings in this study document widespread cognitive zzso which could not be attributed to the effects of zzso zzso These findings expand upon previous data regarding neurological abnormalities in zzso zzso by demonstrating a zzso relationship with zzso zzso An unexpected finding was the high prevalence of zzso impairment and zzso abnormalities among the comparison zzso The results of this study has implications regarding low-level zzso exposure, as in the occupational setting, suggesting that zzso may be a more useful tool to sort out the presence of neurological abnormalities rather than zzso zzso Since no zzso relationship was seen between zzso abuse and zzso testing, reliance upon these tests in assessing neurological injury from zzso is a highly dubious zzso
