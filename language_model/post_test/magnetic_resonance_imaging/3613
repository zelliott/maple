The comparison of systematic prostate zzso zzso with zzso including additional zzso based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso suspicious for prostate cancer zzso has been zzso This study focuses on additional zzso based on zzso findings for better cancer zzso 

Data were collected from zzso men who underwent zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso 1: 395 zzso and a zzso zzso plus 1-3 additional zzso based on zzso zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso of two groups revealed how the additional zzso taken with zzso findings affected zzso zzso 

Group 1 had 205 cases zzso and group 2 had 55 cases zzso of zzso zzso This difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Only 1 of the 55 patients zzso in group 2 had cancer only in the additional zzso based on zzso In other words, only zzso zzso patients was diagnosed with zzso only by the additional core zzso 

We suggest that systematic zzso zzso zzso peripheral zone + 4 transitional zone + 2 far lateral peripheral zzso can be considered an excellent tool for zzso detection and there may be no need for additional zzso based on zzso findings for zzso zzso
