This study evaluates the zzso conventional zzso zzso and clinical testing in zzso patients with cuff tear zzso It analyses the zzso findings in relation to the status of the rotator cuff and clinical status as also the clinical testing in relation to the rotator cuff zzso The aim of the study is to define the usefulness of zzso and clinical examination in cuff tear zzso 

This study analyses the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and clinical characteristics zzso plus active and passive mobility zzso and the zzso findings in a cohort of 307 zzso These patients were part of a zzso retrospective, consecutive study of the French zzso Society zzso All patients had no surgical zzso and were all treated with prosthetic shoulder surgery for a painful zzso cuff tear zzso zzso or zzso or double zzso zzso zzso 

A positive zzso could be found for the relationship between clinical testing and the rotator cuff zzso between zzso distance and zzso rotator cuff zzso between zzso and zzso rotator cuff zzso 

A conventional zzso zzso can not provide any zzso information on the clinical status of the zzso The zzso muscle can be well tested by the press belly test and the zzso minor muscle can be well tested by the zzso sign and by the zzso lag zzso The upward migration index and the presence of zzso are good indicators for the evaluation of the zzso rotator zzso An inferior zzso tip positioning suggests rotator cuff zzso
