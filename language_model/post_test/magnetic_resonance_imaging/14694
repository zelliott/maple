This study investigated white matter zzso in the corpus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using diffusion zzso imaging and zzso transfer imaging, in participants with severe traumatic brain injury zzso and related these changes to processing speed zzso 

Fourteen adult participants with severe zzso underwent zzso and assessment, using the zzso zzso zzso Test and zzso zzso Part B, at approximately 6 months zzso Thirteen demographically similar, zzso intact adults were zzso for zzso 

The zzso group demonstrated lower fractional zzso zzso for the right zzso and higher apparent diffusion zzso zzso for the zzso zzso than the control zzso Lower zzso and higher zzso were noted in all zzso zzso zzso transfer imaging revealed smaller zzso transfer ratios zzso in the right and left zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Written zzso zzso zzso Test performance was related to right zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso whereas oral zzso zzso zzso Test was related to right zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Part B, was related to right zzso zzso and zzso 

Advanced zzso zzso such as diffusion zzso imaging and zzso transfer imaging demonstrate significant zzso in white matter, which are related to processing zzso These techniques may be useful in zzso the extent of injury even in normal appearing white matter after zzso
