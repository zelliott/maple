Plain and zzso CT of the brain (10 and 10), MR studies (1 zzso and 1 zzso and autopsy findings in 11 AIDS patients with zzso zzso were zzso The imaging studies and pathological specimens were analyzed for signs of meningitis, presence of zzso zzso spaces, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Five of 11 patients were found at autopsy to have zzso visible zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that were not detected on CT (10 zzso but were seen on zzso MR (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected by CT in 5 of 11 patients and by MR in 2 of 2 zzso Enhancement of the zzso was seen in only 1 patient by CT despite pathological evidence of zzso meningitis in all 11 zzso zzso zzso spaces were seen in all 11 zzso specimens and in the 2 MR studies but not on zzso zzso zzso was detected by CT in two zzso 

CT scans of the brain underestimate zzso zzso zzso zzso MR is a more sensitive procedure to evaluate zzso and zzso zzso including the zzso zzso which in our autopsy series was not an uncommon site to be infected with zzso zzso zzso
