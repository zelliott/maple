The zzso of the early stages of hand zzso is poorly zzso but recent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies suggest that the joint ligaments have a major role in the zzso expression of the zzso 

To combine zzso and zzso zzso studies to better understand the mechanisms of damage, and especially the role of joint ligaments and zzso in disease zzso 

zzso was carried out in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in 20 patients with zzso with a disease duration zzso or zzso 12 zzso zzso sections of the zzso and zzso zzso were obtained from three zzso specimens for comparative zzso 

The collateral ligaments influenced the location of both zzso bone zzso and bone erosion in early zzso These changes were best understood in relation to the zzso organ concept, zzso the interaction between ligament zzso leads to bone zzso zzso ligaments were commonly associated with zzso at insertions corresponding to ligament zzso noted in early zzso The ligaments also influenced the location of zzso formation in early zzso The zzso zzso zzso insertions were associated with the development of a zzso zzso 

zzso collateral ligaments and zzso have a central role in the early stages of hand zzso and determine the early expression of both the soft tissue and zzso changes in zzso
