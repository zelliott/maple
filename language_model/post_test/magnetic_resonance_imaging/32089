zzso zzso zzso can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human zzso It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood zzso zzso zzso signal during rest reflect the zzso baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of zzso zzso action and external zzso and that these slow fluctuations zzso to functionally relevant zzso zzso Several studies on resting zzso have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified zzso The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and zzso In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called zzso zzso independent component analysis to zzso zzso data to find zzso that are consistent across subjects and zzso We characterize and zzso the consistency of these effects by using a zzso approach, and we estimate the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional zzso consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive zzso auditory processing, memory, and the so-called zzso network, each with zzso signal changes up to zzso In general, areas with a high mean percentage zzso signal are consistent and show the least variation around the zzso These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant zzso zzso with percentage zzso signal change comparable with the signal changes found in zzso zzso
