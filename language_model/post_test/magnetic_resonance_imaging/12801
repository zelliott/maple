The authors undertook a study to review the clinical features and outcome in patients who underwent surgery for intractable chronic zzso caused by zzso lobe zzso 

The Rush zzso zzso Database was zzso to identify patients with chronic intractable zzso who underwent zzso of zzso lobe tumors between 1981 and 2005 at Rush University Medical zzso Medical records were reviewed for age of the patient at seizure zzso delay to referral for surgery, seizure frequency and zzso zzso MR imaging results, extent of zzso pathological diagnosis, zzso duration of follow-up period, and seizure zzso 

zzso patients were identified, all with zzso zzso zzso were the most common zzso followed in descending order by zzso zzso tumors zzso and zzso diffuse zzso zzso The mean duration between seizure onset and surgery was zzso zzso Complex partial zzso were the most common presenting zzso zzso operative data were available for 28 zzso of these, zzso underwent complete zzso of the amygdala, and zzso underwent partial or complete zzso of zzso in addition to zzso The mean follow-up duration was zzso years zzso zzso zzso with zzso of patients having seizure status that improved to Engel Class I, zzso to Engel Class II, and zzso to Engel Class zzso Permanent complications were noted in zzso of zzso 

The zzso examination of the long-term follow-up data in patients with zzso lobe tumors causing chronic intractable zzso demonstrated excellent results in seizure improvement after zzso
