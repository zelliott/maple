zzso central zzso syndrome zzso patients show zzso during sleep and severe zzso zzso including zzso cardiovascular zzso zzso sympathetic patterns, together with increased and variable zzso levels, lead to the potential for sustained cerebral zzso zzso We performed high-resolution zzso imaging in 13 zzso and 31 control subjects using a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and evaluated resting zzso and bilateral middle cerebral artery zzso Two zzso image series were zzso images were averaged and zzso to common space, and regions containing zzso and both middle cerebral arteries were zzso zzso of the zzso and middle cerebral arteries were manually outlined to calculate zzso areas, and differences between and within groups were zzso zzso arteries in zzso were significantly zzso over control subjects, but both middle cerebral artery zzso were similar between zzso No significant differences appeared between left and right middle cerebral arteries within either zzso zzso artery zzso may result from differential sensitivity to high zzso over other vascular beds, damage to zzso or other zzso cells accompanying the artery, or enhanced zzso resistance, and that zzso may impair tissue zzso leading to further neural injury in zzso
