This study evaluated the hypothesis that the zzso formation of cerebral zzso may be influenced by the rate of blood pressure return after induced zzso in a graded brain zzso zzso zzso cats underwent unilateral zzso zzso zzso to a mean of 50 zzso zzso and application of a brain zzso at 20 zzso zzso of pressure for 1 zzso Blood pressure was returned to normal either within 3 minutes or over 20 zzso The degree of cerebral zzso formation was determined by Evans blue dye and zzso magnetic resonance zzso All animals showed zzso of Evans blue dye in the zzso zzso that was most marked at the periphery of the zzso zzso relaxation times were significantly prolonged in the zzso zzso of both the fast return and slow return groups zzso and zzso zzso and more so at the Evans blue sites zzso and zzso although not so zzso beneath the zzso itself zzso and zzso zzso relaxation times were similarly prolonged but to approximately half the degree of the zzso zzso In the zzso hemisphere, drug-induced zzso alone did not result in significant acute cerebral zzso or zzso barrier zzso There was no significant difference between the fast and slow groups in Evans blue zzso or magnetic resonance zzso Thus, in a zzso brain injury, restoration of zzso pressure to normal either gradually or rapidly did not influence the degree or extent of zzso zzso
