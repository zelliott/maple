The relationship of the cellular changes in the zzso brain to the onset and progression of AIDS zzso complex zzso remains zzso We undertook an in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso study and used factor analysis to identify specific cellular and regional brain changes that may serve as zzso markers of zzso The ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso over zzso zzso markers of zzso and zzso cell zzso were measured in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 100 subjects with and without zzso Three zzso patterns were identified, which we termed zzso zzso zzso zzso in all three regions plus zzso increases in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reductions in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that, adjusted for age, zzso zzso and zzso pattern scores were strongly associated with zzso but inflammatory levels were zzso We conclude that by using factor analysis, we are able to combine multiple zzso across brain regions in a biologically plausible manner and construct a zzso model of zzso adjusting for relevant factors such as zzso
