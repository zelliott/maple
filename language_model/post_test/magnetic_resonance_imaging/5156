Neurological injury after global brain zzso zzso sudden zzso remains problematic, despite improving cardiac zzso Unfortunately, sudden death models introduce unwanted variables for studying the brain because of multiple organ zzso To circumvent this, a new minimally invasive large animal model of isolated global brain zzso together with baseline zzso studies is zzso 

The model employs neck and small zzso zzso zzso incisions to block inflow from carotid and zzso arteries for 30 zzso of zzso zzso Neurological changes after 24 h in six pigs was compared with six zzso pigs assessing neurological deficit score zzso 0 zzso normal, 500 zzso brain zzso brain zzso and cerebral zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Six other pigs had baseline zzso characteristics in this new model evaluated at carotid flows of zzso 550 and 450 zzso with cerebral zzso pressure, cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The model never altered cardiac or pulmonary function, and six zzso pigs had normal zzso zzso zzso neurological recovery without brain zzso zzso 24 h analysis showed that 30 zzso of global zzso brain zzso caused multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso raised zzso zzso zzso 16; P zzso zzso versus zzso in four of six survivors and caused marked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and extensive cerebral zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso showed 750 zzso flow rate produced normal zzso levels and zzso consumption at mean zzso zzso carotid zzso zzso pressure and zzso fell at zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso did not change, 450 zzso flow lowered global zzso consumption, which further decreased after transient zzso (30 zzso and 5 zzso of zzso 

This new isolated global brain model consistently caused zzso zzso and functional neurological damage in pigs after 30 zzso of zzso zzso of 750 zzso maintained normal mean systemic zzso zzso zzso pressure, zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso pressure and zzso fell in zzso and zzso zzso A disparity existed between zzso oxygen zzso and global zzso consumption at lower flow rates of 450 zzso following transient zzso indicating that surface oxygen zzso measurement does not reflect global brain zzso zzso
