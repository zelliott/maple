During simple zzso decision making, zzso in the zzso zzso extract evidence from sensory information provided by visual areas until a decision is zzso zzso information can bias zzso activity during the task and change the decision-making zzso One type of contextual information is the availability of reward for correct zzso We tested the hypothesis that the frontal zzso and zzso zzso use contextual information to bias decision making to maximize zzso Human volunteers underwent functional zzso while making decisions about the motion of dots on a computer zzso On rewarded trials, subjects responded more slowly by increasing the threshold to zzso zzso trials were associated with zzso in the zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso in the period preceding coherent dot motion, and the degree of zzso predicted the increased decision zzso zzso zzso transmission, using a zzso zzso acid mixture, abolished the zzso zzso zzso and eliminated the correlation between zzso activity and decision zzso These observations provide direct evidence that some zzso functional zzso signals in the zzso are the result of zzso zzso activity and demonstrate that zzso zzso transmission can influence zzso and decision-making neural processes engaged to maximize reward zzso
