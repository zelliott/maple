We aimed to determine the relationships between resting left zzso zzso wall motion abnormalities zzso zzso zzso and peripheral artery disease zzso in a community zzso A total of zzso zzso Heart Study zzso zzso participants zzso zzso 65 zzso 9 zzso underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance with zzso of zzso plaque volume and assessment of regional left zzso zzso zzso zzso lower zzso zzso and zzso index zzso were recorded at the most zzso examination zzso zzso were associated with greater zzso plaque burden, decreased zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso analyses (all p zzso zzso which were not significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk zzso In zzso and zzso zzso both the presence zzso zzso zzso and volume of zzso plaque were associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso After multivariable adjustment, an zzso zzso zzso or prior zzso was associated with a zzso odds of zzso plaque zzso zzso zzso zzso volume significantly increased with decreasing zzso in zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso In this zzso population, associations of zzso with zzso plaque burden and clinical measures of zzso were attenuated after adjustment for coronary heart disease risk zzso zzso plaque volume and zzso remained strongly zzso correlated after multivariable zzso Our findings suggest that the association between coronary heart disease and zzso zzso is explained by cardiovascular risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso remain strongly associated after multivariable adjustment, suggesting shared mechanisms beyond those captured by traditional risk zzso
