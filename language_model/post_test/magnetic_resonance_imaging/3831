zzso of relaxation rates in the rotating frame with zzso techniques are sensitive to substances with exchanging zzso with appropriate chemical zzso The authors develop a novel approach to zzso selective imaging based on measured zzso zzso with applied zzso field strength, and demonstrate the method on samples containing the X-ray contrast agent zzso with and without zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso of water in the zzso was measured with a zzso zzso magnet by an zzso zzso pulse with fast zzso zzso and the results used to estimate exchange zzso The zzso phantom alone gave a fitted exchange rate of zzso zzso bovine serum zzso alone was zzso zzso and in combination gave rates in zzso By using these estimated rates, we demonstrate how a novel zzso imaging method may be used to enhance contrast due to the presence of a contrast agent whose zzso have specific exchange zzso
