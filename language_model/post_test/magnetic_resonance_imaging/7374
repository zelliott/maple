Caged xenon has great potential in overcoming sensitivity limitations for zzso zzso detection of dilute zzso However, no application of such a system as a magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent has yet been performed with live zzso We demonstrate zzso zzso of cells labeled with zzso xenon in a zzso zzso working under zzso with zzso zzso zzso hosts enable zzso experiments with zzso contrast and selectivity for zzso versus zzso zzso We present MR images with zzso zzso sensitivity enhancement for zzso zzso zzso xenon hosts at low zzso zzso Our results illustrate the capability of zzso xenon to act as a highly sensitive cell zzso for zzso detection even without signal zzso The method will bridge the challenging gap for translation to zzso studies for the zzso of targeted zzso and their zzso zzso
