To date, zzso therapy zzso is the most potent treatment in severe zzso Although zzso has been successfully applied in clinical practice for over 70 years, the underlying mechanisms of action remain zzso We used functional zzso and a unique zzso analysis approach to examine functional connectivity in the brain before and after zzso zzso Our results show that zzso has lasting effects on the functional architecture of the zzso A comparison of zzso and zzso functional connectivity data in a group of nine patients revealed a significant cluster of zzso in and around the left zzso prefrontal cortical region zzso areas 44, 45, and zzso where the average global functional connectivity was considerably decreased after zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This decrease in functional connectivity was accompanied by a significant improvement zzso zzso zzso in depressive zzso the patients' mean scores on the Montgomery zzso Depression zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings reported here add weight to the emerging zzso zzso in depression and support the proposal that increased connectivity may constitute both a zzso for mood disorder and a potential therapeutic zzso
