Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso imaging provides a zzso method for studying the fate of transplanted cells in zzso We zzso in animals with a cortical zzso zzso or with a zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso the fate of implanted rat bone zzso zzso cells zzso and mouse embryonic stem cells zzso labeled with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were either grafted zzso into the zzso zzso of the adult rat brain or injected zzso In zzso MR imaging was used to track their zzso zzso blue zzso and electron zzso confirmed the presence of iron oxide zzso inside the zzso During the first week zzso grafted cells migrated to the zzso site and populated the border zone of the zzso Less than zzso of zzso differentiated into zzso and none into zzso zzso of zzso zzso differentiated into zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso became zzso The implanted cells were visible on MR images as a zzso area at the injection site, in the corpus zzso and in the zzso The zzso signal persisted for more than 50 zzso The presence of zzso or zzso and zzso cells was confirmed by zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that both grafted zzso and zzso zzso labeled with a contrast agent based on iron oxide zzso migrate into the injured zzso Iron oxide zzso can therefore be used as a marker for the long-term zzso MR tracking of implanted stem zzso
