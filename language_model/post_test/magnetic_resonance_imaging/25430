Large zzso zzso contrast agents with zzso or zzso zzso are useful for imaging blood zzso However, their prolonged retention is a major limitation for clinical zzso Although smaller zzso zzso contrast agents are more quickly zzso by the zzso they are also able to zzso vascular structures better than zzso due to less zzso Additionally, unlike zzso they zzso accumulate in zzso zzso and thus also can be used to zzso zzso structural and functional zzso However, these zzso agents are retained in the body for a prolonged zzso The purpose of this study was to obtain information from which a zzso zzso zzso contrast agents feasible for use in further clinical studies could be zzso Six small zzso zzso contrast agents were zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso were evaluated in mice to determine an optimal agent in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso agents cleared more rapidly from the body than zzso zzso zzso agents with the same numbers of zzso Smaller zzso zzso were more rapidly zzso from the body than the larger zzso zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso zzso contrast agents showed relatively rapid zzso these three zzso might be acceptable for use in further clinical zzso
