In phantom studies we investigated the effects of magnetic resonance imaging zzso on zzso and zzso Twenty-five zzso were exposed to zzso in a zzso scanner with continuous registration of the temperature at the zzso zzso Eleven zzso (five single chamber and six dual zzso were exposed to zzso zzso output was monitored to detect malfunction in zzso and zzso zzso A temperature increase at the zzso tip of up to zzso degrees C was observed during 90 seconds of zzso In seven zzso the temperature increase exceeded 15 degrees zzso Although no zzso malfunctions were observed in zzso pacing mode zzso zzso and rapid pacing were observed during zzso imaging if the zzso were set to zzso or zzso zzso zzso function was not impaired during scanning with zzso zzso Next to zzso dysfunction, zzso heating has to be considered a possible adverse effect when exposing patients with zzso to zzso
