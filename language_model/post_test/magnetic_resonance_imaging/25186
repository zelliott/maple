zzso comprehension requires linguistic processing as well as cognitive resources such as working memory zzso and zzso speed zzso The authors zzso that sentence comprehension difficulty in patients with mild zzso is due to degradation of the large-scale neural network that supports cognitive resources during sentence zzso 

To understand the neural basis for sentence comprehension difficulty in zzso 

Regional brain activity with blood zzso zzso zzso was monitored while seven zzso patients and nine healthy seniors answered a simple probe about written sentences that vary in their grammatical and cognitive resource zzso 

Healthy seniors recruited zzso zzso and zzso inferior frontal regions of the left hemisphere, brain regions associated with grammatical processing that were also activated by zzso zzso Healthy seniors also recruited left zzso inferior zzso right zzso zzso and zzso regions that are associated with cognitive resources during sentence zzso zzso contrasts showed that zzso zzso zzso and right zzso regions are recruited to a significantly lesser degree in zzso but these patients have increased zzso of right inferior frontal and left zzso zzso areas during sentence zzso 

These findings associate impaired sentence comprehension in zzso with interruption of a large-scale network important for cognitive resources during sentence zzso These results also imply zzso zzso of cortical activity that allows patients with mild zzso to maintain sentence comprehension zzso
