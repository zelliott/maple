We used zzso responses and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine visual processing in monkeys whose conscious state was modulated by low doses zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We found that, despite the zzso zzso state and despite specific influences of zzso on the zzso system, zzso zzso zzso could be reliably zzso with large, moving visual zzso zzso were zzso zzso for zzso zzso indicating that zzso did not eliminate cortical processing of the motion zzso Also, results from zzso directly demonstrated that the cortical blood zzso zzso zzso response to visual patterns was preserved at the same zzso doses used to elicit zzso Finally, in the zzso state, zzso zzso motion stimuli produced patterns of spontaneously alternating zzso that normally would be tightly coupled to zzso zzso These results, taken together, demonstrate that after zzso administration cortical circuits continue to processes visual patterns in a zzso manner despite the zzso behavioral zzso While zzso experience is difficult to evaluate under these conditions, zzso patterns revealed that the brain not only registers but also acts upon its sensory zzso employing it to drive a zzso loop and even responding to a sensory conflict by engaging in spontaneous zzso state zzso The zzso monkey preparation thereby offers a safe and viable paradigm for the behavioral and zzso investigation of issues related to conscious perception and zzso as well as neural mechanisms of basic sensory zzso
