In this study we analyzed the value of ultrasound examination for diagnosis of zzso artery zzso 

The zzso zzso system was assessed in 14 patients using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and duplex zzso 

The zzso were verified by zzso (in 1 zzso magnetic resonance imaging (in zzso or both (in zzso The dissected segments were zzso zzso in 6, zzso and zzso zzso in 3, zzso and zzso zzso in 3, and zzso in 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso examination of the zzso loop, involved in 12 patients, showed absent flow signal in 5, low zzso flow signal in 1, and zzso low blood flow zzso in 3 zzso Seven of these patients had high-grade zzso or zzso The zzso segment with increased flow signal could be identified directly in 2 zzso Duplex examination of the zzso segment confirmed absent flow in 4 patients, making technically insufficient examination zzso In the 2 patients with directly detected zzso duplex examination showed low flow zzso before the zzso The combined use of zzso and zzso zzso and duplex zzso increases the diagnostic yield to detect zzso artery zzso If any abnormal zzso finding was considered, the yield was zzso relying only on definitively abnormal findings zzso flow zzso severely reduced zzso artery blood flow zzso no zzso flow, zzso flow, and a zzso zzso the yield was zzso 

In most cases, there is no zzso ultrasound finding for zzso artery zzso However, if a patient presents with suggestive symptoms, ultrasound may corroborate the clinical suspicion and aid in the decision regarding early zzso zzso A zzso diagnosis can be made zzso when magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates zzso in the vessel zzso zzso yields additional information such as nature of underlying vascular disease, site and extent of zzso zzso extension, and presence of zzso
