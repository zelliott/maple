Although age-related zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso for cognitive zzso the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso cognitive impairment are zzso The authors investigated cognitive zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

Among 100 patients with zzso stroke with zzso zzso on zzso the authors assessed executive function and global zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso State zzso zzso zzso All zzso measures were corrected for zzso zzso The authors investigated the association between basic zzso vascular risk factors, zzso status, zzso volume, zzso measures zzso number, zzso zzso number, zzso measures zzso central, zzso and cognitive zzso The authors also performed Pittsburgh zzso B zzso imaging among seven cognitive impaired patients with zzso 

zzso was no longer related to cognitive performance after adding zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso models showed that cortical zzso matter volume independently accounted for performance on both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Models examining frontal zzso revealed that volumes of both left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso lateral frontal zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso whereas education zzso zzso and left lateral frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso Volumes of zzso and cognitively relevant brain regions were significantly zzso Seven patients with zzso imaging showed no zzso pattern typical of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a predominantly vascular zzso for the cognitive impairment and brain changes in these zzso 

zzso impairment in patients with zzso zzso is zzso by global and frontal cortical zzso
