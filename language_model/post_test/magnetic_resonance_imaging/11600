The recently completed zzso zzso zzso trial of zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients with secondary progressive zzso shows significant delay of disease progression and reduction of zzso zzso This study provides an opportunity to assess the level of relationship between clinical and zzso outcomes in this cohort of patients with secondary progressive zzso 

Brain zzso zzso volume was measured annually in all available patients, with visual analysis to identify any new or enlarging zzso zzso zzso at each annual time zzso A zzso of 125 patients had monthly zzso zzso imaging at months 0 to 6 and 18 to zzso zzso were documented and expanded disability status scale zzso was measured every 3 zzso 

For the annual zzso zzso a significant but modest correlation was identified between the change in zzso zzso volume from baseline to the final scan and the corresponding change from baseline in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were significant correlations between the cumulative number of active zzso zzso and 1) change in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and 2) zzso rate zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In the zzso of 125 patients undergoing monthly imaging, zzso zzso activity was correlated with zzso rate over months 0 to 24 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with change in zzso 

These results confirm that the zzso relationships previously identified in zzso zzso still are apparent in the secondary progressive phase of the disease and support the use of zzso as a relevant outcome zzso In view of the relatively modest nature of the zzso it seems unwise to rely on such zzso measures alone as primary efficacy variables in secondary progressive zzso zzso
