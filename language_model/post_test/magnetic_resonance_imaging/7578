An ability to decode semantic information from zzso spatial patterns has been demonstrated in previous studies mostly for 1 specific input zzso In this study, we aimed to decode semantic category independent of the zzso in which an object was zzso Using a searchlight method, we were able to predict the stimulus category from the data while participants performed a semantic categorization task with 4 stimulus zzso zzso and written names, photographs, and natural zzso zzso zzso performance was achieved in all 4 zzso zzso decoding was implemented by training and testing the searchlight method across zzso This allowed the zzso of those brain regions, which correctly zzso between the categories, independent of stimulus zzso The analysis revealed large clusters of zzso in the left inferior zzso zzso and in frontal zzso These zzso also allowed category discrimination in a free recall session where subjects recalled the objects in the absence of external zzso The results show that semantic information can be zzso from the zzso signal independently of the input zzso and have clear implications for understanding the functional mechanisms of semantic zzso
