zzso resonance zzso zzso techniques and MR zzso zzso provide specific zzso information that may allow distinction between zzso zzso and progression from stable zzso 

Forty patients underwent conventional MR imaging, dynamic zzso zzso zzso imaging, dynamic zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso spin labeling was available in 26 of these zzso zzso parameters were calculated in tumor zzso and stable disease, which were zzso verified on clinical and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso for each zzso were generated for the differentiation between zzso zzso and stable zzso A forward zzso analysis was undertaken to assess the power of the conjunction of MR zzso techniques and zzso 

Of the 40 patients, 23 were determined to have zzso zzso zzso in zzso spin labeling between the two groups were not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in dynamic zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso were zzso and zzso transfer constant zzso zzso and zzso for cerebral blood flow, and zzso and zzso for cerebral blood volume, zzso Among the parameters in zzso the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso showed the best diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso When considering all zzso zzso diagnostic accuracy could be increased to zzso adding MRS to the zzso approach resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of zzso 

MR zzso techniques and MRS are useful tools that enable improved differentiation between zzso zzso and stable zzso Among the single zzso zzso showed the best diagnostic zzso zzso assessment substantially improved the ability to differentiate the two zzso
