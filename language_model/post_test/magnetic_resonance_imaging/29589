This work describes a new approach to zzso Dixon zzso separation that is amenable to pulse sequences that require short echo time zzso zzso such as zzso free zzso zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso linear zzso method that zzso water and fat images from source images acquired at short TE zzso images with a high zzso ratio zzso and uniform separation of water and fat are zzso This zzso extends to zzso reconstruction with minimal additional zzso Examples of zzso and zzso zzso zzso are shown from source images acquired at both zzso and zzso Examples in the knee, ankle, zzso abdomen, and heart are zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso The zzso was applied to systems with multiple chemical species, and an example of zzso separation is zzso An analysis of the noise performance of this method is zzso and methods to improve noise performance through zzso acquisition and field map smoothing are zzso
