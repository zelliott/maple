zzso can be represented using either mathematical language zzso zzso or natural language zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso processing elicits greater zzso in the brain regions around the zzso zzso zzso relative to other semantic zzso However, little research has been conducted to investigate whether the zzso is also critical for the semantic processing of zzso in natural zzso In this study, 20 adults were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed semantic distance judgment involving six types of materials zzso frequency zzso quantity zzso and zzso animal names, Arabic digits, number words, and dot zzso zzso analyses of brain zzso showed that numbers and dot zzso zzso greater zzso in the right zzso than did words zzso animal names) or zzso zzso frequency zzso and quantity zzso and zzso zzso zzso more zzso in left middle zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso than did numbers and dot zzso No differences were found between zzso and animal zzso These findings suggest that, although quantity processing for numbers and dot zzso typically relies on the right zzso region, quantity processing for zzso typically relies on brain regions for general semantic zzso Thus, the zzso does not appear to be the only brain region for quantity zzso
