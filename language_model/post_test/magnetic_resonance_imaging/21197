zzso and wildlife are exposed to environmental pollutants that have been shown to interfere with the zzso hormone system and thus may affect brain zzso Our goal was to expose pregnant rats to zzso zzso to measure the effects of a zzso on white matter development in offspring using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso We exposed pregnant Sprague zzso zzso rats to 3 or 10 zzso zzso from gestation day 7 zzso until zzso day 25 zzso to determine the effects on white matter zzso gray matter zzso and zzso volumes in zzso We sacrificed offspring at zzso but continued the life of some offspring to zzso to measure persistent effects in adult zzso zzso offspring exposed to 10 zzso zzso displayed lowered levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso and total brain volumes were significantly lower than the volumes in control zzso zzso adults exposed to 10 zzso zzso displayed normal zzso levels but lowered T4 zzso zzso zzso total brain, and zzso volumes were significantly lower than the volumes in control zzso Both zzso and zzso rats exposed to 10 zzso zzso displayed significant reductions in percent zzso as well as zzso in the corpus zzso Exposure to 3 zzso zzso did not produce any significant zzso These results suggest that zzso coupled with zzso analysis is a powerful tool in assessing the effects of zzso hormone disruption on white matter development and brain zzso This approach holds great promise in assessing zzso of zzso in humans and zzso
