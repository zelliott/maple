We sought to derive zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso reference values for zzso left zzso zzso anatomy and function in a healthy adult population of clinically relevant zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly applied in the clinical setting, but zzso zzso zzso values are currently zzso 

A representative sample of zzso zzso Heart Study zzso zzso participants free of clinically overt cardiovascular disease underwent zzso examination to determine zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso and zzso respectively), mass, ejection fraction zzso and linear dimensions zzso zzso cavity zzso zzso with a clinical history of hypertension or those with a zzso blood pressure zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso pressure zzso or zzso zzso zzso at any zzso cycle examination were zzso leaving 142 subjects zzso men, 79 zzso age 57 zzso 9 zzso 

All zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso measures were significantly greater zzso zzso zzso in men than in women and remained greater zzso zzso zzso after adjustment for subject zzso zzso measures were greater zzso zzso zzso in men than in women after adjustment for body surface area zzso but there were increased linear dimensions in women after adjustment for zzso In particular, zzso dimension zzso to zzso was greater in women zzso zzso zzso than in zzso There were no gender differences in global zzso zzso zzso zzso women zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance measures of zzso volumes, mass and linear dimensions differ significantly according to gender and body zzso This study provides zzso normal zzso reference values, uniquely derived from a zzso sample of persons free of cardiovascular disease and clinical zzso These data may serve as a reference to identify zzso pathology in the adult zzso
