Total variation was recently introduced in many different magnetic resonance imaging zzso The assumption of total variation is that images consist of areas, which are zzso zzso However, in many practical magnetic resonance imaging situations, this assumption is not valid due to the zzso of the exciting B1 field and the receive zzso This work introduces the new concept of total generalized variation for magnetic resonance imaging, a new mathematical zzso which is a zzso of the total variation theory and which eliminates these zzso Two important applications are considered in this article, image zzso and image reconstruction from zzso zzso data sets with multiple zzso Apart from simulations, experimental results from in zzso zzso are presented where total generalized variation yielded improved image quality over conventional total variation in all zzso
