The adult zzso zone zzso of the lateral zzso contains neural stem zzso In zzso these cells generate zzso that migrate as chains toward the zzso bulb along the zzso migratory stream zzso The zzso niche at the zzso wall is zzso in various animal species, including zzso However, it is unclear how the zzso and zzso organization in nonhuman primates relates to that of zzso and zzso Here we studied the zzso and zzso of the adult and zzso common zzso zzso zzso a New World zzso used widely in zzso by electron zzso and zzso detection of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained cells similar to type B, C, and A cells of the zzso zzso in their marker expression and zzso The adult zzso zzso had a zzso organization, as in the human brain, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso layer was very thin or absent in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the anterior zzso in zzso zzso wall preparations of adult zzso revealed an extensive network of zzso cell zzso similar to the zzso chains in zzso zzso recordings of zzso zzso zzso cultured in zzso showed the zzso zzso in zzso like zzso type A zzso These results suggest that some features of zzso and zzso migration in the zzso are common to zzso humans, and zzso This basic description of the adult and zzso zzso zzso will be useful for future studies on adult zzso in zzso
