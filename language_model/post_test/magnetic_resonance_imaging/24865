zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso yet few zzso studies have zzso investigated zzso Here, we compared differences in zzso and connectivity between zzso and controls zzso Twenty-two subjects zzso participated in a zzso learning task, a behavioral domain particularly dependent on zzso connectivity and of relevance to the schizophrenia zzso zzso differences were assessed using standard zzso zzso connectivity differences were compared using zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso but significantly decreased connectivity with the zzso across a zzso learning zzso These results assess potentially complementary patterns of network dysfunction in zzso increased zzso suggests inefficient responses relating to functional zzso decreased connectivity suggests impaired integration of functional signals between zzso zzso and zzso appear to collectively characterize functional deficits in zzso
