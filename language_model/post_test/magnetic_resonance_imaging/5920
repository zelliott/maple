Multiple sclerosis zzso is zzso besides focal zzso by brain zzso The zzso of zzso rates in individual patients are poorly zzso 

This study investigated the zzso value of clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso factors, including short-term changes zzso for concurrent and future zzso evolution using zzso rank correlations and zzso multiple linear zzso 

We zzso identified a group of 115 active, early zzso zzso patients relatively homogeneous in terms of disease course and zzso activity compared to a second group of 96 patients with broader spectrum of zzso zzso and inactive zzso All patients had undergone three zzso investigations with zzso intervals of at least 12 and 24 months, zzso 

In the zzso patients, zzso of zzso in concurrent zzso rates (over the first zzso could be explained by the combination of baseline zzso zzso volume and change in zzso score over the first zzso whereas only zzso in future zzso rates (over the second zzso was zzso In the zzso group, zzso of the zzso in future zzso rates could be explained, but slightly less in concurrent zzso rates zzso 

We concluded that zzso in brain zzso rates can partially be explained by clinical and zzso measures of zzso Future zzso rates in individual zzso patients are difficult to predict even when including previous zzso zzso
