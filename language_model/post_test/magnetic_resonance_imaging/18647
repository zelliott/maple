zzso studies have shown convincingly that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso are critical to episodic zzso zzso generally has been found to have a generally negative effect on episodic memory performance, which might relate to zzso changes in the frontal and zzso zzso brain zzso In the present study, we used functional zzso zzso to investigate separately the contributions of zzso and retrieval to the age-related decline in zzso To this end, we compared brain activity patterns obtained during incidental zzso zzso zzso about zzso and subsequent retrieval zzso in three groups: a group of young subjects, a group of elderly subjects showing reduced memory performance zzso and a group of elderly subjects who still performed in the normal range zzso This allowed us to differentiate between age-related changes in brain activity that affect memory function and those that do not have an apparent effect on memory function, because they are found in both elderly zzso zzso to previous imaging studies on this topic, we used zzso zzso zzso to control for differences in performance level across groups by including correct responses zzso Comparing the zzso of successfully remembered items with baseline zzso zzso zzso the young subjects showed a significant increase in brain zzso in the left anterior zzso compared with the zzso but not the zzso zzso Comparing correctly rejected items zzso zzso with zzso the zzso group showed much increased overall activity throughout the brain compared with the other zzso However, when correctly recognized items zzso attempt + zzso were compared directly with correctly rejected items zzso zzso these differences were greatly reduced, revealing common activity in the left zzso zzso and left anterior prefrontal zzso zzso we conclude that the reduced performance in the zzso group is likely to be due to zzso dysfunction during zzso The differences observed during retrieval attempts may reflect strategic zzso The lack of differences observed in relation to retrieval success suggests that zzso does not affect the processes that support the actual recovery of zzso
