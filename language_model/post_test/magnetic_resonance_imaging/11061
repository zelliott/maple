The decision to proceed with surgical treatment of zzso zzso of the zzso head is zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine zzso if spontaneous resolution of zzso of the zzso head occurs, zzso how long it takes for resolution to occur, and zzso if there are zzso of spontaneous zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso of the zzso head were identified from two National Institutes of zzso screening zzso a prospective screening study for zzso of the zzso head after organ transplantation and a study in which patients who had had surgical treatment of symptomatic zzso of the zzso head were screened for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The cohort of patients with zzso zzso of the zzso head was then zzso 

Thirteen zzso hips in ten patients were identified in the prospective screening study for zzso after organ zzso and zzso hips in zzso patients were identified in the zzso zzso zzso Three hips, all from the group of patients who had had organ zzso had Association Research Circulation zzso zzso disease with spontaneous resolution occurring later as evidenced by serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso In these three hips, the modified index of zzso extent measured zzso zzso and zzso with the estimated percentage of zzso head involvement being zzso to zzso in two of the hips and zzso in the zzso Resolution on magnetic resonance imaging was complete in two of the three hips and was nearly complete in the zzso Resolution was not observed when the zzso hip had symptomatic zzso 

zzso resolution of zzso of the zzso head can zzso The factors that appear to be related to resolution are early, zzso disease zzso Research Circulation zzso stage I) and small zzso size (a modified index of zzso extent of zzso A larger series is necessary before these factors can be verified as being independent zzso of zzso zzso signs of resolution may take as long as one year to zzso
