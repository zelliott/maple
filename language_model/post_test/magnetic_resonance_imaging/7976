The zzso of gait and balance disorders in elderly people with zzso level gait zzso zzso is poorly zzso In this study, we aimed to identify the brain networks involved in this zzso zzso clinical scores, zzso parameters of gait initiation and brain imaging data, including deep white matter zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso were assessed in 20 zzso patients in comparison to 20 zzso zzso In comparison to controls, zzso patients presented a zzso zzso phase of gait zzso but a severe zzso of both locomotor and zzso parameters of zzso execution, which was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso patients showed a significant zzso matter reduction in the zzso locomotor region zzso and the left primary motor zzso This zzso zzso was related to the severity of clinical and zzso determined balance zzso zzso patients also showed a reduction in speed of zzso related to zzso zzso signs and zzso cognitive zzso These last two symptoms were correlated with the severity of zzso found in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that the gait and balance deficits in zzso mainly result from the zzso or dysfunction of the network linking the primary motor zzso and the zzso brain regions known to be involved in the control of gait and balance, whereas cognitive and zzso zzso signs mainly result from zzso that could be responsible for a dysfunction of the frontal zzso zzso zzso
