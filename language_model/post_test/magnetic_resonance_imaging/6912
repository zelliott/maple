zzso ring is the most vulnerable site outside zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Its imaging features in NHL of early stage were similar with those of zzso zzso cancer, which often leads to zzso This study was to discuss imaging features of zzso ring in zzso and its clinical zzso 

CT and zzso performances of 149 patients with zzso diagnosed zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

Among 149 cases of zzso zzso 98 zzso were zzso origin, and 51 zzso were zzso or zzso zzso zzso was the most vulnerable site followed by zzso zzso and other zzso CT and zzso showed that 81 were focal zzso or masses zzso in zzso zzso 36 were diffuse zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso 7 were pure zzso and 25 were mixed zzso The zzso of focal masses are characterized with even CT density and zzso zzso The zzso usually localized in zzso zzso but rarely in deep space, such as zzso space, and in zzso Among 78 cases with involved cervical zzso zzso 64 were zzso origin, and 14 were zzso origin zzso zzso 

Multiple positions and centers origin, huge masses, diffuse zzso growth, and less involvement in deep space and zzso are typical imaging features of zzso zzso CT and zzso may be helpful to zzso clinical zzso and treating zzso zzso
