The communication among zzso is the prerequisite for the working zzso To understand the zzso zzso and structural basis of this communication, and the impacts of aging and disease on brain function, quantitative measures are zzso This thesis evaluates several quantitative zzso methods with respect to possible bias and zzso zzso zzso methods are suited for the unbiased zzso of number, zzso and volumes of components of the nervous zzso zzso estimates of the total length of zzso nerve fibers were made in white matter of post zzso zzso and the impact of aging and diseases as zzso and Alzheimer's disease were zzso Although zzso methods are in principle zzso shrinkage artifacts are difficult to account zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings, in conjunction with kinetic zzso permit the zzso of zzso binding in zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as an example of the validation process for quantitative PET zzso zzso zzso based on reference tissue as well as methods based on an zzso plasma input function were evaluated with respect to precision and zzso It was shown that zzso binding had high sensitivity to occupancy by zzso zzso zzso high specific activity in the zzso to avoid zzso The established zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in a two-year follow-up study in elderly zzso Application of partial volume correction of the PET data diminished the reliability of the measures, but allowed for the correct distinction between changes due to brain zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, a PET study of patients with Alzheimer's disease with the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed relatively preserved zzso projections, despite a marked decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered and the relation to the prevailing zzso hypothesis is zzso
