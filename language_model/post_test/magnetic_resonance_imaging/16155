Our objectives were to compare the effects of zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso on cerebral blood flow zzso and then to analyze the relationship between zzso and zzso vascular disease, measured as volume of zzso zzso zzso 

Eight mildly zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso aged 77 zzso 8 years; zzso State zzso score 26 zzso 3 zzso and 14 patients with zzso were compared with 18 cognitively normal elderly zzso All subjects had zzso measured using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and brain volumes were assessed using structural magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso and zzso showed marked zzso reductions in the frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso increased zzso zzso were associated with reduced zzso in the frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to cortical zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso vascular disease is associated with reduced zzso in the cortex, irrespective of brain zzso
