To find cases of zzso treated with zzso we performed a zzso search from 1966 to July 2001, checked all reference lists of studies found and hand searched volumes of 11 zzso Data was extracted by means of a zzso data extraction zzso zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated for outcomes and complications of zzso Cases were zzso according to variables that may influence the outcome and zzso were compared by odds ratios and zzso zzso 

No zzso clinical trial zzso was zzso zzso studies zzso zzso were zzso zzso was the zzso most frequently administered zzso In the majority of cases the zzso was locally infused in the zzso zzso zzso At zzso 10 cases zzso zzso zzso zzso were dependent and 9 cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso of zzso In zzso they were associated with clinical zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso but only zzso required blood zzso 

zzso appeared to be reasonably safe in zzso but its efficacy cannot be assessed from the published zzso Considering that zzso is an uncommon disease, a zzso controlled trial to assess effectiveness and safety of local zzso in cases of zzso with poor prognosis is difficult but not impossible to zzso on a zzso international collaboration zzso
