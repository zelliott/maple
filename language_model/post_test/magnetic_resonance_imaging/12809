To investigate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso contrast agents of different zzso and molecular weight for tumor characterization based on zzso using dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso contrast agents, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with molecular weight of 20 and 70 zzso were evaluated for tumor zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso contrast agent, zzso were used as zzso The zzso studies were performed in nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso and zzso human prostate tumor zzso zzso zzso kinetic parameters including zzso transfer zzso zzso and fractional tumor plasma volume zzso were calculated from the zzso data using a zzso model and compared between the two different tumor models for each contrast zzso 

There was no significant difference in the zzso values between two tumor models estimated with the same agent except for zzso The zzso values in both tumor models decreased with the increase of molecular weight of contrast zzso With the same high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso showed a higher zzso values than zzso due to high zzso of the former in both tumor models zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso zzso tumors were significantly higher than those of zzso tumors estimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast agents are promising in tumor characterization and differentiation with dynamic contrast enhanced zzso
