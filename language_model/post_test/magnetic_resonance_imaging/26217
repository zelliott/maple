zzso functional MR images were acquired while 10 subjects were asked to tap with their right index finger in zzso with a visual stimulus appearing regularly with a frequency of zzso zzso or zzso with a mean frequency of zzso zzso Performance data show that during regular tapping most taps were close to stimulus zzso However, when the subjects paced their tapping according to the irregular zzso most taps appeared about 300 zzso after the onset of the pacing zzso Comparing the brain zzso resulting from regular tapping with those from irregular zzso we found increased zzso in left zzso zzso Comparing irregular versus regular tapping shows increased activity in right zzso zzso and zzso left zzso thalamus, left zzso cortex, left and right zzso and left zzso zzso These results show that during irregular pacing the motor areas are more strongly activated than during regular zzso In addition, further neural systems are involved in the motor control during irregular zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The latter is supposedly involved in error correction in the context of visually guided zzso
