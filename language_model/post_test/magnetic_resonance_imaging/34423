The aim of the study was to assess whether a 3-D zzso sequence with real-time zzso reconstruction could replace our standard zzso imaging of the cervical zzso zzso was performed on a GE zzso zzso T system using a zzso surface neck zzso Signal intensity of zzso spinal cord, surrounding tissue and background were zzso zzso to noise ratio and contrast between the different zzso was calculated for the different zzso A zzso assessment of the various zzso was zzso No statistical difference in tissue contrast was found between zzso and 3-D images when the contrast between zzso and zzso or between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was better on 3-D zzso The contrast to noise ratio was better on zzso images compared with the 3-D images for both zzso and zzso but there was no difference between the zzso and 3-D images for zzso In three patients the zzso was better demonstrated on the 3-D sequence than on the zzso zzso but only in one of these was the zzso not visible on the zzso zzso in six patients the zzso images were considered zzso Although the 3-D sequence reduced overall imaging time we found that at zzso T contrast was zzso and that zzso were less clearly demonstrated than on the zzso zzso We conclude that a single 3-D sequence cannot zzso replace the zzso combination routinely used at zzso zzso
