To compare two methods of adrenal zzso sampling zzso in zzso zzso of adrenal zzso in primary zzso 

zzso patients (13 men, eight zzso underwent selective adrenal zzso sampling between July 2001 and May zzso One of the 21 patients underwent repeat zzso for a total of 22 zzso In half the procedures zzso zzso zzso simultaneous bilateral adrenal zzso zzso and sampling was performed before and after zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso in the remaining half zzso zzso zzso sequential zzso of the left and right adrenal veins was performed during continuous zzso infusion 1 hour before and throughout zzso zzso review provided procedural data, including sampling intervals and zzso zzso Patient records provided clinical data, including blood pressure, serum zzso levels, and zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso pathology reports confirmed unilateral disease but were not zzso to bilateral zzso 

Selective zzso was completed successfully in 21 of 22 procedures zzso the unsuccessful sampling was repeated zzso Disease zzso in 13 of 22 zzso zzso bilateral zzso localized unilateral disease in seven of eight cases zzso and was zzso in one case zzso with cases confirmed by surgical pathology zzso zzso bilateral zzso localized unilateral disease in four of four cases zzso confirmed by surgical pathology reports, with one lost to zzso zzso disease was diagnosed in six of 22 zzso two of 11 by simultaneous zzso and four of 11 by sequential zzso Three of 22 cases demonstrated borderline hormone levels that failed to meet the diagnostic threshold for recommended zzso Mean elapsed time between acquisition of right and left samples did not differ between simultaneous and sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sampling did not contribute unique diagnostic information in any case and provided contradictory or zzso information in three of 11 simultaneous zzso procedures zzso 

zzso bilateral zzso does not compromise the reliability of zzso zzso Both simultaneous and sequential zzso are adequate zzso however, obtaining baseline zzso samples during simultaneous zzso is unnecessary and increases the cost of the zzso
