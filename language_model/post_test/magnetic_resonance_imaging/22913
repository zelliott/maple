To zzso assess the main variables that affect the complete magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective zzso study, with the requirement for informed consent zzso Data from 101 patients zzso men, 40 zzso mean age, 39 years; age range, zzso zzso who had zzso zzso mass zzso that were zzso diagnosed as zzso (World Health Organization grade zzso zzso and zzso underwent surgery with zzso MR imaging guidance were zzso There were 21 zzso zzso 64 zzso and 16 mixed zzso zzso and residual tumor volumes were measured on zzso zzso MR images and three-dimensional zzso zzso MR zzso The zzso relationships between the tumor and eloquent cortical and/or zzso regions and the influence of these relationships on the extent of zzso were analyzed on the basis of zzso MR imaging zzso zzso measures, zzso Fisher exact test and zzso test, and zzso zzso zzso analyses were zzso 

zzso volume ranged from zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed the following tumor characteristics to be significant zzso variables of incomplete tumor zzso diffuse tumor margin on zzso MR images, zzso or zzso zzso type, and large tumor volume zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso involvement of the following structures was associated with incomplete zzso corpus zzso zzso zzso insular zzso middle cerebral artery, motor cortex, zzso radiation, visual cortex, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso analyses revealed that incomplete tumor zzso was due to tumor involvement of the zzso tract zzso zzso zzso large tumor volume zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso 

The main variables associated with incomplete tumor zzso in 101 patients were identified by using statistical zzso zzso
