Middle zzso zzso are rare structural defects previously reported to cause complex partial zzso Their debated zzso is either by failed union of zzso and zzso bone zzso centers or by erosion of the middle zzso floor secondary to pressure zzso Although magnetic resonance imaging zzso often reveals zzso the actual zzso may not be identified zzso 

We present three cases of middle zzso zzso that were identified zzso and provide a review of the relevant zzso 

All three of our case presentations demonstrate patients with medically intractable zzso and zzso findings of middle zzso zzso In all patients, careful retrospective analysis of zzso imaging provided clues to these zzso although none were suspected before zzso After zzso of the area all patients had improved seizure zzso 

Middle zzso zzso should be recognized as a potential source of zzso pathology in patients with complex partial zzso Although only 12 cases are reported in the literature, we believe that this phenomenon may be more common than previously zzso We suggest that simple zzso of the zzso alone may result in long-lasting, excellent seizure outcomes without zzso
