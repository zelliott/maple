The mechanics of the zzso are examined as a basis for imaging blood flow within the zzso The zzso is defined as that part of the circulation in which zzso forces are not negligible compared to viscous forces and as such in human subjects comprises the heart and large blood zzso Because the flow in the system is so complicated, understanding is built up piecemeal by considering various relatively zzso flows which can be seen as approximations to the actual zzso
