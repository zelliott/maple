zzso resonance imaging zzso should be a powerful tool for characterization of spinal zzso pathology in animal zzso We evaluated the utility of zzso zzso for the zzso assessment of progression of spinal zzso injury zzso in a rat zzso Thirteen adult rats were subjected to a zzso or 25 zzso unilateral cervical zzso and underwent zzso and behavioral tests during a zzso study zzso zzso was also performed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso length were the most valuable parameters to determine and were highly correlated to behavioral and zzso zzso Immediately after injury, zzso showed loss of gray zzso matter zzso presence of scattered zzso signal and local zzso zzso and zzso swelling in both zzso At 7 days after injury, the spinal zzso in the 25 zzso group was significantly larger than that of the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso was seen at 24 h in the zzso zzso group, and at 24 h and 7 days in the 25 zzso zzso The volume of zzso zzso representing zzso throughout the zzso region was significantly larger in the 25 zzso compared to the zzso zzso group at both 14 and 21 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso The appearance of the scattered zzso zzso initially representing zzso at later time points changed to a rim of zzso signal surrounding the zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso swelling at 7 days after zzso and zzso length and gray and white matter sparing as determined by zzso Other parameters that were highly correlated with zzso were quantity of zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso signal and in zzso zzso length were highly correlated to zzso zzso correlation was also found between parameters determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a valuable imaging zzso to assess the zzso evolution of zzso and to distinguish different zzso of cervical zzso in zzso In future, zzso could be applied as a screening tool to either administer zzso therapies, or enable even group distribution, prior to therapeutic intervention for example through zzso and matching of swelling and zzso
