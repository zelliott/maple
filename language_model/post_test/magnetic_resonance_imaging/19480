The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of gamma surgery zzso in the treatment of zzso cell zzso that has zzso to the zzso 

The authors performed a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 21 patients with 37 zzso brain deposits from zzso cell zzso who were treated with zzso at the University of Virginia from 1990 to zzso Clinical data were available in all zzso No patient died of progression of zzso disease or deteriorated zzso following zzso Eight patients clinically zzso zzso imaging studies were available for 23 tumors in 12 zzso Nine patients did not undergo follow-up zzso One patient lived 17 months and succumbed to systemic disease: no brain imaging was performed in this zzso Another patient refused further imaging and lived 7 zzso Seven patients lived up to 4 months after the zzso however, their physicians did not require these patients to undergo follow-up imaging examinations because of their general zzso had systemic progression of zzso Of the 23 tumors that were observed zzso one remained unchanged in volume, 16 decreased in volume, and six zzso No tumor progressed at any time, and there were no zzso changes on follow-up imaging an average of 21 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso surgery provides an alternative to surgical zzso of zzso brain deposits from zzso cell zzso Neurological side effects were seen in only one zzso freedom from progression of disease was achieved in all zzso
