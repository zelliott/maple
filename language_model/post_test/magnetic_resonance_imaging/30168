The zzso hypothesis of cognitive control proposes that zzso is higher in zzso conditions compared to zzso or neutral conditions and that increases in conflict lead to increased control on subsequent zzso A zzso model is used to address data on reaction time zzso and zzso responses in a zzso task with neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso trials, allowing investigation of zzso and zzso A zzso study is presented in which the zzso is zzso zzso at every level of processing zzso zzso and is zzso used to zzso the input in the same zzso zzso show that the models capture zzso the profile of zzso plots seen in the behavioral literature and zzso the patterns of zzso responses seen in the zzso zzso Based on the simulations it is suggested that the prefrontal zzso processes zzso and that the zzso zzso processes zzso
