zzso of musical rhythms is culturally zzso Despite this special status, relatively little is known about the zzso of rhythm perception, particularly with respect to beat zzso zzso are presented here from a series of studies that have specifically examined the neural basis of beat perception, using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and studying patients with Parkinson's zzso zzso data indicate that novel zzso sequences robustly activate the zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, although most healthy participants find it much easier to discriminate changes in zzso sequences compared to irregular zzso Parkinson's disease patients fail to show the same degree of zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso zzso are performing a crucial function in beat zzso The results of an additional zzso study indicate that the role of the zzso zzso is strongly linked to internal generation of the zzso zzso zzso activity is greater when participants listen to rhythms in which internal generation of the beat is required, as opposed to rhythms with strongly zzso cued zzso zzso connectivity between part of the zzso zzso (the zzso and cortical motor areas zzso and supplementary motor zzso is also higher during perception of beat rhythms compared to zzso zzso Increased connectivity between cortical motor and auditory areas is found in those with musical zzso The findings from these zzso methods strongly zzso the zzso zzso in processing a regular zzso particularly when internal generation of the beat is zzso
