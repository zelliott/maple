To evaluate the anatomy and function of the zzso zzso in normal women by dynamic magnetic resonance zzso 

Twelve zzso zzso zzso women with no previous pelvic surgery underwent a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging scan of their zzso The origin, orientation, zzso and function of the two components of the zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso is a thin muscle with an upward zzso It slopes forward and zzso It is of variable thickness zzso thickness zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso There are apparent gaps in the muscle zzso and at its site of origin from the zzso zzso The zzso is a thicker zzso It is shaped like a belt zzso the pelvic zzso It is taller zzso than zzso It is not attached to the zzso neck, but the zzso and lower zzso lie in close proximity to zzso The zzso moves zzso whereas the zzso moves zzso 

The zzso zzso is not a single muscle but has two functional components that vary in zzso origin, and zzso The zzso has a mainly supportive function, whereas the zzso has a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso are a normal zzso Individual components of the zzso zzso may be prone to different types of childbirth trauma and should therefore be assessed separately when planning zzso
