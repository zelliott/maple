zzso with zzso heart disease zzso have delayed brain maturation and zzso in brain zzso Brain metrics is a simple measurement technique that can be used to evaluate brain zzso This study used brain metrics to test the hypothesis that zzso in brain size persist at 3 months of age and that infants with zzso have slower rates of brain growth than control zzso zzso infants with zzso underwent serial brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso To evaluate brain growth across the first 3 months of life, brain metrics were undertaken using 19 tissue and fluid spaces shown on zzso performed before surgery and again at 3 months of zzso Before surgery, infants with zzso have smaller zzso zzso zzso and brain stem measures zzso zzso zzso At 3 months of age, zzso persisted in all measures except the zzso There was no difference between control and zzso infants in brain zzso However, the zzso zzso toward greater growth in infants with zzso zzso growth was the primary factor that related to brain zzso zzso of focal white matter zzso before and after surgery did not relate to zzso in brain size or zzso Although infants with zzso have persistent zzso in brain size at 3 months of age, rates of brain growth are similar to that of healthy term zzso zzso growth was the primary predictor of brain growth, emphasizing the importance of optimal weight gain in this zzso
