zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso with a characteristic zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether the concentration of zzso in the zzso fluid of brain tumors can be used as a marker for zzso and zzso zzso 

We investigated the expression of zzso in the zzso wall and zzso fluid of human brain tumors by zzso zzso and zzso The tumors included 12 zzso (5 zzso zzso tumors, 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 4 juvenile zzso zzso and 1 mixed zzso 2 zzso zzso tumors, 3 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso cyst, and 1 inflammatory zzso 

We detected no expression of zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso was detected in the zzso zzso of all the other zzso zzso of quantitative zzso using a zzso unit zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that, on average, a zzso higher signal was observed in the zzso zzso tumors as compared with the zzso zzso and a zzso higher signal as compared with the mixed zzso juvenile zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso correlated with zzso grade, with stronger zzso of the zzso vessels and tumor cells being observed in higher grade zzso No zzso zzso was detected in the walls of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that lack zzso vessels, and minimal zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso rim of the zzso No zzso was detected in the zzso fluid of these zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso in and around the zzso vessels and tumor cells present in the zzso walls of zzso and its deposition in the zzso zzso fluid in which zzso factors have been detected further suggests a role for zzso as an zzso zzso These preliminary results suggest that zzso of zzso in the tumor zzso fluid may indicate tumor type and zzso
