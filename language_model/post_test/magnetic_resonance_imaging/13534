Black blood single shot zzso sequences zzso employ 180 degrees zzso zzso zzso preceded by an inversion zzso double pulse associated to zzso zzso The latter produce signal void of the external volume, and possible reduction of the field of view without zzso artifacts along the phase coding zzso The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic possibilities of the zzso sequences with those of conventional zzso study of cardiac zzso 

Twenty-five patients (19 males and 9 females with age ranging from 20 to 54 zzso presented findings suggesting right zzso zzso zzso MR examinations were performed with a zzso T unit zzso zzso Horizon zzso zzso Milwaukee, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso positioned at zzso zzso The zzso study was performed with zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice thickness 10 zzso acquisition time about 5 minutes) and zzso zzso Half zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso flip angle 120 degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso Phase zzso zzso zzso 64 zzso slice zzso 10 zzso acquisition time about zzso zzso by imaging along the long and short zzso The study was completed with Fast zzso Echo sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso flip angle 25 degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso slice zzso zzso zzso subsequently assessed by zzso In order to compare both zzso two experienced zzso performed an analysis of quantitative parameters zzso intensity ratio between fat and muscular zzso zzso and qualitative parameters zzso blind evaluation for the presence of cardiac and respiratory zzso 

The signal intensity ratio for the zzso sequence images was zzso zzso zzso on the long axis and zzso zzso zzso on the short zzso whereas it was zzso zzso zzso on the long axis and zzso zzso zzso on the axis one for zzso images, with a statistically significant difference zzso and zzso for the long and short zzso zzso The two zzso evaluation of the magnitude of artifacts on the zzso and zzso images was similar only as regards the images with significant zzso zzso zzso images consistently afforded a detailed evaluation of the right zzso wall, although blurring artifacts were more common than with good quality zzso zzso zzso of fatty zzso of the right zzso wall was observed in 5 out of 25 zzso In the remaining 20 patients no fatty substitution of the muscular wall of the right zzso was zzso 

The zzso sequences provide a number of gated zzso images, similar to that obtained by conventional zzso zzso in one zzso time zzso Due to high intrinsic contrast and reduction of motion artifacts, the zzso sequences allow a good evaluation of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Image quality can be zzso due to blurring zzso Therefore zzso sequences can be zzso employed to image patients with suspected right zzso zzso zzso whenever conventional zzso images exhibit substandard zzso
