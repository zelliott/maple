zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso techniques to investigate brain function are now available on clinical MR zzso However, the software packages provided with the MR equipment to analyze the functional images are often zzso In the present study, two registration zzso for correcting motion artifacts and three procedures of statistical analysis zzso correlation analysis, zzso zzso were compared using programs implemented on a graphic zzso For both registration zzso transformation parameters for in plane translations and rotation of images were significantly affected by the task, being higher during sequential finger movements than during the control zzso zzso zzso zzso of interest were identified on the anatomical images and their boundaries automatically projected on functional zzso The number of significantly activated zzso in the zzso and zzso areas was not significantly different after the registration with the two zzso The percentage of zzso of the zzso and zzso areas whose signal intensity was significantly different between the two tasks decreased with respect to the adopted threshold of significance as a power zzso For an area identified outside the brain, the same relation was zzso no activated zzso was found for p zzso zzso The application of the zzso or of the correlation analysis yielded similar zzso The analysis of the profile of mean zzso signal intensity showed higher increases in signal zzso during the motor task in the zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso This appears to be due to a greater number of activated zzso during motor zzso The application of registration procedures, the identification of the regions of interest on the basis of the anatomical images and appropriate statistical analyses allow a more detailed characterization of zzso zzso
