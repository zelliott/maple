To evaluate the effect of zzso artery zzso zzso on zzso blood loss zzso and zzso volume in women with symptomatic zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

West of Scotland zzso and zzso zzso 

Fifty women zzso age 43 zzso with symptomatic zzso undergoing zzso between January 1999 and June zzso 

Women collected zzso protection from one zzso zzso and at regular intervals zzso This allowed objective measurement of zzso using the alkaline zzso zzso zzso volume was calculated using magnetic resonance imaging zzso before and six months following zzso zzso zzso performed bilateral zzso The zzso signed rank test was used for statistical analysis of zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso 

Median zzso zzso was 162 zzso zzso zzso range zzso The median zzso decreased to 60 zzso at 3 months zzso 34, range zzso P zzso zzso 70 zzso at zzso months zzso 34, range zzso P zzso zzso 37 zzso at zzso months zzso 25, range zzso P zzso zzso 18 zzso at zzso months zzso 17, range zzso P zzso zzso and 41 zzso at zzso months zzso 6, range zzso P zzso zzso The median reduction in zzso volume was zzso zzso 46, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso causes a statistically significant reduction in zzso measured zzso zzso is also associated with a statistically significant reduction in zzso volume at six zzso There was no relationship between the changes in zzso volume and zzso
