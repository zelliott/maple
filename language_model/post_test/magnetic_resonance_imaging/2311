Conventional functional imaging zzso use periods of repetitive task performance to generate sustained functional signal zzso We have developed a technique of imaging the small, transient signal changes that occur after single cognitive zzso The technique uses zzso imaging at 3 T to generate functional images of the whole brain with a zzso resolution of 3 zzso It uses a signal averaging technique to create time sweeps of functional zzso After a single cognitive event, widely distributed patterns of brain zzso can be detected and their time course zzso This technique enables the individual cognitive tasks that constitute a paradigm to be analyzed separately and zzso We describe the application of this new technique to separate the cognitive elements in a simple zzso motor zzso zzso of zzso patterns during zzso and zzso responses reveals zzso subdivision of the zzso zzso zzso into an anterior region zzso motor zzso involved in movement decision making and a zzso region zzso motor area zzso directly involved in motor zzso
