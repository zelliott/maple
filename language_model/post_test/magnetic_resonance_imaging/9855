zzso improvements in motor function are associated with changes in movement representation of the primary motor zzso zzso In healthy individuals, zzso magnetic stimulation zzso of zzso delivered in a strict zzso relationship zzso zzso during execution of movements enhances these effects and is superior to random zzso 

The authors tested whether training combined with zzso zzso stimulation enhances zzso reorganization in patients with zzso 

Six patients with chronic stroke participated in the zzso Patients executed zzso wrist extension movements at zzso zzso frequency while zzso repetitive zzso was applied over zzso in a strict zzso relationship to the training zzso zzso was applied to either the affected zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso changes in motor maps and zzso zzso were measured using zzso 

Training alone or combined zzso stimulation of either zzso resulted in differential effects on motor maps and zzso zzso Shifts in motor maps were associated with increases in zzso zzso In contrast to previous results for healthy participants, the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso stimulation was not present, and the zzso effect of zzso zzso stimulation was more zzso 

zzso stimulation is feasible in patients zzso and zzso map reorganization and associated decreases in zzso zzso However, because zzso protocols have a different effect on motor reorganization in the injured brain and may depend on location of the zzso protocols need to be tailored to the patient's zzso
