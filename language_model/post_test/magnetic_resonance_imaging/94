zzso of the cervical spine can be challenging when zzso involves the zzso zzso with zzso zzso screws combined with zzso wiring and bone graft placement has yielded excellent fusion rates, but the technique is technically demanding and places the zzso arteries zzso at zzso Placement of screws in the zzso zzso of zzso as described by zzso and zzso has allowed rigid fixation with greater ease and theoretically decreases the risk to the zzso However, zzso is suggested to avoid penetration zzso zzso and zzso to avoid damage to the VA, spinal cord, and zzso joint, zzso The authors describe how, after meticulous dissection of the zzso zzso zzso such screws can be placed accurately and safely without the use of zzso 

Prospective follow-up was performed in 55 consecutive patients who underwent zzso fusion of zzso by a single zzso The causes of spinal instability and type and extent of zzso were zzso All patients underwent zzso CT or MR imaging scans to determine the suitability of zzso screw zzso zzso screws were placed following dissection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso CT scans were performed to determine the extent of cortical zzso Patients underwent clinical zzso and complications were recorded as vascular or zzso A zzso grading system was created to characterize such zzso zzso by location and magnitude via percentage of screw diameter beyond the cortical edge zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso of screw zzso II zzso zzso III zzso zzso IV zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive screws were placed in the zzso of the axis by a single surgeon using external landmarks zzso In 10 cases, only 1 screw was placed because of a zzso VA anatomy or bone zzso noted zzso In no case was screw placement aborted because of complications noted during zzso Early complications occurred in 2 patients and were limited to 1 wound infection and 1 transient zzso zzso There were 15 total zzso zzso 2 of which occurred in the same zzso Twelve zzso were lateral zzso and 3 were superior zzso There were no zzso zzso The magnitude of the breach was classified as I in 10 cases zzso of zzso II in 3 cases zzso of zzso III in 1 case zzso and IV in 1 case zzso 

zzso placement of screws in the zzso zzso can be done safely and effectively without the use of zzso zzso or navigation when the zzso zzso is assessed preoperatively with CT or MR imaging and found to be suitable for screw zzso When zzso do occur, they are overwhelmingly lateral in location, breach zzso 50% of the screw diameter, and in the zzso experience, are not clinically zzso
