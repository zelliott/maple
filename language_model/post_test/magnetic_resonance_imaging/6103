zzso stiffening and zzso and zzso dysfunction may be associated with cognitive decline or white matter zzso zzso independently of blood pressure zzso We aimed to zzso using an zzso approach, the relative contributions of structural and functional vascular factors to the degree of cognitive impairment zzso zzso and the severity of zzso zzso zzso in elderly zzso patients with zzso memory complaints, a group prone to zzso 

A zzso dedicated, zzso population of 198 elderly zzso patients zzso age zzso zzso with zzso memory complaints underwent a full set of cognitive function zzso brain zzso with zzso of zzso carotid zzso zzso pulse wave zzso zzso zzso function, and plasma von zzso Factor zzso 

After adjustment for the usual cardiovascular risk factors, increased zzso zzso (as assessed by pulse wave zzso was significantly and independently associated with memory impairment in zzso The severity of zzso was independently associated with increased carotid zzso media thickness and zzso (as assessed by zzso zzso as well as with increased age and plasma levels of von zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that vascular zzso independently of blood pressure levels, may play a role in the setting of zzso memory complaints as well as of zzso in elderly zzso zzso zzso thickness and zzso as well as zzso function should be assessed simultaneously and may represent additional targets for the prevention of zzso memory complaints and zzso
