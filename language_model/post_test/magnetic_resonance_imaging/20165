To demonstrate their applications in biological and medical fields such as in zzso magnetic separation of cells or zzso drug or gene delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging, the zzso zzso of zzso and surface zzso magnetic zzso have become essential and are zzso zzso we developed a facile zzso zzso method for the preparation of zzso zzso zzso and hollow zzso by using zzso zzso as single iron zzso These magnetic zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their magnetic properties were also studied by using a zzso quantum interference device zzso zzso at room zzso Then the zzso zzso zzso were applied to zzso and magnetic resonance imaging in live zzso
