zzso findings of an enlarged head of zzso zzso or zzso pancreatic duct zzso with or without a zzso common zzso duct zzso on CT or magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients without zzso zzso raise suspicion for a pancreatic zzso but their clinical significance has not been zzso 

To determine the prevalence of pancreatic zzso in this patient zzso 

zzso analysis of a prospective zzso 

zzso university zzso 

Patients without zzso zzso at initial zzso who underwent zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso for an abnormal CT and/or zzso with an enlarged zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso with or without a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The final diagnosis was based on definitive zzso surgical pathology, and clinical zzso 

An zzso examination was performed by using a zzso zzso followed by a linear zzso if a focal pancreatic zzso was zzso zzso zzso were stained with zzso and zzso methods, and were immediately assessed by an attending zzso 

zzso The prevalence of pancreatic zzso and zzso performance characteristics of zzso for identifying zzso zzso in this patient zzso 

In 110 study patients, the final diagnosis included zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), neuroendocrine tumor zzso zzso 1), tumor zzso zzso zzso 1), and benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had zzso evidence of chronic zzso and, in the remaining 65 patients, the zzso was zzso The accuracy of zzso and zzso for diagnosing pancreatic zzso in these patients was zzso with zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso negative zzso value, and zzso positive zzso zzso 

A retrospective design and surgical confirmation in only a small number of study zzso 

A pancreatic zzso is seen in a clinically significant number of patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso with or without a zzso zzso but without zzso zzso zzso seems highly accurate for diagnosing pancreatic zzso in these zzso
