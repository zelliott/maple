To assess the value of imaging by zzso T MR and by zzso zzso in confirming skeletal infection in patients with zzso infections and/or bone zzso 

Thirty-nine anatomical sites (35 zzso with suspected bone infection were zzso zzso with zzso T MR and zzso zzso zzso infected areas were zzso 12 zzso (out of which 3 were zzso and 27 zzso infections (both bone and zzso infection in 7 zzso 

MR imaging showed 31 zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso and one zzso diagnosis of infection and zzso 27, 7, 0 and 5 zzso The sensitivity of MR for zzso was zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity of MR and of zzso for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of MR for zzso infection was zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso The zzso figures for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR and zzso were zzso with respect to the final diagnosis in zzso zzso sites and zzso in 10 zzso In one patient with zzso zzso a zzso finding was found by both zzso MR detected all 3 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were indistinguishable from infection by zzso 

Combined imaging with MR and zzso zzso is recommended in zzso complicated bone infections except for zzso where MR is the method of zzso zzso positive findings are highly suggestive of infection, the extent of which can be zzso zzso negative results exclude zzso
