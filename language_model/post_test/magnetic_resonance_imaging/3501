zzso zzso zzso of the shoulder are rare, and their zzso is similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso are most frequently reported along the zzso superior, and anterior aspects of the zzso joint and are uncommon zzso to the zzso These zzso rarely become evident zzso unless they cause zzso of surrounding structures, zzso zzso 

We report a retrospective series of five patients with inferior zzso zzso zzso of the shoulder without zzso of the surrounding nerve which were treated during the period from March 2007 to December zzso All these patients presented with only chronic shoulder pain as their chief complaint, and zzso zzso showed the zzso over the inferior aspect of a torn zzso zzso All patients were treated by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso All patients were re-evaluated with zzso performed at an average of 15 months zzso The clinical outcome, including the zzso score, was assessed for all patients at a median of 16 months zzso 

All the five patients had zzso of pain and were satisfied with the shoulder zzso The zzso zzso in all patients showed no zzso zzso zzso The median zzso score improved from a zzso level of zzso points to zzso points at last zzso 

This study demonstrates that, in the absence of any nerve zzso symptoms around the shoulder joint, inferior zzso zzso with zzso tear also be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic shoulder zzso zzso repair of the zzso with repair of the zzso can lead to the disappearance of zzso zzso of this clinical condition and its imaging features is critical for a correct diagnosis of this uncommon cause of chronic shoulder zzso
