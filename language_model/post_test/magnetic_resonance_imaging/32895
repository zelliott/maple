Canal zzso of the horizontal semicircular canal in zzso disease is a frequent zzso zzso zzso is the single most characteristic zzso finding in zzso zzso However, the relationship between zzso zzso and canal zzso is still not zzso 

We used magnetic resonance imaging to zzso zzso of parts of the zzso zzso labyrinth into the horizontal semicircular canal and correlated this zzso feature with the caloric function of the horizontal semicircular zzso 

Patients who showed zzso into the horizontal canal had a significantly impaired caloric function when compared with patients without this zzso zzso 

zzso into the semicircular canal may be the zzso correlate for impaired caloric response in patients with zzso zzso
