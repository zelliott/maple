zzso network zzso abnormalities have been identified in patients with chronic schizophrenia using zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Here, we examined the integrity of the zzso in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis zzso compared with zzso and zzso healthy zzso 

We collected zzso data from 19 zzso patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso and 19 healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso at zzso Following standard zzso we examined the functional connectivity zzso of two zzso zzso and the two zzso hubs zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso exhibited abnormal zzso that appeared largely restricted to the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative to controls, zzso patients exhibited weaker positive zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extending zzso through the zzso lobe to the zzso angular zzso Patients with zzso exhibited weaker negative zzso between the lateral zzso zzso and the zzso cortex, zzso The zzso and zzso junction also exhibited weaker negative zzso with the right zzso zzso extending to the zzso zzso and lateral zzso cortex, in zzso patients, compared to zzso By contrast, patients with zzso showed stronger negative zzso between the zzso pole and zzso motor cortex, anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in patients with a zzso suggest that zzso patterns are altered even in the early stages of zzso
