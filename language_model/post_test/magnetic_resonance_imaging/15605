zzso behavior depends critically on processing of positive and negative information at various stages such as reward zzso outcome monitoring, and choice zzso zzso and zzso evidence suggests that processing of positive zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso reward information may be zzso and individually zzso However, it remains uncertain whether different stages of reward processing share certain neural zzso in frontal and zzso areas, and whether distinct but interactive systems in these areas are recruited for positive and negative reward zzso To explore these issues, we used a monetary decision-making task to investigate the roles of frontal and zzso areas at all three stages of reward processing in the same zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Participants were instructed to choose whether to bet or bank a certain number of zzso If they decided to bank or if they lost a zzso they started over betting one zzso If they won a zzso the wager was doubled in the next zzso Positive reward zzso winning outcome, and evaluation of right choices activated the zzso and zzso zzso cortex, whereas negative reward zzso losing outcome, and evaluation of wrong choices activated the lateral zzso cortex, anterior zzso superior zzso pole, and zzso frontal zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of reward information and zzso comparison more strongly predict a functional zzso in frontal and zzso areas than do various stages of reward zzso These distinct but interactive systems may serve to guide zzso zzso zzso
