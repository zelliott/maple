Neurological manifestations in patients with inflammatory zzso disease supposedly are rare, although the exact frequency is not zzso Most previous reports involve cerebral zzso zzso central nervous system zzso or peripheral nerve zzso 

Two cases of patients diagnosed with inflammatory zzso disease developing neurological symptoms with corresponding zzso in the white matter of the central nervous system led us to search a neurological database with clinical and zzso data for similar zzso 

We identified five patients who presented with acute neurological deficits preceding or following a diagnosis of inflammatory zzso disease with evidence of zzso in the central nervous system white matter on magnetic resonance zzso zzso investigations did not provide evidence of systemic zzso zzso disorders, or zzso 

These cases, together with previous reports, suggest that white matter zzso may be another zzso manifestation of inflammatory zzso zzso
