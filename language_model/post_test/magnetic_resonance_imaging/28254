zzso findings are increasingly used as outcome measures in therapeutic trials in zzso The zzso between the extent of the zzso on conventional zzso images and the clinical condition of the patient is one of the problems encountered in such zzso This zzso paradox prevents the use of zzso data as surrogate markers of disability in zzso A recent pilot study suggested a relationship between zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso To assess in more detail the correlation of changes in zzso zzso load on zzso zzso MR images zzso zzso with changes in disability in zzso we studied 46 patients with clinically zzso zzso at baseline and after a median follow-up of 40 zzso There was a significant correlation between baseline disability and zzso zzso load zzso rank correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In secondary progressive patients, the rate of zzso of these zzso zzso was significantly related to progression rate zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso We speculate that the appearance of zzso zzso is the zzso equivalent of a failure of zzso Overall, zzso zzso load zzso correlated better with clinical assessments than zzso zzso load zzso zzso of zzso zzso load on zzso zzso zzso helps to resolve the zzso paradox between disability and zzso and has the potential to be a surrogate marker of disability in zzso
