We examined the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on brain structure in a subset (N zzso zzso of general population members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth zzso selected through a zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to produce zzso matter maps from each zzso high resolution zzso weighted brain magnetic resonance images, which were subsequently entered into a general linear model with zzso zzso as defined by Met zzso zzso gender and zzso by gender interaction as independent zzso Additional analyses were carried out on zzso matter volumes within the zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso to examine effects on overall zzso volume and also using the zzso as a mask for zzso zzso as this is an area previously reported as associated with Met zzso zzso We failed to find any statistically significant association with zzso matter volume and Met zzso loading in the zzso gene or interaction affects between zzso and gender in either the whole brain zzso analysis or in the area of the zzso
