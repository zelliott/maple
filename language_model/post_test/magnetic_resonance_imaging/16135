With increasing age, a subset of otherwise healthy individuals zzso zzso in learning and memory that have been termed mild cognitive impairment zzso The enhanced zzso activity associated with learning and memory requires increased cerebral blood flow zzso to specific brain zzso However, the interactions between cerebral blood flow and zzso remain zzso In this study, we address whether baseline or zzso zzso blood zzso zzso changes in zzso are modified with age, and whether these measures are zzso of cognitive status in zzso Adult and aged rats were evaluated using a zzso task in a water zzso Aged rats were classified as zzso or zzso based on performance comparisons with adult zzso zzso blood flow was assessed using zzso inversion recovery zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso before and after breathing zzso zzso The transition period between zzso zzso was examined with blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso zzso of aged animals into zzso and impaired categories revealed increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso versus zzso aged zzso Linear zzso revealed that higher zzso zzso was correlated with impaired memory in aged animals, and a zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso predicted spatial memory zzso Several brain regions of aged rats demonstrated an zzso of the zzso increase normally observed in adult rats under zzso zzso animals were the primary contributor to this effect, as their zzso response to zzso was significantly reduced compared to adult zzso Aged, zzso animals were not significantly different from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a reduced response in aged animals to zzso with impaired animals being the primary contributor to the zzso A zzso zzso model based on zzso and zzso zzso correctly predicted cognitive status in zzso of animals zzso Our results indicate that age-related changes in vascular zzso and zzso are important contributing factors in memory zzso
