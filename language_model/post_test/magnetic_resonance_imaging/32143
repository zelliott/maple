To evaluate the functionality and zzso of zzso in subjects who underwent narrow gastric tube zzso reconstruction after total zzso using magnetic resonance zzso with zzso sequences acquired during positive oral contrast agent zzso 

Ten patients, who underwent zzso reconstruction after total zzso between 2002 and 2004, were studied using a zzso T magnet zzso zzso Siemens, zzso Germany, featuring total imaging zzso zzso equipped with surface zzso and integrated spine zzso Imaging protocol included zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso Flip zzso 8 degrees ; zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso 128 zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso acquired on zzso and zzso planes to achieve zzso evaluation during oral administration of positive contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Good quality images were obtained in all patients, with adequate zzso contrast and a frame rate of zzso frames per second zzso Three patients had completely zzso zzso of zzso six patients had mild to moderate zzso including raised transit time, zzso and contrast agent zzso one patient had severe zzso with zzso zzso zzso severe zzso and zzso 

zzso approach represents a promising radiation-free zzso in the evaluation of functionality and zzso of zzso Further investigation in the evaluation of zzso patients is zzso
