Review of magnetic resonance imaging was compared with the zzso review of zzso specimens from 24 pediatric patients who had initial incomplete zzso for soft tissue zzso to determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting residual zzso The median age of patients was zzso zzso The most common diagnosis was zzso zzso zzso of 24 zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging detected residual tumor in eight patients and no tumor in eight zzso the images of eight patients were zzso zzso examination showed residual tumor in 14 of 24 zzso specimens obtained in zzso For two of the eight patients zzso for whom imaging had detected no zzso microscopic examination detected residual zzso for one of the eight patients for whom imaging had detected zzso microscopic examination detected no zzso Five of the eight patients zzso for whom the results of imaging studies were indeterminate had residual tumor on microscopic zzso The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for detecting residual tumor was zzso the specificity was zzso the positive zzso value was zzso and the negative zzso value was zzso zzso regarding the need for additional zzso should not be based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso
