Right zzso structure and function were characterized in spontaneously zzso rats zzso using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso These studies therefore complement previous reports preoccupied with left zzso changes associated with this zzso Eight zzso and eight control zzso zzso zzso rats were each subdivided into equal zzso groups of 8 and 12 zzso The right zzso was zzso through a series of twelve zzso zzso zzso zzso sections at twelve equally spaced zzso that covered both zzso and most of zzso thereby completely reconstructing right zzso zzso This gave zzso of right zzso zzso mass that were consistent through all twelve zzso in all four experimental groups throughout their cardiac zzso However, spontaneous hypertension increased this right zzso zzso mass, as well as the zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso Although stroke volume zzso was zzso decreases in ejection fraction zzso a positive shift in the relationship between zzso and zzso and reduced zzso of zzso ejection rates in zzso rats compared with the zzso normal zzso controls indicated significant zzso zzso Additionally, reductions in the rates of zzso relaxation suggested the onset of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso nature of zzso has made it possible for the first time to demonstrate zzso in structure of the right zzso and in quantitative indicators of its zzso and zzso function in the zzso model of zzso
