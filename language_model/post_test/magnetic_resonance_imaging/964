The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of an zzso zzso black zzso zzso sequence with chest zzso for the detection of pulmonary zzso zzso AND zzso zzso patients with various primary zzso who had undergone zzso and zzso of the chest also underwent zzso black zzso zzso zzso of the zzso MR images and zzso were interpreted zzso The number, location, and size of detected zzso were recorded, and each zzso was classified as affected or not affected on the basis of a grade reflecting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and positive and negative zzso values for the detection of pulmonary zzso with diameters of 5 zzso or larger were determined, using zzso findings as the standard of zzso zzso with diameters smaller than 5 zzso were not zzso Additional zzso comparisons between zzso and zzso findings were zzso 

zzso confirmed pulmonary zzso in 32 patients, whereas zzso zzso revealed zzso in 30 patients and chest zzso in 19 zzso zzso revealed 226 zzso in 32 patients, whereas zzso zzso revealed 227 zzso in 30 zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity for chest zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, whereas zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Positive and negative zzso values for chest zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso increased with zzso size, ranging from zzso for zzso between 5 and 10 zzso in diameter to zzso for zzso exceeding 3 zzso in zzso 

zzso black zzso zzso zzso is reliable for detecting pulmonary zzso exceeding 5 zzso and has proven significantly more accurate than conventional chest zzso The technique appears useful as an adjunct to zzso of the heart, great vessels, or chest, potentially increasing the diagnostic yield of zzso zzso
