Human brain function zzso complex transformations across the zzso We employed zzso functional zzso and zzso approaches to systematically chart the lifespan trajectory of the zzso organization of human zzso functional networks in 126 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 zzso Brain networks were constructed by computing zzso correlations in zzso zzso fluctuations among zzso zzso units followed by zzso network zzso We observed that the human brain functional zzso exhibited highly preserved zzso modular and rich club organization over the entire age range zzso Further quantitative analyses revealed linear decreases in zzso and zzso shaped zzso of local efficiency and rich club zzso zzso zzso age effects were mainly located in several hubs zzso default network, zzso attention zzso Finally, we observed inverse zzso of long- and zzso functional connections, indicating that the reorganization of connectivity concentrates and distributes the zzso functional zzso Our results demonstrate zzso changes in the zzso functional zzso across nearly the entire human zzso providing insights into the neural zzso underlying individual variations in behavior and zzso These results have important implications for disease zzso because they provide a baseline for evaluating network zzso in age-related zzso zzso
