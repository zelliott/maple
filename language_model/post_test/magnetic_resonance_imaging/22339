Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we examined the distribution of cerebral zzso related to implicitly learning a series of fixed zzso zzso In a novel - zzso - zzso of the zzso zzso Time task zzso simultaneous finger movements of the two hands were made in response to pairs of visual stimuli that were presented in a fixed order zzso zzso zzso stimulus presentation prevented explicit sequence knowledge occurring during task practice, which implied that a dual task paradigm could be zzso zzso zzso training on randomly ordered stimulus pairs allowed us to focus on the acquisition of implicit sequence zzso zzso specifically related to the acquisition of fixed sequence knowledge was highly significant in the right zzso prefrontal zzso The zzso prefrontal and right zzso zzso zzso were more indirectly related with such procedural zzso We conclude that this set of zzso reflects a stage of implicit sequence learning constituted by components of zzso spatial working memory zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso response monitoring and selection zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso facilitated linkage of zzso cues to compatible responses zzso zzso zzso Comparing the zzso zzso actions with fixed sequences showed zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso dominance in real-time zzso zzso The relative long time during which performance improves in the zzso provides an opportunity for future study of various stages in both general skill and fixed sequence zzso
