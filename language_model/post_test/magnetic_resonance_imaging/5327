Regarding therapy and prognosis of acute zzso stroke the identification of zzso zzso is zzso A promising candidate is zzso using zzso For valid interpretation of experimental studies in animals normal values for zzso are zzso zzso values in humans at zzso already zzso zzso values for cortical and zzso structures in a spontaneously zzso stroke prone rat stem zzso at a zzso of zzso are zzso 

39 (20 males and 19 zzso spontaneously zzso stroke prone zzso rats were examined in a zzso scanner using a dedicated small animal zzso Mean weight was zzso zzso zzso and mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso For the calculation of zzso multiple echo zzso and zzso w images were zzso zzso were placed into deep and cortical zzso matter in five different brain regions to obtain values for zzso zzso and zzso 

Mean zzso for cortical zzso matter was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for deep zzso zzso The zzso confidence zzso for cortical zzso matter was zzso zzso For zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The values for zzso presented here can serve as reference values for further studies examining the zzso zzso in a rat zzso
