This study aimed to develop a zzso zzso loop zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for zzso zzso MR zzso 

We first designed the zzso zzso which was made of a zzso cable with its extended inner conductor and outer conductor connected to two zzso We then evaluated in zzso the functionality of the zzso zzso by imaging a zzso in a phantom and achieving zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso map of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso we validated in zzso the feasibility of using the zzso zzso to generate intravenous zzso MR images of parallel zzso arteries of zzso living zzso 

In zzso evaluation showed that the zzso zzso zzso functioned well as a receiver zzso with the zzso MR zzso clearly displaying the vessel wall with even distribution of MR signals and zzso contours from the zzso zzso Of the in zzso studies, the new zzso zzso enabled us to successfully generate intravenous zzso MR imaging of the zzso zzso 

This study confirms that it is possible to build such zzso zzso at zzso zzso for zzso zzso MR zzso
