The left zzso zzso contributes to zzso hand zzso In this study, we targeted this region with zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to assess the effects on a wider distributed zzso related to motor zzso Ten healthy subjects underwent 3 zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso They either executed or imagined right wrist zzso movements, which was preceded by a zzso period either with or without zzso This was applied to the left superior zzso zzso in 10 stimuli of 1 zzso at zzso motor threshold zzso zzso preceding the movement execution condition resulted in significantly increased zzso in the bilateral zzso right zzso and left zzso zzso zzso when compared to movement without such intervention zzso zzso zzso volume zzso Movement imagery after zzso showed significantly increased zzso in the left zzso prefrontal cortex, right lateral prefrontal cortex, left zzso zzso and right zzso cortex, while a decrease was present in bilateral anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso changes after zzso of left superior zzso zzso thus appears to increase prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with a reduced function of the anterior zzso cortex, including zzso These changes are thought to reflect an impaired ability to estimate the zzso consequences of movement during its preparation, which is compensated by the increased contribution of more remote zzso and prefrontal cortical zzso
