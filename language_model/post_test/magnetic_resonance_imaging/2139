zzso resonance imaging zzso was employed for zzso analysis of vascular zzso during zzso maturation in the zzso rat zzso zzso Changes in water diffusion and in zzso led us to suggest that hypoxic stress may be a component in the regulation of zzso in the growing zzso However, in contrast with solid tumors of similar size, the spatial and zzso pattern of expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso did not match the zzso zzso The mismatch could be explained by the role of zzso as a high molecular weight zzso of zzso maintaining an avascular zzso zzso
