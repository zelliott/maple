Memory is constructive in nature so that it may sometimes lead to the retrieval of distorted or zzso zzso Sleep zzso accurate zzso memory consolidation but might also promote such memory zzso We examined the influence of sleep and lack of sleep on the cerebral zzso of accurate and false recollections using zzso After zzso lists of zzso related word associates, half of the participants were allowed to sleep, whereas the others were totally sleep deprived on the first zzso zzso During a subsequent zzso zzso session taking place 3 days later, participants made recognition memory judgments about the previously studied associates, critical theme words (which had not been previously presented during zzso and new words unrelated to the studied zzso zzso relative to sleep zzso enhanced accurate and false zzso No significant difference was observed in brain responses to false or zzso recollection between sleep and sleep deprivation zzso However, after sleep but not after sleep deprivation zzso zzso accurate and zzso recollections were both associated with responses in the zzso and zzso zzso The data suggest that sleep does not selectively enhance zzso memories but rather tends to promote zzso consolidation in zzso circuits of memories subsequently associated with both accurate and zzso zzso We further observed that during zzso zzso responses were selectively larger for items subsequently accurately retrieved than for material leading to zzso zzso The data indicate that the early organization of memory during zzso is a major factor influencing subsequent production of accurate or false zzso
