The differential diagnosis and the identification of the source of zzso in zzso zzso zzso syndrome due to a zzso zzso still represents a challenge for the zzso We report our experience in six patients with zzso zzso zzso in whom extensive zzso imaging, and zzso evaluation was zzso All patients presented with zzso associated with high plasma zzso zzso The zzso test and high dose zzso suppression test suggested an zzso source of zzso in three of six zzso During bilateral inferior zzso zzso zzso none of the patients showed a central to peripheral zzso zzso At the time of diagnosis, none of the patients had zzso evidence of the zzso source of zzso whereas zzso zzso identified the zzso in two of four zzso Finally, a chest zzso zzso scan revealed the presence of a zzso zzso in all patients, and zzso zzso identified four of six zzso In all patients a zzso zzso was found and zzso In one patient with zzso evidence of residual disease after two operations, zzso surgery, using a hand-held gamma probe after zzso administration of zzso zzso was zzso this allowed detection and removal of residual multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our data show that there is not a single zzso test or imaging procedure accurate enough to diagnose and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surgery appears to be promising in the presence of multiple tumor zzso and previous incomplete removal of the zzso
