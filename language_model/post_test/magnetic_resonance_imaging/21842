We describe two brothers aged 8 and 10 affected by severe bilateral zzso carrying an identical point zzso of the zzso gene zzso Both children had severe zzso deficits and mental zzso although they differed in the zzso extent of the brain zzso and in the severity of the clinical zzso The present findings, together with the reported cases of zzso associated with zzso zzso support the hypothesis that, at least in some cases, zzso are determined by deleterious zzso of this zzso zzso The different zzso pictures suggest that, besides the zzso zzso other factors are relevant in determining the severity of the brain zzso and clinical zzso
