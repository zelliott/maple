People alter their task performance on a zzso basis, for example after an zzso trial on tasks involving response zzso Previous research has found that these adjustments are most robust in the Simon zzso One explanation for behavioral adjustments is the zzso hypothesis, which zzso that the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso responds to conflict and that this serves as a signal to recruit other brain regions such as the prefrontal zzso zzso to minimize conflict and improve zzso However, another independently supported explanation for behavioral adjustments on the Simon task is the feature integration view, which can account for behavioral adjustments as the result of stimulus repetitions and zzso zzso by itself, evidence for behavioral adjustments on the Simon task does not clearly provide evidence for the zzso zzso However, the zzso hypothesis does predict that behavioral adjustments on the Simon task should involve zzso conflict activity and zzso post-conflict zzso In the current study, consistent with the zzso hypothesis, behavioral adjustments in performance on the Simon task were predicted by zzso zzso zzso In addition, subsequent behavioral adjustments were associated with zzso activity, with previous trial zzso zzso activity predicting greater zzso activity on subsequent zzso These results provide additional evidence that behavioral adjustments on the Simon task are due in part to zzso conflict monitoring and the subsequent recruitment of zzso to minimize zzso
