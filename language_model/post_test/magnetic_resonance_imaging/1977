We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure brain activity when subjects were performing identical tasks in the context of either a zzso switch or a continuation of earlier zzso The context, zzso switching or staying with the current task, influenced zzso frontal cortical zzso the zzso frontal zzso is zzso activated at the time that subjects switch from one way of performing a task to zzso Two types of zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso zzso zzso subjects switched between different rules for response selection and had to choose between competing zzso In the zzso zzso zzso subjects switched between different rules for stimulus selection and had to choose between competing visual zzso The type of conflict, sensory zzso or motor zzso involved in switching was critical in determining zzso frontal zzso Switching in the zzso paradigm was associated with clear zzso signal increases zzso in three zzso frontal zzso the zzso zzso zone, the zzso zzso zone, and the zzso motor area zzso Switching in the VS task was associated with zzso zzso in just one zzso frontal area, a region on the border between the zzso and the zzso zzso to the zzso session, we used zzso zzso zzso procedures and repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to test the importance of the zzso frontal zzso for task zzso zzso zzso over the zzso disrupted subsequent zzso performance but only when it was applied in the context of a zzso This result shows, first, that the zzso is essential for task switching and second that its essential role is transient and limited to just the time of behavioral zzso The results are consistent with a role for the zzso in selecting between response sets at a zzso level rather than in selecting individual zzso The effect of the zzso was not simply due to the tactile and auditory artifacts associated with each zzso zzso over several control regions did not selectively disrupt zzso zzso zzso over the zzso area activated in the VS paradigm did not disrupt zzso This result, first, confirms the limited importance of the zzso frontal zzso for sensory zzso zzso Second, the VS zzso results suggest that just because an area is activated in two zzso does not mean that it plays the same essential role in both zzso
