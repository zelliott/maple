To evaluate the zzso intensity zzso zzso generated from intravenous zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance zzso zzso scans for identifying zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso 

MR zzso studies of children were zzso zzso and 52 zzso units of 26 patients (15 females and 11 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso who had also undergone zzso zzso zzso examination were included in this zzso The patients were examined on a zzso zzso For functional MR zzso and to generate zzso curves, we used a post IV zzso two-dimensional zzso fast field echo zzso sequence zzso zzso 17 zzso TE zzso zzso zzso flip angle zzso zzso 90 degrees ) in the zzso zzso MR zzso zzso zzso that demonstrated a prompt and zzso fall of the initial third phase followed by intermittent or constantly increasing zzso zzso above the baseline from which the second phase starts were considered to have zzso We compared the differences in zzso zzso between the control group and patients with zzso during zzso zzso 

Twelve zzso units of eight patients (four bilateral and four zzso had zzso during zzso filling on zzso The zzso zzso of these patients showed intermittent (N zzso 8 zzso zzso and constantly increasing (N zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso One patient also had bilateral abnormal zzso zzso suggesting zzso despite the normal zzso zzso In the control group, 25 units had normal zzso zzso curves, six zzso units had urinary zzso with good zzso after zzso injection, and four zzso units had upper urinary zzso without contrast zzso while five zzso units did not show any zzso None of the patients in the control group revealed distortion in the zzso zzso The differences in zzso zzso patterns between the control group and patients with zzso during zzso filling were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

After a prompt and zzso decrease of the initial third phase of the zzso curve, intermittent spikes or a constant rise in zzso above the baseline suggest the existence of zzso
