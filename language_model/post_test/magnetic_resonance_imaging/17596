The zzso transplantation zzso is a well accepted treatment option for focal cartilage zzso in the knee joint, whereas the fate of the transplanted cartilage is still unclear and the clinical outcome is zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso character of zzso transplanted cartilage and to correlate technical aspects and the patients' history with the clinical zzso 

The zzso was performed in 27 patients zzso age of 32 zzso zzso with a focal zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso We investigated the clinical outcome after a median follow-up of zzso zzso months using the zzso and the integration of the transplanted plugs using an zzso zzso zzso specimens from representative patients zzso zzso 8) were evaluated with zzso zzso and zzso 

The median zzso was 80 zzso zzso The wide range of the zzso in clinical outcome did not show significant differences in: zzso zzso injuries, zzso size or zzso The zzso analysis revealed in all cases a regular zzso integration of the zzso bone, but a failed zzso zzso The zzso of the plugs to the joint surface was often zzso however a correlation between the zzso and the clinical outcome could not be zzso zzso of the transplanted cartilage revealed small changes in zzso after a relatively short-term zzso whereas the cartilage has still the typical zzso zzso Often, the surrounding cartilage consists of zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso of the joint surface can not be restored to the original status, particularly in larger defects with irregular zzso However, we did not find any aspects which affected the function of the knee joint following zzso It can be assumed that remaining zzso at the surrounding cartilage could maintain the inflammatory process and therefore maintain the pain and a low knee zzso Further investigations are needed to specify the effects of the zzso on the transplanted cartilage and its influence on the later clinical zzso
