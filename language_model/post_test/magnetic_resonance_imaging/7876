To evaluate the effect of different zzso and zzso zzso array designs on spin zzso and specific zzso rate zzso of a 7 T zzso head zzso 

We developed finite difference time domain zzso models of different zzso array zzso zzso and zzso helmet zzso with varying copper trace zzso a zzso zzso zzso model, and two head models were used in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso measured and validated with zzso zzso 

zzso copper trace zzso of zzso in array models caused subtle changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso distribution were observed in the head models with zzso zzso Peak zzso increased zzso to zzso in different zzso for a mean B1 zzso in the brain of 2 zzso Total zzso in the head models for 1 W forward power increased zzso in the heads with zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso with different zzso zzso indicate a change in zzso radiation of the zzso zzso even when changes in B1 zzso and zzso between ports of zzso zzso were zzso 

Changes in zzso zzso and subtle changes in B1 zzso field zzso were observed in the presence of zzso zzso Thus, incorporation of the zzso array effects are needed when evaluating zzso and designing zzso transmit pulse zzso parameters for zzso and/or zzso for 7 T zzso
