A common problem in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data is zzso the statistical reliability of an estimated zzso zzso While visual comparison of the classified active regions across zzso of an experiment can sometimes by zzso it is typically difficult to draw firm conclusions by zzso noise and complex patterns in the estimated map make it easy to be zzso Here, several statistical models, of increasing complexity, are developed, under which zzso reliability can be zzso defined and zzso The method yields global measures of reliability that apply zzso to a specified set of brain zzso The estimates of these reliability measures and their associated uncertainties under these models can be used to compare statistical methods, to set thresholds for detecting zzso and to zzso the number of images that need to be acquired during an zzso
