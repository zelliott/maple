zzso studies have proved that zzso relate to the deficient of memory in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder zzso Many studies in healthy subjects also shown that insular zzso zzso be involved in the zzso zzso This study was designed to investigate whether insular zzso is involved in zzso memory deficits in patients with zzso 

Twelve subjects with zzso and 12 subjects without zzso victims underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso All subjects performed zzso and retrieval memory tasks during the zzso zzso zzso zzso method was used to analyze zzso volume, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze activated brain areas when performing zzso 

Grey matter volume was significantly reduced zzso in the insular zzso of zzso subjects than zzso zzso group also had lower level of zzso in insular zzso when performing word zzso and retrieval tasks than zzso zzso 

The study provides evidence on structural and function abnormalities of the insular zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso volume in insular zzso may be associated with zzso memory deficits in patients with zzso
