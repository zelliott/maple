The purpose of this study was to investigate the separate effects of cooling during the acute zzso 60 zzso zzso or zzso zzso h zzso phase on skeletal muscle after zzso zzso male subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to the control zzso zzso zzso immersion zzso zzso and zzso immersion groups zzso zzso The zzso immersion (15 zzso was administered to the subjects' legs after zzso exercise zzso after recording initial zzso measures, zzso after recording initial and 24 h zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso images were obtained to calculate the zzso relaxation time zzso of the zzso zzso muscle before, immediately after, and at the following times zzso 20, 40, and 60 zzso and 24, 48, 96 and zzso zzso In addition, the ankle joint range of motion, serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso and muscle zzso level were investigated before and after zzso In all groups, significant zzso zzso in the zzso muscle appeared from immediately after to 60 zzso after exercise zzso zzso zzso showed significantly zzso zzso levels in the zzso at zzso h zzso zzso while zzso and zzso showed significantly smaller zzso values than the zzso at 96 h zzso zzso In addition, zzso showed larger increases in serum zzso at 96 h zzso (not zzso and significantly greater muscle zzso levels at 48 h zzso zzso than the cooling zzso The results of this study may suggest that cooling has no dramatic effect, but some minor effects on reducing zzso muscle zzso in the zzso phase and zzso the extent of the damaged muscle zzso
