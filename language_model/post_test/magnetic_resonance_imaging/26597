A zzso bias is well known in humans and animals, and commonly related to the right zzso dominance for spatial zzso Our previous zzso study suggested that this bias is zzso by faster zzso from the right to left zzso zzso than the reverse zzso et zzso zzso However, the limited zzso resolution of zzso and evidence on the critical involvement of zzso regions in zzso of spatial attention suggested further investigation of the zzso bias using zzso zzso In this simultaneous zzso study, healthy participants were presented with face pictures in either the right or left visual fields while performing a central fixation zzso zzso event related zzso zzso to the stimulus zzso showed an association between faster zzso from the right to the left zzso and higher zzso zzso in the left zzso nucleus following left visual field zzso This zzso finding provides original evidence of the involvement of zzso central zzso regions in the zzso zzso This assertion was further strengthened by a zzso analysis designated at cortical zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso connections from the right to left than vice versa, already at the zzso zzso zzso zzso connections within the right than the left hemisphere, from the zzso to the zzso This zzso neural superiority can guide future efforts in alleviating attention deficits by focusing on improving network zzso
