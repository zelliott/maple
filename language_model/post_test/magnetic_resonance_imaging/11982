zzso contrast in MR images is a strong function of zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation zzso However, the zzso relaxation time is rarely zzso because of the long scan time required to produce an accurate zzso map of the zzso In a standard zzso zzso technique, this procedure may take up to 30 zzso zzso of the zzso imaging zzso technique which incorporate the principle of inversion recovery zzso enable zzso zzso maps to be produced in total scan times varying from a few seconds up to a zzso Using zzso rapid zzso of zzso values may thus lead to better discrimination between tissue types in an acceptable scan zzso
