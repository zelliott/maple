To date, cortical regions activated by zzso stimulation have not been identified precisely in zzso In this study we used magnetic source imaging to zzso zzso activity following zzso stimulation with two zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso Peak zzso of the zzso zzso magnetic fields corresponded to the ascending and descending slopes of the major zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso At these zzso we obtained consistent zzso of the zzso parts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the superior zzso zzso No zzso equivalent current zzso were found in other brain areas, including the zzso zzso For the first time, brain areas were identified that generate most components of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
