Although individuals born prematurely have subtle white matter abnormalities and are at risk for cognitive dysfunction, few studies have examined functional reorganization in these zzso In this study we use zzso zzso to examine cortical reorganization related to zzso Thirty-one adolescents zzso selected from a zzso study on child development based on zzso age, birth weight and zzso complications (full term, low-risk zzso high-risk zzso and reading ability zzso average or zzso performed two zzso rhyme tasks during zzso zzso zzso current zzso were localized every 4 zzso during the 150 zzso to 550 zzso period following the onset of the word zzso The association of the mean number of zzso zzso with birth risk, reading ability and zzso was zzso During the zzso rhyme task, adolescents born at high-risk demonstrated a greater zzso in the left prefrontal area than those born at low-risk and zzso During the zzso rhyme task, good and average readers born at high-risk demonstrated a greater zzso in the left prefrontal area than good and average readers born at low-risk and zzso Time course analysis confirmed increased zzso in the left prefrontal regions of those born at zzso This study suggests that adolescents born prematurely at zzso as compared to those born at low-risk and term, demonstrate increased prefrontal cortical zzso during a reading zzso These results suggest a reorganization of the prefrontal zzso in adolescents born prematurely at zzso
