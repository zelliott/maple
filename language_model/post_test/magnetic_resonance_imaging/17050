zzso state zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso acquisitions are characterized by zzso spontaneous activity in a default mode network zzso zzso brain areas and linked to zzso zzso and an zzso zzso system zzso lateral zzso areas and modulated via external sensory zzso In order to better determine the functional contribution of these networks to conscious zzso we here sought to zzso zzso their relationship by means of zzso We used independent component analysis zzso on resting state zzso acquisitions during normal zzso under hypnotic state, and during a control condition of autobiographical mental zzso As compared to mental imagery, zzso zzso of resting state zzso networks resulted in a reduced zzso lateral zzso cortical zzso possibly reflecting a decreased sensory zzso The default mode network showed an increased connectivity in bilateral angular and middle frontal zzso whereas its zzso zzso and zzso structures decreased their connectivity during zzso supposedly related to an altered zzso awareness and zzso zzso In our view, zzso resting state studies of zzso zzso sleep or zzso pharmacological zzso sedation or zzso and pathological zzso zzso coma or related zzso of zzso default mode and zzso zzso sensory networks, and their interaction with other cerebral networks, will further improve our understanding of the neural zzso of zzso zzso
