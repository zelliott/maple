To zzso evaluate differences in zzso of cerebral zzso zzso in zzso disease zzso on zzso imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso at 3 zzso 

zzso and zzso were applied for 50 consecutive zzso zzso zzso was defined as a very low signal intensity area in each sequence without continuity from surrounding vessel zzso Numbers of zzso were compared between the 2 zzso To assess zzso a grading score was assigned to each zzso from Grade 3 zzso to Grade 0 zzso on zzso and zzso respectively, and were compared by zzso signed rank zzso 

A total of 37 zzso were detected in 21 patients zzso on zzso compared with 27 zzso in 16 patients zzso on zzso with significant difference in number of zzso between the 2 sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed greater visual grading score on zzso than on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso offers better zzso of zzso in zzso than zzso at 3 zzso
