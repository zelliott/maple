To investigate the capability of a zzso magnetic resonance zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso for assessment of zzso damaged zzso and to evaluate the time course of signal enhancement in the zzso zzso 

Nine cats were subjected to 90 minutes of zzso of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 90 minutes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained for 12 hours in five cats and 6 hours in four zzso zzso examinations of the zzso specimens were performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso The size of enhanced area on MR images was compared with that of zzso damaged zzso with zzso zzso The time course of signal enhancement was zzso 

The size of enhanced area on MR images was well correlated with that of zzso damaged zzso with zzso zzso zzso enhancement occurred 1-3 hours after administration of the contrast material, with mean enhancement of zzso that of normal zzso zzso microscopic examinations showed severe zzso damage in the zzso damaged zzso but only mild zzso changes in the zzso damaged zzso 

MR images enhanced with zzso zzso provide accurate zzso of zzso damaged zzso with a strong and persistent signal enhancement in the zzso zzso
