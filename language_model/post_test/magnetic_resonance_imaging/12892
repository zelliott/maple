The zzso zzso zzso is an important regulation center of sympathetic nerve zzso Several clinical studies have indicated a possible association between essential hypertension and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have found that patients with essential hypertension and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by adjacent arteries have increased sympathetic nerve activity and that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure and sympathetic nerve zzso Although zzso agents are expected to lower blood pressure in these patients, this remains to be zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso a calcium channel blocker that blocks both vascular zzso and sympathetic zzso zzso channels in zzso patients with zzso zzso Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, 46 patients with zzso essential hypertension were distributed into those with and without zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso All patients were prescribed 10 zzso of zzso for 16 zzso Office and home blood pressure, plasma zzso and left zzso mass index were measured by zzso before and after zzso treatment, and changes were compared between the two zzso At zzso plasma zzso was significantly higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso in office and home blood pressure, plasma zzso and left zzso mass index were significantly greater in patients with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso lowers blood pressure by zzso enhanced sympathetic nerve activity and reduces left zzso mass in zzso patients with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
