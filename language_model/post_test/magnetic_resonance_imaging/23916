zzso gel zzso Research, zzso Guilford, zzso has been evaluated for measuring zzso radiation therapy zzso dose zzso Treatment plans with target doses of 1500 zzso were generated by the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso using test target zzso The gels were enclosed in 13 zzso outer diameter zzso glass zzso zzso zzso was conducted using seven smaller (4 zzso zzso zzso glass vessels zzso to zzso zzso in 300 zzso zzso zzso maps of the zzso relaxation rate zzso were obtained using a zzso T magnetic resonance imaging zzso system zzso Medical Systems, zzso zzso and correlated with zzso A zzso spin echo sequence was used with zzso zzso 3 zzso TE zzso 20 and 100 zzso zzso zzso 1, using 1 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso zzso The zzso zzso were repeated weekly to identify the zzso zzso zzso chamber, zzso zzso zzso and film zzso zzso of the zzso dose zzso were obtained to compare against the gel zzso The other zzso were used in a phantom with the same external zzso as the gel zzso The zzso zzso values of the large vessels did not precisely track the smaller vessels, so the zzso chamber zzso were used to zzso the gel dose zzso The zzso standard zzso of the gel dose zzso was zzso zzso When compared with the zzso chamber zzso averaged over the chamber volume, zzso agreement was zzso Comparisons against zzso film dose distribution zzso and the treatment planning dose distribution calculation were used to determine the spatial zzso accuracy of the gel and zzso zzso zzso was better than 2 zzso and the dose was accurately determined by the gel both within and outside the zzso The zzso chips were placed throughout the phantom to determine gel measurement precision in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso dose comparison tool that simultaneously examines the zzso and zzso was used to evaluate the gel in both zzso high-dose zzso zzso When zzso and 3 zzso criteria were used for the zzso more than zzso of the zzso zzso agreed with the zzso with the worst of 309 zzso chip zzso disagreeing by zzso of the zzso All four zzso measurement session zzso dose zzso were compared to evaluate the time behavior of the zzso The zzso regions were evaluated by comparison with zzso zzso at selected points, while high-dose regions were evaluated by directly comparing measured dose zzso Tests using the zzso comparison tool showed zzso degradation beyond one week zzso but all zzso zzso passed relative to the test criteria and the dose zzso showed few regions that zzso
