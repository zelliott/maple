The right zzso junction zzso is consistently implicated in two cognitive zzso attention and social zzso We conducted zzso zzso zzso to investigate potentially separate functional zzso within zzso implementing this cognitive zzso Both zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso zzso connectivity analysis independently identified two distinct clusters within zzso subsequently characterized by network mapping and functional zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso correlations revealed that the anterior cluster increased neural activity zzso with a zzso network, functionally associated with attention, and decreased neural activity zzso with a zzso network, functionally associated with social zzso and memory zzso The zzso cluster showed the exact opposite association zzso Our data thus suggest that zzso links two zzso brain networks processing external versus internal zzso
