zzso studies in monkeys have identified zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The lateral zzso area, for example, responds zzso for zzso whereas the zzso reach region responds zzso for arm zzso However, the degree of zzso selectivity actually observed is zzso each area contains zzso selective for the zzso zzso and many zzso in both areas respond for both zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree of zzso preference at the population level, focusing on zzso organized regions in the human zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso An zzso design adapted from monkey experiments was zzso In each trial, an zzso cue preceded the appearance of a spatial target, after which a Go signal instructed subjects to produce the specified movement with the specified zzso Our results show that the degree of zzso specificity is limited in many cortical areas and transitions gradually from zzso to reach preference as one moves through the hierarchy of areas in the zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso preference was observed in visual cortex, including early areas and zzso zzso exhibited balanced zzso to zzso and zzso whereas zzso showed a weak but significant preference for zzso In frontal cortex, areas near the central zzso showed a clear and absolute preference for zzso whereas the frontal eye field showed little or no zzso zzso Although these results contradict many theoretical conclusions about zzso zzso they are compatible with the complex picture arising from zzso studies and also with previous imaging studies that reported mostly overlapping zzso and zzso zzso The results are also compatible with theories of efficient coding in zzso
