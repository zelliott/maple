An investigative study was undertaken to determine the potential for a new magnetic resonance zzso imaging technique, zzso zzso delivery of zzso off zzso for use as a diagnostic imaging tool for the zzso The zzso technique provides fat suppression with zzso weighting and is ideal for zzso breast zzso It is a short repetition time, zzso sequence for high-resolution three-dimensional acquisitions and provides a clinically efficient imaging time of approximately 5 minutes for 128 zzso Imaging findings were correlated with serially zzso zzso specimens in 30 breasts with 47 zzso and 27 benign zzso MR imaging had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso MR imaging depicted additional zzso not seen at zzso in 11 of the 30 patients zzso The zzso not seen at zzso varied in size from 3 zzso to 12 zzso zzso MR imaging may be used to improve diagnosis of breast cancer in patients with zzso dense breasts or silicone zzso and to stage disease in patients who are candidates for zzso
