zzso navigation systems represent a huge step forward in the surgical treatment of zzso pathological conditions but lack the ability to provide real-time imaging feedback for assessment of zzso results, such as zzso positions and the extent of tumor zzso An open magnetic resonance imaging system for zzso surgery was developed in Toronto, by a multidisciplinary team, to provide real-time zzso zzso 

The preliminary experience with a zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging system for zzso imaging, which was developed at the University of Toronto for the surgical treatment of patients with zzso zzso is zzso The system is known as the zzso minimally invasive therapy zzso 

Between February 1998 and March 1999, 36 procedures were performed, including 21 tumor zzso 12 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso for zzso zzso Three complications were zzso All zzso were successful, and the surgical goals were achieved for all zzso zzso included restricted access resulting from the confines of the magnet and the imaging zzso design, difficulties in working in an operating room that is less spacious and familiar, inconsistent image quality, and a lack of zzso tools that are as effective as standard zzso zzso zzso included real-time imaging to facilitate surgical planning, to confirm entry into zzso and to assess the extent of zzso and zzso and immediate zzso imaging to confirm the extent of zzso zzso placement, and the absence of zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging has great potential as an aid for zzso surgery, but a number of zzso problems require zzso
