To compare the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of late pregnancy bleeding and to assess the accuracy of the different MR sequences in visualizing the origin of zzso 

42 patients in the third zzso of pregnancy underwent to US and zzso for the evaluation of painless zzso zzso zzso zzso True zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were zzso Two zzso blinded to the results of zzso reviewed each case, resolving by consensus any zzso zzso standards were surgical and pathological zzso 

The reference standards identified 22 zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso (1 zzso with a zzso zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso with zzso zzso zzso identified correctly all these condition with an zzso agreement of zzso zzso and zzso weighted sequences were statistically superior to zzso and True zzso sequences in detecting the cause of bleeding zzso US had 6 false zzso and 2 false positive results, its diagnostic accuracy resulting lower than zzso zzso 

zzso accurately evaluates pregnancy bleeding with an excellent zzso agreement and can grant new and additional data when US is zzso
