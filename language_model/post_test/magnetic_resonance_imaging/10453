zzso foot pain is a common cause of zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has the potential to detect damage in all zzso of the zzso foot, but an understanding of the differences in magnetic resonance zzso images between feet from horses with and without zzso foot pain is zzso This study aimed to describe MR findings in feet from horses with no history of zzso zzso and to compare these with MR findings in horses with zzso improved by zzso digital local zzso Thirty-four limbs from horses zzso with a clinical diagnosis of zzso syndrome zzso zzso months zzso positive response to zzso digital nerve blocks and absence of other zzso problems) zzso zzso and 25 feet from zzso horses with no history of foot pain zzso N) were zzso For each zzso structure, MR signal intensity and zzso size, definition of margins, and relationships with other structures were zzso zzso in MR signal intensity and zzso were graded as mild, moderate, or severe and compared between Groups L and zzso zzso revealed that there were significant differences in MR images between Groups N and zzso Multiple zzso MR signal changes were present in zzso of limbs from Group L and moderate zzso were graded zzso in zzso of limbs from Group zzso In most Group L zzso more than three structures and frequently six to eight structures were zzso zzso abnormalities involved most frequently the deep digital zzso tendon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone, collateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso (with significant associations in severity grade between these zzso sometimes with involvement of the zzso zzso joint and/or its collateral zzso It was concluded that findings on MR images were different between horses with and without foot pain, and that pain localized to the foot was associated with MR changes in a variety of structures, indicating that damage to several structures may occur zzso and that MR imaging was useful for evaluation of foot zzso
