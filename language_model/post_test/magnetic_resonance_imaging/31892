In this study, a zzso zzso based zzso for the first time, was proposed and applied to discriminate children with zzso disorder zzso from normal zzso On the basis of regional zzso zzso a mapping of brain function at resting state, zzso Fisher zzso analysis zzso was trained to build a linear zzso zzso test was then conducted to identify the brain areas with the most significant contribution to the final zzso Experimental results showed a correct zzso rate of zzso using a zzso zzso Moreover, some highly zzso brain regions, like the prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso cortex, well confirmed the previous findings on zzso Interestingly, some important but less reported regions such as the zzso were also zzso We conclude that the zzso using zzso brain function as zzso feature, has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of zzso
