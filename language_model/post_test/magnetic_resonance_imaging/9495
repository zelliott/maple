The zzso of zzso structures has been associated with zzso sleep zzso zzso We zzso that: 1) a smaller zzso is a risk factor for zzso and 2) the previously observed zzso positioned zzso bone in zzso is associated with enlarged tongue zzso This is a zzso study using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 55 zzso and 55 controls were matched for age, sex and zzso The analysis was zzso by sex and controlled for age, race, zzso neck visceral fat, skeletal type and tongue zzso We found that a zzso increase in zzso length and depth were associated with decreased risk of sleep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in males but not in zzso Greater zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in males and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in males and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso distances were associated with increased risk of zzso The difference for zzso position between zzso and controls was lost after controlling for tongue zzso Enlargement of tongue is likely to be the zzso factor for zzso positioning of zzso A small and shallow zzso is an independent risk factor for zzso in males but not in zzso
