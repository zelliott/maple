Although numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have been performed on the processing of zzso information, the zzso zzso system so far has not received much zzso In the present study, we sought to delineate the neural zzso of zzso stimulation using carbon dioxide zzso presented to the left or right zzso Fifteen right-handed men underwent zzso using single runs of 3 conditions zzso in the right and the left zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso the right zzso As expected, zzso zzso were located in the zzso zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso and zzso regions including the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso the zzso thalamus, the zzso the zzso zzso cortex, and the zzso Left compared with right side zzso resulted in stronger zzso and brain stem zzso right versus left stimulation resulted in stronger zzso of the superior zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest a zzso processing system that taps into similar cortical regions and yet is separate from that of the zzso zzso The overlapping pattern of cortical zzso for zzso and zzso stimuli is assumed to be due to the intimate connections in the processing of information from the 2 major zzso zzso zzso
