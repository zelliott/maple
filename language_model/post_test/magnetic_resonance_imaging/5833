To compare contrast zzso three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso and zzso row zzso zzso zzso in the same patient with regard to image quality of zzso disease and zzso vascular zzso 

This study enrolled 32 patients with zzso disease who underwent both zzso zzso dynamic zzso and zzso CT using zzso Data analysis of image quality was performed by two zzso based on source images, zzso reconstruction zzso curved zzso reconstruction zzso and maximum intensity projection zzso zzso zzso of image quality was based on a 4-point image quality rating zzso 

The overall image quality of the zzso zzso images was superior to that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protocol yielded an average score of zzso points versus zzso for the CT zzso No significant difference was found between zzso zzso and zzso images in zzso or zzso image zzso Image quality for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso arteries was significantly improved using zzso zzso No significant difference was found between the zzso and zzso MR in portal vein branch image zzso 

zzso dynamic zzso MR imaging at zzso is a comprehensive technique which provides high image quality in zzso zzso
