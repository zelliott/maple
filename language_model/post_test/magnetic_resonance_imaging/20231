The measurement of the zzso is a zzso procedure and there are no reliable gold zzso This abstract shows a zzso zzso for zzso It has equivalent flow properties to those within the tissue zzso system of the human brain and allows the validation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso phantom consists of a zzso for the simulation of the zzso system, a feeding tube for simulation of the zzso and a zzso pump for simulation of the zzso Using this zzso zzso the exact determination of the gold standard zzso due to the well-known geometry of the phantom is zzso It was validated based on different zzso zzso These zzso were investigated with standard software zzso zzso zzso The software determined the zzso within the zzso zzso Based on this zzso a comparison to the gold standard was made with several different flow zzso After zzso selection, a total of 726 zzso data points were automatically extracted by the zzso 

This results in a comparison of the gold standard zzso to these 726 zzso zzso zzso a zzso and reliable zzso zzso between gold standard zzso and measured zzso using the software was zzso It can be shown that the zzso between gold standard and software-based evaluation ranges between 1 and 31 zzso 

There is no significance for any correlation between flow speed and amount of zzso The mean measured zzso is zzso % higher than the gold standard zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this kind of zzso the validation of different software systems allows reliable conclusions about their zzso
