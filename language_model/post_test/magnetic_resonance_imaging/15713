Inspired by the challenge of determining the nature of cracks on the zzso of Michelangelo's statue David, we discovered that one can image zzso gas in cracks in marble samples with zzso The imaging method produces images of gas with a zzso ratio zzso of zzso which is very high for magnetic resonance imaging zzso in general, let alone for an image of a gas at zzso equilibrium zzso To put this unusual zzso in better perspective, we zzso zzso in a crack in a marble sample and zzso the lung tissue of a live rat (a more familiar variety of sample to many zzso zzso using the same pulse zzso the same size coils and the same zzso zzso In both cases, we try to image zzso thin sheets of material that should appear bright against a darker zzso By choosing imaging parameters appropriate for the different relaxation properties of zzso gas versus lung tissue and by choosing zzso sizes appropriate for the different goals of detecting zzso cracks on marble versus resolving zzso thin sheets of zzso the zzso for zzso full of material was 220 and 14 for marble and zzso zzso A major factor is that we chose large zzso to zzso zzso for detecting small cracks and we chose small zzso for resolving lung features at the expense of zzso Imaging physics will cooperate to provide detection of small cracks on marble, but David's size poses a challenge for magnet zzso For the modest goal of imaging cracks in the left ankle, we desire a magnet with an approximately zzso gap and a flux density of approximately zzso T that weighs zzso zzso
