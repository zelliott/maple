To compare the ability of zzso and zzso prostate seed implants to escalate biologically effective dose zzso to zzso of disease while reducing prescription dose to the zzso 

Nine plans, using zzso zzso and zzso alone and in combination were created zzso for 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used for treatment zzso zzso zzso was calculated for zzso and zzso zzso zzso uniform zzso zzso was used to compare zzso The zzso planning target volumes zzso were delineated along with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prescribed to conventional doses, were generated to achieve good zzso zzso The zzso were zzso used to generate implants using zzso of zzso For zzso zzso we also explored the impact on zzso of lowering prescription doses by zzso 

The zzso of zzso in the setting of primary zzso implant increased zzso when zzso and zzso were used compared with zzso zzso zzso prescription dose by zzso in zzso implants results in a potential zzso reduction in zzso zzso with preservation of zzso coverage while still boosting zzso (up to zzso When zzso parameters corresponding to zzso disease are assigned to zzso zzso zzso used in mixed implants have the potential to preserve the equivalent biological effect of zzso implants considering zzso disease distributed in the entire zzso 

This is a zzso study proposing a treatment paradigm that could be the middle ground between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of two zzso concurrent with decreasing the minimal peripheral dose is shown to increase zzso of selected zzso while preserving the therapeutic effect at the level of the zzso
