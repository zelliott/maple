zzso zzso zzso zzso is typically zzso while zzso forms are usually referred to spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso or zzso during the course of infections and zzso Our objective was to evaluate the frequency of zzso zzso to clarify the zzso of these forms through comparison with zzso and zzso TM zzso 

Prospective cohort study on patients presenting with zzso was carried out zzso of zzso and zzso Disease zzso zzso 

Over an zzso period, we recruited 13 patients with zzso and 16 with zzso The patients were zzso for at least 3 years with repeated brain and spinal zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso and serum screen for zzso zzso were defined on clinical and imaging zzso 

Four patients with zzso zzso had a zzso course zzso They were all males with age zzso and severe zzso zzso The final outcome was poor in three out of four zzso zzso zzso G was zzso in all zzso zzso extensive zzso was not zzso of zzso zzso and zzso shared clinical, zzso fluid zzso and zzso features, as well as a similar rate (54 vs zzso of peripheral nervous system involvement zzso and an identical rate of relapses zzso for both zzso 

Our series support the existence of zzso zzso as a disease entity that does not appear related to zzso nor to zzso cannot be further specified and shares many features with zzso The likelihood of relapses was unpredictable based on clinical, zzso and zzso zzso
