The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the zzso and zzso of brown zzso tissue zzso in zzso in a rat zzso We hypothesized that, based on differences in tissue water and zzso content, zzso could reliably differentiate between BAT and white zzso tissue zzso and could therefore be a possible alternative for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the current gold standard for zzso BAT zzso 

Eleven rats were studied using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso A dual echo zzso sequence was used, both with and without spectral zzso inversion recovery zzso fat suppression zzso to zzso zzso after which all BAT was surgically zzso The BAT volume zzso obtained via zzso and zzso MR were zzso compared with the zzso zzso All study protocols were reviewed and approved by the local ethics zzso 

The BAT mass zzso that were obtained using zzso MR zzso images correlated better with the zzso findings zzso zzso than did the zzso obtained using zzso zzso zzso regardless of the BAT zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the basic feasibility of the zzso method was demonstrated in three human pilot zzso 

This study demonstrates the potential for zzso to reliably detect and zzso BAT in zzso zzso can provide information beyond that provided by zzso imaging, and its ability to detect BAT is independent of its zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso is a low-cost alternative that does not require zzso
