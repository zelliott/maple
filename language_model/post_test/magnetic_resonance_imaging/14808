There is an emerging interest in using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso measurement for the evaluation of degenerative cartilage in zzso zzso However, relatively few studies have addressed zzso changes in adjacent knee zzso This study used zzso zzso measurement to investigate sequential changes in knee cartilage, zzso and zzso bone zzso in a rat zzso model induced by anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso 

zzso male Sprague zzso rats were randomly separated into three groups zzso zzso 6 each zzso Group 1 was the normal control zzso Groups 2 and 3 received zzso and zzso respectively, of the right zzso zzso values were measured in the knee cartilage, the zzso and zzso zzso bone zzso of all rats at 0, 4, 13, and 18 weeks after zzso 

zzso zzso values were significantly higher at 4, 13, and 18 weeks zzso in rats of the zzso group than in rats of the control and sham groups zzso In the zzso group zzso to the sham and control zzso zzso values increased significantly first in the zzso horn of the zzso zzso at 4 weeks zzso zzso zzso then in the anterior horn of the zzso zzso at 13 weeks zzso and began to increase significantly in the zzso zzso bone zzso at 13 weeks zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso change in zzso over time in cartilage, zzso and zzso bone zzso were zzso This information could be potentially useful for in zzso monitoring of disease zzso
