Two hypotheses were zzso zzso that zzso variations in bulk phase and zzso of zzso in vascular volume elements can indicate the presence of zzso blood flow, and zzso that a substantial loss of signal intensity on magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso regions is due to zzso changes in zzso To test these zzso a technique was developed in which zzso variations in zzso zzso were used to create zzso projection images, which showed only zzso flow zzso flow zzso in zzso and in zzso In phantom studies, this technique recovered signal intensity downstream from zzso A combination of zzso flow maps with zzso images improved zzso of zzso regions and provided information on characteristics of local zzso These results show that zzso variations in zzso zzso occur in regions of zzso flow and are an important cause of loss of signal zzso This technique can provide information about dynamic blood flow and improve depiction of zzso structures on MR zzso
