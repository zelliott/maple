zzso zzso zzso is in development as an oral treatment for zzso multiple zzso which is commonly treated with zzso agents zzso or zzso zzso 

In this phase 3, zzso study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of oral zzso at a dose of 240 zzso two or three times daily, as compared with zzso in patients with zzso multiple zzso An active agent, zzso zzso was also included as a reference zzso The primary end point was the annualized zzso rate over a period of 2 zzso The study was not designed to test the superiority or zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso 

At 2 years, the annualized zzso rate was significantly lower with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in disability progression with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso As compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced the numbers of new or enlarging zzso zzso zzso (all zzso and new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In post hoc comparisons of zzso versus zzso zzso differences were not significant except for the annualized zzso rate zzso zzso new or enlarging zzso zzso zzso (both zzso zzso and new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for each zzso zzso events occurring at a higher zzso with an active treatment than with zzso included zzso and gastrointestinal events (with zzso and zzso events (with zzso zzso There were no zzso zzso or opportunistic infections reported with zzso zzso counts decreased with zzso 

In patients with zzso multiple zzso zzso (at both zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso rates and improved zzso outcomes relative to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso number, zzso
