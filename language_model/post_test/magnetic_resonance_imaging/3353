The formation and maintenance of a functional zzso is essential for normal embryonic development, and genetic changes that affect the zzso zzso zzso in many human zzso In zzso imaging in mouse models is required to understand the full complexity of zzso vascular formation, which is a dynamic and zzso zzso zzso zzso of genetically expressed fluorescent reporter proteins offers high resolution but limited depth of penetration in zzso zzso there are a plethora of molecular zzso for alternative in zzso vascular imaging zzso but few options for genetic control of contrast zzso 

To develop a reporter system for zzso imaging of genetic processes involved in zzso vascular zzso 

To approach this problem, we developed an optimal tagging system based on zzso zzso In the resulting zzso reporter system, zzso of 2 interacting proteins results in zzso labeling of cell zzso thus enabling zzso imaging with zzso zzso To assess this approach for in zzso imaging, we generated transgenic mice that expressed the zzso zzso from a minimal zzso zzso A variety of imaging methods were used to show the utility of this approach for quantitative analysis in embryonic and adult models of vascular development, using zzso injection of zzso zzso for near zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

The present results demonstrate the versatility of the zzso system for studies of vascular biology in genetically engineered mice, providing a robust approach for zzso in zzso imaging of genetic processes in the zzso
