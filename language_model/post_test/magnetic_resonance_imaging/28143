In zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso of 16 isolated dog brains were studied by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The observed zzso peak had an irregular shape, which implied that it represented more than one single homogeneous pool of zzso To evaluate our ability to discriminate between single and multiple zzso and determine peak areas, we designed studies of simulated zzso zzso with the zzso zzso ratios ranging from zzso to zzso with reference to the simulated zzso zzso For the analysis we used computer programs with a linear prediction zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the simulated data had very high zzso levels, both methods located the peak centers zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was the more reliable at low zzso zzso The linear prediction method was poor at determining peak zzso at comparable zzso levels, the zzso zzso determined all peak areas relatively zzso Application of the zzso zzso to the individual experimental in zzso dog brain data resolved the zzso peak into seven or more separate zzso A composite spectrum obtained by averaging all spectral data from six of the brains with normal zzso zzso was fitted using the zzso zzso The results suggested that there were eight significant zzso with the following chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parts per million zzso Although linear prediction demonstrated the presence of only three peaks, all corresponded to values obtained using the zzso zzso The peak indicating a compartment at zzso zzso zzso zzso was assigned to zzso pH on the basis of direct simultaneous zzso zzso On the basis of earlier zzso studies of brain zzso zzso the zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were thought to represent zzso fluid and the zzso zzso zzso
