To compare zzso filling seen at magnetic resonance zzso zzso after zzso stimulation and zzso parameters determined with the zzso zzso test zzso for evaluation of pancreatic zzso zzso 

MR zzso after zzso stimulation and zzso were performed in 41 patients with chronic zzso zzso 1) and eight patients with other pancreatic disease zzso zzso A control group zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso underwent MR zzso after zzso stimulation zzso MR zzso were acquired before and every 30 seconds for 10 minutes after zzso zzso zzso filling was graded from least amount of filling zzso 1) to normal filling zzso 3) on the last MR zzso zzso zzso function was determined at zzso Main pancreatic zzso diameter was compared between groups 1 and zzso 

All zzso diameters were significantly larger in group 1 zzso zzso The zzso diameter variation after zzso stimulation was significantly higher in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso function parameters determined at zzso were significantly lower in patients with grade 1 zzso filling than in those with grade 2 or 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration alone was independently associated with all grades of zzso filling zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of reduced zzso filling for assessment of reduced pancreatic zzso function were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso filling grade determined at MR zzso after zzso stimulation allows specific zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso
