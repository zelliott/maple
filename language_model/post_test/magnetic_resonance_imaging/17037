The development of diagnostic imaging zzso evaluation of spinal zzso but there is no full correspondence between zzso and zzso changes observed in zzso studies and clinical zzso The aim of the study was to: zzso Evaluate the degree of signal intensity and degenerative changes of zzso discs in the zzso spine on zzso zzso Estimate zzso reliability of zzso of pathology between experienced and inexperienced medical zzso 

The sample consisted of 89 persons aged between 18 and 21 zzso zzso scans of the zzso spine were evaluated by the use of a console for digital analysis by three medical doctors with different levels of zzso 

Evidence of zzso of zzso disc was found in zzso at the zzso level, and in zzso of cases at the zzso zzso zzso reliability ranged from full agreement at levels where degenerative changes are rarely observed to fair and poor agreement at zzso and zzso zzso reliability showed full agreement on higher levels to good and very good at zzso and zzso zzso zzso reliability concerning the degree of degenerative changes was zzso for zzso to zzso but was poor at zzso and zzso zzso reliability ranged from full agreement at higher levels to poor at zzso and moderate at zzso 

zzso zzso zzso disk changes were found in zzso of the study zzso zzso zzso of the degree of degenerative changes of zzso discs requires specialist training and zzso
