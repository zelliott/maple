In an attempt to improve the detection of zzso abnormalities with magnetic resonance imaging, a zzso three-dimensional zzso acquisition in the steady state zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso by study of five zzso knee zzso zzso with this zzso sequence then were compared with results with three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two three-dimensional zzso echo sequences zzso and zzso zzso in the assessment of naturally occurring abnormalities of the zzso compartment in 10 zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso sequence were significantly better zzso zzso zzso than results with the other five sequences and had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso In addition, normal cartilage consistently appeared as a zzso structure with the zzso zzso zzso a feature that appeared to help in identification of zzso zzso
