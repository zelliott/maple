zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been widely used for zzso brain regions that tend to work in tandem and grouping them into zzso Despite that certain brain regions are known to interact with multiple zzso few existing techniques support identification of zzso with zzso To address this zzso we propose a novel approach based on zzso dynamics that zzso detection of sparse overlapping zzso We refer to our approach as overlapping zzso dynamics zzso On synthetic data, we show that zzso achieves higher accuracy in zzso identification than state-of-the-art zzso On real data, we demonstrate that zzso is able to identify major functional hubs that are known to serve as communication channels between brain regions, in addition to detecting commonly observed functional zzso Moreover, we illustrate that knowing the zzso zzso enables zzso of functional zzso zzso from primary sensory areas to the integration zzso
