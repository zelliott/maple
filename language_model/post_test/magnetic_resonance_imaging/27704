It has long been known that specific visual zzso result in greater blood flow to the zzso zzso These zzso are thought to reflect zzso of local zzso firing that is reflective of local cortical zzso Since disrupted neural connectivity is a possible zzso for zzso our goal was to investigate whether localized zzso as measured by zzso zzso is abnormal in children and adolescents with zzso zzso included 25 children and adolescents with schizophrenia and 39 controls matched for age and zzso zzso were scanned on a zzso 3 zzso Trio scanner while observing flashing zzso presented at either 1, 4, 8, or 12 zzso Image processing included both a standard zzso model and a zzso transform zzso Patients had significantly smaller volume of zzso in the zzso lobe compared to zzso There were no differences in the integral or percent signal change of the zzso response function for each of the four zzso zzso zzso was stable during development between childhood and late zzso Finally, both patients and controls demonstrated an increased response between 4 and 8 zzso consistent with zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso Children and adolescents with schizophrenia had a significantly lower volume of zzso in the zzso lobe in response to the flashing zzso zzso However, features of intact local connectivity in patients, such as the zzso response function and zzso response at 8 zzso were zzso These results are consistent with abnormalities in regional connectivity with preserved local connectivity in zzso zzso
