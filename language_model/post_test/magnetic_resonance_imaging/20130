zzso zzso for optical zzso often introduces upon the resulting sections zzso that make zzso reconstruction zzso Here we present an automatic method for producing a smooth zzso volume from distorted zzso sections in the absence of any zzso zzso The method is based on zzso elastic image zzso between successive tissue zzso which can be zzso by zzso image zzso Using a zzso zzso an average zzso is zzso for each section from the zzso zzso in a group of its neighboring zzso The average zzso zzso each section to match its neighboring zzso thus creating a smooth volume where corresponding features on successive sections lie close to each zzso The proposed method can be used with any existing zzso image registration method for zzso zzso In particular, we present a novel image zzso zzso based on dynamic programming that extends Dynamic Time zzso in zzso speech recognition to zzso zzso zzso between high-resolution zzso zzso The zzso zzso efficiently zzso a restricted class of zzso local zzso that are characteristic between successive tissue zzso Finally, a validation framework is proposed and applied to evaluate the quality of reconstruction using both real sections and a synthetic zzso
