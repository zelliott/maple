This study compares zzso and zzso for zzso detection after zzso repair of abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with previous zzso underwent both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within 1 week of each other for zzso zzso zzso was performed by using a zzso contrast medium zzso zzso zzso Two zzso independent observers evaluated zzso and zzso zzso Consensus reading of zzso and zzso studies was defined as reference zzso zzso zzso and accuracy were calculated and Cohen's k statistics were used to estimate agreement between zzso Twenty zzso were detected in 18 patients at consensus reading (12 type II and 8 indeterminate zzso zzso zzso and accuracy for zzso detection were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for reader 1 zzso zzso zzso for reader 2) for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for reader 1 zzso zzso zzso for reader 2) for zzso zzso agreement was excellent for zzso zzso zzso zzso and good for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the use of a zzso contrast agent is significantly superior in the detection of zzso after zzso compared with zzso zzso may therefore become the preferred technique for patient follow-up after zzso
