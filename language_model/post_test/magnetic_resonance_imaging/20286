In Japan, zzso zzso after CT screening is the most common imaging strategy prior to intravenous zzso zzso with tissue zzso zzso zzso within 3 h after zzso zzso A choice of zzso with MR zzso zzso provides a higher diagnostic zzso but may delay an initiation of zzso 

In our zzso brain CT is the first screening image for suspected zzso We zzso examined a delay to zzso imaging zzso diagnostic zzso and clinical outcomes at 3 months by the modified Rankin zzso in patients receiving zzso within 3 zzso 

Among 67 patients receiving zzso with zzso brain imaging prior to zzso was solely CT in 10 zzso patients and CT + zzso in 57 zzso zzso Final diagnosis of brain zzso was zzso Patients receiving CT + zzso had significantly shorter zzso delay zzso 54 zzso 83 zzso p zzso zzso but longer zzso time zzso 90 zzso 57 zzso p zzso zzso than those receiving CT zzso Finally, time from onset to zzso was not different between the two groups and clinical outcomes were also zzso The earlier patients arrived, the longer zzso times were zzso zzso zzso 

The imaging strategy of initial CT screening with optional zzso scans prior to zzso was zzso However, it resulted in an additional 30 zzso zzso delay of zzso administration, which may affect clinical zzso
