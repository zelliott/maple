To determine the zzso value of CT and zzso in AIDS we studied the survival of patients with neurological involvement, in relation to the initial imaging zzso Twenty-six initial CT and 15 zzso examinations of 41 patients were reviewed for the presence of cerebral zzso and/or focal zzso The mean survival time of patients with initially normal imaging was longer zzso zzso 89 zzso than that of patients with isolated cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso or isolated focal zzso zzso zzso zzso The shortest survival (78 zzso 44 zzso was found in patients with both cerebral zzso and focal zzso The risk of death in patients with zzso alone was zzso times higher, that in patients with focal zzso alone zzso times higher, and in patients with both changes zzso times higher than in patients with initially normal zzso zzso imaging with CT and/or zzso thus allows identification of AIDS-related cerebral changes and may contribute to assessment of zzso
