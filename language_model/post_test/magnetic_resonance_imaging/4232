To examine the degree and frequency of reductions in zzso volume in patients with zzso lobe zzso with and without a history of zzso zzso 

In zzso measures of zzso volume were zzso from three zzso zzso echo zzso images in 44 patients undergoing comprehensive evaluations for zzso zzso Twenty one patients zzso reported a history of zzso zzso The volumes from these patients were compared with those from 23 patients without a history of zzso zzso and 34 healthy zzso 

The zzso seizure group had significant reductions in volume, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso seizure zzso Twelve of 18 patients with zzso zzso exhibited clinically significant zzso volume zzso defined as volumes falling 2 zzso below the mean obtained from the control zzso Only four of 19 patients without zzso zzso exhibited this degree of zzso No significant correlations were found between seizure variables (for example, duration of zzso seizure zzso and zzso reductions in zzso However, a significant inverse correlation zzso zzso between seizure frequency and the volume of the zzso zzso to the seizure focus was found in the zzso seizure zzso 

These results suggest that a history of zzso zzso is associated with the finding of a smaller zzso on the side zzso to the subsequent zzso lobe focus whereas chronic factors seem to be be related to pathology zzso to the seizure zzso
