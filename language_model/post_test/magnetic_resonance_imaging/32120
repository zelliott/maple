Patients who have benign enlargement of the zzso spaces zzso have long been suspected of having an increased propensity for zzso zzso either spontaneously or as a result of accidental zzso zzso zzso in infants are often zzso with zzso trauma zzso A better understanding of the clinical and imaging characteristics of zzso zzso that occur either spontaneously or as a result of accidental trauma may help distinguish this group of patients from those who suffer zzso zzso as a result of zzso The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of zzso zzso that occur either spontaneously or as a result of accidental injury in infants with zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with zzso complicated by zzso zzso evaluated at a single institution from 1998 to zzso Data concerning the patient's clinical zzso physical findings, imaging, and management are zzso 

During the study period, 7 patients with zzso complicated by zzso zzso were zzso Their mean age at identification of the zzso zzso was zzso months of zzso In 5 cases, there was no recognized trauma before identification of the zzso zzso In 3 cases, baseline CT or MR imaging was available, showing prominent zzso spaces without any evidence of zzso zzso 

Although suspicious for zzso zzso zzso can occur in children either spontaneously or as a result of accidental zzso zzso must be exercised when investigating for zzso based on the sole presence of zzso zzso especially in children who are otherwise well and who have zzso
