To evaluate by magnetic resonance imaging zzso the difference in muscle signal zzso between zzso and control zzso 

Thirty-four healthy subjects and 46 zzso individuals were zzso zzso was carried out using a zzso magnet zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The presence of muscle changes was evaluated by measuring signal zzso at the zzso zzso and lateral heads of the zzso muscle by zzso and zzso short zzso inversion recovery zzso The mean signal zzso of the two sample groups were compared by zzso with age as a zzso In the zzso group, correlations between signal zzso and plasma levels of muscular and zzso zzso in addition to years of high-risk consumption and lifetime dose of ethanol zzso were zzso The mean signal zzso were also compared with the different degrees of pain by zzso 

Compared with healthy subjects, the zzso group had mean higher signal zzso in both zzso heads in all zzso The difference in the zzso in zzso sequences was significant zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A modest correlation between the years of high-risk consumption and the signal intensity was found in zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso whereas a correlation with the lifetime dose consumed was not zzso zzso correlations between signal zzso and plasma levels of muscular and zzso zzso were not zzso There were also no significant group differences on different degrees of zzso 

zzso was shown to be a sensitive, zzso and inexpensive procedure capable of detecting changes in signal zzso in the muscles of zzso This technique could be included among other diagnostic tools for alcoholic zzso with further improvements and if the signal zzso can be zzso by biopsy zzso
