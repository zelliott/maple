Multiple sclerosis zzso is characterized by a zzso zzso response to zzso viruses such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso measurable in zzso as the so-called zzso zzso zzso We aimed to evaluate the relevance of zzso to predict conversion of patients with clinically isolated syndrome zzso to zzso and to compare it to zzso bands zzso and zzso 

zzso was determined in a prospective study over 2 years including 40 patients that remained zzso over follow-up zzso and 49 patients that developed zzso zzso using zzso Using zzso regression, a score zzso balancing the zzso value of the zzso zzso included in zzso was defined (9 points zzso 8 points zzso 1 point zzso zzso zzso sum of scores greater zzso zzso and zzso were significantly more frequent in zzso as compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the best positive zzso value zzso of all parameters investigated zzso zzso zzso which could be further increased by combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data indicate the relevance of zzso to predict conversion to zzso It zzso shows the importance of weighting the different zzso zzso included in zzso and suggest that patients with positive zzso are candidates for an early begin of zzso zzso
