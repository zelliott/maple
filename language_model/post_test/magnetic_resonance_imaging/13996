To assess magnetic resonance imaging zzso heating for a zzso system zzso zzso Control System, zzso Minneapolis, zzso used for chronic deep brain stimulation zzso 

Different zzso were evaluated for bilateral zzso zzso Model zzso zzso and leads to assess worst-case and clinically relevant positioning zzso In zzso testing was performed using a zzso MR system and a zzso phantom designed to approximate the head and upper torso of a human zzso zzso was conducted using the zzso body and zzso head radio frequency zzso zzso Various levels of zzso energy were applied with the zzso body zzso averaged specific zzso rate zzso range, zzso zzso and zzso head zzso averaged zzso range, zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso system was used to record temperatures at multiple locations before (1 zzso and during (15 minutes) zzso 

Using the body zzso zzso the highest temperature changes ranged from zzso zzso degrees zzso Using the head zzso zzso the highest temperature changes ranged from zzso zzso degrees zzso these findings indicated that substantial heating occurs under certain conditions, while others produce relatively minor, zzso inconsequential temperature zzso 

The temperature increases were dependent on the type of zzso zzso level of zzso used, and how the lead wires were zzso zzso the use of clinically relevant positioning techniques for the zzso system and low zzso commonly used for imaging the brain generated little zzso Based on this information, MR safety guidelines are zzso These observations are restricted to the tested zzso zzso
