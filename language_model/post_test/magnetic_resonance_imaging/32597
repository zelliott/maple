Animal studies have demonstrated that motor recovery after zzso stroke is associated with functional and structural brain zzso While studies in stroke patients have revealed functional plasticity in zzso cortical areas in association with motor recovery, corresponding structural plasticity has not been zzso We sought to test the hypothesis that chronic zzso stroke patients exhibit structural plasticity in the same zzso cortical areas that exhibit functional zzso zzso zzso during unilateral tactile stimulation and structural zzso was conducted in chronic stroke patients and normal zzso Using recently developed zzso methods for high-resolution analysis of zzso data, we evaluated for zzso differences in functional zzso responses, and cortical thickness of areas that showed an enhanced zzso response in the zzso We found a significant zzso zzso zzso increase in the zzso response in areas of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients relative to zzso These same zzso zzso areas showed a significant zzso zzso zzso increase in cortical thickness in the zzso Control cortical areas did not show a significant zzso difference in thickness or zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence of structural plasticity zzso with areas exhibiting functional plasticity in the human brain after zzso
