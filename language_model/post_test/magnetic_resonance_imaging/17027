Many imaging studies report activity in the prefrontal and zzso zzso when subjects are aware as opposed to unaware of visual zzso One possibility is that this activity simply reflects higher signal strength or the superior task performance that is associated with zzso To find out, we studied the zzso zzso who has unilateral destruction of almost all primary visual zzso He exhibits zzso that is, he claims to have no conscious visual zzso zzso no visual zzso for stationary stimuli presented to his right visual field (the blind zzso although he can press keys to distinguish between different stimuli presented zzso We presented to him a visual discrimination task, and zzso performance for stimuli presented to the left or right visual field by presenting low contrast stimuli to his normal (left) field and high contrast stimuli to his blind (right) zzso Superior accuracy can be a serious zzso and our paradigm allows us to control for it and avoid this zzso Even when performance was zzso and the signal strength was lower, visual stimulation to the normal zzso field led to higher activity in the prefrontal and zzso zzso These results indicate that the activity in the prefrontal and zzso areas that has been reported in previous studies of awareness is not just due to a zzso strength or zzso zzso One possibility is that it reflects the superior zzso capacity that is associated with zzso because zzso was better able to distinguish between his own correct and incorrect responses for stimuli presented to his normal field than to his blind zzso
