This study reports on a woman who suffered left anterior cerebral artery zzso with a focal zzso undercutting the left supplementary motor zzso After almost complete recovery of language the patient was left with zzso halting zzso In a series of four experiments we examined the major factors influencing the patient's zzso There was a significant effect of zzso and zzso length on repetition and zzso learning zzso 1 and zzso The number of syllables was also found to influence, in a simple reaction task, onset zzso but not zzso times zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso had no particular effect on either repetition or vocal reaction zzso 1 and zzso While repetition of real words was zzso single word production in word generation tasks was zzso zzso generation and zzso both of which rely on zzso processing, were particularly involved, whereas semantic word generation tasks like verb generation and generation of category members were relatively spared zzso zzso Control tasks revealed that the observed zzso processing deficit was confined to the condition of generating spoken language zzso These experimental findings suggest that the patient's zzso speech could neither be attributed to a deficit of linguistic processing proper, nor to one of motor zzso Her speech disorder rather resulted from an impairment of initiating sequential zzso particularly in association with the process of downloading temporarily stored zzso strings from an zzso zzso This deficit could obviously be overcome in real word repetition through the use of a semantic zzso zzso
