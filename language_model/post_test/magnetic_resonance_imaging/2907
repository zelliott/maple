zzso zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an inherited zzso disease of the brain recently mapped to zzso zzso We studied 148 subjects belonging to seven families by magnetic resonance imaging and genetic linkage zzso 45 family members zzso males and 22 zzso were clinically zzso zzso signs were zzso zzso zzso events zzso progressive or zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso migraine with aura zzso and mood disorders with severe depressive episodes zzso All symptomatic subjects had prominent signal abnormalities on zzso with zzso zzso on zzso images in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were also present in 19 zzso zzso The age at onset of symptoms was mean 45 zzso zzso years, with attacks of migraine with aura occurring earlier in life zzso zzso zzso than zzso events zzso zzso zzso The mean age at death was zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso data, the zzso of the disease appears complete between 30 and 40 years of zzso zzso analysis showed strong linkage to the zzso locus for all seven families, suggesting genetic zzso zzso is a zzso cause of stroke, migraine with aura, mood disorders and zzso The diagnosis should be considered not only in patients with zzso small zzso zzso leading to zzso but also in patients with transient zzso attacks, migraine with aura or severe mood zzso whenever zzso reveals prominent signal abnormalities in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Clinical and zzso investigations of family members are then crucial for the diagnosis which can be confirmed by genetic linkage zzso The disease is probably largely zzso
