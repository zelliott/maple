Regional flow zzso can be accomplished either by measuring the concentration of a deposited zzso whose extraction during transit through the organ is zzso or by observing the time course of concentration of a zzso whose transport passage through the organ is zzso The deposition method is simpler and applies not only to zzso or other large particles that lodge in the zzso but also to molecular markers which are zzso It has the advantage of having substantial time in which to observe the local zzso by external zzso In contrast, zzso markers must traverse the tissue without barrier limitation or other zzso influence on the zzso When the marker is limited strictly to the zzso space, the transit time through the organ is short and observations must be made rapidly with a high resolution zzso An indicator which distributes throughout a large volume of distribution within the tissue has a slower zzso providing more time in which to make zzso zzso water is a suitable marker, except perhaps in the zzso For flow measurement by zzso markers which fulfill these criteria without causing side effects are zzso
