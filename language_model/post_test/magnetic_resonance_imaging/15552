Mental rotation is a complex cognitive skill depending on the manipulation of mental zzso We aimed to investigate the maturing zzso network for mental rotation by measuring brain zzso in 20 children and 20 adults using functional magnetic resonance zzso Our results indicate that brain zzso patterns are very similar between children and zzso However, adults exhibit stronger zzso in the left zzso zzso compared to zzso This finding suggests a shift of zzso from a predominantly right zzso zzso in children to a bilateral zzso pattern in zzso Furthermore, adults show a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is not observed in zzso In conclusion, zzso changes of brain zzso during mental rotation are leading to a bilateral zzso zzso pattern and faster zzso
