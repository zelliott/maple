Despite the extensive research into brain development after zzso birth, few studies have investigated its long-term effects on cortical zzso The Stockholm Neonatal Project included infants between 1988 and 1993 with birth weight zzso zzso 1500 zzso Using a previously published method, cortical thickness was estimated on zzso zzso anatomical images acquired from 74 zzso and 69 zzso adolescents zzso age zzso zzso The zzso was significantly thinner in zzso individuals in focal regions of the zzso and zzso zzso as indicated by zzso zzso In addition, large regions around the central zzso and zzso lobe as well as parts of the frontal and zzso zzso tended also to be thinner in the zzso zzso Although these results were not significant on zzso tests, the zzso coherent arrangement of the thinning in zzso individuals made it zzso When the group of zzso individuals was divided by zzso age or zzso the thinning tended to be more pronounced in the anterior and zzso poles in those born zzso term or with a zzso closer to 1500 zzso These results support the notion that zzso birth is a risk factor for long-term development of cortical zzso
