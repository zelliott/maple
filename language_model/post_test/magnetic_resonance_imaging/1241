To determine the influence of spontaneous and zzso zzso delivery on objective measures of pelvic organ zzso 

Prospective study at a university hospital with two study groups: zzso spontaneous delivery zzso zzso 26) and vacuum extraction zzso zzso zzso Control group consisted of healthy zzso volunteers zzso zzso zzso Participants underwent pelvic organ support evaluation by use of the pelvic organ zzso zzso zzso examination and zzso functional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso differences for individual zzso component zzso were noted for points zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso delivery versus zzso and in addition for zzso zzso and D zzso extraction versus zzso zzso differences for zzso zzso were observed for the position of zzso base, zzso neck, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso hiatus perimeter and depth of zzso 

zzso changes in pelvic organ support after zzso delivery can be demonstrated by a zzso and reliable clinical zzso system zzso and by functional zzso magnetic resonance zzso
