Early zzso and increase in collateral blood supply are powerful zzso of zzso outcome in acute zzso zzso The factors contributing to the zzso response to intravenous zzso therapy in individual patients, however, are not fully zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging during zzso study uses repetitive zzso spin zzso zzso zzso to characterize the zzso processes in acute stroke during zzso The first milestone was to develop an appropriate infrastructure for zzso in the magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner without time delay and ensuring optimal patient safety and zzso 

Between February and December 2011, 16 patients with acute neurological symptoms suggestive of zzso stroke within zzso h after symptom onset were zzso In addition to clinical data, we documented the time from onset to arrival at the hospital, start and duration of zzso examination, start of zzso therapy, and zzso The decision to zzso was made after a routine stroke zzso zzso During the zzso systemic zzso repetitive zzso zzso imaging was acquired, providing zzso information on cerebral zzso Continuous zzso monitoring, pulse zzso blood pressure zzso every 5 zzso and short neurological assessments every 15 zzso were performed in every zzso 

The median initial zzso score of the patients presenting with a mean of 84 zzso after onset was 4 zzso zzso zzso examination was initiated within a mean of 45 zzso after arrival at the zzso Five patients identified as stroke mimics were not treated with zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and in 1 case with zzso artery zzso bridging therapy was performed outside the zzso In the remaining 10 patients, zzso therapy was started in the scanner directly after decision making on the basis of clinical information and baseline zzso The mean zzso time was 60 zzso zzso zzso including approximately 10 zzso needed for acquiring informed zzso While 4 patients required zzso treatment, no relevant complications were zzso 

Fast and safe medical care in patients during systemic zzso in the zzso scanner is zzso Despite the process of obtaining informed zzso with a dedicated and experienced stroke team the zzso time can be kept in a range recommended by current zzso Continuous real-time information about the dynamics of cerebral zzso from zzso zzso in acute stroke patients undergoing zzso may provide additional information for the understanding of the events following acute zzso obstruction and its zzso
