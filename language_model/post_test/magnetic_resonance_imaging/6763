The conventional functional zzso zzso map offers information indirectly about localized changes in zzso activity because it reflects changes in blood zzso not actual zzso zzso To provide a zzso basis of zzso researchers have used zzso to show correlations of zzso and electric zzso However, quantitative interpretation of the degree to which zzso activity has changed still cannot be made from conventional zzso zzso The zzso signal has 2 zzso one describes the correlation between zzso metabolism zzso zzso rate of oxygen zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso which supports the zzso work to sustain zzso zzso the other is the requisite zzso of blood vessels zzso blood volume zzso which is the mechanical response involved in removal of waste while providing zzso Since changes in energy metabolism are related to zzso work, we tested whether zzso frequency of a zzso ensemble zzso is reflected by local energy metabolism zzso in rat zzso We used zzso recordings to measure zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to measure zzso during sensory zzso We found that zzso is approximately zzso which suggests efficient energy use during brain zzso Thus, zzso zzso provides data on where and by how much the zzso activity has zzso zzso of utilizing zzso zzso as a zzso method are zzso
