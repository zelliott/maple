Conventional zzso can reveal abnormalities in patients with zzso zzso With fast dynamic MR imaging systems, zzso has become possible, which does not expose patients to zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation of both methods after zzso 

zzso consecutive patients underwent abdominal zzso and zzso due to zzso zzso zzso all patients were investigated by zzso zzso Fourteen patients underwent zzso zzso The results were screened for zzso angle and pelvic floor position zzso zzso and zzso The findings were depicted in Box plot analysis and compared with the zzso zzso of pelvic zzso was also zzso 

In zzso zzso angle at rest was smaller than in conventional zzso but there was no difference during squeezing and zzso zzso pelvic floor position, during zzso zzso illustrated a lower zzso and a broader range of pelvic settings, but no difference at rest and during zzso In four patients, zzso zzso a descent of the zzso However, in four patients with complete zzso in zzso and with no clinical complaints about incomplete zzso MR imaging showed deficient zzso zzso zzso of patients was significantly improved through surgery, but there was no change in zzso pressure, zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

In general, with respect to zzso angle and zzso zzso both methods revealed consistent zzso The zzso depiction of structures in zzso is helpful in the assessment of descent of pelvic zzso and permits zzso of zzso However, in zzso of patients, zzso wrongly showed incomplete zzso
