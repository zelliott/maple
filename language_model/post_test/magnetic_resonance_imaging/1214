To reduce noise in zzso images of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso the authors implemented and evaluated a pulse sequence that enables automatic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for individual heart zzso in zzso flow on the basis of a rapid zzso This sequence was zzso evaluated by comparing zzso ratios with those from a standard MR flow scan obtained in the carotid artery in eight zzso This sequence was shown to improve zzso ratios by a factor of zzso in all but the zzso heart phase and was determined to be an effective technique for reducing noise in zzso zzso zzso
