zzso sensitive gels have been used as zzso for clinical dose zzso of different radiation therapy zzso However, the use of gels is not zzso because careful techniques are required to achieve the dose precision and accuracy aimed for in clinical dose zzso Here, the introduction of gel zzso in a clinical environment is zzso including the whole chain of zzso and preparations required to introduce magnetic resonance zzso based gel zzso into clinical zzso In order to zzso gel zzso in dose zzso for zzso and intensity modulated zzso zzso we focused on both the zzso of the gel composition and of the MR imaging parameters to increase its zzso The relative amount of the components of the zzso zzso acid based gel zzso was changed to obtain linear and steep dose response zzso MR imaging parameters were customized for the different dose ranges used in order to lower the relative standard zzso of the measured zzso relaxation rate zzso An zzso zzso was introduced to zzso the change in the relative standard zzso of zzso zzso taking the increase in MR time into zzso A zzso zzso acid gel customized for zzso was found to give a linear dose response up to 40 zzso with a slope of zzso zzso zzso while a zzso zzso acid gel customized for zzso had a linear range up to 3 zzso with a slope of zzso zzso zzso With the help of an introduced zzso zzso the mean zzso was improved by zzso for high doses and by zzso for low doses, without increasing MR time to unacceptable zzso A mean dose resolution of less than zzso zzso has been achieved with the gel and imaging parameters customized for zzso and a dose resolution from zzso zzso (at 5 zzso to zzso zzso (at 40 zzso for the zzso dose zzso The comparisons of calculated and measured relative zzso dose zzso performed for zzso and zzso showed an acceptable overall zzso The gamma criterion for the zzso zzso with a zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was passed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso distance, zzso in zzso For the zzso zzso using a zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso the gamma criterion was passed by zzso of the zzso (3 zzso distance, zzso dose zzso Using dedicated data analysis and zzso software, MR based zzso gel zzso was found to be a valuable tool for clinically based dose zzso provided that customized gel compositions and MR imaging parameters are zzso While high dose precision was zzso further work is required to achieve clinically acceptable dose zzso
