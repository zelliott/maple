zzso brooding is associated with increased vulnerability to major zzso zzso who regularly zzso will often try to reduce the frequency of their negative thoughts by actively suppressing zzso We aimed to identify the neural zzso underlying thought suppression in zzso and depressed zzso 

Three groups of women were zzso a major depressive disorder group, an zzso group zzso a first degree relative with zzso and zzso Participants performed a mixed zzso zzso paradigm involving thought suppression, free thought and motor control zzso Participants identified the zzso of zzso thoughts with a button zzso 

During thought suppression the control group showed the greatest zzso of the zzso prefrontal cortex, followed by the zzso then depressed zzso During the zzso of intrusive thoughts compared to successful zzso of those thoughts, the control group showed the greatest zzso of the anterior zzso zzso followed by the zzso then depressed zzso 

zzso participants displayed anomalies in the neural regulation of thought suppression resembling the zzso found in depressed zzso The zzso value of these changes in the onset of depression remains to be zzso
