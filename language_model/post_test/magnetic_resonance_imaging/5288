To investigate in older adults without zzso the relationships between socioeconomic status zzso in childhood and magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain volume measures typical of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease zzso 

Using a zzso and zzso observation approach, we invited volunteers without zzso all born in 1936, and who were participants in the 1947 Scottish Mental Survey, for MR brain zzso zzso of 320 zzso zzso We measured whole brain and zzso volumes and recorded childhood zzso history, the number of years of education zzso and adult zzso zzso Mental ability at age 11 years was recorded in 1947 and was also zzso 

Analysis shows a significant association between childhood zzso and zzso volume after adjusting for mental ability at age 11 years, adult zzso zzso and zzso 

A significant association between childhood zzso and zzso volumes in late life is consistent with the established zzso findings that early life conditions have an effect on structural brain zzso This remains zzso more than 50 years zzso
