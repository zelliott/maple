We present a simple and robust method for the automated image analysis of quantitative cerebral water content maps acquired with zzso The method is based on a new approach for the absolute and quantitative mapping of water content in zzso Water content maps were automatically segmented into zzso and white matter by employing the quantitative zzso information acquired as part of the water content mapping zzso Based on the segmented zzso zzso parameters sensitive to both absolute water content and its spatial zzso are automatically extracted without user zzso The parameters include, amongst others, absolute water content in zzso and white matter and spatial zzso of the cerebral water content zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes in the parameters determined were observed in a study of zzso healthy zzso Most notably, the zzso matter water content decreases at a rate of zzso for females between the 3rd and 8th decade of life, whilst a much stronger decrease is observed in males which sets in after the 5th decade of zzso In addition, female zzso matter water content is, on average, zzso higher than the respective male zzso matter water zzso In contrast to the zzso observed in zzso matter, no significant zzso variation was observed for white matter water zzso In addition to absolute zzso matter water content, characteristic zzso and zzso variations were also observed in most of the other zzso To check the potential loss of information associated with the large reduction of the zzso of the zzso to 22 parameters only, the age and gender of each individual subject were predicted by employing robust linear zzso analysis based on only the determined zzso zzso The median zzso between predicted and real age was zzso years resulting in a high correlation zzso between both values zzso zzso zzso Gender is correctly predicted in zzso of all cases which improves to zzso when zzso effects are first corrected, demonstrating the high information content present in the variables even though the dimension of the zzso was significantly zzso These results form the baseline for future studies of cerebral zzso The method presented is fully zzso robust and flexible, making it an ideal tool for routine application in both zzso studies and clinical diagnosis based on the quantitative measurement of cerebral water zzso
