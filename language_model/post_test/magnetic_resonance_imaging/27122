To generate zzso zzso zzso cardiac images, the zzso zzso trajectory combined with parallel imaging in the form of zzso zzso has shown zzso However, this method starts to fail at high zzso factors due to the assumptions that must be made for the purposes of zzso the zzso weight zzso In this zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso scheme is proposed which greatly improves image quality for the high acceleration factors required for real-time cardiac zzso This zzso zzso method offers better image quality than standard zzso zzso but it requires many additional zzso frames to be zzso By combining the zzso zzso method proposed here with the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso method, images with high acceleration factors can be reconstructed using few zzso zzso Both the zzso and the hybrid zzso methods are investigated to determine the most advantageous zzso parameters for an R zzso 6 in zzso zzso cardiac zzso Once the zzso parameters have been established, they are then used to reconstruct several in zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso with zzso resolutions better than 45 zzso including one with a zzso resolution of 35 zzso and an zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso
