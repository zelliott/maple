zzso of the human prion protein gene zzso contribute to the genetic zzso of zzso disease zzso Numerous zzso in the promoter regions as well as the open reading frame of zzso were zzso Greater than zzso of zzso Chinese, and Japanese carry the zzso 129 zzso zzso In Korea, zzso have not been zzso zzso except zzso 129 and 219 in zzso among Korean zzso zzso Although zzso at zzso 129 and 219 play an important role in zzso to sporadic zzso patients with other zzso in zzso exhibited critical distinctions of clinical zzso 

The genetic analyses of zzso were carried out among probable zzso patients in comparison with the results from magnetic resonance imaging zzso and electroencephalogram zzso 

The molecular analyses revealed that three zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Patients with the zzso and zzso zzso had a zzso zzso whereas the patient with the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso They all revealed strong zzso positive zzso The zzso patient with the zzso zzso showed progressive gait zzso and zzso was in zzso The zzso patient with the zzso zzso coupled to the zzso zzso had gait zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and progressed rapidly to death 3 months from the first onset of zzso The 65-year-old patient with the zzso zzso showed rapidly progressive memory decline and gait zzso and died within 16 months after onset of zzso 

Despite differences in ethnicity, the clinical and pathological outcomes were similar to the respective zzso around the world, except absence of zzso in zzso zzso
