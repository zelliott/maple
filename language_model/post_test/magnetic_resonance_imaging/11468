zzso magnetic resonance imaging relies on detecting small changes in the signal in the presence of noise from various zzso It has been shown that periodic variations in the signal at the respiratory frequency occur in the brain and various techniques have been proposed to remove zzso However, the precise mechanism by which zzso affects the zzso signal has not yet been zzso Here, we explore the nature of respiratory signal variations and the zzso they produce in brain zzso Our results demonstrate zzso that bulk zzso variations in the lungs during zzso cause variations in the zzso magnetic field within the brain zzso These variations in field strength and zzso lead to a shift of the image and a zzso of image intensity in the phase zzso zzso These zzso if left zzso may lead to the production of zzso zzso and/or decreased statistical significance of true zzso in zzso In addition, these results suggest that zzso effects may not necessarily be well characterized as simple additive noise and that an alternative model based on the physical origins of zzso variations may be more zzso
