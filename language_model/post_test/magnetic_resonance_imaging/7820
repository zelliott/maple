Complex forms of zzso zzso zzso are rare and genetically zzso In apparently sporadic cases, analysis of known zzso genes often fails to reveal a zzso 

We report a 24-year-old patient with a syndrome of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower motor zzso zzso 

zzso of the patient's zzso for copy number variation identified a novel 276 zzso deletion spanning the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso scan showed zzso of the zzso and zzso revealed a chronic disorder of motor zzso or their zzso A deletion in zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso was excluded in either parent, suggesting that the deletion in the index patient occurred de zzso 

We zzso that the deletion identified here is the cause of our patient's clinical zzso due to the resemblance to the zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso
