The zzso of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso is zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that zzso begins in infancy as benign external zzso due to decreased zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso Since this occurs before the zzso zzso a secondary hypothesis is that the zzso volumes of patients with zzso should be larger than those of healthy zzso 

zzso volumes of 51 patients with clinically suspected zzso were compared with those of zzso and zzso control zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso MR zzso They had zzso zzso stroke volumes of at least 60 zzso which was 50% higher than previously published normal zzso zzso volumes were measured and compared between zzso 

The average zzso volume for men with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso compared with zzso for male control subjects zzso zzso zzso The zzso volume averaged 118 zzso zzso larger than the control volume zzso zzso zzso The average zzso volume for women with zzso zzso zzso 29) was zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for female control subjects zzso zzso zzso The zzso volume was 88 zzso zzso larger than the control volume zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso have zzso volumes significantly larger than normal, suggesting that the initial insult occurs before the zzso fuse at 1 year of zzso The patients somehow remain zzso until their later years, when a second insult must occur, leading to symptomatic zzso
