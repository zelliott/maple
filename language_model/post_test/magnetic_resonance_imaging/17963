zzso correction for zzso zzso is zzso Most commercial systems zzso the zzso map from zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Bones, the most zzso zzso are neglected because they are difficult to zzso In this work, the authors build on this zzso approach by adding bones using a registration technique and assessing its performance on human PET zzso 

Twelve zzso patients were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso pulse zzso A database of 121 zzso correction quality CT scans was also zzso Each patient zzso was compared to the CT database via weighted zzso measures to find the zzso zzso CT in terms of body zzso The similar CT was aligned to the zzso with a zzso registration zzso Two zzso zzso maps were zzso One was a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso fat, and lean zzso using basic image processing zzso The other was zzso except the bones from the aligned CT were zzso The PET data were reconstructed with the patient's zzso zzso map (the silver zzso and both zzso zzso zzso The relative errors of the zzso zzso corrections were zzso in 14 standardized volumes of interest, in zzso and over whole zzso The squared zzso correlation zzso was also calculated over whole zzso zzso testing was done with zzso and paired zzso 

The zzso zzso correction ignoring bone had relative errors ranging from zzso to zzso in volumes of interest containing zzso By including bone, the magnitude of the relative error was reduced in all cases zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Further, the relative error in volumes of interest adjacent to bone was improved from a mean of zzso to zzso zzso In the other seven volumes of interest, including bone reduced the magnitude of relative error in three cases zzso had no effect in three cases, and increased relative error in one zzso There was no statistically significant difference in the relative error in zzso Over whole zzso including bone slightly increased relative error in lung from zzso to zzso zzso in fat from zzso to zzso zzso and in lean tissue from zzso to zzso zzso but reduced the magnitude of relative error in bone from zzso to zzso zzso The correlation zzso was essentially unchanged in all zzso regardless of whether bone was included or zzso 

The approach to include bones in zzso zzso maps described in this work improves zzso of zzso PET images in and around zzso zzso The reduction in error is often large zzso of zzso and could alter image interpretation and subsequent patient zzso Changes in other parts of the PET image are minimal and likely not of clinical zzso
