In the episodic retrieval zzso domain, zzso in right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso are often attributed to zzso zzso Yet, right zzso zzso are also frequently found during zzso zzso To investigate the role of this region across different cognitive functions, we directly compared brain activity during zzso and visual perception zzso using zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso In the zzso task, participants decided whether words were old or new, whereas in the VP task, they decided which of the two colored screen areas was zzso In both tasks, each decision was followed by a confidence zzso The main finding was that right zzso zzso area zzso activity was greater for low- than for zzso decisions in both tasks, demonstrating a general role in decision zzso Even when reaction times zzso were included in the model, confidence remained the significant predictor of activity, suggesting that right zzso is involved in zzso evaluation rather than in continuous zzso In contrast, activity in anterior zzso zzso was not only greater for zzso decisions but also increased with zzso reflecting a role in continuous conflict zzso Overall, the results demonstrate how direct zzso comparisons clarify the zzso and specificity of the functions of various brain zzso
