Whether the degree of diffuse zzso damage is correlated with the signal change on MR images after injection of zzso iron oxide zzso particles was zzso In addition, we investigated whether zzso function zzso after injection of zzso 

zzso female zzso rats aged 3 to 4 weeks were given drinking water containing zzso zzso zzso for 4 or 12 weeks to induce two grades of liver zzso zzso normal rats were served as a zzso zzso and model rats were administered zzso (10 zzso zzso and signal zzso in the liver on MR images obtained at zzso T were measured up to 60 minutes after injection zzso zzso zzso The model rats were injected with 10 times the zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso or saline as a control substance, and blood parameters were measured at 4, 24, and 48 hours after injection zzso zzso 5 or zzso At 4 hours after injection, iron and zzso cells in the liver were stained zzso zzso zzso 

zzso signal reduction in the liver occurred 15 minutes after injection in all zzso The reduced signal persisted for 60 minutes after zzso However, the degree of zzso signal reduction in the model rats was significantly less than that in the normal rats zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal reduction in the zzso group was less than that in the zzso zzso In control rats, the number of zzso cells increased by 22 cells per area zzso zzso following treatment with zzso In the zzso and zzso groups, numbers of zzso cells increased by 13 and 11 cells, zzso There was no statistically significant difference in the number of zzso cells between control and model zzso No significant change was observed in blood parameters with zzso 

The MR signal induced by zzso depended on the degree of zzso activity in the zzso The safety profiles of zzso remained unchanged even at 10 times the imaging zzso
