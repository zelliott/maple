Stress plays an important role in drug zzso It can trigger zzso in zzso zzso and both in the everyday world and in the laboratory, a zzso can induce drug zzso Drug cues, such as the sight of drug, can also trigger zzso craving and zzso and this effect may be amplified by zzso zzso this interaction may be the fact that stress and zzso drug cues act on overlapping brain zzso We exposed 15 smokers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging to a zzso zzso the Montreal Imaging Stress zzso followed by drug cues consisting of video clips of zzso In a separate session similar video clips were shown after a zzso control zzso We observed significantly decreased neural activity during stress in the zzso amygdala, bed nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso and nucleus zzso Following stress there was an increased neural response to drug cues in the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso cortex, zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and primary and association visual zzso These regions are thought to be involved in visual attention and in assigning incentive value to zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted subsequent neural zzso We suggest that stress increases the incentive zzso of drug zzso
