zzso mechanisms underlying persistent zzso deficits after continuous spinal zzso using zzso zzso zzso are still not well zzso It has been suggested that high-dose zzso zzso zzso irreversible zzso block and even zzso in white matter tracts by breakdown of the zzso zzso In this study, we use zzso magnetic resonance zzso to characterize the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat spinal zzso The zzso measured with zzso is an zzso diffusion zzso zzso which can be used to exclude the presence of zzso 

Female Fischer zzso rats were zzso Group 1 zzso zzso 5) was exposed to zzso group 2 zzso zzso 7) was exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso and group 3 zzso zzso 5) was exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images in group 1 were acquired before and after zzso induced by cardiac arrest and in groups 2 and 3 rats prior to and during zzso of the spinal zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso decreased the zzso by zzso in gray matter and by zzso in white matter of spinal zzso Continuous zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso did not affect the spinal zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso in gray or white matter of spinal zzso 

zzso reduced the zzso in both spinal zzso white and gray zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the spinal zzso zzso during the first zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso does not induce irreversible zzso deficits by causing spinal zzso zzso
