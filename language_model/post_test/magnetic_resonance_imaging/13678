Earlier work has shown markedly lower density of zzso 2A zzso receptors in elderly subjects than in young healthy zzso In this study the authors used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso with high affinity for the zzso zzso to examine the relationship between zzso zzso density and age in more zzso 

The 22 subjects ranged in age from 21 to 69 years zzso zzso and were healthy comparison subjects in a study of zzso zzso of interest were determined on magnetic resonance images and were transferred to zzso PET zzso The data were derived from dynamic PET scanning and zzso sampling with resulting plasma activity data corrected for labeled zzso zzso modeling was used to estimate the zzso distribution zzso By comparing the distribution volume zzso of different regions to the zzso distribution volume, zzso which is zzso to the binding potential, was zzso 

The decrease in zzso binding was not linear but on average was approximately zzso per decade from age zzso The correlations between age and zzso zzso were significant for the global measure and for the zzso zzso zzso anterior cingulate, zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso and zzso zzso Most of the fall off in zzso binding occurred up through zzso and there was less decrease in late zzso There were no decreases in regional brain volumes of corresponding zzso 

zzso zzso binding decreases dramatically in a variety of brain regions up through zzso
