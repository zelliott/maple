zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso in zzso offers unique opportunities for the zzso study of zzso structure and function in parallel with cognitive zzso However, zzso is a potent toxin and there is evidence that it can interfere with zzso zzso Thus, apart from causing adverse peripheral side effects, zzso may disrupt the function of brain areas where it accumulates to produce signal enhancement and, zzso zzso administration may confound cognitive zzso Here, we examined in male adult Lister hooded rats if a moderate systemic dose of zzso zzso zzso two zzso injections of 100 zzso separated by 1 zzso that produces zzso MR signal enhancement would disrupt zzso zzso To this end, we used a zzso zzso zzso task, which requires rapid zzso place learning and is highly sensitive to interference with zzso zzso Tested on the zzso task 1 h and 24 h after zzso injection, rats did not show any impairment in zzso of memory performance zzso search zzso or any zzso zzso However, zzso injection caused acute peripheral effects zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which subsided over 30 zzso Additionally, rats injected with zzso showed reduced weight 1 day after injection and failed to reach the normal zzso curve of control rats within the 16 days zzso Our results indicate that 200 zzso zzso produces zzso MR signal enhancement without zzso zzso behavior on a rapid place learning task, even though attention must be paid to peripheral side zzso
