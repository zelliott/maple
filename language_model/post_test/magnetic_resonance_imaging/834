zzso of speech is improved when presentation of the audio signal is accompanied by zzso visual speech gesture zzso This enhancement is most prevalent when the audio signal is zzso One potential means by which the brain zzso zzso enhancement is thought to be through the integration of zzso information from multiple sensory channels in a common site of zzso zzso integration zzso zzso Some studies have identified potential sites in the superior zzso zzso zzso that are responsive to zzso information from the auditory speech signal and visual speech zzso One limitation of these studies is that they do not control for activity resulting from zzso zzso cued by such things as visual information signaling the zzso and zzso of the acoustic speech zzso as well as activity resulting from zzso of properties of the auditory speech signal with aspects of gross visual motion that are not specific to place of articulation zzso This zzso experiment uses spatial zzso zzso filtered Japanese sentences presented with background zzso audio noise to discern brain activity reflecting zzso induced by auditory and visual correspondence of place of articulation information that controls for activity resulting from the zzso zzso The experiment consists of a zzso zzso filtered condition containing gross visual motion of the lips, zzso and head without specific place of articulation information, a zzso zzso filtered condition containing place of articulation information, and an unfiltered zzso zzso Sites of zzso selectively induced by auditory and visual correspondence of place of articulation information were determined by the presence of activity for both the zzso and zzso conditions relative to the zzso zzso Based on these criteria, sites of zzso were found predominantly in the left middle zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso (including the auditory zzso By controlling for additional factors that could also induce greater activity resulting from visual motion information, this study identifies potential zzso sites that we believe are involved with improved speech perception zzso
