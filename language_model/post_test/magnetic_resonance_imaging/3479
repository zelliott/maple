zzso targeting the zzso tumor 1 zzso gene product is a promising treatment zzso for patients with zzso zzso and there have been reports of encouraging zzso It has become clear, however, that zzso MR imaging does not reflect zzso thereby zzso a more robust imaging evaluation system for monitoring response to zzso zzso To meet this demand, the authors performed a zzso zzso response map zzso analysis of zzso PET zzso in zzso zzso and compared the data with the overall survival after initiation of zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen patients with zzso zzso zzso were included in the study, and zzso was compared with: 1) volume and length change in the contrast area of the tumor on zzso MR zzso 2) change in maximum zzso of zzso and 3) a more detailed zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso analysis was able to identify the following 3 areas within the tumor zzso 1) area with no change in zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2) area with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3) area with decreased zzso zzso zzso While the results of zzso MR imaging zzso and conventional zzso analysis did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso MR imaging zzso p zzso zzso for zzso MR imaging volume, and p zzso zzso for zzso the percentage of zzso area showed excellent correlation zzso zzso zzso with zzso 

This study describes the limited value of zzso MR imaging and highlights the potential of zzso zzso analysis of zzso for monitoring treatment response in zzso for zzso zzso Clinical trial registration zzso zzso
