Based on previous studies and due to the characteristics of zzso as an auditory zzso decoding disorder, we predicted that the shape of the zzso corpus zzso zzso would differ between dyslexic and control zzso 

Twenty right-handed boys with zzso zzso were selected from a carefully screened general population sample zzso age 11 zzso and compared to a matched control zzso The zzso zzso was manually traced on the aligned zzso MR slice and total zzso area and its zzso were compared between the zzso A statistical shape analysis and subsequent zzso zzso was performed using a recently developed shape model zzso 

The shape analysis revealed shorter zzso shape in the dyslexic group, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This region contains zzso fibers from primary and secondary auditory zzso A shape length difference larger than a fixed threshold in the zzso zzso region could correctly discriminate between control and dyslexic subject in zzso of the cases, where a dyslexic zzso was shorter in this region than a control zzso However, there were no significant group differences with respect to overall zzso area or zzso 

A clear shape difference in the zzso zzso of the zzso was found between dyslexic and control zzso This fits with recent other studies that have reported a strong growth factor in this zzso region during the late childhood years, coinciding with literacy zzso Our results show that the dyslexic group has not undergone the same growth pattern as the normal reading zzso
