To zzso evaluate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging features that differentiate traumatic zzso from zzso zzso after neck zzso 

Imaging findings of 10 patients with a traumatic zzso and 17 with zzso zzso were zzso US and CT were performed in all zzso MR imaging was performed in 16 zzso zzso analyzed at US included the diameter of the long and short zzso the zzso ratio, and the presence of a central zzso zzso zzso analyzed at CT were zzso with common or internal carotid artery, zzso location in correlation with carotid artery, and the presence of a zzso zzso zzso analyzed at MR imaging included signal intensity on zzso and zzso images, the presence of ring enhancement, and the presence of a zzso rim on zzso zzso 

zzso significant differences were found between traumatic zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso ratio zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso the zzso diameter zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso the presence of a central zzso area (five of 10 patients zzso vs one of 17 patients zzso P zzso zzso the frequency of contact with carotid artery zzso of 10 patients zzso vs 13 of 17 patients zzso P zzso zzso and the presence of a zzso rim on zzso MR images (three of six patients zzso vs zero of 10 patients zzso P zzso zzso zzso in other parameters were not statistically zzso 

Several imaging findings can differentiate traumatic zzso from zzso zzso after neck zzso
