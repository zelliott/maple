zzso and zzso of flow of the left anterior descending zzso coronary artery in healthy volunteers are demonstrated using zzso imaging zzso A zzso zzso model was used to derive coronary flow zzso from zzso curves, free of cardiac wall motion zzso zzso cardiac studies were performed using a zzso zzso echo zzso technique to limit the effect of cardiac wall motion on coronary vessel zzso A series of 10 to 20 single or zzso images were acquired within a single zzso zzso zzso series showed the zzso coronary artery with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and revealed zzso zzso in vessel position of a magnitude equal to or greater than its zzso zzso zzso was measured in the zzso portion of the artery at rest and during zzso The data demonstrated the known zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso and peak zzso zzso 14 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 11, V zzso mean zzso flow zzso During zzso exercise, a zzso flow zzso increase zzso zzso zzso was detected in eight of nine zzso The capacity of the zzso zzso method to detect flow zzso changes should prove clinically useful for future assessment of coronary flow zzso
