Water management is critical to zzso the operation of zzso zzso membrane fuel zzso At present, zzso models are employed to guide water management in such fuel zzso zzso zzso of water content variation in zzso zzso membrane fuel cells are required to validate these models and to zzso fuel cell zzso We report a direct water content measurement across the zzso membrane in an operational zzso zzso membrane fuel cell, employing double half zzso spin echo single point imaging zzso The zzso zzso with zzso mapping were undertaken with a parallel plate zzso to avoid the effects of zzso zzso The parallel plate zzso employs the zzso inherent to the fuel cell to create a resonant circuit at zzso zzso for MR zzso and zzso while still operating as a conventional fuel cell at zzso Three stages of fuel cell operation were zzso zzso operation and zzso Each profile was acquired in 6 zzso with 6 zzso nominal resolution and a zzso of better than zzso
