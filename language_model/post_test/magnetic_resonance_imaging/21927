Our purpose was to evaluate the utility of zzso and biological markers prior to treatment in predicting the immediate response to chemotherapy in cervical and zzso zzso Twelve patients with locally advanced cervical zzso and 16 patients with zzso zzso received zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso consisting of zzso and zzso before surgical zzso The decrease in tumor volume on magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso volume before zzso - tumor volume after zzso volume before zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response to zzso were zzso Five factors prior to zzso zzso grade, zzso tumor volume, zzso index, zzso protein zzso and DNA zzso were analyzed for correlation with the decrease in tumor volume and zzso response in cervical and zzso zzso zzso In cervical zzso patients with higher zzso index tumor zzso or zzso zzso showed a significantly greater decrease in tumor volume than those with lower zzso index zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso those with a smaller tumors zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly greater decrease than those with a larger tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso with higher zzso index zzso or zzso zzso and negative zzso protein expression appeared to respond better than other tumors, but the difference was not statistically zzso Nuclear grade and DNA zzso were not correlated with decrease in tumor volume either in cervical zzso or in zzso zzso Four cases of effective zzso response (2 complete responses zzso microscopic residual zzso and 2 marked responses zzso zzso residual zzso were noted only in patients with zzso zzso who had a smaller zzso higher zzso index, and negative zzso protein zzso zzso tumor volume and zzso index were the only significant zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso index in cervical and zzso zzso and the zzso tumor volume in zzso zzso appeared to be potentially useful in predicting the immediate response to the zzso
