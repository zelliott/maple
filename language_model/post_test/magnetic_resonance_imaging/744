Recent zzso studies are of interest in exploring long-range interactions between different brain structures and the functional zzso of specific brain regions by known zzso zzso One of the experimental approaches requires the invasive zzso of an zzso zzso to zzso specific brain zzso In the present report, we describe a procedure for the production of a zzso carbon fiber zzso and the use of this zzso for direct zzso of the brain in zzso zzso The zzso carbon fiber zzso was implanted in the zzso zzso of zzso rats and zzso zzso echo images in the zzso plane obtained on a zzso T system zzso zzso zzso during electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso The image quality obtained using this zzso was acceptable without reduction of the zzso ratio and image zzso zzso analysis showed that the signal zzso of activated areas in the zzso anterior zzso zzso were significantly increased by about zzso during zzso zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso carbon fiber zzso are suitable for zzso studies and can be used to investigate functional zzso zzso
