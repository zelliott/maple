To demonstrate the influence of auditory zzso zzso on auditory zzso responses zzso and zzso zzso magnetic fields zzso in zzso 

A total of 15 normal subjects, 9 patients with left auditory zzso zzso and 1 patient with a right auditory zzso zzso were zzso zzso were recorded from each zzso of the brain in a zzso zzso room using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded from the scalp at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso bursts were used as auditory zzso 

Pam responses of the zzso which are typically evoked in the zzso range of the Pa of the zzso and are localized at the auditory zzso as zzso were impaired or abolished over the left auditory zzso zzso in the patients with zzso zzso but the Pa of the zzso zzso 

The main generator of the Pam in zzso was demonstrated to be the auditory zzso The results also show that the Pa of the zzso is evoked only partly from the auditory zzso
