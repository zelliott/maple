zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso is one of the first magnetic resonance imaging zzso signs in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso and used as a measure of disease zzso Visual assessment of zzso is easy to perform but the reliability of zzso rating over time has not been zzso 

To investigate what happens to the zzso rating scores if two zzso rate the same zzso scans six times over a period of 1 zzso 

One hundred zzso were included in this zzso All patients underwent zzso with a protocol and sequences used for geriatric patients, according to local clinical zzso One zzso and one general zzso independently of each other performed retrospective visual assessments of zzso six times, using the same scans, over a period of 1 zzso 

zzso zzso varied between zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for the general zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso values showed almost perfect agreement for both investigators zzso zzso zzso reliability showed fair to moderate agreement, with the zzso value varying from zzso zzso to zzso and weighted zzso values ranging from zzso zzso to zzso There was a statistically significant difference in rating between the two zzso 

Visual assessment of zzso repeated over time has a high grade of zzso when performed by an experienced zzso The zzso drops when assessment is rarely zzso zzso reliability is low when two investigators not working together are zzso
