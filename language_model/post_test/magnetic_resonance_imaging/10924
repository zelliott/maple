The mechanisms underlying zzso barrier zzso compromise in human zzso virus zzso infection and the ways in which zzso compromise might impair zzso function remain poorly zzso This study had two zzso zzso to examine the relationship between zzso breakdown, measured using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso plasma viral load, and neurological zzso and zzso to examine the influence of highly active zzso therapy zzso on the relationship between zzso using zzso zzso a surrogate marker of zzso zzso as measured by magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso compromise determined by zzso In 25 zzso patients, we found that: zzso the severity of zzso impairment correlated with the degree of zzso breakdown in the zzso zzso zzso for any given degree of zzso compromise, patients with high plasma viral load were more severely zzso zzso zzso compromise correlated with zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso for any given level of zzso the severity of zzso compromise and the severity of zzso impairment were significantly less in patients on zzso than in those who were zzso These results confirm a role for zzso compromise in the zzso of zzso zzso impairment and suggest that elevated plasma viral load in the presence of zzso compromise may increase the risk for development of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, they suggest a zzso effect of zzso on the zzso and severity of zzso which may, in part, be due to protection of zzso zzso
