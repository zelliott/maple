The introduction of zzso mapping zzso has improved the understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso systems are used to delineate zzso regions responsible for the zzso by creating zzso or zzso time zzso Previous studies have identified the benefits of creating zzso zzso zzso however, in some cases zzso maps may not identify regions of slow propagation that can cause the zzso zzso In this study, we obtained local zzso time maps and analyzed propagation properties by performing zzso mapping of the zzso left zzso while pacing from the right zzso zzso and zzso late zzso enhancement images were used for zzso navigation and identification of zzso zzso Our zzso mapping procedure showed qualitative correspondence to conventional clinical zzso systems in healthy pigs and demonstrated altered propagation in zzso zzso zzso
