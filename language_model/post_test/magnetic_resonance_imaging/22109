zzso zzso zzso binding has been suggested in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of Alzheimer's zzso However, it remains unclear whether these changes are present in mildly zzso patients, and the role of cortical zzso in zzso binding assessment has not been zzso We studied zzso zzso binding zzso to zzso with zzso using zzso in five mildly affected patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and in five zzso control zzso Region of interest zzso analysis was performed in a consensus procedure blind to clinical diagnosis using matched magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by calculating percentages of zzso fluid in each zzso An observer study with three observers was conducted to validate this zzso zzso patients showed statistically significantly less zzso binding in left zzso and right zzso zzso compared with controls, independent of age, sex and cortical zzso Mean zzso zzso was zzso and zzso results showed consistent differences in zzso binding between zzso However, differences between patients and controls were comparable among observers and statistically significant in the same regions as in the consensus zzso Using an zzso matching technique, we conclude that zzso binding is reduced in patients with mild probable Alzheimer's disease in areas of zzso and zzso zzso
