Despite numerous clinical and experimental studies on zzso toxin type A zzso long-term zzso of muscle texture and fine structure following zzso treatment have thus far not been studied in normal human skeletal zzso After obtaining institutional review board approval, we performed a zzso zzso zzso follow-up study on two healthy adults using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and muscle biopsy to zzso long-term zzso after a single zzso injection into the lateral head of the zzso zzso zzso disclosed a zzso pattern in short zzso inversion recovery zzso and a reduction of the zzso area in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso control muscle (at 6 to 9 months in volunteer zzso zzso in B: zzso at 12 months in zzso zzso and in B: zzso zzso zzso 12 months after injection, confirmed zzso zzso of muscle fibers only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed additional degenerative changes at the zzso zzso The data confirm that zzso is a suitable tool to monitor the long-term effect of zzso on skeletal zzso zzso muscle zzso following a single zzso injection should be taken into consideration when repeated zzso injections into the same muscles are zzso
