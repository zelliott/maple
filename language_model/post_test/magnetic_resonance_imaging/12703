To investigate the zzso value of zzso zzso in zzso lobe zzso zzso 

We reviewed zzso of 97 patients who had undergone zzso evaluation programs with zzso zzso complex partial zzso zzso and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso All patients had surgery due to zzso and became zzso In 57 patients, determination of speech dominance was necessary by using Wada tests or functional zzso zzso To zzso the zzso seizures, we reviewed one to three zzso recorded zzso of each zzso zzso 223 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was considered to be present in a particular patient if it occurred in at least one of the recorded zzso 

zzso zzso occurred in 22 zzso They occurred in 37% of zzso and in zzso of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with determined speech zzso zzso zzso occurred in 37% of the dominant and in zzso in patients with zzso zzso zone zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso began at age zzso zzso 6, whereas in the remaining patients, zzso started at age zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso dominance and age at onset were independently associated with pure zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a frequent phenomenon, occurring in zzso of patients with zzso It is more often associated with zzso and early onset zzso Our results may improve the zzso of the zzso zone and suggest that zzso zzso in humans are related to the dominant zzso zzso Our study is a further argument that there are different zzso of zzso depending on the age at zzso
