To evaluate the efficacy of MR zzso zzso in patients with known or suspected Crohn's disease without the use of zzso zzso agents compared to zzso and zzso 

A retrospective review of zzso consecutive patients who underwent routine zzso to evaluate known or suspected Crohn's disease was zzso Of these, 310 patients also underwent zzso with zzso within 90 zzso The results of the zzso were compared to the zzso and pathology reports to determine the presence or absence of disease in zzso zzso zzso Individual imaging parameters (including wall zzso enhancement, zzso zzso zzso vascular prominence and zzso were also separately analyzed to determine their independent zzso zzso 

In 310 patients, the overall sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso zzso as a gold zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso The sensitivity of zzso for detection of zzso severe disease was zzso in the terminal zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso In the subset of 162 patients who underwent zzso within 30 days of zzso the overall sensitivity remained zzso but the specificity increased to zzso zzso Wall zzso and abnormal enhancement were sensitive indicators of Crohn's disease zzso and zzso while abnormal zzso zzso zzso vascular prominence and zzso were specific zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso compares favorably to zzso for evaluation of known or suspected Crohn's disease zzso and without the exposure to zzso radiation associated with CT zzso zzso
