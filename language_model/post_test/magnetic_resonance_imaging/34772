To present the feasibility and advantages of the zzso zzso management of zzso third zzso zzso As a result of recent developments in zzso classical third zzso has become a standard single zzso hole procedure and a real alternative to zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso In patients with third zzso tumors zzso the aqueduct, the acute development of zzso may often zzso debilitating focal symptoms and zzso Forty percent of those tumors are zzso rendering zzso zzso The goal of primary management is the zzso of raised zzso pressure and determination of the zzso nature of the zzso zzso fluid zzso and the performance of a zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso biopsy are generally suggested as the methods of zzso 

Three patients with zzso third zzso tumors and acute zzso were treated in one session by zzso zzso zzso third zzso and zzso tumor biopsy was performed by means of two rigid zzso 

zzso was performed in three patients, and tumor biopsy was performed in two zzso The maximum 40-minute operation did not involve mortality or zzso zzso findings were established in all zzso In two patients with zzso zzso tumors, zzso zzso was zzso in one patient with a small zzso no further measures were zzso At the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging confirmed zzso zzso in all zzso 

The zzso zzso approach allowed independent visual control of both procedures, safe passages of the zzso via the narrow zzso of zzso and facile control of the zzso pressure in the zzso via the available four irrigation channels during the performance of tumor biopsy and zzso of the floor of the third zzso In selected patients with zzso zzso third zzso tumors, this procedure and zzso zzso may be an alternative to direct surgery or to zzso and performance of zzso zzso
