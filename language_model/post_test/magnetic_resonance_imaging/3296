Previous work has shown that fetal zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provided additional information complementary to zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine if zzso zzso provides better zzso of fetal eye structures compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were zzso examined in 82 consecutive fetal studies with normal central nervous system without sensitivity zzso Relative signal intensity values on zzso and zzso zzso were obtained for zzso and zzso zzso of the signal intensity of zzso to the signal intensity of zzso were calculated to determine zzso Similar zzso were obtained in a smaller separate data set zzso zzso zzso using zzso imaging with sensitivity zzso zzso The zzso images significantly demonstrated greater zzso zzso of zzso to zzso than zzso zzso This was consistent for both sensitivity zzso and zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso was on average approximately two times greater in the zzso images compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the fetal eye provides on average two times greater zzso of fetal eye structures than zzso zzso This enhancement is not affected by zzso age or the use of sensitivity zzso parallel imaging zzso
