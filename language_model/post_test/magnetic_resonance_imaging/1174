The purpose of this experiment was to directly examine the neural mechanisms of zzso control involved in the Simon task as compared to a spatial zzso task using zzso zzso The Simon effect typically refers to the interference people experience when there is a zzso zzso The zzso effect refers to the interference people experience when two attributes of the same stimulus conflict with each zzso Although previous imaging studies have compared the brain zzso for each of these tasks performed zzso none had done so in an integrated task that incorporates both types of zzso as was done in the current zzso Both tasks activated brain regions that serve as a source of zzso control zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso regions that are sites of zzso control (the visual processing zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso In addition, there were also specific brain regions activated to a significantly greater degree by one task and/or only by a single zzso The brain regions significantly more activated by the Simon task were those sensitive to detection of response conflict, response selection, and planning zzso zzso cortex, supplementary motor areas, and zzso and zzso association zzso In contrast, the regions significantly more activated by the zzso task were those involved in zzso the processing toward the zzso attribute zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the interference effects of these two tasks are caused by different types of conflict zzso conflict for the Simon effect and zzso conflict for the zzso zzso but both invoke similar sources of zzso zzso
