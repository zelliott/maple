To develop an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso we must understand the long-term effects and problems of conventional zzso 

We performed a retrospective follow-up of four infants with PA in the zzso 

The initial treatment consisted of partial tumor removal and/or external zzso The mean zzso duration after the initial treatment was zzso zzso All patients received a second course of radiation to treat zzso zzso These conventional treatments produced relatively long zzso Three patients died 105, 202, and zzso months after the initial zzso One patient is still alive at zzso months after the initial zzso However, mental zzso was obvious in all four patients 6 to 12 years after the first zzso and within 2 years of the second course of zzso zzso new therapeutic strategies must focus on delaying the timing of radiation until the patients are at least 5 years old and avoiding a second course of radiation to treat zzso
