zzso the zzso functional and aesthetic anatomy has been of critical importance to surgeons planning zzso zzso Beyond skilled clinical examination, few objective studies exist to aid the zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso represents a potentially excellent method for precise zzso imaging of the zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso involves no zzso Similar to CT, however, zzso can provide computer-enhanced three-dimensional and quantitative airway zzso zzso zzso has proven sensitivity in evaluation of tumors of the brain and zzso and is the imaging zzso of choice for many zzso zzso Due to the relatively high cost of conventional zzso zzso scanning zzso to zzso per zzso zzso of the nose utilizing full head scanning technique has been zzso The recent development of small field of view surface coils has enabled zzso zzso scans at a fraction of the scanner time and cost zzso to zzso of conventional zzso zzso We have developed a protocol utilizing a small field of view zzso which results in zzso high-resolution zzso scans requiring less than 6 minutes of scanner zzso This protocol has been used in both the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with traumatic and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Image resolution obtained using the protocol is significantly better than with conventional zzso This technique is excellent for both diagnosing and documenting zzso anatomy and zzso
