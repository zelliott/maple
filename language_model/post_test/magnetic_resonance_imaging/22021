Reversal or reduction of normal structural cerebral zzso may be related to the zzso of zzso but this relationship remains zzso We review the literature and describe a further study designed to detect whether anomalous zzso are present early in the illness (at the first zzso whether they predict deficits in language processing, and whether they may be related to a genetic predisposition for zzso zzso of brain zzso and segments of the zzso zzso were assessed in a magnetic resonance imaging study of 87 patients with a first episode of schizophrenia and 52 normal zzso These zzso were correlated with specific measures of language processing, memory, and hand zzso An independent group of 14 pairs of siblings with schizophrenia were also evaluated for evidence of zzso to cerebral zzso zzso zzso were reduced in patients compared with controls in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brain horizontal zzso on the other hand, was significantly more zzso in patients zzso zzso right; p zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls zzso zzso right) were greatest for the horizontal zzso this asymmetry tended to detect differences in patients by comparison with controls zzso zzso zzso In a range of tests of language and memory, few significant correlations between performance and cerebral zzso were detected either in patients or controls, although patients consistently scored poorer than controls in the majority of zzso In 14 pairs of psychotic siblings, zzso correlations for the horizontal zzso zzso asymmetry were significantly greater than zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the early presence zzso zzso of anomalous cerebral zzso However, the functional zzso of reduced asymmetry remain zzso
