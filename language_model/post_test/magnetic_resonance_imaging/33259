The purpose of this study was to report on the zzso survival of zzso zzso zzso patients treated with DC zzso loaded with zzso zzso in a scheduled scheme in up to three treatments and thereafter on zzso 

173 zzso patients not suitable for zzso treatments were zzso enrolled zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stage was zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was one dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso one dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso survival at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was zzso zzso 62, zzso and zzso zzso with higher rates achieved in Child class A compared with Child class B patients zzso zzso zzso 45, and zzso % zzso zzso 75, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mean overall survival was zzso months zzso zzso zzso survival was better for Child class A compared with Child class B patients zzso zzso zzso For patients with dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival rates were 100, zzso zzso zzso and zzso % for Child class A and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % for Child class B zzso Regarding zzso treatment, zzso analysis identified number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso initially achieved complete response zzso zzso zzso and objective response zzso zzso zzso as significant and independent zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso results, with high rates of zzso survival for patients, not amenable to zzso zzso Number of zzso zzso zzso and local response were significant independent zzso of zzso zzso
