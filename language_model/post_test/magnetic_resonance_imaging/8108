To use zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso to measure zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso in adult patients with zzso zzso associated with zzso of cortical development zzso 

We used MRS to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso containing compounds zzso as well as zzso and zzso Fifteen patients with zzso attributable to zzso and 15 healthy controls were zzso Nine of the zzso group had zzso and six had zzso zzso short echo time MRS zzso time zzso zzso repetition time zzso zzso was performed in the zzso evident zzso and in the zzso zzso of the control group and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso plus zzso zzso was measured in the same regions using a double quantum zzso 

The dominant abnormalities in the patient group were zzso of zzso and zzso and reduction in zzso compared to the control zzso The ratios zzso and zzso were also increased in the patient group whilst the ratio zzso was zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso than zzso 

Large cortical zzso had abnormal levels of both zzso and zzso Low zzso and high zzso were also zzso These results indicate that zzso show zzso features of primitive tissue and abnormal metabolism of both zzso and zzso zzso
