To perform well on any challenging task, it is necessary to evaluate your performance so that you can learn from zzso Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that the neural zzso of error commission in a zzso anterior zzso circuit index a type of zzso or zzso learning, while zzso in a zzso anterior zzso circuit reflects appraisal of the affective or motivational significance of zzso Patients with schizophrenia show zzso zzso zzso that is not zzso responsive to zzso zzso of reduced anterior zzso zzso zzso activity during error commission in schizophrenia suggest that difficulties in evaluating and zzso zzso in response to errors may contribute to zzso zzso Using zzso functional zzso and an zzso paradigm with concurrent monitoring of eye position, the present study examined zzso zzso and its relation to task performance in the zzso components of two zzso circuits that are theorized to make distinct contributions to error zzso zzso zzso schizophrenia patients and 15 healthy controls zzso Compared to controls, patients showed increased zzso error rates and decreased zzso zzso in the reinforcement learning zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also in the affective appraisal zzso zzso zzso and zzso These reductions remained when the effects of antipsychotic medication dose and error rate were statistically zzso zzso in these networks was zzso related to error rate in both patient and control groups, but the slope of this relation was zzso in patients zzso across participants with zzso zzso in error rate were associated with smaller zzso in zzso This indicates that the blunted neural response to errors in schizophrenia was not simply a reflection of more frequent zzso Our findings demonstrate a blunted response to error commission that is associated with worse performance in two zzso circuits in zzso In the zzso circuit, the blunted response may reflect deficient modification of zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso and in the zzso network it may reflect diminished concern regarding zzso zzso However, despite these deficits and in the absence of external feedback regarding zzso patients corrected their errors as frequently as controls suggesting intact error recognition and ability to institute corrective zzso zzso in evaluating and learning from errors in schizophrenia may contribute to zzso that is rigid and zzso rather than zzso guided by zzso and may compromise performance across a wide range of zzso
