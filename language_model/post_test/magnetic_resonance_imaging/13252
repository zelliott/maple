For cellular zzso there is a need to label cells with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso that have multiple imaging zzso that are nontoxic and have increased zzso relaxation properties to improve the detection and tracking of therapeutic zzso Although increases in the relaxation properties of zzso have been accomplished, detection of zzso cells is limited by either poor cell labeling efficiency or low zzso iron zzso A strategy via a complex formation with zzso agents to overcome these obstacles has been zzso In this paper, we report a complex formation between zzso charged fluorescent zzso zzso and positively charged peptides and use the complex formation to improve the MR properties of labeled stem zzso As a result, labeled stem cells exhibited a strong fluorescent signal and enhanced T zzso MR imaging in zzso and in zzso in a flank tumor zzso
