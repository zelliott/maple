With the present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study at 3 zzso we investigated the neural zzso of zzso and zzso during zzso word problem zzso In the domain of zzso zzso might mean to zzso numbers and zzso results while zzso and zzso might mean that numbers and zzso results are verbally repeated during zzso If the brain areas involved in number processing are zzso as zzso that is, that the left angular zzso zzso shows an affinity to the verbal domain, and that the left and right zzso zzso zzso shows an affinity to the visual domain, the zzso of these areas should show a dependency on an zzso cognitive zzso 

36 healthy young adults participated in the zzso zzso The participants habitual use of zzso and zzso during solving zzso word problems was assessed with a short self-report zzso During the zzso zzso zzso word problems that had to be solved by the participants were presented in an zzso zzso 

We found that zzso showed greater brain zzso in brain areas involved in visual processing, and that zzso showed greater brain zzso within the left angular zzso 

Our results indicate that cognitive styles or preferences play an important role in understanding brain zzso Our results zzso that strong zzso use mental imagery more strongly than weak zzso during zzso Moreover, our results suggest that the left AG shows a specific affinity to the verbal domain and zzso number processing in a zzso zzso
