To compare the performance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods in measuring zzso zzso cerebrovascular zzso zzso 

zzso were scanned using both zzso sequences during a controlled zzso procedure and visual zzso zzso was zzso as the percent zzso zzso increase in cerebral blood flow zzso per zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked responses were expressed as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio were also zzso zzso averaged values for the different quantities were compared in gray matter zzso and visual zzso zzso using zzso 

Both zzso and zzso yielded comparable respective values for resting zzso zzso zzso 3 and 56 zzso 4 zzso and visually evoked responses (75 zzso zzso and 81 zzso zzso zzso of zzso determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VC 8 zzso 1 zzso however, were significantly higher than those measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VC 5 zzso 1 zzso in both zzso and zzso The percentage of zzso zzso in which statistically significant zzso responses were detected was also higher for zzso (27 zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso may be less prone to zzso of zzso zzso flow changes due to improved label timing zzso
