We present a case of type II zzso in a patient whose diagnosis had been previously zzso and who had previously been zzso with zzso arthritis and later zzso zzso and MR imaging features of the patient's zzso were pronounced but otherwise typical of zzso zzso zzso assessment can be useful in permitting a specific diagnosis to be made in patients with zzso and zzso zzso
