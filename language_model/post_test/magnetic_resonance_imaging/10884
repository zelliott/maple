We have conducted a study to compare the diagnostic yields of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and capsule zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in patients with inherited zzso zzso 

zzso was performed in 20 patients, with either zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso 4) or familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and capsule zzso was done the next zzso The number, size, and location of zzso were zzso 

Overall, zzso zzso ranging from about 1 zzso to 30 zzso in size were detected in eight patients by capsule zzso whereas with zzso only 24 zzso all bigger than 5 zzso could be seen in the four zzso zzso 

zzso bigger than 15 zzso were detected similarly with capsule zzso and zzso whereas smaller zzso were seen much more often with capsule zzso zzso smaller than 5 zzso were exclusively seen with capsule zzso However, location of the detected zzso and determination of their exact sizes was more accurate by zzso
