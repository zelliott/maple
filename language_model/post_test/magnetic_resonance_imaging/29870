zzso and functional zzso abnormalities have been previously reported in institutionalized zzso and aggressive zzso This study assessed whether prior findings of a right greater than left (R zzso zzso functional asymmetry in caught violent offenders zzso to the structural domain in zzso caught zzso 

Left and right zzso volumes were assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 23 control subjects, 16 unsuccessful zzso and 12 successful zzso community zzso and transformed into standardized zzso 

zzso zzso showed an exaggerated structural zzso asymmetry (R zzso zzso relative both to successful zzso and control subjects zzso zzso that was localized to the anterior zzso This effect could not be explained by environmental and diagnostic confounds and constitutes the first brain imaging analysis of successful and unsuccessful zzso 

zzso anterior zzso zzso in unsuccessful zzso may reflect an underlying zzso zzso that zzso zzso circuitry, resulting in affect zzso poor contextual fear zzso and zzso to cues predicting zzso
