The goal of this study was to construct a model of normal changes in zzso volume occurring throughout childhood from age 7 days to 15 zzso 

Using the technique of zzso on magnetic resonance images obtained in healthy children, zzso volume was measured and plotted against zzso 

zzso volume in the first few months of life is on average 900 zzso in males and 600 zzso in zzso By the age of 15 years, it increases up to 1500 zzso in males and zzso zzso in zzso increased by factors of zzso and zzso zzso By the time the child reaches 2 years of age, zzso volume has reached zzso zzso zzso in males and 1000 zzso in zzso and, by 5 years, zzso zzso zzso in males and 1200 zzso in zzso of the volume observed at age 15 zzso The change in zzso volume that occurs with age is not zzso but there seems to be a zzso zzso Three main periods can be zzso each lasting approximately 5 years zzso 5-10, and zzso zzso during which the growth of zzso volume is zzso Throughout childhood, males have higher zzso volumes than zzso with a similar growth zzso
