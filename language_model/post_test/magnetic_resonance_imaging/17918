To analyze and to discuss whether by paying attention to the many recent zzso in the field of pediatric zzso surgery catastrophic childhood zzso caused by definitive or suspected structural zzso can be prevented more often these days in comparison to the zzso 

Based on data from the literature and supplemented by the authors own experience, risks for children suffering from structural focal zzso that the zzso becomes catastrophic and ways how such evolutions can possibly be prevented are discussed for the different zzso separately - in the order of their frequency as they are seen at pediatric zzso surgery zzso Special emphasis is put on data regarding attempts to prevent permanent severe mental zzso 

There are common factors zzso to catastrophic courses in all structural focal zzso such as early onset and a longer duration of zzso (with respect to cognitive outcome not with respect to seizure zzso but there are also zzso zzso the better perspectives now in comparison to the past for children with conditions like zzso focal zzso subtle focal cortical zzso zzso post zzso events, zzso sclerosis zzso are not well recognized zzso While there is agreement that zzso (and zzso surgery is essential in many instances to prevent permanent mental zzso there is insufficient data regarding the issue that zzso surgery zzso not be early enough under certain circumstances and there is also only little data regarding variables which would allow to keep calm when a child is presenting with early onset difficult to control zzso One of the biggest changes seen over the last decade is the fact that children with very severe zzso who have unilateral zzso but zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso are not excluded anymore from considerations for zzso zzso Even children with bilateral zzso can be surgical zzso 

The gradually widening spectrum of indications for zzso surgery in children is resulting in an increasing number of zzso of catastrophic zzso Insufficient data regarding timing of surgery in order to prevent permanent mental zzso are calling for prospective zzso zzso
