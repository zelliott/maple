For zzso and zzso detection of tumor distribution, numerous zzso contrast agents, such as magnetic zzso zzso with several examination zzso are currently in zzso However, complex materials, zzso and cost are required for zzso contrast agents, accompanied by a high possibility of toxicity and low popularity in zzso Nevertheless, the magnetic labeling of zzso using zzso should be feasible not only in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso but also in zzso examination based on other magnetic zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso injected into mice with liver tumors, were used to examine the characteristics of magnetic zzso Using zzso and scanning zzso zzso zzso based on alternating current zzso zzso the magnetic labeling occurred significantly on the first day zzso of zzso magnetic fluid zzso and then decreased over zzso However, for both zzso without zzso and an zzso zzso zzso no magnetic labeling zzso on the first day of their respective zzso The favorable agreement indicates that magnetic labeling possesses two magnetic zzso distortion of the imaging field and zzso zzso In addition, the results of the biopsy tests, zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso show the same dynamics as those of magnetic zzso and prove that bound zzso on tumor tissue are zzso by an zzso magnetic field to express zzso zzso zzso with the simple zzso of zzso zzso magnetic labeling is also feasible for zzso examinations using zzso with high mobility and zzso
