zzso studies suggest that zzso affects neural structure and function in mature zzso clinical studies are less conclusive with many, but not all, studies showing a positive influence of zzso on verbal memory in zzso zzso 

To investigate the effects of zzso on brain zzso patterns in zzso women as they performed verbal and zzso working memory zzso 

zzso zzso zzso crossover trial from 1996 through zzso 

Community volunteers tested in a hospital zzso 

zzso zzso women aged 33 to 61 years zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso randomly crossed over with identical zzso and a zzso zzso between zzso 

Brain zzso patterns measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during tasks involving verbal and zzso working zzso 

Treatment with zzso increased zzso in the inferior zzso zzso during storage of verbal material and decreased zzso in the inferior zzso zzso during storage of zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso in the right superior frontal zzso during retrieval tasks, accompanied by greater zzso zzso during zzso The latter pattern represents a sharpening of the zzso zzso asymmetry zzso zzso zzso did not affect actual performance of the verbal and zzso memory zzso 

zzso in a therapeutic dosage alters brain zzso patterns in zzso women in specific brain regions during the performance of the sorts of memory function that are called upon frequently during any given zzso These results suggest that zzso affects brain organization for memory in zzso zzso
