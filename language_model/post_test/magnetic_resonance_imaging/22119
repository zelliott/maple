The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebral zzso with zzso dynamic zzso in the area around the zzso zzso We examined seven patients with zzso cerebral zzso After zzso injection a zzso zzso a series of zzso images were recorded in a selected zzso From these images, zzso zzso were created on a zzso zzso basis around zzso for calculating relative regional cerebral blood volume zzso Brain zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso study also was performed with intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso All patients showed prolonged signal decrease in the area around the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed significantly increased zzso compared to the normal side zzso zzso zzso paired zzso zzso The zzso zzso study showed that these areas had decreased cerebral blood zzso zzso findings suggest zzso vascular zzso due to decreased zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso is a useful method for detecting zzso zzso of zzso insult in the zzso zzso
