The clinical zzso of zzso disease zzso is far more complex and variable than depictions of it as a progressive movement disorder dominated by zzso pathology zzso The availability of novel zzso methods has enabled us to evaluate cerebral cortical changes in zzso which we have found to occur early and to be zzso zzso What is less clear, however, is how these changes influence the clinical expression of the zzso In this study, we used a high-resolution surface based analysis of in zzso zzso data to measure cortical thickness in 33 individuals with zzso spanning the spectrum of disease and 22 zzso and zzso zzso We found close relationships between specific functional and cognitive measures and zzso specific cortical zzso We also found that distinct motor zzso were associated with discrete patterns of cortical zzso The selective topographical associations of cortical thinning with clinical features of HD suggest that we are not simply zzso global worsening with global cortical zzso Our results indicate that cortical involvement contributes to important symptoms, including those that have been ascribed primarily to the zzso and that zzso selective changes in the zzso might explain much of the clinical zzso found in zzso Additionally, a significant association between regional cortical thinning and total functional capacity, currently the leading primary outcome measure used in zzso trials for zzso establishes cortical zzso zzso as a potential zzso of disease zzso
