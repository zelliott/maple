We tested the hypothesis whether texture analysis zzso from MR images could identify patterns associated with an abnormal zzso in small for zzso age zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed on 91 zzso fetuses at 37 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were delineated from fetal zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso test and were classified as abnormal if zzso 1 area was zzso zzso and as normal if all areas were zzso zzso zzso features associated with zzso were selected and machine learning was used to model a zzso zzso 

Of the 91 zzso zzso 49 were classified as normal and 42 as zzso The zzso to predict an abnormal zzso based on zzso were zzso for frontal zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso 

Fetal brain zzso textural patterns were associated with zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso could be a useful tool to predict abnormal zzso in zzso
