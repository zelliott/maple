In this work, a neutral zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been realized as a zzso sensor through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was further developed as a zzso agent for monitoring zzso zzso Upon addition of zzso to a solution of zzso a noticeable spectral blue shift in both zzso and zzso zzso bands was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that coordination of zzso to the complex zzso fast decomposition of zzso to form a new complex, which is responsible for the significant variations in optical and zzso zzso zzso cell imaging experiments have shown that zzso is membrane permeable and can be used to monitor the changes in zzso levels within cells in a zzso zzso zzso
