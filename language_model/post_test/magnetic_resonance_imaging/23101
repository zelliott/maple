Recent evidence suggests that a zzso automatic face detection system is supported by zzso structures including the amygdala, zzso and superior zzso zzso abnormalities in these structures may be related to reduced social zzso in children with zzso and zzso to zzso development of cortical circuits involved in face zzso Our objective was to determine whether functional abnormalities in the zzso face processing system are present in adults with zzso spectrum disorders zzso during zzso fearful face zzso Participants included zzso individuals with zzso and 25 controls zzso on age, zzso and behavioral zzso The zzso group met diagnostic criteria on the zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso and control groups showed significant zzso in bilateral zzso zzso The control group exhibited additional significant responses in the right amygdala, right zzso and bilateral superior zzso In the direct group comparison, the controls showed significantly greater zzso in the left amygdala, bilateral zzso zzso right zzso and bilateral superior zzso No brain region showed significantly greater zzso in the zzso group compared to the zzso Thus, basic rapid face identification mechanisms appear to be functional in zzso However, individuals with zzso failed to engage the zzso brain regions involved in face detection and automatic emotional face processing, suggesting a core mechanism for impaired zzso processing in zzso zzso abnormalities in this system may contribute to zzso deficits in social zzso and attention, the putative precursors to abnormalities in social zzso and cortical face processing zzso
