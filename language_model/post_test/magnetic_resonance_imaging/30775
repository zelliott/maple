zzso sexual zzso have been correlated with behavioral differences between healthy men and zzso We have reported higher zzso zzso to zzso ratio zzso in women than zzso Although gender differences in schizophrenia are evident clinically and correlate with zzso measures, their relationship to zzso has not been zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was performed in 31 zzso schizophrenic patients (16 zzso and 80 healthy volunteers zzso zzso aged less than 50 zzso An automated tissue zzso procedure was combined with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

Men with schizophrenia had increased zzso relative to healthy men, whereas women had decreased zzso Increased zzso in men with schizophrenia reflected zzso low zzso volumes, whereas decreased zzso in women reflected zzso low zzso zzso Less severe negative symptoms were associated with increased zzso in men but with decreased zzso in zzso In men, increased zzso volume was associated with greater symptom severity, whereas in women higher volumes of both zzso and zzso regions were associated with lesser severity of negative zzso 

These opposite zzso zzso zzso men show zzso and women zzso suggest zzso effects of the underlying zzso zzso The correlations with symptom severity suggest that zzso abnormalities in zzso reflect zzso brain zzso
