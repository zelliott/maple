The goal of this retrospective study was to recognize the zzso of adrenal tumors called zzso that are in fact symptomatic or hormone zzso tumors, to assess if the diagnostic criteria proposed in the literature are reliable for adrenal tumors found zzso 

The records concerned 147 patients operated between April 1981 and December 2000 for an adrenal mass measuring 3 zzso in diameter and larger on CT zzso Clinical and laboratory findings as well as hormone levels and imaging examinations zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated with operative findings and results of zzso zzso One hundred and three patients were operated by a traditional approach and zzso four by zzso zzso 

In 41 patients zzso the tumors had to be classified as false zzso zzso 1) zzso In 106 patients zzso the nature of tumor was non zzso In this group 2, there were ten zzso tumors, two zzso and 94 benign zzso Age of patient, size of zzso increase in size over time and zzso appearance represent criteria that are not reliable to separate zzso from benign zzso 

zzso of zzso and non specific nature only should be classified as zzso Imaging techniques as well as other criteria of zzso cannot be relied upon to separate benign from zzso zzso The risk even small of cancer or zzso leads us to recommend zzso of tumors zzso or zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso The zzso approach is a good alternative to open operation in centers with this special zzso
