The aim of this study was to zzso evaluate the relationship between short echo time pulmonary zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal intensity zzso and zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and pulmonary function zzso 

Nine healthy zzso and 11 COPD subjects underwent zzso zzso zzso short echo time zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso In addition, for COPD subjects only, CT zzso was also zzso 

Mean zzso zzso was significantly greater for zzso zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units zzso compared to COPD subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was also significantly greater for zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to COPD subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and significant correlations between zzso MR zzso and CT zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The significant and moderately strong relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as between zzso zzso and CT zzso of zzso suggests that these imaging methods and zzso may be zzso similar tissue changes in COPD and that pulmonary zzso zzso may be used to monitor zzso as a complement to CT and noble gas zzso
