Defining tools in magnetic resonance imaging zzso representing specific pathological processes is needed to understand the complex relationship between zzso zzso breakdown, zzso injury and clinical symptoms in multiple sclerosis zzso and its zzso Here, we describe a case of zzso zzso in which the zzso appearance of the zzso and clinical course support the diagnosis of zzso concentric zzso zzso zzso transfer, diffusion zzso imaging and zzso resonance zzso from 14 days to 13 months after zzso allow the contextual interpretation of specific pathological zzso In our case, acute inflammation was sensitively traced by fractional zzso and increased zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso transfer ratio and the apparent diffusion zzso monitor the sequential loss of tissue in selected rings of the zzso The delay from the peak of symptoms in a dramatic clinical course to the maximum tissue destruction indicated through zzso suggests that compromise of zzso function may be decisive for the acute clinical zzso This is the first report comparing zzso resonance zzso zzso transfer and diffusion zzso imaging with zzso in a patient with zzso concentric zzso
