Although zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso stroke, differences in the nature of these conditions may result in differences in associated stroke zzso We compared patterns of acute and zzso zzso stroke in zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso diagnostic codes and medical record review, we identified 362 patients zzso zzso with zzso and 14 patients with zzso Thirty-five patients (with 27 episodes of zzso 9 zzso who underwent 36 initial and 29 follow-up zzso scans were selected for this zzso zzso zzso size, number, and location were compared between groups and correlated with stroke syndromes and zzso zzso 

zzso was abnormal in all but 2 zzso Four acute stroke patterns were zzso zzso single zzso zzso territorial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso numerous small zzso zzso and medium (10 to 30 zzso or large zzso zzso zzso in multiple zzso All patients with zzso exhibited pattern 4, whereas those with zzso exhibited patterns 1, 2, 3, and 4 zzso 2, 8 and 9 episodes, zzso Seventy-five percent of patients with pattern 3 exhibited the clinical syndrome of zzso zzso zzso size, zzso and organisms had no correlation with stroke zzso 

zzso has utility in zzso between zzso and zzso Patients with zzso zzso have zzso widely distributed, small and large strokes, whereas patients with zzso exhibit a panoply of stroke zzso
