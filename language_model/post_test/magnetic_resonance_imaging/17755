zzso zzso methods such as zzso use zzso zzso and are prone to zzso error in zzso A significant error in zzso may result at relatively small zzso zzso that are well within the region without zzso zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso based on the zzso based zzso sequence to errors in center frequency are calculated by means of a Bloch simulation and validated by phantom zzso Typical zzso errors following local cardiac zzso are determined by field mapping at both zzso and zzso In zzso examples demonstrate the zzso appearance of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso 

zzso varied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across the heart at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso For zzso zzso 1000 zzso the variation in zzso due to zzso variation was approximately 20 zzso at 62 zzso and zzso 50 zzso at 125 zzso 

Regional variations due to the inability to completely zzso the zzso variation around the heart appear as regional variation in zzso which is zzso
