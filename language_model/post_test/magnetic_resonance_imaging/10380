zzso studies are necessary for all patients treated with targeted zzso In order to attain the precision required, we have developed zzso a zzso tool based on the zzso zzso Carlo zzso The anatomy of each patient is considered in the form of a zzso geometry created using zzso zzso zzso images or magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso enables zzso studies to be carried out at the zzso zzso zzso of the results obtained by comparison with existing methods is complex because there are multiple sources of zzso calculation methods zzso zzso Carlo codes, point zzso patient representations zzso or zzso and geometry definitions zzso or zzso In this paper, we validate zzso by taking each of these parameters into account zzso zzso Carlo methodology requires long calculation times, particularly in the case of zzso zzso and this is one of the limits of personalized zzso zzso However, our results show that the use of zzso geometry as opposed to a zzso defined geometry decreases the calculation time zzso due to an zzso of the zzso zzso It is therefore possible to zzso the use of zzso for personalized zzso in the clinical context of targeted zzso
