zzso is a crucial sensation that triggers rest, yet its underlying zzso mechanisms remain zzso zzso long-term fatigue is a symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome, which is used as a model to study the mechanisms underlying zzso 

Using magnetic resonance imaging, we conducted zzso zzso of 16 patients and 49 zzso healthy control zzso 

We found that patients with chronic fatigue syndrome had reduced zzso volume in the bilateral prefrontal zzso Within these areas, the volume reduction in the right prefrontal zzso paralleled the severity of the fatigue of the zzso 

These results are consistent with previous reports of an abnormal distribution of zzso zzso which is one of the zzso markers of chronic fatigue syndrome, in the prefrontal zzso Thus, the prefrontal zzso might be an important element of the neural system that regulates sensations of zzso
