In zzso zzso type 2 zzso cardiac muscle involvement is usually more benign than in zzso but clinically severe zzso has been reported in some zzso Using a novel method of magnetic resonance zzso zzso we examined the left zzso zzso and the left zzso muscle in 11 zzso zzso patients without overt cardiac zzso Data on cardiac zzso and function were obtained by zzso echo two-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso no significant differences were found between zzso patients and healthy controls, but using a median split approach older patients showed mildly increased left zzso zzso volumes, zzso 59% increase of zzso volume index zzso and zzso increase of zzso volume index zzso and an increase of zzso mass zzso On cardiac zzso zzso patients showed a reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by 25 and zzso compared to matched healthy zzso No significant differences were found between younger and older zzso In skeletal muscle of the zzso patients, no significant decrease of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso However, in older patients, who commonly show overt hip zzso muscle zzso we observed reduced values for zzso and zzso Our MRS and zzso findings reveal evidence for zzso zzso in zzso patients without overt heart zzso Future prospective studies are needed to clarify the risk of developing overt cardiac disease in zzso and to define zzso zzso
