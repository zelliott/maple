The aim of the present study was to establish a suitable method for virtual zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso CT scans of a pig stomach were obtained after air zzso and zzso of diluted zzso acid zzso and with double zzso In addition, three patients with gastric tumors were studied after zzso of an zzso agent zzso 6 zzso and intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso images were zzso on a Sun zzso 20 zzso zzso megabytes of random access memory, four gigabytes of hard disk zzso using dedicated software zzso General Electric Medical System zzso The zzso sequences were compared with real zzso examinations and with anatomical zzso 

In the zzso studies, the best results were obtained with plain air zzso whereas virtual CT zzso with diluted contrast and with double contrast showed artifacts simulating zzso zzso and flat zzso Patient studies showed good correlation with the zzso zzso findings, although large amounts of retained gastric fluid substantially reduced the quality of the surface zzso 

These preliminary results show that virtual CT zzso is able to provide insights into the upper gastrointestinal tract similar to those of zzso zzso However, due to the limited spatial resolution of the CT protocol used, as well as inherent image artifacts associated with the Navigator program's reconstruction algorithm, the form of virtual CT zzso studied was not capable of competing with the imaging quality provided by zzso zzso
