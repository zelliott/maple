Although successful at restoring near normal zzso to the knee in the short term, anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions have not been shown to prevent the development of zzso zzso 

Bone bruises and zzso cartilage injuries sustained at the time of initial injury (1991) would not zzso Our secondary hypothesis was that the presence of a bone zzso or zzso cartilage injury originally identified on magnetic resonance imaging would not be associated with long-term outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction evaluated by the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

We attempted to contact all patients from an original cohort (N zzso zzso for follow-up zzso which included repeat zzso magnetic resonance images, physical examination, and International zzso Documentation Committee questionnaire more than a decade zzso 

zzso patients zzso of the original zzso returned for on-site zzso No patient with a bone zzso identified on original magnetic resonance imaging had one identified at 12-year zzso The mean ( zzso zzso International zzso Documentation Committee score at follow-up with no bone zzso originally present was zzso ( zzso zzso versus zzso ( zzso zzso when a bone zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso No consistent association was observed between the presence of an initial zzso cartilage zzso with a zzso on follow-up magnetic resonance zzso The mean ( zzso zzso International zzso Documentation Committee score at follow-up with no zzso cartilage injury was zzso ( zzso zzso versus zzso ( zzso zzso with zzso cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All bone bruises identified in our study with magnetic resonance imaging at the time of initial injury had resolved at 12-year zzso The presence of a bone zzso at the time of initial injury did not significantly alter the zzso outcome by International zzso Documentation Committee after anterior cruciate ligament zzso Additionally, zzso cartilage zzso on magnetic resonance imaging did not influence the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso
