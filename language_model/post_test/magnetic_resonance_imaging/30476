The aim of this study was to evaluate observer performance using zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences in distinguishing between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance images of 51 patients with benign zzso and zzso of the musculoskeletal system were zzso There were 33 benign zzso and 18 zzso The character of zzso and zzso of the fatty zzso on zzso zzso sequences and the presence of high signal on zzso sequences were zzso Two independent observers took zzso Observer agreement was zzso The two observers achieved sensitivities of 100 and zzso for zzso images and zzso each for zzso zzso zzso were 76 and zzso for zzso and 70 and zzso for zzso zzso Observer agreement was very good zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In distinguishing zzso from zzso observer performance was comparable using zzso and zzso MR zzso High sensitivity and moderately high specificity were zzso
