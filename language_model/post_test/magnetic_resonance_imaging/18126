High serum levels of zzso zzso zzso at baseline have been associated with zzso response to zzso beta in patients with zzso multiple zzso 

To further investigate the role of zzso in predicting treatment response to zzso zzso in patients with zzso multiple sclerosis using the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with zzso zzso 250 zzso for at least 2 years in the zzso zzso zzso Outcomes of a New zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso 250 zzso for at least 2 zzso 

zzso of zzso at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the zzso levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the zzso zzso patients with less disease activity vs more disease zzso zzso patients with no disease activity vs some disease zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso 

zzso of zzso measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and new zzso on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with zzso serum zzso zzso When patients with zzso zzso were zzso the results did not zzso All patients with levels of zzso greater than 200 zzso were associated with poor response with some clinical or zzso zzso 

An increase of zzso before and early after treatment with zzso zzso was not associated with poor zzso These data do not support the value of zzso as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with zzso zzso although high levels of zzso greater than 200 zzso may predict zzso
