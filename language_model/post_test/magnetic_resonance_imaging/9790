zzso zzso and effective zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso relaxation times provide zzso measures of tissue zzso The objective for this study was to zzso independent effects of zzso zzso and zzso on normal tissue zzso and zzso in rabbit liver, zzso and zzso zzso 

Three gas challenges zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso were delivered to the rabbits in random order to isolate the effects of inspired zzso and zzso During each challenge, quantitative zzso and zzso maps were collected on a zzso zzso MR zzso Mean changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were calculated from regions of interest in each zzso 

Greatest zzso and zzso changes were observed in liver for zzso zzso and in kidney for zzso zzso zzso and zzso generally followed predicted patterns when transitioning from air zzso lower zzso zzso with inspired zzso higher zzso zzso with inspired zzso and variable zzso changes in the presence of both zzso zzso New observations also zzso 1) zzso transitions revealed the greatest significance in zzso for the liver and kidney resulting from the isolation of independent zzso and zzso zzso 2) zzso provided the best sensitivity and detected both tissue zzso and blood volume zzso and 3) zzso sensitivity was restricted mainly to tissue zzso in the absence of zzso zzso 

zzso use of MR relaxation times as zzso zzso requires an understanding of their relative sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso
