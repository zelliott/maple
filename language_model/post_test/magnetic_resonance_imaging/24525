zzso imaging is widely used in functional zzso but suffers from its pronounced sensitivity to field zzso that cause geometric zzso and image blurring which both limit the effective zzso resolution zzso In this work, it is shown how zzso techniques based on zzso zzso zzso zzso can be applied to reduce the zzso in the zzso direction without zzso and increase the zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and standard zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso resolutions of up to zzso zzso thickness zzso were acquired at zzso zzso signal contributions of zzso side zzso were shifted out of the object zzso or of the zzso plane by tilting the zzso plane zzso Brain zzso in healthy volunteers was investigated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso could be detected with all sequences and zzso most reliably with zzso due to its higher signal zzso and the longer zzso zzso that are more sensitive to magnetic field zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso based on zzso zzso could help to improve the spatial resolution of zzso of focal target regions, zzso for applications in the spinal zzso
