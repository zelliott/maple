zzso echo time zzso imaging is a robust and silent zzso zzso technique suitable for direct zzso of zzso with very rapid zzso zzso Given its successful application on zzso and animal zzso systems, the purpose of this work is to enable and demonstrate zzso imaging in humans using a zzso zzso 

A commercial 7 T zzso scanner was zzso by rapid zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso detector zzso With this setup, zzso switching is achieved within 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed in 3 zzso and digital zzso filtering takes zzso zzso resulting in an effective dead time of only 5 zzso 

zzso imaging was performed at 250 and 500 zzso bandwidth with central zzso gaps of zzso and zzso zzso intervals and repetition times of zzso and zzso zzso The technique was applied for silent zzso imaging of the head and zzso of human volunteers at an zzso resolution down to zzso zzso A sound pressure level of 41 zzso was measured, which is a reduction of more than 40 zzso compared to zzso zzso 

zzso imaging in humans was demonstrated for the first time, enabled by dedicated, zzso zzso zzso
