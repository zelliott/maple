The aims of this study were to zzso the distribution of cerebral zzso zzso in patients with zzso stroke and study the relationship between zzso and the severity of old zzso zzso and cerebral white matter zzso 

The study population consisted of 247 consecutive zzso with zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging findings of these zzso were zzso zzso were counted respectively according to their locations, including the zzso regions, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The number of the old zzso and the severity of the cerebral white matter changes were also zzso Based on the occurrence of zzso the patients were divided into two groups zzso patients with zzso 175 patients without zzso 

The most common location of zzso in patients with zzso stroke was the zzso zzso followed by the zzso region, the zzso the zzso and the zzso The severity of zzso was closely correlated with the severity of zzso zzso and cerebral white matter changes, zzso
