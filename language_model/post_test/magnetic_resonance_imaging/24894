zzso passive motion is the most widely accepted rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff zzso however, a rotator cuff zzso remains a frequent surgical zzso Clinical outcomes indicate that early passive motion is harmless to rotator cuff healing, but no laboratory evidence supports this zzso 

zzso Immediate zzso zzso improves rotator cuff healing in zzso zzso Early passive motion after short-term zzso does not harm rotator cuff healing in zzso 

Controlled laboratory zzso 

An injury to the zzso zzso was created and repaired in 90 New Zealand White zzso after which they were randomly separated into 3 groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with early passive motion zzso zzso zzso zzso At 3, 6, and 12 weeks zzso 5 rabbits from each group were sacrificed for zzso zzso zzso testing, and magnetic resonance zzso 

The zzso study demonstrated better zzso healing in the IM and zzso groups, with clusters of zzso accumulated at the zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging illustrated that the zzso junction was intact in the IM and zzso zzso The magnetic resonance zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group was not significantly higher than that of the zzso groups at 3 weeks zzso zzso zzso or 6 weeks zzso zzso zzso but it was significantly different at 12 weeks zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso At 12 weeks, the failure load was significantly higher in the IM and zzso groups than in the zzso group zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso but no difference was found between the IM and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 

Immediate zzso zzso led to better zzso healing than immediate zzso zzso and under zzso early passive motion was harmless to zzso healing in this zzso 

The results have an implication in supporting the rehabilitation protocol of early passive motion after rotator cuff zzso
