To evaluate the utility and possible increased sensitivity of zzso inversion recovery zzso images for the detection of zzso in patients with zzso zzso compared with standard zzso images, and to evaluate whether the zzso are correlated with zzso zzso 

We examined the number, size, and location of zzso in five zzso sclerosis patients using zzso and zzso zzso Their intelligence zzso ages at the onset of the first seizure, seizure types, and zzso severity also were studied zzso 

The number of zzso observed ranged from 4 to 17 on zzso images, and from 10 to 33 on zzso zzso All the zzso other than the zzso line on zzso images, were remarkably demonstrated as high-intensity zzso on zzso zzso No correlation was found between the zzso outcome and the number, size, or location of zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso images were very sensitive for the detection of zzso especially small zzso ones, the number, size, and location of which are not related to the zzso zzso
