The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agents is highly dependent on the rate of water exchange between the inner sphere of a zzso zzso and bulk zzso Normally, identifying a zzso complex that has optimal water exchange zzso is done by zzso and testing one compound at a zzso We report here a zzso economical zzso zzso synthesis of a library of imaging zzso Eighty different zzso acid zzso zzso derivatives were prepared on beads using a variety of charged, zzso but zzso zzso and zzso sized primary zzso A single chemical exchange zzso transfer image of the zzso library easily distinguished those compounds having the most favorable water exchange zzso This zzso approach will allow rapid screening of libraries of imaging agents to identify the chemical characteristics of a zzso that yield the most sensitive imaging zzso This technique could be automated and readily adapted to other types of zzso or magnetic zzso zzso zzso agents as zzso
