To investigate the frequency and distribution of end plate zzso signal intensity changes in an zzso population and to correlate these findings with patient age and degenerative findings in the zzso 

MR imaging studies of the zzso zzso spine in 59 zzso subjects were zzso reviewed by 2 musculoskeletal zzso to determine the presence and location of zzso and zzso zzso signal changes about the end plates of the zzso through zzso zzso The presence of degenerative changes in the spine was recorded as was patient zzso zzso statistics were zzso to determine the frequency and associations of end plate findings and degenerative changes in the zzso zzso zzso was determined by a zzso zzso zzso probability was used to predict the prevalence of the end plate changes in a similar subject zzso The Fisher exact test was performed to determine statistical significance of the relationship of end plate changes with degenerative changes in the spine, superior versus inferior location about the disc and age of the patient zzso 

zzso zzso signal intensity adjacent to the zzso zzso was noted in 15 out of 59 subjects by both readers, and involved 38 and 36 out of zzso end plates by readers 1 and 2, zzso zzso zzso signal intensity adjacent to the zzso end plate was noted in 8 out of 59 subjects by both readers and involved 11 and 10 out of zzso end plates by readers 1 and 2, zzso Either fat or zzso signal intensity occurred most often at the anterior ( zzso aspects of the zzso spine and was seen in an older zzso of the study ( zzso 

End plate zzso signal intensity changes are present in the zzso spine of some zzso subjects with a characteristic location along the spine and in zzso end zzso
