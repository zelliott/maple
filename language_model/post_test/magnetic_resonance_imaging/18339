The next several years will see the maturing of a collection of technologies that will enable fully and transparently distributed computing zzso Networks will be used to zzso independent zzso storage, and zzso elements into zzso zzso that are optimal for solving a particular zzso This environment will make the most powerful computing systems those that are logically assembled from network-based components and will also make those systems available to a widespread zzso Anticipating that the necessary technology and communications infrastructure will be available in the next 3 to 5 years, we are developing and demonstrating zzso applications that test and exercise the currently available elements of this zzso zzso The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory zzso Information and zzso Sciences and Research Medicine Divisions have collaborated with the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center to demonstrate one distributed application that illuminates the issues and potential of using networks to zzso virtual zzso This application allows the interactive zzso of large three-dimensional zzso zzso fields zzso data zzso by using a network-based zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The specific test case is zzso of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The virtual system architecture consists of a zzso zzso zzso that performs surface reconstruction from the zzso data, a zzso zzso that renders the resulting geometric data into an image, and a zzso that provides the display of the image and the user interface for specifying the parameters for the geometry generation and zzso zzso These three elements are configured into a virtual system by using several different network zzso This paper reviews the current status of the software, hardware, and communications technologies that are needed to enable this zzso zzso These zzso technologies include: zzso user interface and application program construction zzso zzso the zzso communication zzso mechanisms used to connect the software zzso of the application, zzso the network protocols and interface hardware used by the zzso for zzso between zzso running on separate and independent computing system zzso zzso the telecommunications infrastructure that provides the low-level data transfer functions for the networks that connect the geographically distributed elements used by the application, and zzso the nature of the functional elements that will be connected to form virtual zzso
