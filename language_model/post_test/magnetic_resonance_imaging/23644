A zzso phantom with unique features and a wide variety of applications in MR and other imaging zzso is zzso Using zzso technique, a network of zzso in the scale of actual zzso was zzso The geometry of the network was determined based on zzso minimum work law to simulate the zzso in actual zzso zzso The zzso zzso such as flow, volume ratio and the transit time, were precisely calculated using a finite element method based zzso These parameters were also estimated through the zzso of the zzso function from the tissue zzso curve in the zzso zzso The widely accepted singular value decomposition zzso method in standard, zzso and zzso zzso forms were used for the purpose of the zzso and zzso The accuracy of these methods in the presence of delay and zzso was zzso Comparing the estimated values to the true values, the contribution of each of these sources of error to the total error in the estimated zzso parameters was zzso
