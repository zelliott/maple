In order to evaluate the reliability of medical imaging methods in the assessment of zzso invasion by lung zzso a prospective study was conducted in 30 patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and pulmonary digital zzso zzso zzso improved the sensitivity of detection of surgically confirmed zzso zzso but its specificity in relation to zzso results was poor and identical to that of zzso In terms of extension to vascular structures, zzso and CT gave comparable results for the pulmonary artery and vein with two false zzso for the pulmonary veins and left atrium with the two zzso zzso was found to be superior to CT for the detection of invasion of the zzso zzso Digital zzso zzso is not as reliable as the other two zzso particularly for extension to the pulmonary vein for which it was found to be technically zzso By means of zzso and frontal scans, zzso was therefore found to be more effective than CT for examination of the zzso region and zzso zzso In contrast, the persistence of false zzso with the two methods and the impossibility of distinguishing between inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso means that zzso can never be zzso on the basis of the results of imaging zzso
