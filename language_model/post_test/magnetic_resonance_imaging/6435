In patients with zzso adrenal masses, tumor characterization is clinically relevant to establish the appropriate treatment zzso The aim of this study was to comparatively characterize such adrenal zzso using MR and zzso zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso unilateral adrenal tumors underwent both MR and adrenal zzso MR was performed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images as well as zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso MR qualitative and quantitative zzso intensity zzso evaluation was zzso zzso studies consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso PET zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy zzso or zzso follow-up zzso zzso 13 zzso 3 zzso 2 zzso 4 zzso zzso 4 zzso 1 zzso and 3 zzso Comparative imaging analysis was focused on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso MR evaluation zzso signal zzso in zzso of zzso and in zzso of zzso and zzso tumors, no zzso enhancement in zzso of zzso and zzso signal intensity loss on zzso in zzso of such tumor zzso zzso enhancement in zzso of zzso and in zzso of zzso and no absolute change of signal intensity on zzso in zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso MR analysis zzso significantly higher signal zzso of zzso compared to zzso and zzso as well as significantly higher enhancement after zzso in zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies showed significantly increased zzso zzso only in zzso zzso significant zzso zzso only in zzso zzso and zzso activity only in zzso adrenal zzso zzso 

MR techniques may provide some zzso criteria to characterize zzso adrenal masses, such as no zzso enhancement and zzso signal intensity loss on zzso in zzso or zzso measured zzso and zzso enhancement in zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso offer more specific findings in this setting since zzso and zzso scans are respectively able to reveal benign tumors such as zzso and zzso while zzso imaging allows identification of zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso is recommended in those patients, when MR images are uncertain or zzso
