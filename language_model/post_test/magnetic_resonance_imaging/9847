To validate the 2010 diagnostic criteria from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases zzso for zzso zzso zzso on zzso using the surgical liver zzso as a gold zzso 

A total of 21 liver transplant recipients were zzso zzso Each underwent surgery because of zzso between January 2007 and January zzso zzso zzso was performed on a zzso zzso MR zzso The zzso and zzso signal and kinetic contrast enhancement were correlated for each zzso with the surgical zzso zzso diameters between zzso and zzso were compared zzso A zzso model was created (R statistics software zzso to predict the presence and grade of tumor differentiation zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 71 zzso were detected at zzso including 54 zzso zzso size: zzso compared to 68 on zzso There was moderate agreement zzso zzso between the maximum zzso diameters measured on zzso and at zzso zzso on zzso provided an accuracy of 75 % for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Adding zzso zzso to the zzso criteria increased the sensitivity of zzso from zzso % to zzso % for the diagnosis of zzso and from zzso % to 79 % for zzso less than zzso in diameter, without affecting zzso On zzso analysis, wash out as a single variable was significantly associated with a diagnosis of zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso and loss of signal on zzso images zzso odds ratio zzso were zzso of good zzso 

On zzso the zzso criteria or presence of wash out within a liver zzso in patients with underlying chronic zzso disease are suggestive of zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso to the zzso criteria increases the detection of zzso especially zzso smaller than zzso
