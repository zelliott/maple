Inherent compromises in zzso zzso or impaired zzso of muscle may contribute to the occurrence of zzso zzso In this study, the zzso response of the elbow zzso muscles to light exercise was examined in eight subjects (five zzso three zzso who previously demonstrated zzso with extreme swelling zzso zzso zzso 4) or no swelling zzso zzso zzso 4) of the upper arm after eccentric zzso zzso performed identical light exercise bouts zzso s of rapid zzso biceps curls consisting of both concentric and eccentric actions at zzso of maximum voluntary contraction zzso using their previously eccentrically exercised arm zzso and control arm, which was not used previously to perform eccentric exercise zzso Blood zzso concentration zzso was assessed zzso 3, zzso 6, and 9 zzso zzso Peak zzso and the area under the curve zzso were compared between the zzso of the zzso and zzso groups and between the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso did not differ between the zzso of the zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso or between the zzso and zzso of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, the increase in zzso after light exercise with the zzso zzso zzso change, zzso zzso zzso zzso was not different from the increase after exercising the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing the response of the zzso between groups, the increase in zzso of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso was not different than that observed in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, subjects who had previously exhibited signs of zzso zzso did not show an abnormal response to zzso zzso zzso
