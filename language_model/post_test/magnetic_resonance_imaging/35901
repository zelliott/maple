To determine the usefulness of extremely low field magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the evaluation of zzso masses 19 patients with 15 tumors (13 zzso and 2 zzso pelvic zzso and 8 zzso were examined in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings were compared with results of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed in 6 zzso zzso enabled differentiation between zzso and solid zzso zzso extension into the inferior zzso zzso could be demonstrated in one case and liver zzso in two zzso The image quality was inferior to that reported at higher field strengths and the tumors were more precisely staged by CT and zzso At present, it is unlikely that low field zzso will play any substantial role in the evaluation of zzso zzso
