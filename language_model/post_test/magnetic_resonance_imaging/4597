MR images show a large range of contrast for various zzso in the body and are ideal for zzso zzso Typically, only two MR images zzso series) are used for zzso however, other images are often zzso We evaluated MR images from 40 patients to determine the optimal type and number of images required for zzso of zzso associated with brain tumors zzso brain, zzso zzso and active zzso zzso recognition methods indicated that three MR images from the same slice location were adequate for zzso as defined by feature selection and feature extraction measures based on training zzso This result was also confirmed by visually examining segmented images for all 40 zzso This work demonstrates that by using existing zzso analysis techniques zzso selection and feature zzso one can systematically determine the optimal type and number of MR images for tissue zzso
