The intrinsic differences of water and fat zzso in the MR environment allow selective interrogation of their contribution to the MR zzso zzso techniques and chemical shift imaging are routinely used in clinical body zzso zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and zzso zzso zzso is a novel imaging technique for separating fat and zzso 

This article describes the basic principles of zzso zzso and illustrates the use of zzso imaging as an alternative to zzso techniques and chemical shift imaging for body zzso
