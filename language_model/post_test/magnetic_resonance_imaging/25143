The goal of this study was to assess the regional variations of zzso wall stress in patients with zzso Q wave acute zzso zzso zzso with the use of a three-dimensional zzso zzso Fifteen normal volunteers and fifty patients with zzso zzso underwent cardiac zzso that used a zzso zzso zzso The zzso wall stress was calculated with the use of the Grossman formula with the radius and the wall thickness defined with a 3-D approach using the zzso zzso The mean wall stress was significantly increased at each level of the zzso plane only in patients with anterior zzso When calculated at a regional level in patients with anterior zzso wall stress significantly increased in anterior sector as well as normal zzso In patients with inferior zzso wall stress significantly increased only in inferior and lateral zzso In conclusion, the zzso of regional wall stress by cardiac zzso is better with the zzso approach than other methods for precise evaluation in patients with zzso Despite early zzso the wall stress remained high in patients with anterior zzso
