The aim of the study was to measure zzso parameters by dynamic zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the zzso effects during treatment with zzso in different zzso zzso 

In 20 healthy normal zzso 20 patients with zzso syndromes zzso 10 patients with multiple myeloma zzso and 10 with zzso zzso a fast zzso echo sequence zzso fast low angle shot zzso with a pump controlled zzso infusion of zzso was performed before and in 18 of these after beginning zzso of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso calculated and a statistical comparison of these values between healthy persons and patients as well as a correlation with the clinical course was zzso 

Compared with the normal controls the patients showed a higher zzso zzso persons zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso persons zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso examinations a significant zzso zzso zzso reduction of the zzso and exchange rate constant values was evident in 14 of 18 patients undergoing a zzso zzso zzso all of these patients showed a therapy responding with complete or partial diseases zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso significantly higher zzso parameters of the zzso spine can be demonstrated than in normal zzso During zzso treatment with zzso a decrease of these values was observed in case of a responding to zzso
