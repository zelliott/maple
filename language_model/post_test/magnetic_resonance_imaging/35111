Recent studies indicate that motor imagery is zzso by zzso of motor zzso However, at present it is not clear whether the sparing of motor zzso pathways is necessary to perform a motor imagery zzso To clarify this issue, we required patients with a selective, severe zzso zzso syndrome, zzso to mentally manipulate hands and three-dimensional zzso Compared with normal controls, zzso patients showed a profound impairment on a modified version of the zzso task and a normal performance on mental rotation of abstract zzso Moreover, zzso patients did not present zzso zzso effects between anatomical side of hands and spatial location of stimuli on the computer zzso Such findings confirmed that the motor system is involved in mental simulation of action but not in mental manipulation of visual zzso To explain zzso patients' inability in manipulating hand zzso we suggested that the zzso zzso both determined a complete zzso and affected a component of the motor system, which is crucial for mental representation of body parts, probably the neural connections between zzso zzso and zzso
