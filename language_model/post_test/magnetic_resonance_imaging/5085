To report the use of zzso monitoring to alter the course in aneurysm surgery to minimize zzso zzso and zzso adverse zzso 

Two patients with large middle cerebral artery zzso zzso were admitted to the zzso zzso zzso clipping seemed to be difficult, and zzso paralysis was not rare in the zzso experience zzso to prolonged zzso zzso of the parent zzso zzso test zzso zzso was positive in one patient, who developed paralysis and zzso 3 minutes after balloon zzso of the feeding zzso zzso A bypass procedure seemed to be inevitable in both zzso Motor evoked zzso zzso and sensory evoked zzso zzso were used for monitoring during the zzso 

For the patient with a positive zzso result, zzso waves did not change until 17 minutes after temporary clip zzso The aneurysm was zzso and the zzso time was 24 zzso zzso waves recovered quickly after zzso In the other patient, there were early changes in zzso waves after temporary zzso After bypass construction from the zzso artery to the inferior zzso zzso the time window of safe zzso was prolonged to zzso zzso Both the aneurysm and the zzso branch were zzso and the clip reconstruction was done to preserve the flow from zzso to the superior zzso zzso Permanent zzso disability did not occur in either zzso 

zzso zzso monitoring is a complementary method to zzso zzso to evaluate the window of safe zzso with high zzso
