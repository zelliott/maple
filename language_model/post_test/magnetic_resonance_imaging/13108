zzso and functional brain images are playing an important role in helping us understand the changes associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease zzso Recent efforts have now started investigating their utility for diagnosis zzso This line of research has shown promising results where methods from machine learning (such as Support zzso zzso have been used to identify zzso patterns from images, for use in diagnosing new individual zzso In this paper, we propose a new framework for zzso zzso which makes use of the Linear Program zzso boosting with novel additional zzso based on spatial zzso in zzso image coordinate zzso The zzso zzso the expectation that since the examples for training the zzso are images, the zzso eventually selected for specifying the decision boundary must constitute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso must be preferred over isolated zzso This prior belief turns out to be useful for significantly reducing the space of possible zzso and leads to substantial benefits in zzso In our method, the requirement of spatial zzso (of selected discriminating zzso is incorporated within the zzso framework zzso Other methods have made use of similar biases as a zzso or zzso step, however, our model incorporates this emphasis on spatial zzso directly into the learning zzso We report on extensive evaluations of our zzso on MR and zzso images from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso and discuss the relationship of the zzso output with the clinical and cognitive zzso data available within zzso
