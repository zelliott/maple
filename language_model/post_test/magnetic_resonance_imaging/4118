To evaluate the relationship between zzso membrane and joint zzso volumes determined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso and microscopic zzso zzso findings in patients with zzso arthritis zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were performed, and zzso grades of zzso zzso at zzso knee sites during zzso or zzso in 17 knees with zzso and 25 with zzso zzso inflammation and 9 separate tissue characteristics were graded zzso zzso membrane and joint zzso volumes were determined by zzso zzso enhanced with intravenous zzso zzso 

zzso zzso membrane volumes were correlated with the overall zzso assessment of zzso inflammation zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso deposition, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and less significantly with zzso zzso vessel zzso and zzso tissue formation zzso zzso zzso No correlation with zzso lining zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, or zzso was found zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso volumes are correlated with zzso inflammatory zzso zzso volumes probably mainly reflect the mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso but may also be influenced by the cumulative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane and zzso volumes may be sensitive markers and/or zzso of disease activity and treatment outcome in zzso
