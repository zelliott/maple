To describe the use of a statistical tool zzso zzso Analysis - zzso for the recognition of patterns and zzso applying these concepts to digital images used in zzso 

The description of Principal zzso Analysis is made by means of the explanation of zzso and zzso of a zzso This concept is presented on a digital image collected in the clinical routine of a hospital, based on the functional aspects of a zzso The analysis of potential for recovery of the original image was made in terms of the rate of zzso zzso 

The compressed medical images maintain the principal characteristics until approximately zzso of their original size, highlighting the use of Principal zzso Analysis as a tool for image zzso zzso the zzso obtained may reflect the complexity and zzso the texture of the original zzso 

The quantity of principal components used in the zzso influences the recovery of the original image from the final zzso zzso
