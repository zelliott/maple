One thousand zzso consecutive patients referred for shoulder zzso were asked to complete the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and analyzed with multivariable linear zzso 

No statistical relationship could be found between the level of pain, zzso and disability as reported on the zzso zzso and the location and size of zzso tears of the rotator cuff as observed on zzso zzso and disability are significantly linked to the presence of zzso zzso zzso and the presence of zzso but these factors contribute little to the zzso Patients with biceps zzso did not experience increased pain when compared with patients without biceps zzso or with biceps zzso zzso
