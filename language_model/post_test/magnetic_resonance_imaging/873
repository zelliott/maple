zzso and automated methods are used to measure zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso but their comparative zzso sensitivity, and zzso are zzso 

Brain zzso fraction zzso was measured in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy control subjects zzso zzso 17) by four zzso zzso or automated zzso and zzso or zzso pulse zzso Linear measures of zzso zzso zzso volumes, and clinical data were used to explore zzso 

The zzso automated method yielded unreliable zzso and was zzso The three other zzso methods produced data that were highly zzso and indistinguishable by analysis of zzso In the zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and automated zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were lower than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso automated zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and automated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with third zzso zzso and showed similarly robust correlations with the zzso ratio (all r zzso zzso The zzso and automated zzso showed similar, moderate correlations with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volume, physical disability zzso zzso zzso zzso score, and disease duration and similar differences between secondary progressive and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso reliability was somewhat higher for the automated than for the zzso zzso 

These automated and zzso measures of zzso zzso provided similar and nearly interchangeable data regarding zzso They zzso zzso from healthy individuals and showed similar relationships to established disease zzso
