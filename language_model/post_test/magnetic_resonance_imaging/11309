The objective of this work was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso in cell cultures using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the long-term goal to develop a tool for evaluation of novel zzso agents in a realistic zzso zzso This initial study was carried out using zzso cells treated with independently determined zzso of zzso Two cell culture systems were zzso cell zzso and single layers of cells grown on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell cultures were acquired with two zzso zzso Recovery Fast Spin Echo zzso three zzso zzso Recovery Fast Spin Echo zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso accuracy of these sequences was confirmed with zzso zzso samples of known zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured in the cell zzso and cell zzso respectively, and were different from the value of zzso zzso for zzso in zzso Both cell zzso and zzso are suitable for initial assessment of novel MR contrast zzso
