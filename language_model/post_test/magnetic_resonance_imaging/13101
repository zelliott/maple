Natural history of patients with zzso discovered zzso that fulfill magnetic resonance imaging zzso criteria for multiple sclerosis zzso in the absence of objective clinical symptoms suggestive of central nervous system zzso zzso disease is not well zzso 

We evaluated the risk of developing symptomatic zzso in patients with zzso uncovered zzso possible zzso disease zzso 

We identified and zzso followed a cohort of 22 patients from two zzso care zzso zzso Istanbul University, zzso School of Medicine, zzso Turkey, and Mayo zzso Rochester, Minnesota, after an initial zzso study fulfilling the zzso zzso criteria completed for other reasons unrelated to zzso 

Eight of 22 patients developed an objective clinical symptom consistent with a zzso zzso syndrome and fulfilled dissemination in space and time criteria for zzso zzso Median age at the time of diagnosis of zzso was zzso years zzso zzso zzso Time taken for the development of zzso zzso was studied by survival zzso zzso event rates zzso 12 zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso 36 zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso Six of 22 patients were followed beyond 60 zzso Two of these six patients developed zzso later (at 66 and 112 months, zzso Three patients remained zzso despite follow-up of 10 zzso
