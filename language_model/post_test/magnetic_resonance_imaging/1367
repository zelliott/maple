The relationship between abnormal color vision and zzso zzso was investigated in 27 zzso patients and 31 zzso controls by using the zzso 100 zzso zzso Twelve zzso of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above zzso The axes of zzso determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores, compatible with the notion that different zzso in visual zzso genes occur in different zzso zzso These observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these zzso and it supports our zzso that zzso zzso (and its companion, zzso are very closely linked to the visual zzso zzso at zzso and zzso this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe zzso gene zzso
