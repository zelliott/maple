Young adults born zzso have distinct differences in left zzso mass, function, and zzso Animal studies suggest that zzso changes are evident in both zzso after zzso zzso therefore, we investigated whether these young adults also have differences in their right zzso structure and zzso 

We studied 102 zzso young adults followed up zzso since birth and 132 zzso control subjects born to uncomplicated zzso We zzso right zzso structure and function by cardiovascular magnetic resonance on a zzso zzso scanner using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso birth was associated with a small right zzso (end zzso volume, zzso versus zzso zzso zzso but greater right zzso mass zzso versus zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso controls, with the severity of differences zzso to zzso age zzso zzso zzso in right zzso mass and function were zzso greater than previously reported for the left zzso This was most apparent for zzso zzso young adults born zzso had significantly lower right zzso ejection fraction zzso versus zzso zzso Indeed, zzso had values below the lower limit observed in the zzso adults and zzso had mild zzso dysfunction zzso zzso ventilation accounted for some of the variation in mass but not zzso 

zzso birth is associated with global zzso structural and functional differences in adult life, including smaller right zzso size and greater zzso The changes are greater in the right zzso than previously observed in the left zzso with potentially clinically significant impairment in right zzso zzso zzso
