The purpose of this study was to determine the role of zzso stress cardiac magnetic resonance zzso for risk zzso in patients with coronary artery zzso of intermediate zzso zzso 

zzso zzso only provides a zzso description of coronary zzso As the patient's prognosis is closely related to the functional significance of zzso detected coronary zzso a functional assessment is desirable in patients with coronary artery zzso of intermediate zzso 

zzso zzso zzso at rest and zzso stress were performed on 81 patients zzso male, mean age zzso zzso with stable angina zzso (AP) and coronary artery zzso of intermediate zzso severity zzso to zzso Regardless of the zzso result, all patients were treated conservatively with an intensified medical treatment, and a follow-up was performed after 18 zzso 8 months and 30 zzso 8 zzso The primary end point was defined as a major adverse cardiac event zzso zzso death, stroke, acute coronary zzso the secondary end point was defined as target vessel zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso were zzso 

After the follow-up period of 30 zzso 8 months, 9 patients with zzso deficit zzso suffered from zzso whereas no zzso occurred among the 36 patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso Among patients who had zzso the number of zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was significantly higher, whereas the number of delayed enhancement segments did not differ zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Target vessel zzso was required in 38% of patients with zzso and zzso of patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the percentage of freedom from zzso and zzso at the follow-up after 18 zzso 8 months was significantly lower among patients without zzso deficit zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso After a follow-up period of 30 zzso 8 months, the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as well as the percentage of patients free of symptoms was similar in both groups zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso stress zzso may help to identify patients at risk who benefit from intensified medical treatment and close zzso
