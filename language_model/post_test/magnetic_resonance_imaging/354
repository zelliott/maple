The recent discovery of a circuit of brain regions that is highly active in the absence of overt behavior has led to a quest for revealing the possible function of this so-called zzso network zzso A very recent study, finding similarities in awake humans and zzso zzso has suggested that zzso activity might not simply reflect ongoing conscious zzso but rather a more general form of network dynamics typical of complex zzso Here, by performing functional zzso in humans, it is shown that a natural, zzso reduction of consciousness is reflected in altered correlation between zzso network zzso most notably a reduced involvement of frontal zzso This suggests that zzso may play an important role in the zzso of conscious zzso
