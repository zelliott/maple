zzso from zzso have strongly supported the idea that the zzso zzso zzso contributes to successful memory formation, but the role the zzso zzso zzso in memory zzso is more zzso Some findings suggest that the zzso is recruited when one is processing relationships between items in working memory, and this processing specifically promotes subsequent memory for these zzso However, previous studies could not rule out the possibility that zzso promotes memory during all zzso zzso conditions and contributes to memory on all subsequent zzso memory zzso To address this question directly, we used zzso to examine activity during two zzso tasks that prompted participants to zzso either zzso or zzso zzso On zzso trials, participants imagined pairs of items zzso whereas on zzso trials, participants imagined the items zzso separated and in different zzso After zzso we examined memory for zzso information and zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso activity specifically promoted memory for zzso information during zzso zzso and not memory for zzso information during zzso zzso In contrast, activity in the zzso predicted memory for both zzso and zzso zzso The present results are consistent with the idea that the zzso specifically contributes to successful memory formation through its role in building relationships among zzso
