zzso we have presented evidence in humans for two zzso motor zzso which we had speculated play a significant role in the planning of voluntary motor zzso A review of the more recent experimental literature shows that zzso zzso and electrical stimulation studies in animals reveal the existence of two frontal regions that from the experimental data also seem to play an essential role in the preparation (as opposed to zzso of voluntary zzso Current available evidence suggests that these two areas zzso F5 and zzso of zzso et zzso zzso to the negative motor areas we have described in human zzso Also of interest is that zzso area in the dominant zzso zzso the corresponding negative motor zzso This observation suggests that zzso area has evolved from area F5 of monkeys specializing in the planning of fine movements necessary for speech zzso We feel that current evidence suggests the existence of three mechanisms by which cortical stimulation (by electrical stimulation or by zzso zzso can generate negative motor zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is consistently zzso has a zzso distribution, and tends to affect predominantly muscles involved in fine zzso It is of relatively short duration and seems to be generated by the zzso of cortical areas in the primary zzso zzso The zzso is not inhibited during the silent period, suggesting that the silent period is generated by a decrease in the zzso input through direct zzso zzso on the spinal alpha zzso It is possible that in normal individuals this system is used for fine tuning of fine zzso zzso The negative zzso seen in some patients with focal cortical zzso is probably generated by this zzso The primary and supplementary zzso motor zzso described in this zzso This effect also has a zzso distribution but can affect muscle zzso even if there is a clear predominance zzso The negative motor effect does not influence zzso tone and can be zzso The negative motor effect is probably produced by zzso of zzso zzso immediately in front of the primary and supplementary face motor zzso These cortical areas are probably used for organization and integration of fine motor zzso zzso of these areas would produce an zzso of fine zzso zzso zzso zzso are probably generated by this zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which by zzso of the zzso zzso centers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tend to produce bilateral zzso of zzso zzso zzso This system probably does not depend on the presence of the direct zzso zzso By zzso with zzso which is probably produced by zzso of similar zzso zzso systems, we would expect the zzso to be markedly diminished or even to disappear during the atomic phase zzso This zzso would be used normally for zzso adjustments and zzso The bilateral massive zzso seizures, seen most frequently in patients with severe and diffuse cortical zzso are probably produced by this zzso However, the bilateral zzso zzso occasionally seen in patients with focal cortical zzso may also be produced by a similar zzso
