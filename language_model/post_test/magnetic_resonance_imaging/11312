Although it has been demonstrated that quantitative measures of cerebral blood flow zzso can be obtained with the singular value decomposition zzso algorithm, the extent to which quantitative zzso zzso can be zzso under zzso conditions has not been systematically zzso A total of five healthy volunteers and five patients with unilateral carotid artery zzso were zzso Only magnetic resonance zzso images were acquired for the volunteer group while both MR and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired for the patient zzso zzso of zzso from normal volunteers compared favorably with values reported in the zzso However, while a linear relationship was observed for each patient when MR measured zzso was compared to that obtained from zzso this linear relationship diminished when all patients were analyzed as a group zzso zzso zzso A correction factor zzso was proposed that was equal to the ratio of the area of the zzso output function zzso in each patient to the mean zzso obtained from the volunteer zzso After globally zzso the zzso of each patient based on the zzso derived zzso a substantial improvement was observed (a slope of zzso and r zzso zzso for the linear zzso line) in the relationship between MR estimated zzso and those obtained from zzso
