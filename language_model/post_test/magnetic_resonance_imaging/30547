To compare the enhancement of brain zzso between zzso fast zzso zzso recalled acquisition in the steady state zzso and spin echo zzso zzso imaging at zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

The subjects comprised 18 patients with 81 suspected brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were obtained before and after zzso zzso The signal intensity of each tumor was measured for each zzso the enhancement and contrast rates were also zzso 

For equivalent slice zzso the enhancement and contrast rates of the zzso images were lower than those of the zzso images zzso whereas for the thin zzso the rates were higher for the zzso images zzso zzso zzso 

On zzso magnetic resonance imaging, the enhancement of zzso images was less than that of the zzso images under the same conditions, but not to a fatal degree, and thin slice zzso imaging is therefore considered to be useful for detecting small zzso when given a high dose of contrast agent and a suitable scanning delay zzso
