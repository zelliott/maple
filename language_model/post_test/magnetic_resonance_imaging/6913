In zzso study of zzso it was lack of large group of patients to evaluate zzso qualitative diagnosis, and no consensus had been achieved concerning problems such as zzso zzso in zzso This study was to zzso main clues for diagnosing zzso through analyzing zzso performance of 126 patients with zzso 

Among 126 patients with zzso 32 were zzso 35 were zzso 24 were zzso 9 were zzso 18 were zzso 3 were zzso and 5 were zzso All patients were scanned with zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of brain was more likely to be involved, among 126 cases of zzso 45 zzso tumors located at zzso of zzso The size of tumor ranged from zzso to zzso zzso Eighty-one percent of tumors were round or oval in zzso zzso or slight zzso of zzso signals detected in zzso zzso The rates of tail sign, and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso sign of brain zzso was observed in zzso zzso patients with tumor size of zzso 4 zzso zzso even and increasing sign in zzso zzso were observed in 104 patients zzso zzso zzso occurred in 57 patients zzso and related to tumor zzso Other rare signs included zzso changes, zzso zzso zzso changes, and zzso vessel zzso The correct rate of diagnosis was zzso 

zzso performances of zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso typical zzso signals, tail sign, and significantly even and increasing sign are key factors for diagnosing zzso
