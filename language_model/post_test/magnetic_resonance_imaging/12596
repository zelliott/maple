The present study investigated the premise that individual differences in zzso physiology could be used to specify the nature and consequences of information processing taking place in zzso prefrontal regions during cognitive zzso of unpleasant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter, cardiac zzso signals were recorded simultaneously as zzso older people zzso zzso zzso used zzso to increase, zzso or decrease their responses to unpleasant zzso zzso was higher when increasing and lower when decreasing compared to zzso This suggested zzso of emotional zzso by zzso By contrast, zzso diameter and cardiac acceleration were higher when increasing and decreasing compared to zzso This suggested zzso of cognitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in two zzso prefrontal regions zzso zzso frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso was correlated with greater cardiac acceleration zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso These data indicate that these two zzso prefrontal regions are involved in the allocation of cognitive resources to regulate unpleasant emotion, and that they zzso emotional zzso in accordance with the regulatory zzso The emotional zzso effects were zzso by the right zzso zzso zzso in a third zzso prefrontal region zzso anterior zzso zzso was not associated with similar patterns of change in any of the zzso measures, thus highlighting regional specificity in the degree to which cognitive demand is reflected in zzso prefrontal zzso during zzso
