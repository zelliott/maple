zzso proteins of the zzso family interact with bone cells and with bone mineral and are thus in a key position to regulate bone development, zzso and zzso Within this family, bone zzso zzso is highly expressed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso We recently reported that mice lacking zzso zzso have very low zzso bone zzso In the present study, we set up an experimental model of bone repair by drilling a 1 zzso diameter hole in the cortical bone of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso imaging and bone zzso procedure was designed to follow bone zzso and these data were extended by zzso imaging and zzso on zzso sections for analysis at cellular zzso These combined approaches revealed that the repair process as reflected in zzso in the cortical area was significantly delayed in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that formation, zzso and zzso of repair zzso bone in the zzso were delayed in zzso mice, with lower zzso and zzso surfaces at day zzso In conclusion, the absence of zzso delays bone repair at least in part by zzso both new bone formation and zzso zzso
