zzso due to middle cerebral artery zzso was studied in 29 rats from 1 to 24 hours after zzso using magnetic resonance zzso Images were made before and after the injection of a zzso iron oxide compound, zzso zzso images demonstrated the region of zzso deficit as early as 1 hour after zzso earlier than conventional zzso zzso The area of altered zzso detected by this technique zzso imaging after zzso zzso correlated with that demonstrated by zzso zzso Since this magnetic resonance technique can be used to serially estimate the location and size of the zzso area, the technique can be an important adjunct to zzso studies of focal zzso using magnetic resonance zzso The technique may have clinical applications as zzso
