The aim of this study was to examine the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by use of magnetic resonance imaging in control knee zzso and zzso with zzso zzso of the lateral zzso zzso to determine the zzso of abnormal zzso zzso zzso in these zzso 

zzso zzso were diagnosed with zzso when there was a history of mechanical zzso episodes and when zzso of the lateral zzso was recognized on zzso In this study zzso knee zzso were zzso The zzso were classified into a control group zzso zzso zzso group (16 zzso and zzso zzso group (7 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging was as zzso type I, a tense, zzso band ran from the superior zzso border of the lateral zzso to the zzso zzso type II, an unclear band ran from the superior zzso border of the lateral zzso and type III, no band was zzso zzso II and III were thought to exhibit abnormal zzso The distribution of knee zzso among the 3 groups and zzso types was zzso 

zzso of abnormal zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, in the control zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso A significant difference in the distribution of knee zzso by zzso of zzso was recognized between the control and zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso A significant difference in zzso was also recognized between the zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 

A significantly high zzso of abnormal zzso was found in zzso and zzso zzso Thus abnormal zzso existed in both knee zzso before patients had zzso symptoms, suggesting that abnormal zzso may be required for zzso zzso A significantly high zzso of abnormal zzso was found only in the knee zzso with zzso An abnormal zzso is thus the essential zzso to allow the zzso lateral zzso to become unstable beyond the rate of control zzso 

Level III, zzso zzso
