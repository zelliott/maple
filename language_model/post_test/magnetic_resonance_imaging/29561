This study investigated the neural zzso of implicit sequence learning in subjects with and without small animal zzso in a follow-up to analogous studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso 

Ten subjects with specific zzso and 10 healthy comparison subjects were studied by using a serial reaction time task paradigm and functional magnetic resonance zzso 

A main effect of condition zzso sequence learning versus random zzso was observed across diagnostic groups in the right zzso as well as in other zzso In the zzso the a zzso region of interest, there were no significant effects of diagnosis or the interaction of diagnosis and zzso 

Brain zzso in the zzso of subjects with specific zzso does not significantly differ from that of normal comparison subjects during implicit sequence zzso This suggests different zzso mechanisms for specific zzso in contrast to zzso in which deficient zzso recruitment has been zzso found with this zzso This approach offers promise for demonstrating diagnostic specificity across different zzso disorders based on the presence or absence of deficient zzso zzso
