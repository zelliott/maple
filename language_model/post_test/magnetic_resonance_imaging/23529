The anterior zzso and several other prefrontal and zzso brain regions are implicated in error processing and cognitive zzso The effects of different doses of alcohol on activity within these brain regions during a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso task where errors are frequently committed have not been fully zzso 

This study examined the impact of a zzso zzso alcohol concentration zzso zzso zzso moderate zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso doses of alcohol on brain zzso activity during a functional zzso zzso zzso task in 38 healthy zzso 

Alcohol increased reaction time and false alarm errors in a zzso zzso zzso analyses showed alcohol decreased activity in anterior cingulate, lateral prefrontal cortex, zzso and zzso lobe regions during false alarm responses to zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that brain regions implicated in error processing are affected by alcohol and might provide a neural basis for zzso effects on behavioral zzso
