zzso hypertension is often associated with insulin resistance and visceral zzso Whether these zzso abnormalities have an independent impact on regional cardiac function is not zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of increased blood pressure, insulin resistance, and zzso fat zzso on the changes in peak zzso zzso zzso Thirty-five male subjects zzso zzso years; body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included 13 with normal blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 9 newly diagnosed with essential hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance tissue tagging zzso and zzso zzso of abdominal visceral and zzso zzso zzso zzso on oral zzso tolerance test, and insulin resistance were assessed along with the serum zzso zzso All of the subjects had normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes, and ejection zzso Across the zzso groups, left zzso mass tended to increase, and zzso zzso was progressively reduced at zzso zzso and zzso segments (on average, from zzso in normal blood pressure to zzso in zzso to zzso in those newly diagnosed with essential zzso zzso zzso zzso strain was significantly associated with raised zzso independent of age zzso zzso and with zzso and visceral fat, serum zzso and insulin resistance independent of age and zzso In conclusion, regional left zzso function is already reduced at the early stages of hypertension despite the normal global cardiac zzso zzso resistance, zzso and zzso fat zzso are associated with reduced regional zzso zzso
