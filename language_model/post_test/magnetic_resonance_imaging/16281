The zzso zzso of pathological gambling are not well zzso Insight might be gained by understanding pharmacological effects on the reward system in patients with Parkinson's disease zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso has been associated with pathological gambling in zzso zzso However, how zzso are involved in the development of this form of addiction is zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso stimulation of zzso receptors specifically zzso the zzso reward system by preventing decreases in zzso transmission that occurs with negative zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied zzso patients during three sessions of a zzso reward task in random order: off medication, after zzso zzso treatment, and after an equivalent dose of zzso zzso For each trial, a reward prediction error value was zzso using outcome, stake, and zzso zzso specifically changed activity of the zzso zzso zzso in two ways that were both associated with increased risk taking in an zzso zzso zzso zzso were generally higher with zzso compared with zzso or off zzso In addition, only zzso greatly diminished zzso correlation with reward prediction error zzso Further analysis yielded that this resulted mainly from impaired zzso in trials with negative errors in reward zzso We propose that zzso prevent pauses in zzso transmission and thereby impair the negative reinforcing effect of zzso Our findings raise the question of whether pathological gambling may in part stem from an impaired capacity of the zzso to guide behavior when facing negative zzso
