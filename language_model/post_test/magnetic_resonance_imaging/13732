The evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries has traditionally relied primarily on information gained from the clinical history, physical examination, and zzso zzso Taken together, all of this clinical and diagnostic information often allows one to determine the location and severity of the underlying peripheral nerve zzso However, it may not be sufficient in diagnosing a focal zzso zzso superimposed upon a more generalized peripheral zzso zzso a focal zzso along a long segment of nerve which may be difficult to assess accurately with zzso zzso distinguishing early between an zzso grade of injury, which can recover through zzso zzso and a zzso grade which cannot and therefore may benefit from a surgical exploration and repair zzso and zzso diagnosing and determining the surgical zzso of peripheral nerve mass zzso such as zzso The goal of this review is to illustrate how standard and evolving magnetic resonance imaging techniques can provide additional information in dealing with some of these zzso
