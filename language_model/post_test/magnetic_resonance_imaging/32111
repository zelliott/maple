A model of zzso transplantation has been used in studying peripheral nerve zzso and central zzso It was found that recovery of sensory perception depends not only on peripheral zzso but also on central zzso zzso 

Our aim was to investigate functional changes of the brain and zzso representation of the transplanted toes after zzso zzso 

Six patients who had zzso transplantation from 3 to 8 years earlier underwent motor and sensory functional MR imaging studies of transplanted toes and opposite corresponding normal zzso The motor task was performed by zzso tapping of the transplanted toe or finger against the zzso whereas the sensory task was applied by zzso stimulating the pulp of the transplanted toe or zzso 

The main zzso areas from both types of zzso were located in the expected location of the finger zzso of the primary zzso zzso In addition, activated volumes from the transplanted toes were significantly greater than those from the opposite fingers zzso zzso zzso for motor task and P zzso zzso for tactile sensory task, paired samples Student zzso zzso 

zzso recruitment in the primary zzso zzso seemed to have occurred following zzso zzso The transplanted toe was zzso represented in the hand zzso
