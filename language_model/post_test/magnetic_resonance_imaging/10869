Previous structural magnetic resonance zzso research in patients with zzso stress disorder zzso has found smaller zzso volumes in patients compared with control zzso These studies have mostly involved subjects who have had zzso for a number of years, such as war veterans or adult survivors of childhood zzso Patients with zzso zzso have rarely been zzso To our knowledge only one other study has investigated such a zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso volumes of patients with recent onset zzso and zzso control zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso recruited from an accident and emergency department, were compared with 11, zzso healthy control zzso Patients underwent a structural MR scan soon after trauma zzso time zzso 158 zzso 41 zzso zzso brain volumes, zzso size 1 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso were acquired for each zzso Point counting and zzso were used to measure the zzso and zzso volume of each zzso 

zzso zzso volume was significantly smaller in zzso patients than control subjects after controlling for effects of whole brain volume and zzso Neither left nor total zzso volume were significantly smaller in the zzso group after zzso Whole brain volume was also found to be significantly smaller in zzso There were no differences in zzso or white matter volumes between patients and control zzso 

This result replicates previous findings of smaller zzso volumes in zzso patients, but in an zzso population, suggesting that either smaller zzso volume is a zzso factor in the development of zzso or that damage occurs within months of zzso rather than a number of zzso Either of these two hypotheses have significant implications for the treatment of zzso For instance, if it could be shown that screening for zzso volume may, in some cases, predict those likely to develop clinical zzso
