To evaluate the zzso area at risk zzso measured by the zzso surface area zzso method on late zzso enhancement zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso when applied after zzso zzso (3 months after index zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso One hundred and sixty nine patients with zzso zzso zzso treated with primary zzso coronary intervention, underwent one zzso within 1 week after index treatment to determine the zzso with zzso imaging and a second scan 3 months after to measure zzso with the zzso zzso There was a moderate correlation between the two methods zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso was significantly higher measured with zzso imaging than with the zzso methods (32 zzso zzso of left zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean difference was 6 zzso zzso Furthermore, the mean difference between the two methods was statistical higher in the patients with zzso salvage index zzso than in the remaining patients (9 zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso method performed after zzso zzso (3 months following zzso yields significantly lower zzso and zzso salvage zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso is the method of choice to assess zzso and zzso salvage index using zzso However, the zzso method is an easy and valid method for determining zzso which can be used in settings where zzso imaging has not been obtained in the acute zzso
