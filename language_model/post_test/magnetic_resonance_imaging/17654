zzso sensitivity, or the tendency to engage in motivated approach behavior in the presence of rewarding zzso may be a zzso factor for vulnerability to zzso zzso Although evidence exists for a reward zzso increased response in reward brain areas zzso nucleus zzso or zzso during the processing of reward cues, it is unknown how this trait zzso brain zzso specifically the crucial zzso between the nucleus zzso the zzso and other zzso brain areas, including the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso Here, we zzso the relationship between effective connectivity and personality in response to anticipatory reward zzso zzso males performed an adaptation of the Monetary Incentive zzso Task and completed the zzso to zzso zzso The results showed the zzso of reward sensitivity on both activity and functional connectivity zzso zzso during the processing of incentive zzso zzso to reward scores related to stronger zzso in the nucleus zzso and zzso during the processing of reward zzso zzso interaction analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso connectivity was zzso correlated with sensitivity to reward scores for high as compared with low incentive zzso Also, nucleus zzso connectivity correlated zzso with sensitivity to reward scores during reward zzso Our results suggest that high reward zzso zzso in reward brain areas may result from associated zzso effects of other brain regions within the reward zzso
