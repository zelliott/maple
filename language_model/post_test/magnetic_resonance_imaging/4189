A method to measure arbitrary zzso zzso was developed to compensate for zzso zzso performance during rapid magnetic resonance zzso imaging with actively or zzso zzso zzso at a magnetic field strength of zzso zzso zzso MR image reconstruction requires knowledge of the zzso produced by the zzso zzso during zzso zzso Even with zzso zzso residual zzso currents and imperfections in zzso amplifier performance can cause the true zzso trajectory to zzso from the ideal zzso The zzso determination was used for spiral zzso imaging zzso the human zzso While individual zzso are needed for new pulse zzso the method of zzso determination can be used for any sequence of preparation zzso and zzso zzso zzso and should prove useful for other zzso including the zzso lines of zzso zzso
