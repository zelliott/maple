zzso hallucinations are a frequent symptom in zzso While functional imaging studies have suggested the association of certain patterns of brain activity with zzso or single symptoms zzso positive symptoms such as zzso there has been only limited evidence from structural imaging or zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the relation of local brain structural deficits to severity of auditory hallucinations, particularly in zzso areas previously reported to be involved in auditory zzso In order to overcome certain limitations of conventional zzso methods, we used zzso zzso zzso a novel automated zzso zzso technique, to assess local gray and white matter deficits in structural magnetic resonance images of 85 schizophrenia zzso We found severity of auditory hallucinations to be significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with volume loss in the left zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso auditory zzso and left zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso right prefrontal zzso This demonstrates a pattern of distributed structural abnormalities specific for auditory hallucinations and suggests zzso zzso in areas of a zzso network for processing auditory information and zzso
