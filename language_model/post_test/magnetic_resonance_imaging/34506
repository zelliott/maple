In the normal adult human brain, there are quantitative relationships between a surface area measure of the zzso matter and the volume of zzso zzso matter, the volume of the zzso zzso matter and the zzso area of the corpus zzso as revealed by analysis of high resolution zzso zzso These relationships reflect structural order in, and biological features of, normal human cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with disruption of the normal organization of the zzso to a greater or lesser extent and is often manifest as zzso zzso We have examined structural proportions and their disruption in the brains of patients with zzso and zzso We found that structural measures were abnormal in zzso of patients with CD, with abnormalities in zzso of zzso that, on visual inspection alone, appeared completely zzso We showed that the disruptions found are compatible with expected zzso in cases where zzso may be zzso and that extensive abnormalities may be due to abnormal patterns of connections within the zzso In some cases, it may be possible to predict zzso on the basis of quantitative analyses of high resolution zzso data, when such prediction is not possible on visual inspection zzso
