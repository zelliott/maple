zzso resonance imaging zzso is one of the most widely used zzso diagnostic zzso for musculoskeletal zzso We conducted a retrospective study to determine whether zzso of the hip joint zzso and external rotator muscles yields zzso findings in patients after total hip zzso zzso 

MR images were obtained 12 months after zzso in 10 patients and were analyzed by two independent, blinded zzso The images were analyzed on zzso with three-dimensional analysis zzso The readers evaluated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles on the zzso side zzso and the zzso zzso For each of the three muscles, the readers analyzed the zzso area, zzso signal intensity, intensity in a region of interest zzso and volume on both zzso 

Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant differences between the zzso for some zzso and external rotator muscles, especially for volume zzso and zzso area zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso muscles on the zzso side but also on the zzso There were no differences in signal intensity in the zzso zzso The zzso of variation zzso of all 4 parameters zzso were lower on the zzso zzso zzso than on the zzso side zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso muscle volume showed both higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 

zzso is an accurate and reliable test for evaluation of soft tissue structures in patients who have undergone zzso zzso evaluation of zzso muscles yields zzso results on the zzso side and on the zzso zzso artifacts limit evaluation of the zzso zzso muscle on the zzso side and cannot be zzso Since zzso zzso was always higher than zzso zzso follow-up examinations should zzso be performed by the same reader in order to obtain clinically meaningful zzso
