The contribution from zzso zzso zzso to the effective zzso relaxation rate, zzso in zzso bone zzso is governed by the magnetic field zzso induced by the difference in zzso zzso between bone and bone zzso and should, therefore, scale zzso with field zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso at zzso and 4 T by means of the zzso zzso sampling of free induction zzso and zzso pulse sequence showed zzso to increase by a factor of zzso at the higher field, which is close to the ratio of the field strengths zzso At both field strengths, zzso dominates zzso contributing more than zzso to the total relaxation rate at 4 zzso The data further indicate large regional variations within the zzso and a notable dependence of zzso on the angle of the foot relative to the direction of the zzso zzso The findings have implications on the choice of the zzso site for assessment of zzso zzso
