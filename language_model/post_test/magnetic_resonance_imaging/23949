A common problem in many biomedical imaging studies is that of finding a correspondence between two plane zzso which zzso their zzso A mathematical zzso and solutions to this problem is proposed in this zzso The zzso exhibits desirable zzso It allows for zzso as well as zzso zzso it consistently compares shape, even in zzso situations, and it is completely zzso with respect to the two zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso for finding the optimal correspondence is also zzso The zzso is used to estimate zzso motion of the zzso in zzso image sequences of normal and zzso dog zzso The return error (the difference between the starting and ending positions of a zzso is used as a performance measure to evaluate the zzso Since heart motion is zzso the return error is a measure of consistency of the zzso zzso applications to other data sets are reported as zzso
