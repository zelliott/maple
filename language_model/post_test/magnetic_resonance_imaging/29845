zzso of nouns and zzso following brain damage have been interpreted as evidence for distinct neural zzso underlying different aspects of the language zzso Some zzso studies have supported this claim by finding neural differentiation for nouns and zzso zzso 122 (1999) zzso while others have argued against neural zzso zzso 119 zzso zzso Brain 124 (2001) zzso We suggest that one reason why these inconsistencies may have arisen is because the zzso structure of nouns and zzso has been zzso In an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study we test the hypothesis that the neural processing of nouns and zzso differs when they are zzso We contrasted the processing of regularly zzso nouns zzso with regularly zzso zzso zzso and found that the zzso was more strongly activated in processing regularly zzso zzso compared to regularly zzso zzso Moreover, regions of zzso that were more active in the zzso study for zzso zzso partially overlapped with the zzso in patients who have particular problems with verb zzso Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that noun and verb stems do not differ in terms of their zzso but when zzso are zzso complex they zzso engage those neural systems which are involved in processes of zzso and zzso
