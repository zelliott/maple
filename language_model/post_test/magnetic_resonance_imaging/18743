The zzso approach is an elegant reliable surgical procedure that provides anterior exposure of the zzso base and the zzso zzso Our objective was to demonstrate the advantages of zzso in planning and performing the zzso zzso 

Three patients with zzso and one patient with zzso zzso zzso were considered for a zzso zzso zzso For image guidance, the Stryker navigation system zzso zzso Kalamazoo, zzso was zzso Registration was performed with individually constructed zzso zzso with four zzso 

The zzso approach was successfully used for two patients with zzso involving the zzso base and the upper spine and for one patient with dislocation of the zzso and zzso zzso In one case, zzso simulation of the approach and trajectory planning demonstrated that adequate zzso could not be achieved via the zzso route, and a zzso zzso approach was zzso The registration accuracy achieved with the zzso zzso was less than 1 zzso 

zzso is a useful tool for planning and performing a zzso zzso It zzso zzso planning, zzso and zzso zzso limits, and reduces overall surgical zzso Registration with an zzso zzso with four markers proved to be an attractive alternative to conventional zzso
