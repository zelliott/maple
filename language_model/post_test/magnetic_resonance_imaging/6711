This study determined whether cognitive zzso and structural brain changes in older depressed subjects, especially in the zzso are related to zzso 

zzso depressed subjects over age 60 who met zzso criteria for major depression and 40 healthy comparison subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, zzso testing, zzso E zzso zzso and zzso cortisol assessment (over 3 zzso with follow-up 6 months zzso zzso volume was measured by manual zzso that was blind to zzso Average area under the curve for zzso cortisol over the 3 days was zzso zzso function was assessed by using a combined memory zzso zzso 

zzso subjects showed multiple zzso in attention, working memory, visual memory, verbal memory, new learning, and executive function in relation to comparison zzso They had zzso zzso increase in area under the zzso and a reduction in right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso volume reduction was not associated with increased cortisol levels but was significantly correlated with continuing memory deficits at 6 zzso zzso zzso cognitive zzso was seen in 20 zzso of 49 subjects at 6 months and was associated with reduced zzso volume but not severity of depression, cortisol levels, or zzso zzso 

Older depressed subjects have zzso cognitive zzso associated with zzso volume reduction, but the results do not support zzso zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso studies are required to investigate the basis for zzso changes, while follow-up will determine whether zzso zzso is a risk factor for cognitive zzso
