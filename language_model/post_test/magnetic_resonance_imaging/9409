Although key to understanding individual variation in zzso brain zzso the genetic contribution to these individual differences remains largely zzso Here we report zzso genetic model fitting in a large sample of 319 healthy, young adult, human identical and fraternal twins zzso zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso who performed an zzso working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at a high magnetic field (4 zzso zzso of zzso brain response zzso signal difference of zzso minus zzso were significantly zzso with the highest estimates zzso in the inferior, middle, and superior frontal zzso left supplementary motor area, zzso and zzso zzso middle zzso cortex, superior zzso zzso angular zzso superior zzso zzso including zzso and superior zzso zzso Furthermore, high zzso reliability for a zzso of 40 twins indicates that zzso zzso in the zzso brain response is largely due to unique environmental influences rather than measurement zzso Individual variations in zzso of the working memory network are therefore significantly influenced by genetic zzso By establishing the zzso of cognitive brain function in a large sample that zzso good statistical power, and using zzso zzso this study provides the necessary evidence for zzso brain zzso to be considered as an zzso for psychiatric or neurological disorders, and represents a substantial new contribution to the field of zzso zzso These genetic brain maps should facilitate discovery of gene zzso influencing cognitive brain function through zzso association studies, potentially opening up new avenues in the treatment of brain zzso
