Our objective was to determine if CT or MR imaging findings could be used to accurately predict zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

CT and MR findings in 41 consecutive patients with zzso zzso who were referred to the zzso surgery clinic for zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso before zzso Review of zzso studies focused on local invasion of three separate zzso the zzso chest wall, and zzso zzso of all imaging examinations were carefully correlated with zzso zzso and microscopic zzso zzso 

After zzso and clinical zzso 34 patients zzso had zzso 24 of these had tumors that were zzso The sensitivity was high zzso zzso for both CT and MR in each zzso zzso however, was low, probably because of the small number of patients with zzso zzso 

CT and MR provided similar information on zzso in most zzso zzso was high for both zzso Because CT is more widely available and used, we suggest it as the initial study when determining zzso In difficult cases, important complementary zzso information can be derived from MR images obtained before surgical zzso
