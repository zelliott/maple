A zzso device zzso was developed for performing consistent magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the rat zzso The zzso was developed by adapting a zzso zzso head zzso of zzso zzso inner diameter zzso zzso head zzso and utilizing partial acrylic construction for the positioning zzso The small head zzso provides improved resolution and accuracy of the image, while the zzso holder permits zzso and accurate imaging of identified brain zzso This system provides several advantages over existing experimental zzso zzso The zzso ensures that the head is always placed in the center of the zzso in a uniform zzso zzso positioning of the skull zzso image quality and provides a consistent orientation of the zzso In addition, a zzso coordinate system described by zzso and Watson can be employed to assist in the identification of structures and to facilitate surgical zzso The zzso is compatible with a zzso zzso device for zzso with the zzso zzso thus permitting the planning and performance of experimental zzso using the same coordinate zzso The zzso also provides the ability to perform zzso and zzso at different times, thus avoiding the need for prolonged zzso during an experimental zzso Finally, the zzso allows repeated zzso of the same, identifiable positions in the brain during zzso experimental zzso The utility of this device is demonstrated here by examining the time course of cerebral damage that evolved within a zzso focus after gamma zzso
