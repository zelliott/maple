zzso zzso is an unusual zzso in zzso function due to a cerebral zzso which is zzso to that which would be zzso We report a case of crossed zzso due to a right zzso zzso in a left handed patient who had been obliged to be right zzso We discuss the peculiar zzso profile and possible relation of this to left zzso 

A 75 year old man, left handed but obliged to use the right hand, suffered an acute episode of zzso in the management of zzso zzso zzso medicine zzso although he maintained his usual social zzso and zzso On zzso examination no focal deficits were zzso On zzso he scored zzso on the Edinburgh questionnaire he scored 35 zzso handed zzso On a Barcelona zzso battery his scores were in the pathological range for zzso on understanding orders, carrying out symbolic gestures and imitating zzso in zzso super imposed images and visual zzso zzso showed a right zzso zzso zzso 

The patient showed clear bilateral zzso motor zzso which could not be zzso by zzso spatial zzso secondary to a right zzso zzso zzso It is usually considered that zzso and zzso zzso are due to left zzso zzso whilst zzso zzso and zzso related to dress are due to right zzso zzso In this case, there was zzso zzso secondary to a right zzso zzso that is to say a crossed zzso zzso without crossing of other zzso zzso This supports the theory of independence of zzso dominance for different cognitive zzso The frustrated left zzso of the patient might be related to the greater probability of unusual zzso dominance for zzso zzso function in this particular zzso
