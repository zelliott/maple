To determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can distinguish between human zzso virus zzso homosexual men with normal zzso test results and zzso homosexual men with abnormal zzso test zzso 

zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso examinations were performed on 10 zzso homosexual men without cognitive impairment and five zzso homosexual men with cognitive zzso 

Human zzso zzso homosexual men from New York City were recruited for the zzso 

zzso on zzso scans were evaluated zzso for focal zzso zzso of the cortical margin, white matter zzso and decreased global cortical zzso All zzso focal defects were zzso with magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and global cortical zzso were also measured zzso 

zzso with magnetic resonance imaging revealed that zzso of the focal zzso defects corresponded to brain zzso and 37% corresponded to zzso There was no significant difference in the frequency of qualitative or quantitative zzso abnormalities between zzso homosexual men zzso and without cognitive zzso However, after examining individual zzso test factors, impaired motor speed performance was associated with decreased quantitative global cerebral zzso 

zzso zzso abnormalities are not increased in frequency in zzso homosexual men with global cognitive impairment compared with those in zzso homosexual men without cognitive zzso zzso motor speed performance may be associated with decreased quantitative global cerebral zzso
