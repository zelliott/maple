In zzso imaging, zzso acquisitions are problematic due to zzso inconsistencies of the phase caused by motion during the zzso zzso A model for the zzso phase errors in zzso of the brain is zzso in which zzso and zzso motion are zzso In the model, it is assumed that zzso motion is due to cardiac zzso and that the motion patterns are zzso from zzso To test the zzso of this zzso the zzso of zzso zzso phase errors is zzso in three healthy zzso zzso zzso phase was found to significantly correlate zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso tested across all slices and zzso
