The purpose of this study was to compare midfield zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging with conventional zzso for assessment of zzso changes of the zzso zzso The material consisted of magnetic resonance images and zzso of 66 zzso zzso Each set of images was assessed for zzso changes without knowledge about patient symptoms or findings of the other imaging zzso The results showed that 30 zzso were normal both by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso 21 zzso showed zzso changes with both techniques, and there were discrepancies between the two techniques in 15 zzso In 12 of these 15 zzso magnetic resonance imaging was negative, but zzso showed zzso zzso In the other three zzso zzso was normal, but magnetic resonance imaging showed zzso zzso Based on previous zzso and midfield magnetic resonance imaging studies with correlation to zzso and dissection and the quality of the depiction of the zzso changes in these images, it was apparent that zzso represented a more accurate representation of the zzso zzso The results therefore suggest that conventional zzso is superior to midfield magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of zzso changes of the zzso zzso
