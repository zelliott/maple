zzso of structural brain change based on zzso MR imaging are increasingly important but can be zzso by intensity zzso This zzso can be more pronounced at higher field strengths, or when using zzso receiver zzso We assessed the ability of the zzso zzso intensity zzso zzso technique to correct zzso in 72 zzso brain MR scans from the zzso phase of the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso elderly subjects zzso were scanned on different zzso scanners with a zzso phased array receiver zzso at zzso using zzso prepared rapid zzso echo zzso and zzso zzso echo zzso pulse zzso and again 2 weeks zzso When applying zzso we used five brain masks of varying accuracy and four zzso smoothing distances zzso 100, 150 and 200 zzso to ascertain which combination of parameters zzso reduces the zzso We used the zzso white matter intensity zzso zzso zzso to ascertain zzso the correction for a single zzso we used the zzso of the zzso difference image to assess zzso the consistency of the correction over time from registered scan zzso Our results showed statistically significant zzso improvement in uniformity for individual scans and reduction in the zzso difference image zzso when using masks that identified distinct brain tissue classes, and when using smaller zzso smoothing distances zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso pulse zzso These zzso settings may assist future large-scale studies where zzso scanners and phased array receiver coils are used, such as zzso so that intensity zzso does not influence the power of MR imaging to detect disease progression and the factors that influence zzso
