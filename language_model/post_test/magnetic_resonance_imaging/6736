To examine the benefit of using higher field strengths for zzso zzso to detect changes in zzso zzso zzso following pharmacological zzso 

Renal zzso zzso primarily at zzso zzso has been shown to be useful for monitoring changes in zzso zzso zzso We performed the present studies on a zzso T scanner using a multiple zzso zzso sequence with a zzso array to acquire 16 zzso images within a single zzso Data were obtained before and after administration of zzso (20 zzso zzso 

The baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso T was zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso at zzso T was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso 

Higher magnetic field strength is beneficial for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contrast on the zzso map was significantly improved at zzso zzso with no evidence of increased bulk zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso T were both significantly higher compared to our previously reported data obtained at zzso zzso
