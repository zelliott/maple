To assess the risk of zzso heating in zzso and abandoned leads using in zzso temperature zzso at zzso zzso as a function of lead zzso 

Five custom lead zzso zzso zzso were exposed to a uniform magnitude and phase zzso electric field to examine the effect of lead length on zzso lead tip heating for zzso and abandoned zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso leads show resonant heating behavior and maximum heating occurs at different lead lengths due to the differences in termination zzso For clinical lead lengths zzso zzso abandoned leads exhibited greater lead tip heating compared with zzso zzso 

Current recommendations for zzso zzso safety should highlight the possible increased risk for patients with abandoned leads as compared to zzso zzso
