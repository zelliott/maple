zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso images of rat brain taken through the zzso skull were measured using zzso fringe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a period of 10 zzso for total measurement time of 210 zzso stopping blood flow due to cardiac arrest, in order to investigate the potential of zzso to monitor tissue viability in zzso First, spatial resolution degradation was evaluated with zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate that the zzso resolution was 390 zzso at a thickness of 1000 zzso After cardiac arrest, the signal intensity in depth profiles increased zzso times compared with that before cardiac zzso The ratio of signal intensity after euthanasia with an injection of zzso sodium salt to that before sharply increased for 20 zzso with stationary values of 2 to 4 zzso The trends of time variations of each position were zzso However, each stationary value depended on the zzso zzso
