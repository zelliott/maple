Evidence is increasing for involvement of the zzso system in cognitive functions including attention and executive function, as well as in psychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive deficits, such as zzso Executive function appears to be associated with both zzso of active networks and zzso of activity in the default mode zzso In the present study, we examined the role of the zzso system in executive function, focusing on both the associated brain network and the default mode zzso A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was conducted with a zzso zzso design, investigating effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on executive function in 20 healthy volunteers, using a continuous performance task with identical zzso Task performance was impaired after zzso administration, reflected in both an increase in false alarms and a reduction in detected zzso This was associated with reduced zzso in a set of brain regions linked to the default mode network, including zzso zzso zzso and angular zzso Less zzso was significantly correlated with lower performance after zzso zzso that were activated by the continuous performance task, notably bilateral prefrontal and zzso cortex, did not show effects of zzso These findings suggest an important role for the zzso system in both default mode zzso and executive zzso This may be relevant for psychiatric disorders associated with executive function deficits, such as schizophrenia and zzso
