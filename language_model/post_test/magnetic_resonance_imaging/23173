zzso mechanisms underlying word processing have been extensively zzso It has been revealed that when individuals are engaged in active word processing, a complex network of cortical regions is zzso However, it is entirely unknown whether the word-processing regions are zzso organized without any explicit processing tasks during the resting zzso The present study investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity between word-processing regions during the resting state with the use of zzso zzso The zzso fluctuations were observed between the left middle zzso zzso and a number of cortical zzso They included the left angular zzso left zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and left zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso which have been implicated in zzso and semantic zzso Additionally, the zzso were also observed in the bilateral superior zzso zzso and zzso lateral prefrontal cortex, which have been suggested to provide zzso monitoring on the zzso processing of zzso The findings of our study indicate an zzso organized network during the resting state that likely prepares the visual system to anticipate the highly probable word input for ready and effective zzso
