The degree to which the zzso system contributes to effective language skills is not well zzso We sought to determine if the zzso plays a role in zzso decoding in healthy, normal skilled zzso The experiment follows from the implications of the zzso model of zzso zzso which provides distinct predictions about the nature of zzso zzso The paradigm zzso word zzso and zzso spelled zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimuli that differed in their demand for zzso as opposed zzso zzso The data clearly showed that the zzso system was not involved in single word decoding in zzso native English zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso system as a whole showed significant zzso during zzso or zzso based zzso The results provide evidence that zzso and zzso decoding are implemented by distinct but overlapping zzso zzso zzso decoding appeared most uniquely associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso biased toward the left zzso In contrast, zzso decoding appeared associated with right middle frontal and zzso and bilateral zzso zzso Both these decoding operations appeared in the context of a shared widespread network of zzso including bilateral zzso zzso and superior frontal zzso These zzso suggest that the absence of zzso involvement in either zzso or zzso decoding appears likely a function of the skilled reading ability of our sample such that zzso recognition and retrieval processes do not zzso the zzso memory system, in the case of zzso zzso and require only minimal analysis and zzso of the phonetic elements of a word, in the case of zzso zzso
