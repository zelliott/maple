Our purpose was to evaluate zzso whether MR imaging, including dynamic zzso MR imaging, could be used to categorize peripheral vascular zzso and especially to identify zzso zzso that do not need zzso for zzso 

In this blinded prospective study, two observers independently correlated MR imaging findings of 27 patients having peripheral vascular zzso with those of diagnostic zzso and additional zzso MR diagnosis of the category, based on a combination of conventional and dynamic zzso MR zzso was compared with the zzso diagnosis using gamma zzso zzso and specificity of conventional MR imaging and dynamic zzso MR imaging in zzso zzso from zzso zzso were zzso 

Excellent agreement between the two observers in determining MR categories zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between MR categories and zzso categories was high for both observers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of conventional MR imaging in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso whereas specificity was zzso zzso increased to zzso by adding dynamic zzso MR imaging, but sensitivity decreased to zzso 

Conventional and dynamic zzso MR parameters can be used in combination to categorize vascular zzso Dynamic zzso MR imaging allows diagnosis of zzso zzso with high zzso
