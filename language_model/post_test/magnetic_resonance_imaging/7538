We evaluated the zzso zzso zzso imaging features of early zzso zzso zzso and compared these findings with those obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 52 early zzso with a mean zzso diameter of zzso were enrolled in this retrospective zzso After confirming the location of the target zzso using fusion imaging combining conventional US and zzso phase of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso acid, we evaluated findings of zzso US using a zzso contrast zzso The zzso US detection rates for zzso in early zzso were compared with those obtained for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso subsequent to zzso during zzso phase and zzso during portal and zzso zzso were the zzso zzso US findings seen for 25 zzso of the 52 early zzso Nine zzso showed zzso during all three zzso while 1 zzso showed zzso during all three zzso The remaining 17 zzso showed partial or whole zzso during zzso phase, zzso during portal phase, and zzso or zzso during zzso zzso The detection rate for the zzso of early zzso using zzso US zzso zzso was significantly higher than that obtained using zzso CT zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were observed during the zzso phase of zzso US in zzso zzso and zzso of the early zzso zzso zzso US was more sensitive than zzso CT for the detection of zzso in early zzso Of note, early zzso might not exhibit the early zzso enhancement that is generally considered to be a typical finding for zzso
