There is a need for direct imaging of effects on tumor zzso in assessment of response to zzso drugs and vascular zzso zzso Imaging tumor zzso depends on differences in zzso of zzso of tumor and normal zzso which cause changes in penetration of contrast zzso zzso imaging may be defined in terms of measurement of tumor zzso and direct imaging of the molecules involved in zzso In addition, assessment of tumor zzso will give an indication of tumor zzso The range of imaging techniques available for these processes includes zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso
