The relationship between the number of cortical zzso observed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the severity of cerebral dysfunction of zzso sclerosis patients has been examined in a zzso of the published zzso The literature review has identified five independent studies for examining the zzso These studies consistently reveal that the cortical zzso count detected on zzso scans is increased among those with more severe cerebral zzso zzso of the cerebral dysfunction is measured by the seizure status and its control and by the zzso status and the level of mental zzso zzso demonstrates that within a study population, the zzso cortical zzso count is six times more likely to be above the median count for zzso sclerosis patients with severe cerebral dysfunction zzso seizure control or zzso zzso or zzso than more mildly affected zzso sclerosis zzso Similarly, across studies, moderately to severely affected patients are five times more likely to have greater than seven zzso cortical zzso than those more mildly zzso These associations are both statistically significant and zzso The cortical zzso count is a zzso that reasonably predicts the severity of cerebral dysfunction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sclerosis form in the early zzso zzso The zzso disruption determining the clinical severity of the cortical dysfunction of zzso sclerosis is set in the early zzso zzso
