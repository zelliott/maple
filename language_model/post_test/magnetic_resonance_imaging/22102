To compare results with the following magnetic resonance zzso imaging sequences in the detection of focal zzso zzso fast zzso zzso before and after administration of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso SE, and dynamic zzso fast zzso shot zzso 

In 26 patients with known zzso and documented focal liver zzso zzso MR imaging was performed prior to zzso zzso All images were reviewed independently by four blinded zzso zzso was calculated for each sequence and for each observer by means of zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

The mean area under the zzso zzso curve with zzso fast zzso zzso was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso than that with all other zzso zzso was significantly improved with zzso fast zzso compared with dynamic zzso zzso (which was the best of the other three zzso for all zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with the zzso fast zzso sequence improved detection of focal liver zzso and had the highest diagnostic zzso
