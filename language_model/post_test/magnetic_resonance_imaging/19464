We present zzso evidence demonstrating that the binding of form elements into shapes zzso from the binding of surface detail to zzso Data are reported from a patient with bilateral zzso zzso zzso who zzso zzso visual extinction along with many zzso zzso when asked to discriminate both surface and form information about zzso We show that there are effects of grouping on both extinction and zzso zzso when the tasks require report of object zzso In contrast, zzso zzso involving surface and form information were unaffected by grouping based on zzso In addition, grouping was stronger when forms were presented within the same zzso than when they appeared in different zzso whilst zzso zzso of form and zzso occurred equally often within and across zzso These results support a zzso account of visual zzso form elements are first bound together locally into shapes, and this is followed by a second stage of binding in which shapes are integrated with surface zzso The second but not the first stage of binding is impaired in this zzso
