zzso to visual objects while ignoring information from other zzso is necessary for performing difficult visual zzso but it is unclear how selecting between sensory zzso alters processing within the visual zzso We used an zzso zzso selective attention paradigm with zzso to study the effects of visual attention on cortical activity in the absence of competitive interactions between multiple visual zzso Complex stimuli zzso and zzso activated higher visual areas even in the absence of visual zzso These zzso zzso zzso covered zzso zzso cortex, extended zzso to the anterior zzso zzso and zzso to include multiple distinct zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Attention amplified the baseline response in zzso zzso regions and altered activity in different ways in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The majority of the zzso was strongly and exclusively activated by visual attention: zzso zzso zzso zzso and spread well beyond the focal zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso only a small subset of the regions activated by unattended stimuli showed zzso zzso zzso was also zzso we found a distinct zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso that was activated exclusively by attention, showing neither zzso nor any significant stimulus zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso suggest that these regions play critical roles in zzso visual zzso
