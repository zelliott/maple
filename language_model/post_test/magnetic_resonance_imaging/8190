There is abundant evidence from clinical and zzso studies that acute administration of nicotine has beneficial effects on zzso network function in the zzso In contrast, little is known about potentially zzso effects on the zzso network during zzso critical zzso such as during adolescence and early zzso 

Using zzso functional zzso zzso we investigated prefrontal zzso network function in young adults zzso regular smokers and zzso zzso age: zzso zzso zzso of smoking was zzso years zzso of zzso Smokers were allowed to smoke ad zzso before the zzso scanning was zzso 

As expected from literature, prefrontal zzso network activity was significantly reduced in smokers compared to nonsmokers zzso zzso In smokers, we found that the history of smoking duration zzso is directly related to the extent of diminished zzso network activity zzso zzso 

To our best knowledge, the relationship between the duration of smoking history and prefrontal zzso network function has not yet been zzso This finding might suggest that several years of chronic nicotine abuse may be sufficient to exert long-lasting effects on the brain function of adolescents and young zzso
