zzso malaria is the most severe complication of zzso zzso infection, accounting for 1 million deaths per zzso We characterized the zzso disease using in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso proving that zzso zzso is responsible for zzso The aim of the present study was to identify early markers of experimental cerebral malaria using very high field conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso mice infected with zzso zzso zzso were observed at an early stage of the disease, before the onset of zzso brain swelling and at the most acute stage of cerebral zzso zzso we report the first detection of damage to the zzso and zzso nerves on zzso zzso The zzso nerves appeared zzso with significantly reduced diameter and zzso zzso The zzso nerves were zzso and often not zzso In addition, the zzso distance between the zzso nerves was significantly and progressively reduced between the early and zzso zzso zzso nerve injury was the earliest zzso hallmark of the disease, visible before brain zzso became zzso Thus, zzso nerve damage may manifest in zzso signs, which may assist in the early recognition of cerebral zzso
