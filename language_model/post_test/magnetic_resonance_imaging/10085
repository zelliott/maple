Little is known about how visceral zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso influence zzso lipids zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships of visceral zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso lipids in circulating zzso 

A zzso of 46 men zzso zzso 20, aged zzso zzso and women zzso zzso 26, aged zzso zzso were recruited from an ongoing population study at our zzso zzso variables including weight, zzso and waist circumference were measured using standard procedures, and body mass index was calculated zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso was measured with magnetic resonance zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso and insulin were measured after an overnight zzso 

The men had a significantly higher waist zzso zzso and zzso ratio, while the women had a significantly higher zzso and zzso In particular, this is the first study to report that zzso and zzso were independent zzso in determining plasma zzso zzso 

The relations of plasma zzso concentration with zzso and zzso suggest that information on zzso and zzso in zzso zzso may provide additional information on the zzso zzso zzso
