zzso has been used in zzso cancer treatments, and in randomized, controlled studies, zzso is an effective cancer zzso For clinical accuracy and safety, however, temperature monitoring during treatment is zzso We aimed to develop a convenient zzso zzso system combined with zzso resolved real-time temperature monitoring to improve its efficacy and zzso 

Using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thigh muscles of zzso and subcutaneous zzso tumors of rabbit were heated in combination with zzso MR temperature zzso For MR temperature zzso a zzso resonance frequency method was zzso After determination of temperature zzso and evaluation of the precision in MR zzso distribution of zzso heating over time was examined for each zzso 

The temperature zzso of zzso rabbit muscles, and zzso tumors were zzso zzso and zzso zzso degrees C, zzso The zzso limits of agreement of MR and zzso zzso in the three subjects were zzso degrees C, zzso degrees C, and zzso degrees C, zzso zzso zzso zzso the average tumor temperature was zzso zzso zzso degrees C and the surface of skin was zzso zzso zzso degrees C in the zzso experimental zzso 

With this zzso zzso zzso system, effective zzso was accomplished in zzso and living animals in combination with MR temperature zzso
