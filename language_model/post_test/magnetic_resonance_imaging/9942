zzso activities of daily living zzso impairment in Alzheimer's disease has been associated with global zzso deposition in zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso impairment is associated with increased cortical Pittsburgh zzso B zzso zzso 

Fifty-five subjects (19 normal older controls, NC, and 36 with mild cognitive zzso zzso underwent clinical assessments and dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A linear multiple zzso model showed that greater zzso impairment was associated with greater global zzso retention in all subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and in zzso subjects only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in NC subjects zzso 

These results suggest that daily functional impairment is related to greater zzso burden in zzso
