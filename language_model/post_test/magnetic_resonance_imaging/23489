This study explored the correspondence between implicit memory and the zzso of zzso brain zzso By using a zzso method, we examined whether zzso reflects only the similarities between study and test or zzso at the zzso regions are diagnostic of zzso in the implicit memory zzso A simple detection task served as incidental zzso of zzso zzso A subsequent visual search task served as the indirect zzso test of zzso zzso did not know that their memory would be zzso Half of the subjects were unaware that some stimuli in the search task are the same as those that had appeared during the detection zzso Another group of subjects was made aware of this relationship at the onset of the visual search zzso Memory performance was superior for the zzso aware, compared to zzso unaware, zzso Brain zzso was calculated using a conjunction analysis implemented through zzso the neural activity at zzso and zzso The conjunction analysis revealed that implicit memory in both groups of subjects was associated with zzso of zzso and zzso brain zzso We were able to zzso zzso aware and zzso unaware subjects based on the zzso zzso values representing the neural dynamics between zzso and zzso The zzso results indicate that neural dynamics between zzso and test accounts for the differences in implicit zzso Overall, our study demonstrates that implicit memory performance requires and depends upon zzso of zzso brain zzso
