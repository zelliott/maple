zzso resonance imaging was used to assess prefrontal brain structure in 17 zzso 18 psychiatric control, and 19 normal control subjects of comparable age, social background, and educational status, while three zzso measures were used to assess prefrontal zzso zzso patients had significantly smaller prefrontal areas than both psychiatric control and normal control subjects in all three zzso When zzso brain area and zzso lobe were entered into statistical analysis as zzso they did not explain the prefrontal zzso zzso patients made more zzso errors on the Wisconsin zzso zzso Task and had fewer correct responses on the zzso Delayed Response Task than normal control zzso zzso patients performed more poorly than psychiatric control subjects on the Block Design zzso No group differences were found on three other zzso zzso These data lend some support to the role of prefrontal deficits in the development of zzso
