Two different zzso pattern recognition methods are used to segment magnetic resonance images zzso of the brain for quantitative zzso of tumor volume and volume changes with zzso A supervised zzso neighbor zzso rule and a zzso fuzzy zzso zzso method are used to segment zzso slice zzso zzso volumes as determined by the zzso and zzso zzso methods are compared with two reference methods, based on image zzso scale, as a basis for an zzso of ground truth, zzso zzso a commonly used seed growing method that is applied to the contrast enhanced zzso image, and zzso a manual zzso method using a zzso zzso user interface applied to the same raw image zzso zzso zzso is placed on measurement of zzso and zzso observer zzso using the proposed zzso zzso and zzso variation for the zzso method was zzso and zzso zzso The results for the zzso method was a little better at zzso and zzso zzso For the seed growing method, the zzso variation was zzso and the zzso variation was zzso significantly larger when compared with the zzso zzso The absolute tumor volume determined by the zzso zzso methods was consistently smaller than that observed for the reference zzso The results of this study are found to be very patient zzso The results for zzso suggest that it should be useful for relative zzso of tumor volume during therapy, but further studies are zzso This work demonstrates the need for minimally supervised or zzso methods for tumor volume zzso
