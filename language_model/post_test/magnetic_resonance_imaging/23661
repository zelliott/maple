The nature of the signal zzso observed in the zzso intervals in zzso studies using a block paradigm consisting of alternating periods of visual stimulation and rest was investigated using the following single shot zzso zzso zzso echo zzso spin echo zzso spin echo with additional flow zzso zzso and inversion recovery zzso prepared zzso Both the zzso and zzso sequences showed a significant signal zzso during the zzso zzso zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were measured in the stimulation and zzso zzso respectively, with the latter being lower than that which would be consistent with a pure zzso effect arising from an elevated zzso blood volume and a normal zzso content zzso The addition of zzso zzso to the zzso sequence in order to zzso the signal from spins flowing within larger vessels produced a zzso reduction in the number of activated zzso but had little effect on the time intensity zzso Our interpretation of these results is that both zzso and zzso zzso effects are present in the zzso intervals and the lack of any effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso profile indicates that the zzso component probably occurs mainly in smaller vessels, such as zzso which are affected relatively little by the relatively weak zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso used in this zzso For the zzso sequence the zzso measured during the zzso intervals was similar to that seen with the zzso zzso sequence and thus was consistent with a residual zzso effect, zzso that zzso changes in the zzso vessels did not contribute significantly to the signal zzso
