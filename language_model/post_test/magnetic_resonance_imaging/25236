In zzso zzso in the superior zzso lobe zzso 5) code for spatial position of zzso body parts by combining visual and zzso zzso Using a modified version of the classical mental rotation task, we were able to demonstrate that in humans zzso in the zzso superior zzso lobe could be evoked when mental rotation was combined with motor imagery of zzso These findings show that even in the absence of visual and zzso zzso information provided by motor imagery zzso to induce zzso superior zzso lobe monitoring of the imagined limb zzso This constitutes an important prerequisite for effective imagined motor practice that can be used to improve actual motor zzso
