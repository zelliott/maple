Three cortical areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Place Area zzso respond selectively to zzso However, their wider role in spatial zzso and their functional connectivity remain zzso Using zzso first we tested the responses of these areas during spatial comparison tasks using dot targets on white zzso zzso increased during task performance in both zzso and zzso but not in zzso However, the zzso of zzso activity and behavioral measures of task demand were correlated only in zzso A control experiment showed that none of these areas were activated during a comparable shape comparison zzso zzso we analyzed functional connectivity of these areas during the resting zzso zzso revealed a significant connection between zzso and frontal association areas zzso to be involved in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso showed functional connections zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso not with zzso and/or frontal association zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso showed zzso functional connections with the zzso and zzso parts of zzso zzso These results suggest two parallel pathways for spatial zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso network was involved in active spatial zzso
