Conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging using blood zzso level dependent contrast requires signal averaging and statistical methods to detect zzso Signal averaging implicitly assumes that brain zzso in response to a stimulus is zzso on the scale of the imaging zzso This assumption is examined in the absence of averaging by analyzing individual trials of individual zzso that approach the size of the functional unit, the cortical column, in the human primary visual zzso In the absence of spatial and zzso zzso even highly active zzso demonstrate inconsistent zzso to the same repeated stimulus despite consistent behavioral zzso This observation implies a variable selection of suitable cortical columns from a population of available functional units to produce consistent perception of the zzso The implication of this observation for zzso and behavioral consistency at the level of functional units is zzso
