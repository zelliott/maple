The purpose of this study was to compare the muscle zzso response in women during both the zzso zzso and the zzso phase zzso of their zzso cycles following zzso zzso resistance training combined with blood flow restriction zzso Eight zzso women and five men, all previously zzso performed unilateral zzso zzso of 1 repetition zzso zzso zzso training with zzso once a day for 6 zzso The opposite arm served as an untrained zzso This zzso training zzso was conducted during both zzso cycle zzso the early zzso and the mid zzso zzso biceps muscle volume zzso and zzso elbow zzso strength were measured in both arms before and 2 days after the final training zzso zzso zzso greater muscle zzso was observed in the LP zzso than in the zzso zzso The absolute and relative changes in serum hormone zzso between the two zzso did not correlate zzso with the percentage change in zzso between the LP and zzso There was no change in zzso in the control arm for both cycle zzso Following training, zzso strength increased zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative strength zzso per unit zzso was similar zzso and zzso in both zzso The percentage changes in zzso and strength were similar between the women zzso of LP and zzso and zzso Our results indicate that muscle zzso and strength gain are higher in the LP than in the zzso following 6 days of zzso training, although the sex difference in the training response is zzso
