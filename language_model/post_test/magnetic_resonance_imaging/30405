To zzso determine if zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings are zzso of outcome in patients who undergo zzso radiation therapy for prostate zzso 

Committee on Human Research approval, with waiver of the requirement for informed zzso was obtained for this zzso zzso Eighty men with zzso prostate cancer zzso age, 59 years; range, zzso zzso who underwent zzso MR imaging of the prostate prior to zzso radiation therapy were zzso zzso details of baseline tumor zzso treatment, and outcome were zzso Two experienced readers independently reviewed all MR imaging studies and recorded tumor T stage and the zzso diameter of zzso extension (if zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cox zzso analyses were used to investigate the relationship between baseline imaging and clinical zzso variables and the end point of zzso zzso 

At MR imaging, readers 1 and 2, respectively, considered 50 and 60 patients to have zzso or zzso disease zzso zzso disease) and 30 and 20 patients to have zzso zzso After a mean follow-up of 43 months, four patients developed zzso zzso Cox analysis revealed that baseline serum zzso zzso level, presence of zzso extension at MR imaging zzso to either zzso and degree of zzso extension zzso to either zzso were all significantly zzso zzso zzso related to the development of zzso zzso Cox analysis revealed that the sole independent zzso variable was mean diameter of zzso extension zzso hazard ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In particular, three of five patients with zzso extension of more than 5 zzso at zzso MR imaging developed zzso 24, 43, and 63 months after zzso 

The presence and degree of zzso extension at MR imaging prior to zzso radiation therapy are important zzso of zzso zzso zzso
