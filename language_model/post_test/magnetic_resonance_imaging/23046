During speech communication, visual information may interact with the auditory system at various processing zzso Most zzso recent zzso zzso data provided first evidence for early and zzso zzso zzso of the visual data zzso to its fusion with auditory zzso features zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso Time course of early audiovisual interactions during speech and zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso Journal of zzso zzso 21, zzso zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present follow-up study aims to further zzso the zzso distribution of zzso operations and audiovisual zzso interactions during speech zzso zzso acoustic zzso to zzso or zzso by the visual channel zzso zzso as test materials, zzso with various control conditions zzso zzso signals, zzso and zzso speech, and zzso zzso zzso Visual speech yielded an zzso zzso of primary auditory zzso and the anterior superior zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso responded both to speech and zzso zzso zzso The inferior frontal and the zzso zzso of the right zzso showed a strong zzso impact zzso effects of visual zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso during presentation of speaking zzso Taken together with the previous zzso data, these results point at a zzso model of visual speech information zzso On the one hand, access to the auditory system via the anterior zzso zzso path may give rise to direct zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, visual speech information seems to be represented in a zzso visual working memory, providing a potential basis for later interactions with auditory information such as the zzso zzso
