The current optimal imaging protocol in spinal zzso MR imaging in patients with multiple sclerosis includes a long zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso requiring long acquisition zzso Using short zzso inversion recovery fast zzso zzso zzso sequences both acquisition time can be shortened and sensitivity in the detection of multiple sclerosis zzso abnormalities can be zzso This study compares both sequences for the potential to detect both focal and diffuse spinal zzso Spinal cords of 5 volunteers and 20 zzso patients were studied at zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging included zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso fast STIR zzso Images were scored regarding number, size, and location of focal zzso diffuse abnormalities and zzso of artifacts by two experienced zzso zzso were scored as being definitely normal, zzso or definitely zzso zzso agreement regarding focal zzso was higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso than for fast STIR zzso zzso zzso but did not differ zzso Of all focal zzso scored in consensus, zzso were scored on both zzso zzso were only detected by fast zzso and zzso only by zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement for diffuse abnormalities was lower with fast STIR zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After consensus, fast STIR showed in 10 patients diffuse abnormalities and zzso zzso in zzso After consensus, in 19 of 20 patients zzso zzso scans were considered as definitely abnormal compared with 17 for fast zzso The fast STIR sequence is a useful adjunct to zzso zzso in detecting focal abnormalities and is helpful in detecting diffuse zzso abnormalities in the spinal zzso Due to the frequent occurrence of artifacts and the lower observer zzso fast STIR cannot be used zzso
