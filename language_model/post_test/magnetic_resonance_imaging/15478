Prior studies identify two cortical areas, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortex, that zzso activate to images of real-world scenes compared to images of other meaningful visual stimuli such as objects and zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that zzso of real-world scenes differ in their visual and semantic zzso It is presently unknown whether the cortical areas that have been implicated in scene analysis similarly activate zzso to zzso relevant scene zzso To examine this issue, we directly compared cortical zzso to indoor and outdoor scenes in an zzso study with a large number of zzso images in each zzso zzso in zzso zzso cortex, including zzso place area, was significantly greater for indoor than outdoor zzso In contrast, no such difference was observed in zzso cortex, though this region zzso activated to scenes over zzso These findings suggest differences in function in these two zzso The results are consistent with the view that zzso zzso zzso is functional in processing local zzso
