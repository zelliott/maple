Our laboratory and others have reported the ability to detect individual Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso plaques in transgenic mouse brain in zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Since zzso plaques contain iron, most zzso studies attempting to detect plaques in zzso transgenic mouse brain have employed techniques that exploit the zzso effect of iron and have had mixed zzso In the present study, using zzso zzso spatial zzso of MR images with three different zzso techniques, properties of zzso plaques in zzso transgenic mouse brain were revealed that may explain their variable visibility in zzso and zzso MR zzso The results demonstrate differences in the visibility of plaques in the zzso and zzso compared to plaques in the thalamus, by the different zzso zzso All plaques were equally zzso by zzso while only zzso plaques were reliably zzso by zzso pulse zzso zzso revealed that zzso plaques have low levels of iron while zzso plaques have very high zzso However, the zzso effect of iron does not appear to be the sole factor leading to the rapid zzso of zzso zzso (short zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso methods that rely less on iron magnetic zzso effect may be more successful for eventual human zzso plaque MR imaging, particularly since human zzso plaques more closely resemble the cortical and zzso plaques of zzso transgenic mice than zzso zzso
