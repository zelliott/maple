We have discovered two zzso zzso and zzso associated with schizophrenia and in an independent study provided additional support for this zzso We have both discovered and verified the association of two zzso zzso and zzso with zzso We combined a zzso screening strategy with zzso measures as the quantitative zzso and identified the single zzso zzso zzso related to these genes as consistently associated with the zzso zzso To control for the risk of false zzso the empirical zzso for association significance was calculated using zzso zzso The quantitative zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the left zzso lateral prefrontal zzso measured during a working memory zzso The differential distribution of zzso associated with these two genes in cases and controls was then zzso in a larger, independent sample of patients with schizophrenia zzso and healthy controls zzso thus suggesting a putative zzso function for both genes in zzso Up until now these genes have not been linked to any zzso illness, although both genes have a function in prenatal brain zzso We introduce the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a quantitative zzso in conjunction with zzso association as a gene discovery zzso
