To zzso the pattern of zzso dissemination in the zzso space from zzso zzso 

Among zzso patients treated for zzso cancer between 1986 and 2001, zzso zzso was diagnosed in three patients, previously treated for zzso zzso zzso 

All three patients have been treated by surgical zzso through lateral cervical zzso Two of them were controlled regionally whereas the remaining one had a zzso zzso zzso locally zzso 27 months after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is rare, but should be a recognized pattern of zzso dissemination from zzso zzso to avoid unnecessary zzso and because surgical zzso is zzso with acceptable zzso
