zzso I zzso accompanied by zzso zzso anomaly of the zzso zzso is comparatively zzso We report a case of zzso I zzso accompanied by zzso of the atlas, zzso syndrome, and zzso 

The patient was a zzso woman demonstrating zzso of the zzso sensory zzso muscular zzso and zzso zzso X-ray images and CT scans demonstrated zzso of the zzso to the zzso bone, C2 and zzso fusion, abnormal passage of the zzso zzso and an anomalous zzso mass on the right lateral mass of the zzso protruding into the spinal zzso The zzso process was also deviated to the zzso zzso resonance images demonstrated bilateral descent of the zzso zzso and zzso extending from zzso to zzso zzso zzso scans with the head rotated to the right demonstrated increased narrowing of the zzso column caused by the right lateral mass of the atlas, and MR images confirmed exaggerated deformation of the spinal zzso at the same zzso This deformation zzso no zzso symptoms, and we therefore performed zzso zzso zzso and zzso using Gore-Tex zzso Gore & Associates, zzso Flagstaff, zzso In the early zzso period, zzso symptoms zzso 

We believe it is important that a treatment plan for zzso I zzso accompanied by zzso anomaly of the zzso junction be determined based on zzso investigation of the region supplemented by dynamic zzso evaluation of instability, or a careful inspection for zzso passage of the zzso zzso a frequent site of zzso
