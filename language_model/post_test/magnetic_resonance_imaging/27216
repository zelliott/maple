To identify vascular mechanisms of brain zzso in type 1 diabetes zzso zzso patients by investigating the relationship between brain volumes and cerebral zzso and zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Approval from the local institutional review board was zzso and patients gave informed zzso Fifty-one type 1 zzso patients (30 zzso mean age 44 zzso 11 years; mean zzso duration 23 zzso 12 zzso and 34 zzso and zzso healthy control subjects were zzso zzso zzso criteria comprised hypertension, stroke, zzso disease, and standard zzso zzso White matter zzso and gray matter zzso brain volumes, total cerebral blood flow zzso total brain zzso and zzso pulse wave zzso zzso were assessed using zzso zzso linear zzso analysis was used for statistics, with zzso age, sex, mean zzso pressure, zzso smoking, heart rate, zzso zzso and zzso 

Both zzso and zzso brain volumes were decreased in type 1 zzso patients compared with control subjects zzso P zzso zzso respective zzso P zzso zzso Total brain zzso was increased in type 1 zzso compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Total zzso and zzso zzso predicted zzso brain volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso respective zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso zzso in type 1 zzso Age was the independent predictor of zzso brain volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Type 1 zzso patients without hypertension showed zzso and zzso volume loss compared with control subjects zzso with a relative increased brain zzso Total zzso and zzso of the zzso independently predicted zzso brain zzso in type 1 zzso Only age predicted zzso brain zzso
