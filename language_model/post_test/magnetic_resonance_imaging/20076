The Institutional Review Board approved this zzso study, and each patient gave written informed zzso Thirty-nine consecutive patients (19 male, 20 zzso mean age, zzso zzso referred for functional MR imaging for possible tumor zzso were zzso zzso A zzso diagnosis of brain tumor was made in all zzso zzso completion and bilateral hand squeeze tasks were used to map language and sensory motor zzso zzso completed questionnaires regarding the proposed treatment plan before and after functional MR imaging and after zzso They also gave confidence ratings for functional MR imaging results and estimated the effect on surgical time, extent of zzso and surgical zzso The effect of functional MR imaging on changes in treatment plan was assessed with the zzso signed rank zzso zzso in confidence ratings between altered and zzso treatment plans were assessed with the zzso U zzso The estimated influence of functional MR imaging on surgical time, extent of zzso and surgical approach was zzso with summary zzso 

Treatment plans before and after functional MR imaging differed in 19 patients zzso zzso zzso with a more aggressive approach recommended after imaging in 18 zzso There were no significant differences in confidence ratings for functional MR imaging between altered and zzso zzso zzso MR imaging resulted in reduced surgical time zzso reduction, zzso minutes) in 22 patients who underwent surgery, a more aggressive zzso in six, and a smaller zzso in zzso 

zzso MR imaging enables the selection of a more aggressive therapeutic approach than might otherwise be considered because of functional zzso In certain patients, surgical time may be zzso the extent of zzso increased, and zzso size zzso
