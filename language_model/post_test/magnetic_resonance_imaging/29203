The zzso of zzso for the treatment of Parkinson's disease zzso has generated various opinions regarding the ideal zzso or zzso location of the target within the zzso zzso The role of zzso recording guidance in zzso for the treatment of advanced zzso is presently under zzso The purpose of this study was zzso The first goal was to determine the degree of accuracy in the targeting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso by comparing these results with the final placement of the zzso zzso (as defined by zzso zzso The second goal was to ascertain the zzso arrangement of the zzso in zzso 

The analysis involved 50 patients with zzso who underwent zzso zzso The theoretical coordinates for zzso were calculated after definition of the zzso line by zzso The actual placement of the zzso was determined after mapping of the zzso by zzso using stimulation to identify the zzso region and its zzso zzso 

In most cases, the zzso were placed zzso and lateral to the targets chosen by zzso zzso by zzso revealed differences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The actual zzso overlapped the theoretical target for only zzso of the zzso The zzso organization of the zzso was zzso Most of the units with zzso activity or zzso activity were in the lateral portion of the zzso Upper limb and zzso units were in the most lateral region and mainly in the zzso one-third of the zzso Lower limb responses were recorded mainly in the zzso one-third of the zzso zzso cells were found throughout the zzso region of the zzso 

These results indicate that zzso targeting based on zzso alone is not sufficiently accurate to guarantee placement of the zzso in the zzso region of the zzso
