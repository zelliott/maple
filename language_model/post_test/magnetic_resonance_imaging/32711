zzso deficits in persons with Parkinson's disease zzso have been identified as a contributor to zzso However, there is little research that examines the effect of resistance training on muscle size, muscle force production, and mobility in persons with zzso The purpose of this exploratory study was to zzso in persons with zzso the changes in zzso muscle volume, muscle force production, and mobility as a result of a zzso zzso eccentric resistance training program and to compare the effects to a zzso zzso zzso individuals with idiopathic zzso were recruited and zzso to zzso zzso assignment for age and disease severity resulted in 10 participants in the eccentric group and 9 participants in the control zzso All participants were tested prior to and following a zzso intervention period with testing and training conducted at standardized times in their medication zzso The eccentric group performed zzso zzso zzso on an eccentric zzso 3 days a week for 12 zzso The zzso group exercise program zzso standard exercise management of zzso The outcome variables were zzso muscle volume, muscle force, and mobility measures zzso walk, stair zzso zzso Each outcome variable was tested using separate one-way analyses of zzso on the difference zzso Muscle volume, muscle force, and functional status improvements occurred in persons with zzso as a result of zzso eccentric resistance zzso The eccentric group demonstrated significantly greater difference scores for muscle structure, stair zzso and zzso walk zzso zzso zzso zzso of effect size zzso for the eccentric group consistently exceeded those in the zzso group for all zzso To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to investigate and demonstrate the effects of eccentric resistance training on muscle zzso strength, and mobility in persons with zzso Additional research is needed to determine the anatomical and neurological mechanisms of the observed strength gains and mobility zzso
