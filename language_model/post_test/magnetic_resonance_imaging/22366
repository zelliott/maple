To determine how zzso zzso distribution is zzso with the distribution of zzso areas in the human brain, zzso male healthy volunteers underwent one PET scan with the zzso zzso zzso zzso under resting zzso The binding potential zzso a zzso for the regional cerebral zzso zzso zzso was zzso using the zzso zzso as reference zzso The following regions of interest zzso were defined on individual MR zzso thalamus, sensory motor strip zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso anterior insular cortex, zzso insular cortex, anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso part of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso part of zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus and the zzso zzso for zzso was lowest in the sensory motor strip zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso cortex, zzso zzso had higher zzso than zzso zzso In the zzso region, we found high zzso in all zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Factor analysis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed four factors zzso explained zzso zzso zzso areas, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and thalamus, zzso zzso and thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas of the lateral pain system zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than zzso comparable to anterior and zzso areas of the zzso pain zzso These findings suggest that the cortical zzso effects of zzso are not only zzso by zzso and zzso but also by the zzso cortex, if it can be assumed that zzso binding mediates zzso in those zzso
