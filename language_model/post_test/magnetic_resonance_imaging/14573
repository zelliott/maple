The authors sought to explore whether anatomical and functional brain deficits are present in similar or different brain regions early in the course of zzso before antipsychotic treatment, and whether these deficits are more severe or otherwise different in patients with prominent negative zzso 

A total of 100 zzso zzso schizophrenia patients and 100 matched healthy comparison subjects underwent structural and zzso functional zzso zzso Gray matter volume and zzso of zzso fluctuations during zzso functional studies were zzso 

Group comparisons of gray matter volume showed significant differences mainly in zzso networks, while zzso in the zzso of zzso fluctuations were observed in zzso and default mode zzso Thus, different brain regions had zzso in gray matter volume and resting state zzso These changes did not correlate with the duration of zzso illness, nor with acute clinical symptom zzso Patients with prominent negative symptoms had greater regional zzso in brain zzso particularly in the left zzso prefrontal cortex, while the pattern of functional zzso was unrelated to severity of negative zzso 

zzso and zzso functional deficits were observed in different brain regions, indicating that anatomical and functional brain abnormalities are significantly zzso in the early course of zzso The lack of association of these abnormalities with illness duration and episode severity suggests that these anatomical and functional changes may be zzso features of the illness that are relatively stable early in the course of zzso The different structural deficits of regional gray matter observed in patients with prominent negative symptoms may provide unique insight into the early regional zzso of this symptom dimension in zzso
