The purpose of this study was to assess the zzso value of global magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso in women with suspected zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso coronary artery disease zzso 

The zzso value of global zzso in women without zzso zzso remains zzso 

Women zzso zzso 100, mean age 57 zzso 11 years, age range 31 to 76 zzso with symptoms of zzso zzso and with no zzso zzso as assessed by coronary zzso underwent zzso and standard functional zzso During follow-up zzso zzso 16 zzso time to first adverse event zzso zzso zzso or hospitalization for worsening zzso zzso was analyzed using global zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso 

zzso events occurred in 23 zzso zzso Using zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso zzso variables found to be zzso of adverse events were global zzso average zzso slope zzso zzso zzso the ratio of zzso peak signal zzso to zzso slope zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two multivariable Cox models were formed, 1 using variables that were performance site zzso ratio of zzso peak zzso to zzso slope together with zzso zzso zzso 13, p zzso zzso and a model using variables that were performance site zzso zzso slope and zzso zzso zzso 12, p zzso zzso Each of the 2 multivariable models remained zzso of adverse events after adjustment for age, disease history, and zzso risk zzso For each of the Cox models, patients were zzso as high risk if they were in the upper zzso of the model and as not high risk zzso zzso analysis of time to event was performed for high risk versus not high risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

Among women with suspected zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso global zzso of zzso zzso slope and peak signal zzso together with global functional assessment of zzso appear to predict zzso
