To evaluate the diagnostic ability of MR imaging for zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso reviewed the MR imaging findings of zzso space in 20 knee zzso of 11 zzso In all 20 knee zzso zzso and MR imaging were zzso MR imaging was performed with a zzso zzso zzso zzso using a round surface zzso Pulse sequences were zzso zzso 600 zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso 26, 70 zzso and zzso zzso 450 zzso 15 zzso 90 zzso In six of the 20 knees with zzso proved by zzso a low intensity band was shown above the zzso zzso of the zzso on both zzso and zzso MR images, and on zzso images this band was shown as intermediate zzso In the other 14 knees with no zzso observed by zzso the low intensity band was not shown on MR zzso In all 20 knees, a similar low intensity band was shown about 1 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso This should not be diagnosed as zzso The low intensity band seen on zzso and zzso MR images and its anatomical relation to the zzso zzso are important in diagnosing zzso
