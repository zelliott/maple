zzso zzso and lateral inferior prefrontal zzso zzso are considered important for conflict monitoring and interference resolution in many verbal zzso We studied interference resolution in a spatial working memory task using zzso zzso The task required participants to ignore two locations from a set of four initially held in working memory and to remember the remaining two locations as the target set for a subsequent recognition zzso zzso of zzso zzso was manipulated by drawing the probe from either the ignored locations zzso familiarity zzso or locations not used in the present trial zzso familiarity zzso zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso lobe zzso two regions commonly associated with motor planning and spatial attention, showed heightened activity in response to increased level of interference from zzso of high zzso Our finding suggests that interference resolution in the spatial domain may involve a different subset of the working memory system from that in the verbal zzso
