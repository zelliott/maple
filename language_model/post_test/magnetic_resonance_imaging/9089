To achieve better prognosis and quality of life for patients with zzso cancer, extent of surgery and zzso zzso should accurately reflect disease zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate accuracy of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso staging of zzso zzso 

Between 2001 and 2003, 104 patients with primary zzso cancer were examined with zzso and underwent radical zzso zzso invasion depth and zzso zzso zzso were assessed zzso and classified according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer zzso zzso zzso system by both zzso and zzso and results were zzso zzso for zzso and lateral pelvic zzso zzso involvement were zzso diameters of zzso or zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

There were 15 zzso 25 zzso 50 zzso and 14 zzso zzso zzso accuracy rate for zzso invasion depth was zzso The zzso zzso could be zzso in zzso of zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso involvement and the overall accuracy rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso and the overall accuracy rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pelvic zzso zzso zzso was observed in 15 patients and the overall accuracy rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was moderately accurate for prediction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and highly accurate regarding zzso invasion depth, and zzso zzso and lateral pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso appears useful for zzso decision-making in zzso cancer zzso
