We report here the development of zzso zzso quantum dots zzso as dual modal zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso They are zzso in a simple, versatile and environmentally friendly method, not only decreasing the difficulty and complexity, but also avoiding the increase of zzso size brought about by zzso coating procedure in the synthesis of zzso reported zzso These zzso with exceptionally small size and enhanced zzso resulting from the zzso doping, can label successfully the zzso cells in short time and present no evidence of toxicity or adverse affect on cell growth even at the concentration up to 1 zzso These results show that such zzso have low zzso especially in comparison with the traditional zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso studies, they exert strong positive contrast effect with a large zzso zzso zzso of water zzso of 16 zzso zzso Their capability of imaging zzso cells with zzso implies that they have great potential as zzso contrast zzso Combining the high sensitivity of zzso imaging with high spatial resolution of zzso We expect that the zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide a better reliability of the collected data and find promising applications in zzso medical and other zzso
