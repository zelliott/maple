zzso patient selection for zzso pulmonary valve zzso replacement requires accurate evaluation of right zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of zzso for evaluating RV parameters in patients in the zzso Melody zzso zzso 

zzso data were compared with cardiac magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso comparisons were made using site and core laboratory zzso 

zzso zzso assessments of RV zzso tract obstruction and RV pressure showed excellent zzso zzso mean zzso zzso were correlated most closely with zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso RV pressure estimates were correlated well with zzso data zzso zzso Assessment of pulmonary zzso zzso using a zzso severity scale showed good agreement with zzso zzso fraction zzso The zzso zzso Z score was highly zzso but correlated zzso with zzso RV zzso volume zzso zzso However, RV zzso zzso area was highly zzso zzso zzso and had an excellent correlation with zzso RV zzso volume zzso zzso all patients with zzso RV zzso zzso areas zzso zzso had zzso RV zzso volumes zzso zzso RV function using the fractional area change method showed a fair correlation with zzso RV ejection fraction zzso zzso 

In patients with dysfunctional RV zzso tract zzso zzso provided zzso accurate estimates of pressure overload and RV zzso zzso assessment of zzso correlated less closely with zzso zzso fraction but showed good zzso zzso assessment of RV function by these methods was zzso zzso alone may be a suitable screening test for some zzso replacement candidates; zzso may be indicated for zzso replacement decisions zzso on assessment of RV zzso
