Two patients with primary zzso nerve zzso due to direct mild head injury are zzso They presented with internal zzso zzso zzso zzso and very mild zzso in zzso Except for the persistent zzso nerve zzso both the patients recovered fully within one zzso Neither demonstrated a history that was suggestive of a cause for their zzso nerve zzso zzso CT scans demonstrated localized zzso zzso around the brain zzso One of the patients had sustained a fracture of the anterior zzso zzso As the underlying zzso mechanism underlying the zzso nerve zzso we suspected mild injury to the zzso fibers at the anterior zzso ligament and that of the zzso fibers at the zzso zzso zzso We speculate that these zzso fibers at the anterior zzso zzso acted as a zzso due to downward displacement of the zzso at the time of zzso
