Our goal was to test the hypothesis, as previously reported in other studies, that apparent diffusion zzso zzso provide specific information to diagnose zzso tumors, especially to discriminate between benign and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso spin echo imaging and zzso echo zzso imaging were performed in 31 women with 61 zzso components of zzso zzso 

The zzso that showed typical watery intensity, zzso in zzso imaging, and zzso in zzso imaging had similar zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso that showed signal intensity different from typical watery intensity in conventional zzso tended to have low zzso In zzso zzso the mean zzso of the zzso that showed typical watery intensity was higher than that of other zzso 

With conventional zzso a tendency of zzso could be zzso zzso may not provide additional information, especially to discriminate benign from zzso zzso
