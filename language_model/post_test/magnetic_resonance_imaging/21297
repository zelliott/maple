The surface properties of objects, such as zzso transparency and texture, provide important information about the material characteristics of objects in our visual zzso However, because there have been few reports on the zzso responses to surface properties in zzso we still lack information about where and how surface properties are processed in the zzso visual zzso In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine the cortical responses to zzso surfaces in the zzso visual zzso Using computer graphics, we generated images of zzso and matte objects and prepared scrambled images by locally zzso the zzso zzso of the images with zzso and matte zzso In experiment 1, we contrasted the responses to zzso images with those to matte and scrambled zzso zzso was observed along the zzso visual pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso In experiment 2, we manipulated the contrasts of images and found that the zzso observed in these regions could not be explained solely by the global or local zzso These results suggest that image features related to zzso surface are processed along the zzso visual zzso from zzso to specific regions in the IT zzso This is consistent with previous human zzso experiments that showed surface properties are processed in the zzso visual zzso
