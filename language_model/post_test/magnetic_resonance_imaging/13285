A comparative analysis of zzso muscle damage and zzso parameters after zzso and conventional open zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso 

To determine whether zzso zzso decreases zzso muscle damage and yields the same zzso results as those in conventional open zzso 

Compared with conventional open zzso zzso zzso using a zzso approach reduces zzso zzso and decreases zzso back zzso However, whether the latter produces less zzso muscle damage than the former remains zzso No comparative study has investigated slip reduction and zzso zzso at the fusion level in the 2 zzso 

We studied 20 patients (10 in each zzso who had undergone single-level conventional zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso screws and zzso cages at the zzso level for zzso degenerative zzso The rate of improvement in the Japanese zzso Association zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso angle at the zzso zzso and fusion rate were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using magnetic resonance zzso zzso No significant differences were detected between the 2 groups with respect to the rate of improvement in the Japanese zzso Association score, zzso zzso angle, and fusion zzso Both groups showed significant reduction in zzso after zzso The degree of zzso zzso and the increase in zzso intensity in the zzso muscle after zzso zzso were significantly lesser than those following open zzso 

zzso zzso is safe and zzso zzso zzso was less invasive than open zzso with regard to the zzso zzso
