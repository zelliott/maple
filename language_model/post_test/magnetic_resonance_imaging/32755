The clinical assessment of chronic zzso hamstring zzso zzso in athletes is a challenge to sports zzso To be able to compare the results of research and treatments, the methods used to diagnose and evaluate zzso must be clearly defined and zzso 

To assess the reliability and zzso of three pain provocation tests used for the diagnosis of zzso 

zzso athletes with zzso and without zzso zzso were examined by one physician and two zzso who were trained in the examination techniques before the zzso The examiners were blinded to the symptoms and identity of the zzso The three pain provocation tests examined were the zzso zzso stretch and modified zzso stretch zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso based on the repeated measures analysis of zzso were used to zzso the zzso and zzso zzso while sensitivity, zzso zzso values and likelihood ratios were used to determine the zzso of the three zzso 

The zzso values in all three tests revealed a high correlation zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso reliability and a zzso high correlation zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso All three tests displayed a zzso zzso with the highest degree of zzso being yielded by the modified zzso stretch zzso 

All three pain provocation tests proved to be of potential value in assessing chronic zzso in zzso However, we recommend that they be used in conjunction with other objective measures, such as zzso
