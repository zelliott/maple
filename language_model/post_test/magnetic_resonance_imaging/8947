zzso zzso are a major component of anterior ankle zzso zzso The two major accepted hypotheses on the origin of these zzso spurs are zzso formation due to repetitive zzso and zzso development because of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed evaluation of the zzso zzso that arise on the anterior aspect of the zzso and correlate them with the sites of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso bones from the San Diego Museum of Man were assessed regarding the presence of zzso on the anterior aspect of the zzso The distance of the zzso from the zzso head was zzso The results were correlated with zzso of zzso attachment on the anterior aspect of the zzso derived from MR zzso images in 13 zzso zzso 

The average distance of zzso attachment from the zzso head in the zzso aspect of the bone was zzso zzso and in the lateral part was zzso zzso The mean distance of zzso spurs from the zzso head in the zzso and lateral parts of the zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso spurs developed more zzso on the neck compared to the zzso attachment zzso zzso zzso zzso this difference was not significant zzso zzso zzso 

On the zzso part of the anterior zzso bone development appears to occur in an zzso location zzso zzso zzso the zzso develop zzso and appear to result from zzso and zzso traction zzso zzso
