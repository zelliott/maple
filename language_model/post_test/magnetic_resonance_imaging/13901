zzso and functional imaging studies have not always given zzso results about brain areas showing zzso changes and reduced flow or metabolism in Alzheimer's disease zzso The aim of this study was to determine the initial zzso and the zzso changes in both zzso and functional zzso for the same individuals with zzso 

We investigated 15 patients with mild zzso and 25 zzso healthy zzso The zzso patients underwent both zzso and zzso 3 times at intervals of approximately 1 zzso The gray matter volume, as segmented from zzso and the regional cerebral blood flow zzso as measured by zzso of zzso patients were compared with those of healthy volunteers using statistical zzso zzso which is a zzso analysis in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso between areas of regional zzso and areas of decreased zzso was zzso The zzso zzso areas showed a faster and more extensive reduction of gray matter volume than of zzso In comparison with the value at the baseline study, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was extensively zzso In contrast, the extent of significant decrease in this area continued to be much zzso for gray matter volume than for zzso even in the follow-up zzso zzso areas, including the anterior zzso zzso and the zzso areas, showed a progressive reduction in both zzso and gray matter zzso The reduction in zzso was in a more zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso than was the reduction in gray matter zzso 

These results indicate a distinct zzso between zzso and functional changes in a zzso study of zzso zzso changes may be caused partly by remote effects from the zzso involved areas with decreased connectivity and partly by a zzso response by zzso zzso
