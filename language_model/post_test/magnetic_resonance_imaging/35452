zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has recently been developed to detect high zzso of protein or zzso We have previously reported that 50% of patients with sudden zzso hearing loss zzso show high signals in the affected inner ear on zzso zzso However, the relationship between zzso findings and hearing prognosis is zzso Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the results of zzso zzso at 3 zzso and prognosis in sudden zzso 

We used zzso at 3 zzso with and without zzso enhancement to evaluate the zzso conditions in the inner ears of 48 patients with sudden zzso 

Thirty-one of 48 patients with sudden zzso showed high signals in the affected inner ear on zzso zzso Hearing improvement in patients with high signals in the affected inner ear on zzso zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso was significantly worse than that in patients with no signal zzso zzso 27 zzso P zzso zzso Our analysis suggests that high signals in the affected inner ear on zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso factor for sudden zzso 

zzso findings show that high signals in the zzso on zzso zzso are related to a poor hearing zzso These signals may reflect minor zzso or an increased concentration of protein in the inner ear, which has passed through blood vessels with increased zzso or has originated in disrupted cells in the inner zzso
