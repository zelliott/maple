Earlier studies reported evidence suggesting distinct zzso auditory representations for environmental sounds such as animal zzso and tool sounds in superior and middle zzso regions of the zzso zzso However, the degree of selectivity of these representations remains to be zzso The present study combined functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso adaptation with a silent acquisition protocol to further investigate zzso auditory processing of environmental zzso To this end, we zzso presented pairs of sounds taken from the categories zzso zzso or zzso zzso with either the same or different zzso We examined the degree of selectivity as evidenced by adaptation effects to both or only one sound category in the course of zzso as well as functionally and zzso constrained region of interest zzso While most regions predominately in the zzso zzso showed an adaptation to both sound categories, particularly the left superior zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso middle zzso zzso zzso selectively adapted to animal zzso and tool sounds, zzso However, the zzso profiles of these regions differed with respect to the general responsiveness to zzso While tool sounds still produced zzso signals significantly different from fixation baseline in the zzso this was not the case for animal zzso in zzso zzso with the interpretation of zzso as an intermediate auditory processing stage, this region might differentiate auditory stimuli into categories based on variations of physical stimulus zzso However, processing in left zzso seems to be even more restricted to zzso sounds of man-made zzso
