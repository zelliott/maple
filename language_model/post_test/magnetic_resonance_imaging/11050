The purpose of this study was to compare the relationship between the actual zzso fluid volume that was measured at delivery and magnetic resonance zzso fluid volume determination, largest vertical pocket, and zzso fluid zzso 

Three hours before zzso delivery, 80 women had zzso measurement of the zzso fluid index and the largest vertical zzso zzso resonance imaging was then completed, and the magnetic resonance zzso fluid volume was zzso At surgery, the zzso fluid was zzso zzso correlations were zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso were developed for each method as a measure of predictability for zzso 

The correlations for the magnetic resonance zzso fluid volume, zzso fluid index, and largest vertical pocket to zzso fluid volume was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso fluid volume has a statistically higher correlation than the largest vertical pocket ( P zzso zzso The 3 methods, however, are statistically comparable for identifying zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is comparable with ultrasound evaluation for the prediction of zzso zzso to actual zzso fluid volume are also zzso
