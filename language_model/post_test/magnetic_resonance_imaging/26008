zzso zzso of zzso zzso are a sensitive indicator of the early zzso zzso of the zzso zzso lobe in zzso However, zzso pathology appears first in the zzso cortex, not the zzso The authors tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are more sensitive than zzso of zzso volume in discriminating among three clinical zzso controls, patients with a mild cognitive impairment zzso and patients with mild probable zzso 

The authors studied 30 controls, 30 patients with zzso and 30 patients with zzso who were matched among clinical groups on age, zzso and zzso All underwent a standardized zzso protocol from which the authors made zzso of zzso volume, zzso zzso volume, and the cumulative length of the zzso border of the zzso zzso 

zzso intergroup differences zzso zzso zzso were found for all zzso zzso with the exception of the cumulative length of the zzso cortex, which did not differentiate controls from zzso zzso Whereas the zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso provided slightly better intergroup discrimination than the zzso distance zzso overall differences in discriminating ability among the three zzso zzso were zzso 

Despite the theoretical rationale for the superiority of zzso zzso in early zzso the authors found zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were approximately equivalent at intergroup zzso zzso of the zzso may be preferable because zzso depiction of the boundaries of the zzso zzso can be obscured by zzso zzso image artifact, or zzso
