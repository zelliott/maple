zzso zzso mapping and monitoring of eloquent brain areas can be combined with zzso zzso to enhance the safety and efficacy of surgical procedures in the motor zzso We designed a new type of cortical zzso which can be repeatedly placed on the cortical surface and allows accurate and zzso stimulation by means of a navigation zzso The newly designed device consists of a zzso zzso contact for direct cortical zzso housed in a holder which allows placement, easy zzso and precise repeated placement of a surgical navigation zzso It can be used for zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical stimulation zzso for the mapping of eloquent cortex, and for monitoring of motor zzso While the zzso is zzso compound muscle action zzso zzso are recorded from muscles of the zzso zzso and are assessed both zzso and zzso When the device is used in combination with zzso zzso the stimulation sites may zzso be registered or displayed on the system zzso This allows repeated zzso and zzso the need for strip or grid zzso in the operative field; although such zzso may be useful for continuous monitoring, they often are in the zzso zzso In addition, the primary and supplementary motor zzso can be mapped by determining the location of the sites of stimulation on zzso images of the cerebral zzso
