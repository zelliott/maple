The communication among zzso zzso reflected by transient zzso activity, is the mechanism underlying the information processing in the zzso Although it is widely assumed that the interactions among those populations zzso functional zzso are highly zzso the amount of zzso information transmission and its functional roles are not zzso The state of the art to understand the communication between brain systems are dynamic zzso modeling zzso and zzso zzso While zzso models zzso zzso zzso zzso which constitutes a major tool to reveal effective zzso and is widely used to analyze zzso data as well as zzso signals, is usually applied in its linear zzso In order to capture zzso interactions between even short and noisy time series, a few approaches have been zzso We review them and focus on a recently proposed flexible approach has been recently proposed, consisting in the kernel version of zzso zzso We show the application of the proposed approach on zzso signals and zzso zzso
