zzso bone zzso is a rare disorder, accounting for less than zzso of all cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso In our study, a favorable response and lower risk of emergent surgery were observed following the administration of systemic chemotherapy with or without zzso 

Patients diagnosed with zzso zzso at our hospital between 2000 and 2011 were evaluated for zzso zzso data, including the clinical zzso zzso type, treatment zzso long-term outcome, survival curve and zzso factors, were zzso 

zzso patients with a median age of 63 years were diagnosed with zzso A complete response zzso was achieved in zzso zzso of the zzso With treatment of the disease, nine of 10 patients with initially impending pathological bone fractures ultimately did not undergo zzso The median follow-up duration was 48 zzso Two patients experienced disease zzso In a zzso analysis, the zzso overall survival zzso and zzso survival zzso rates were zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the significantly favorable zzso factors for zzso were an International zzso Index zzso score of zzso an age of zzso years, a performance status with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology zzso score of zzso a zzso and chemotherapy zzso zzso For zzso a zzso was the only favorable zzso In the zzso analysis, a zzso was the only independent factor for both zzso and zzso 

Our study confirms the good prognosis of this rare zzso Once a zzso is zzso even elderly patients may exhibit long-term survival, possibly obviating the need for surgery for less severe bone zzso
