To perceive the vast array of stimuli in the world around us, the visual system employs parallel processing mechanisms that ensure efficiency in zzso multiple objects in a zzso A way to test this efficiency is to measure reaction time zzso to pairs of identical zzso presented zzso or as zzso typically, the resulting phenomenon is the redundant targets effect zzso which zzso as faster zzso to paired than zzso presented zzso It is controversial, however, whether the neural locus of the parallel processing mechanisms invoked to produce the zzso is zzso or motor and why some studies observe a substantial zzso and others do zzso To resolve these two issues, we measured the zzso in young adults while undergoing functional zzso Regarding the question of a zzso or motor basis for the zzso we observed that bilateral zzso of zzso zzso was prominent in paired zzso the sum of the two single stimulus conditions, indicating that the zzso invoked zzso zzso by contrast, the motor zzso was not disproportionately activated in this zzso Regarding the magnitude of the zzso we compared zzso patterns in individuals with small zzso large zzso and observed that frontal and zzso areas were activated with small zzso These data indicate that the primary processing level of response zzso observed as the zzso is zzso but the zzso of the zzso magnitude is zzso and associated with basic aspects of response selection and zzso
