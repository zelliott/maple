zzso of zzso in the whole body is important for sufficient the staging of zzso zzso zzso imaging of the brain is particularly zzso Although there is evidence that clinical examination is not sufficient for prediction of cerebral zzso zzso scan is not always regarded as reasonable in neurological zzso zzso zzso we explored the zzso of cerebral zzso in our patient population in relation to the stage of disease to estimate the zzso of this zzso 

120 consecutive patients with zzso melanoma were zzso zzso All patients were zzso without pathological findings and received routine staging by zzso zzso The zzso of brain zzso was zzso The examination protocol consisted of an zzso zzso flair and a T 1 zzso Ten minutes after administration of contrast agent, a T 1 sequence in zzso and zzso orientation was performed using the zzso transfer zzso The type of melanoma, the thickness of the zzso the Clark level, the location of the primary zzso and the clinical stage were recorded from the clinical zzso 

15 zzso zzso of the 120 patients zzso stage I: 27 patients, stage II: 29 patients, stage zzso 25 patients, stage zzso 39 zzso had cerebral zzso in zzso 14 patients were in stage III or IV at this zzso zzso zzso % of the patients in stage III and IV had cerebral zzso Only one patient in stage zzso had cerebral zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso patients seems to be an important factor in the staging of melanoma especially in the advanced stage of this disease and in patients with a thick primary zzso
