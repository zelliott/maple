Four different patterns of zzso have been described in active zzso zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso patients that were zzso shortly after disease zzso These patterns were suggested to represent zzso of the underlying zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso also exists in an zzso collection of autopsy material from patients with established zzso 

All zzso brain tissue available in the zzso Medical Center was assessed for the presence of active zzso zzso using magnetic resonance zzso sampling and zzso zzso blocks containing active zzso zzso were evaluated for the presence of complement and zzso deposition, zzso zzso differential loss of zzso zzso and zzso damage using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with active zzso zzso were compared with blocks with active zzso and inactive zzso 

zzso and zzso were consistently associated with zzso in areas of active zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso extensive zzso damage, and zzso zzso were absent or zzso This pattern was observed in all tissue blocks containing active zzso zzso zzso zzso between patients was not zzso 

The zzso appearance of active zzso zzso in established zzso is zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the earliest phase of zzso zzso formation may disappear over time as different pathways zzso in one general mechanism of zzso zzso presence of complement, zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso suggests that zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the dominant mechanism of zzso in established zzso
