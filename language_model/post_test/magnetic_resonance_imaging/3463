zzso in zzso primary motor zzso and zzso zzso zzso are tuned to movement zzso In humans, zzso populations tuned to movement direction have recently been described using zzso pattern analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso It is zzso however, to what extent zzso tuned zzso populations are sensitive to movement zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to determine whether zzso tuned zzso populations are modulated by movement zzso In different blocks, participants were adapted to small- or zzso zzso zzso On occasional test trials, we zzso varied the angular difference between adaptation and test direction and the zzso between adapted and tested zzso zzso or zzso We predicted that the blood oxygen zzso signal in zzso tuned regions should be adapted in proportion to the angular difference between adaptation and test zzso zzso tuned regions insensitive to movement zzso should show a transfer of adaptation from the adapted to the zzso zzso In contrast, regions sensitive to the specific combination of movement direction and zzso should show directional tuning only for the adapted zzso We identified a network of zzso and frontal regions tuned to movement zzso We found that zzso areas contain zzso populations sensitive to specific combinations of movement direction and zzso while frontal areas show transfer from the adapted to the zzso zzso during zzso movements after adaptation to large zzso but not vice zzso Our results thus imply different processing of movement zzso in zzso tuned frontal and zzso zzso
