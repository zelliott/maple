zzso of remote memory is considered to zzso involve the anterior and zzso zzso zzso Previous zzso studies suggest that the different zzso zzso cortical regions are involved in the retrieval of remote memory of different categories of zzso whereas the anterior region is involved more generally in remote memory zzso In the present study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging of human zzso we tested this zzso by examining the more precise characteristics of the anterior and zzso zzso cortical zzso Two categories of zzso faces and scenes, were used for paired stimuli to be zzso and the brain activity during retrieval of paired stimuli that were learned immediately before the scanning was compared with that during retrieval of paired stimuli that were learned zzso weeks zzso We found that the different zzso zzso cortical regions were activated during retrieval of different categories of remote memory in a zzso manner, whereas the anterior zzso cortical region was activated during retrieval of remote memory in a zzso zzso Furthermore, by applying a zzso pattern analysis to zzso interactions during retrieval of remote memory relative to recent memory, we revealed the significant interaction from the zzso zzso zzso cortical regions to the zzso anterior zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso cortical regions are involved in representation and retrieval of zzso remote memory, whereas the anterior cortical zzso region is involved in zzso retrieval process of remote zzso
