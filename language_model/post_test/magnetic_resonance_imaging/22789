Although gray matter zzso and white matter zzso have differing zzso responses to zzso in animal models, it is unclear whether this translates into differing thresholds for zzso We studied this issue in zzso stroke patients using magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

MR studies were performed in patients with acute zzso zzso stroke occurring within 24 hours and at 3 zzso zzso blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso mean transit time zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso were zzso After zzso based on a zzso map of zzso and zzso zzso diffusion and zzso thresholds for zzso were zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso thresholds for zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso g per minute, zzso range zzso to zzso than in zzso zzso zzso g per zzso zzso range zzso to zzso zzso zzso were also significantly higher in zzso than zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and there was a trend toward a shorter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso has a higher zzso threshold for zzso zzso and zzso than zzso in patients within 24 hours of zzso stroke zzso zzso when assessing patients for potential therapies, zzso rather than zzso thresholds may be a more precise measure of predicting the likelihood of zzso
