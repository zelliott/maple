We assessed the cognitive performance of patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso caused by unilateral zzso sclerosis zzso in comparison with that of zzso healthy zzso We report the relationship between cognitive measures and duration of zzso zzso with zzso volumes, and the impact of educational level on cognitive zzso 

This study involved 61 zzso (40 with zzso or zzso 8 years and 21 with zzso years of formal education) with unilateral HS and 61 zzso zzso zzso was performed on all patients and 10 zzso The results zzso zzso of the zzso tests of healthy subjects and patients were compared using the Student zzso and zzso zzso 

Patients performed worse than controls in the zzso zzso When adjusted zzso scores were used to calculate the impairment index, patients had a greater percentage of abnormal tests compared with zzso The cognitive decline, assessed through the impairment index, correlated with duration of zzso Higher level of education did not protect against this decline, thus not supporting the hypothesis of cerebral reserve in this zzso A significant correlation between zzso zzso measures and duration of zzso was observed only in patients with left zzso 

Patients with zzso caused by HS present with cognitive morbidity that extends beyond memory zzso zzso decline is associated with duration of zzso and in patients with zzso zzso duration may correlate with zzso zzso zzso
