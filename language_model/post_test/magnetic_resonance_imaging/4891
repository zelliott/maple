zzso is a benign entity, whose appearance on conventional MR imaging makes its differentiation from zzso zzso or zzso zzso disease zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso effects from zzso with excellent spatial zzso Only scarce case reports have described the utility of zzso in cases of zzso Our aim was to show the diagnostic value of zzso applied to a larger series of zzso 

This was an zzso retrospective study of 33 zzso in 27 consecutive patients examined from August 2009 to January 2011 with MR imaging, including zzso zzso signal intensity zzso and additional vascular zzso were zzso zzso or follow-up examinations were available in 18 patients with a median time zzso of zzso months zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-five zzso and 8 zzso zzso demonstrated distinct zzso loss on zzso in combination with zzso zzso Mean zzso diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirty-nine percent showed slight zzso changes on zzso and/or zzso the remainder were zzso to normal zzso In zzso a prominent draining vessel was zzso Additional cerebral vascular zzso were found in 5 zzso 

zzso represents a valuable tool for confirmation of presumed zzso zzso of zzso loss on zzso in an enhancing focal brain zzso otherwise unremarkable on conventional MR images, is highly specific for zzso thus excluding serious pathology and reassuring the patient and referring zzso This is particularly helpful for zzso in less typical zzso
