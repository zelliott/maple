Prospective zzso 

In a prospective study, 45 consecutive cases of cervical spinal zzso injury without zzso evidence of trauma zzso who were treated zzso were analyzed to correlate the magnetic resonance image findings with the initial neurological deficit and the extent of neurological recovery at 2 zzso 

University zzso teaching hospital in South zzso 

The neurological status of patients who did not have any zzso or computerized zzso zzso at the time of admission was assessed by ASIA zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso The spinal zzso zzso seen in the magnetic resonance imaging was zzso The neurological status at the end of 2 years was zzso 

zzso of the 45 patients zzso had zzso zzso 8 zzso had zzso zzso 8 zzso patients had a normal zzso and 2 zzso patients had zzso swelling on the magnetic resonance zzso Out of 27 patients who presented with zzso zzso 14 zzso patients recovered from zzso D to zzso E and 6 zzso patients did not recover and remained at zzso zzso Seven zzso patients who had a normal zzso recovered completely to zzso zzso Five zzso patients who had zzso of the zzso recovered up to zzso zzso 

The initial neurological status zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso neurological recovery is dependent on the type of zzso damage and initial neurological zzso The rate of recovery and the final motor outcome are zzso related to the length of zzso zzso
