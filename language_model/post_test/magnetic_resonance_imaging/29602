To estimate the role of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso in women with previous zzso 

Clinical examinations were performed on 51 women presenting with symptoms of zzso A zzso dynamic zzso assessment was zzso The mid zzso line was the reference level used for zzso zzso The parameters of analysis included zzso correlation by compartments of clinical and zzso grading of zzso zzso assessment of the accuracy of clinical examination of the middle zzso and zzso identification of any additional information provided by zzso All zzso films were analyzed and validated by the same two zzso 

Analysis of each compartment separately revealed poor correlation between clinical and zzso zzso Of the 51 cases with clinical vault zzso 27 zzso cases were clinically zzso 3 zzso were zzso and there was agreement in 21 zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso follow-up of the 18 zzso patients who underwent zzso after zzso assessment revealed the presence of zzso in 4 zzso occasions and zzso in 3 zzso which had been detected on zzso but not confirmed zzso 

There is poor correlation between clinical and zzso findings when assessing zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging allows the identification of other zzso compartments and may be a complementary diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of complex zzso zzso zzso
