To describe the magnetic resonance imaging zzso appearances of the brain in acute carbon monoxide poisoning, the zzso cause of accidental poisoning in Europe and the zzso To attempt to correlate the imaging findings with patient outcome as an aid to zzso 

Brain zzso was performed on 19 consecutive patients, who had sustained acute carbon monoxide poisoning, as soon as possible after their referral to the regional zzso Unit at the Royal Hospital, zzso All patients were unconscious on zzso and had received at least one treatment with zzso oxygen by the time of first zzso The imaging findings were zzso independently by two experienced MR zzso with a third zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

Thirteen male and six female patients, age range zzso years zzso zzso zzso underwent MR an average of zzso h zzso zzso zzso following presentation at the referring zzso MR (at zzso revealed abnormalities in the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5: entire zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone, zzso nucleus, zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso either localized or general; zzso zzso lobe in the region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of the patients with zzso in the region of the zzso zzso zzso 3) had no other area of cortical zzso Two patients showed abnormalities in the zzso zzso appearances were seen on the initial MR in seven zzso 

The appearances of the brain following acute CO poisoning are zzso and have previously been the subject of case reports or small studies, most of which have have addressed the delayed zzso of this zzso This study, the first large series undertaken in the acute phase, confirms that, although the zzso zzso is the zzso site of zzso in the brain, the effects of CO poisoning are zzso The extent of damage zzso with clinical outcome, and therefore aids management and zzso
