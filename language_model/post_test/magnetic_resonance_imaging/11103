We introduce an integrated framework for detecting brain activity from zzso data, which is based on a spatial discrete zzso zzso Unlike the standard zzso approach for zzso analysis, we apply the suitable statistical test procedure in the spatial zzso For a desired significance level, this scheme has one remaining degree of freedom, characterizing the zzso processing, which is zzso according to the principle of minimal approximation zzso This allows us to determine the threshold values in a way that does not depend on zzso While developing our zzso we make only conservative zzso zzso the detection of zzso is based on strong zzso We have implemented this framework as a zzso zzso for the zzso software, taking advantage of multiple options and functions of zzso such as the setup of the linear model and the use of the zzso response zzso We show by experimental results that our method is able to detect zzso zzso the results are comparable to those obtained by zzso even though statistical assumptions are more zzso
