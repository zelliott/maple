The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a strategy for safe performance of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso patients with cardiac zzso 

zzso criteria were presence of a cardiac zzso and urgent clinical need for an zzso zzso zzso patients and those requiring examinations of the zzso region were zzso The study group consisted of 82 zzso patients who underwent a total of 115 zzso examinations at zzso To minimize zzso lead heating, the specific zzso rate was limited to zzso zzso All zzso were zzso before zzso If heart rate was zzso zzso the zzso mode was programmed to avoid magnetic resonance zzso zzso if heart rate was zzso zzso zzso mode was used to avoid zzso competitive pacing and potential zzso Patients were monitored with zzso and pulse zzso All zzso were interrogated immediately before and after the zzso examination and after 3 months, including measurement of pacing capture threshold zzso and serum zzso I zzso All MR examinations were completed zzso zzso of zzso output or induction of zzso was not zzso zzso increased significantly from zzso to zzso zzso In 2 of 195 zzso an increase in zzso was only detected at zzso In 4 of 114 zzso zzso increased from a normal baseline value to above normal after zzso and in 1 case zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this increase was associated with a significant increase in zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso patients can be performed with an acceptable zzso ratio under controlled conditions and by taking both zzso and zzso zzso
