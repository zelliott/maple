The spinal zzso is a common site of involvement in multiple sclerosis zzso where pathology contributes substantially to locomotor zzso Previous studies have demonstrated significant correlations between clinical disability and cervical zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso We evaluate cervical zzso pathology zzso for the first time, quantitative zzso relaxation time zzso which shows zzso specificity for tissue damage in the cerebral white zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was compared in 15 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 7 secondary progressive zzso and 6 healthy controls, and related to zzso upper cervical zzso area zzso cerebral white matter zzso zzso zzso load and disability measures including the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso index zzso and timed zzso zzso zzso maps of the brain and cervical zzso were acquired using a zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso zzso sequences were also zzso 

Median cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and SP patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso and in SP zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso In the overall patient zzso it correlated significantly with median cerebral white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Both median cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated significantly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and timed zzso walk zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and could also prove a useful surrogate outcome measure in zzso The relation of cervical zzso zzso to cerebral white matter zzso suggests that zzso pathology may be influenced by tissue damage zzso
