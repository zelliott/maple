zzso one of the most important zzso brain imaging methods, relies on the blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso whose precise zzso are still not fully zzso It is a widespread assumption that the components of the zzso response function zzso are fixed relative to each other in time, leading most studies as well as analysis tools to focus on zzso responses, thus using or zzso a zzso or zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we examined the nature of the zzso of the zzso response and asked in particular whether the positive zzso peak is subject to zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the positive peak of the zzso zzso signal exhibits a zzso zzso jitter on the order of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso can be exploited to uncover the initial dip in the majority of zzso by pooling trial responses with large peak zzso zzso dips exposed by this procedure possess higher spatial resolution compared to the positive zzso signal in the human visual zzso These findings allow for the reliable observation of zzso signals that are zzso closer to neural activity, leading to improvements in both zzso and spatial zzso
