A technique is described for zzso brain tissue into three zzso gray matter, white matter, and zzso zzso This technique uses simultaneously registered zzso density and zzso zzso zzso of each of the three types of tissue are identified on both image sets and used as zzso zzso these tissue samples are then used to generate a linear zzso function, which is used to zzso the remaining zzso in the image data zzso zzso of varying the location and number of training classes have been zzso six pairs of training classes have been found to yield a suitable zzso zzso and zzso reliability have been examined and found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso has also been zzso zzso rates are zzso within the same individual when the same scanner is used, but in this study poor zzso occurs when the same individual is scanned on two different zzso The zzso of the technique has been tested by examining correlations between traced and segmented regions of interest, evaluating correlations with age, and conducting phantom studies, in addition to using visual inspection of the classified images as an indication of face zzso From all four perspectives, the method has been found to have good zzso Additional applications, strengths, and limitations are zzso
