To investigate a new zzso protocol defined as zzso zzso for the detection of zzso 

A total of 36 patients (18 men, 18 zzso with the clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso or zzso who were scheduled for surgical exploration were preoperatively zzso at zzso T in the zzso zzso zzso STIR sequences and zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso sequences before and after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso were zzso Image zzso was routinely zzso The image findings were compared with the findings at surgical exploration according to a uniform zzso zzso 

A total of 46 zzso were seen on zzso zzso whereas surgery described 41 zzso zzso and surgery zzso depicted a total number of 40 zzso six zzso were only described by zzso and one zzso was only seen during zzso A total of 27 zzso were detected with zzso compared to 22 during zzso A total of 22 zzso were zzso zzso Complete agreement between zzso zzso and surgery occurred in 32 zzso of the 36 zzso The four patients in whom both procedures disagreed had complex zzso zzso with multiple zzso and/or zzso due to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is an important complement to surgical exploration and especially suitable for investigating complex zzso zzso
