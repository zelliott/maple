zzso to the classical view, recent zzso studies claim that zzso processing, as part of auditory speech perception, is zzso by both the left and right zzso zzso and not the left zzso lobe zzso This study seeks to explore whether there are variations in the zzso of response to verbal and zzso sounds by varying spectral complexity of those zzso White noise was gradually transformed into either speech or music sounds using a zzso zzso zzso The stimuli were presented in an zzso design and the evoked brain responses were measured using zzso The results demonstrated that the left zzso lobe was predominantly sensitive to gradual manipulation of the speech sounds while the right zzso lobe responded to all sounds and zzso This effect was especially pronounced within the middle region of the left superior zzso zzso zzso This area could be further subdivided into a more zzso area, which showed a linear response to the manipulation of speech sounds, and an zzso adjacent area which showed the strongest interaction between the speech and music sound zzso Such a differential and selective response was not seen in other brain areas and not when the sound zzso into a music zzso This gives further experimental evidence for the assumption of a zzso processing stream in the left zzso zzso In addition, the present findings support the notion that the left mid zzso area is more sensitive to speech signals compared to the right zzso
