zzso damage in multiple sclerosis zzso is correlated to disease zzso Early zzso damage may be compensated for by zzso zzso zzso protein 43 zzso is a marker for zzso growth and zzso in various neurodegenerative zzso We investigated the expression of zzso in 48 zzso zzso and white matter zzso of different zzso zzso zzso expression was found in zzso of the white matter zzso independent of the zzso zzso In 19 out of 35 white matter zzso areas of increased zzso expression were present immediately adjacent to the zzso Increased or zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso expression appeared unchanged in zzso matter zzso zzso were present in the areas of changed zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso levels were zzso correlated with magnetic resonance imaging measures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that decreased zzso zzso reflects zzso damage in zzso zzso which may again be reflected in decreased zzso fluid zzso The increased levels of zzso in zzso or zzso white matter close to zzso zzso may reflect zzso attempts by damaged zzso
