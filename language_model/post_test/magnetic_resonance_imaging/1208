To evaluate acute zzso zzso by using zzso enhancement zzso and delayed enhancement zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging compared with zzso 201 zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DE zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in 60 consecutive patients zzso men, seven zzso mean age zzso zzso 56 years zzso 13; range, zzso zzso at 6 days zzso 3 after zzso first zzso zzso zzso of zzso obstruction was determined on zzso MR zzso zzso size was defined on DE MR images as percentage of left zzso zzso area and compared with zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in continuous data were analyzed with Student zzso zzso Linear zzso and zzso analysis were used to compare zzso of zzso zzso 

Mean zzso size was not significantly different between DE MR imaging zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso area; P zzso good correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso and agreement were found, with a mean difference of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to depict zzso in six zzso of 30 patients with inferior zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso zzso of zzso area on DE MR zzso whereas DE MR images showed the zzso in all patients zzso zzso zzso MR images depicted zzso obstruction in 23 zzso of 60 zzso these patients had larger zzso at DE MR imaging than did patients without zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso of zzso area, P zzso zzso zzso showed larger zzso in patients with zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso of zzso area, P zzso 

Good correlation and agreement with zzso zzso indicate DE MR imaging may be used to estimate zzso size 6 days after zzso acute zzso zzso DE MR imaging is more sensitive for detection of inferior zzso than is zzso zzso Patients with zzso obstruction on zzso MR images have larger zzso
