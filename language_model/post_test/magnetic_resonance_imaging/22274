We studied zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso following stimulation of bilateral zzso zzso nerves zzso zzso in normal subjects to determine the zzso and zzso interference effects caused by zzso of sensory areas in bilateral zzso zzso areas in the primary and second sensory zzso zzso and zzso in each zzso following bilateral stimulation were clearly identified by zzso of the double zzso equivalent current zzso zzso using the zzso head model, and the large zzso differences were zzso zzso following the right zzso zzso nerve stimulation and those following the left stimulation were zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was induced by a zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no consistent changes between the zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso reduced in zzso as compared with the zzso zzso The differences were clearly identified in the zzso zzso in which the main zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso were located in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso but the zzso of the zzso were located in bilateral zzso which are considered to receive ascending signals from the body zzso zzso some zzso interactions might take place in zzso by receiving zzso from the body zzso
