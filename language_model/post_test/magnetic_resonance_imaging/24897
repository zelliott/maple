zzso treatment is a promising strategy for improving long-term outcomes in advanced zzso zzso Two tumor response evaluation criteria for zzso treatment are zzso response evaluation criteria in solid tumors zzso and zzso zzso This prospective study aimed to identify which was a better surrogate end point for survival in the zzso zzso 

We analyzed all eligible patients zzso from the zzso treatment group in a phase III trial comparing zzso versus zzso zzso plus zzso for clinical stage II or III zzso zzso zzso reliability was evaluated with the proportion of agreement and the zzso zzso For zzso zzso hazard ratios zzso of response to zzso and differences in response rates between zzso and long-term survivors were zzso 

The clinical and zzso response rates were zzso (62 of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The proportion of agreement for response to zzso between the 2 criteria was zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso for death in patients with zzso response zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso was lower than for those with zzso response zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The difference in response rates between zzso and long-term survivors according to zzso criteria (27 zzso zzso zzso was larger than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso agreement was relatively low, and zzso criteria yielded more valid assessments of response than zzso zzso response rate seemed to be the better surrogate end point of survival in the zzso zzso
