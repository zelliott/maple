We present a case of a young girl complaining of headaches in whom a zzso area was found in the zzso zzso with a standard magnetic resonance zzso image of the zzso This finding did not agree with clinical symptoms, so a dedicated MR of the zzso region was zzso We determined that the supposed mass was artifact caused by volume zzso Volume averaging is the effect of expressing the average density of two structures of a zzso slice on a zzso zzso Increased slice thickness leads to increased volume averaging and decreased zzso Dedicated MR uses thinner zzso slices to reconstruct an image and thus has better spatial resolution than standard zzso We emphasize the need of dedicated MR to evaluate zzso zzso
