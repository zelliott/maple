This zzso study investigates the differences between a blocked and zzso analysis in a cued target detection task, the so-called Posner zzso using a hybrid zzso zzso and zzso cued trials were presented zzso in different blocks containing zzso zzso or zzso valid zzso Four analyses were zzso zzso an zzso analysis comparing invalid and valid trials, zzso a blocked analysis comparing blocks with 50% valid and invalid trials to blocks with zzso valid trials, zzso a blocked analysis detecting differences between block models when modeled as epochs or chains of events, and zzso a blocked analysis that modeled blocks as chains of events to scale zzso equally to the zzso zzso zzso of the type of analysis zzso or event zzso significant zzso of the right zzso zzso was zzso A larger cluster size was evident in the blocked analysis, which can be attributed to higher zzso In addition to this common right zzso zzso the zzso analysis revealed zzso in right superior zzso zzso and left zzso zzso In contrast, the blocked analysis yielded additional activity in the right zzso zzso No influences of the block model zzso versus chain of zzso were found in regions activated in the blocked or zzso analysis, zzso In zzso using a hybrid design and both zzso and blocked analysis techniques, we show both sustained and transient neural processes underlying zzso of zzso zzso
