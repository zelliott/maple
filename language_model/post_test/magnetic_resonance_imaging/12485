zzso tissue temperature and/or pH is a common feature in pathological conditions, where zzso demand exceeds oxygen supply such as in tumors and following zzso zzso in zzso tissue temperature and pH may become valuable zzso for disease detection and the monitoring of disease progression or treatment response in conditions with altered zzso zzso In this study, pH is measured using the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso complex with a zzso zzso zzso The pH was uniquely determined from the zzso of the asymmetry curve of the chemical exchange zzso transfer spectrum, independent of contrast agent zzso or temperature for a given zzso zzso pH maps with an zzso standard zzso of less than zzso pH units were obtained in 10 zzso zzso solutions with pH ranging from zzso to zzso pH units at zzso zzso maps were simultaneously obtained using the chemical shift of the chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso and pH maps are demonstrated in the mouse leg (N zzso zzso where the mean and standard zzso for pH was zzso zzso zzso pH unit and temperature was zzso zzso zzso
