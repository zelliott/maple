Physical and rehabilitation medicine physicians commonly see patients with chronic functional ankle zzso The main anatomical structures involved in ankle stability are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Several anatomical zzso variations have been described in the literature as being sometimes responsible for this instability, the zzso zzso muscle being the most zzso The objective of this clinical study is to discuss the implication of the bilateral zzso zzso muscle in functional ankle zzso 

This 26-year-old patient was seen in zzso consultation for zzso episodes of lateral ankle zzso The clinical examination found a moderate zzso on the right side in bilateral ankle zzso We also noted a bilateral weakness of the zzso zzso Additional imaging examinations showed a zzso bilateral zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso muscles was zzso 

In the literature the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso muscle varies from 0 to zzso Most times this muscle is zzso and is only zzso zzso However some cases of chronic ankle pain or instability have been reported in the zzso It seems relevant to discuss, around the clinical case of this patient, the impact of this muscle on ankle instability especially when faced with lingering weakness of the zzso zzso and zzso muscles in spite of eccentric strength training and in the absence of any neurological zzso One of the zzso previously described in the literature, would be the overcrowding effect resulting in a true conflict by reducing the available space for the zzso muscles in the zzso zzso
