We investigated the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging at an extremely low concentration of zzso zzso supplied from a continuous zzso zzso zzso system and established a standard procedure for measuring regional lung ventilation of small animals, such as the zzso as a baseline for further zzso 

We performed zzso zzso zzso MR imaging of the lungs of 2 healthy and 2 zzso mice that were spontaneously breathing diluted zzso zzso zzso From the three zzso MR images acquired by varying the flip angle of the zzso zzso pulse, we calculated the time constant of regional recovery, zzso which represents the time required for zzso zzso zzso to be replenished approximately zzso after destruction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso After calculating the zzso zzso we examined the zzso of our zzso 

We used diluted xenon from the zzso system to acquire zzso zzso zzso MR images of the mouse lung that were undiminished under spontaneous zzso The averaged zzso values were longer for the zzso lungs than for the healthy zzso which reflected ventilation defects in the zzso zzso 

This procedure permitted us to estimate the regional lung ventilation for any arbitrarily set zzso and it will provide a standard for measuring regional lung ventilation as a baseline for further zzso
