To evaluate the usefulness of MR sequences for the differential diagnosis of spinal zzso zzso which mimic zzso disc zzso 

We analyzed six patients with zzso zzso who had symptoms mimicking zzso disc zzso The study group consisted of three women and three men who were zzso zzso zzso zzso years zzso Patients were zzso in the zzso and zzso planes with a zzso MR scanner using a spine zzso 

The level of zzso were accurate in zzso (six of zzso of patients with MR zzso zzso examinations revealed an zzso soft tissue mass which were zzso to zzso compared to spinal zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso zzso By contrast study, diffuse homogeneous or slightly zzso enhancements were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso can have zzso disc disease zzso zzso may zzso and rapidly reveal the presence of spinal zzso and degree of extension to the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso should be included in the differential diagnosis of zzso symptoms caused by disc zzso
