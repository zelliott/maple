The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of zzso PET to characterize adrenal zzso in patients with proven or suspected zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed on 50 adrenal zzso in 41 patients, whose PET scans were done to evaluate the primary or zzso zzso CT had shown 50 adrenal zzso in 41 patients and zzso had revealed 13 zzso in 10 zzso There were 34 patients with proven zzso zzso lung cancer, 3 zzso cancer, 2 zzso cancer, and 1 zzso and 7 with lung zzso Of the 50 zzso 18 were eventually determined to be zzso either by zzso zzso zzso 7) or by follow-up zzso zzso zzso The remaining 32 zzso were proven or assumed to be benign by zzso zzso zzso 4) or clinical follow-up zzso zzso zzso Unlike previously published reports, PET was interpreted as positive if the zzso was equal to or greater than that of the zzso 

No zzso zzso yielded a negative result on zzso Most zzso zzso showed significantly higher zzso zzso than that of the zzso In the remaining 5 zzso (2 zzso from neuroendocrine zzso 2 early zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was equal to or slightly higher than that of the zzso Of the 32 benign zzso there were 2 zzso with zzso equal to or slightly higher than that of the liver, 3 with zzso less than the liver but more than the background, and 27 with zzso of the zzso zzso identified 3 of the 13 zzso as zzso but zzso PET correctly identified all 3 as zzso The other 10 adrenal zzso accurately diagnosed by zzso were also characterized by zzso zzso PET for characterization of adrenal zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso 

zzso PET showed excellent diagnostic performance in zzso adrenal zzso detected on CT or zzso Because zzso PET has the additional advantage of evaluating the primary zzso as well as zzso it could be cost-effective and the zzso of choice for the characterization of adrenal zzso especially in patients with zzso
