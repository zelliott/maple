The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection and grading of soft tissue zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 20 zzso of the zzso were zzso using zzso corrected zzso zzso zzso zzso values zzso and zzso ratios zzso were compared with zzso parameters using French and Japanese grading zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso and TNT could differentiate between zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso 6) zzso and high-grade zzso 2 and 3; zzso zzso zzso zzso according to the French grading system zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso max zzso and TNT correlated with zzso score, zzso score, the French and Japanese grading system zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is able to zzso zzso and differentiate between zzso and high-grade zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with the proliferation of zzso
