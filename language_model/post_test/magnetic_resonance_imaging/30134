Previous studies investigating the anterior zzso zzso zzso have relied on a number of tasks which involved cognitive control and zzso zzso In this zzso study, we tested the model that zzso functions as an zzso network in the processing of zzso We employed a paradigm that requires the processing of concurrent linguistic information predicting that the cognitive costs imposed by competing trials would zzso the zzso of zzso zzso were confronted with sentences where the semantic content conflicted with the zzso zzso zzso zzso randomly zzso with sentences which conveyed coherent discourse components zzso zzso We observed the zzso of the zzso zzso and the middle frontal zzso when the zzso condition was zzso from the zzso zzso Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of the zzso zzso in the processing of complex competing linguistic zzso supporting theories that claim its relevance as a part of the cortical zzso zzso The processing of emotional zzso involved a bilateral network encompassing the superior and zzso zzso zzso This evidence confirms previous research investigating the zzso network that supports the processing of emotional zzso
