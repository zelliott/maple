We have prepared a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso technique and found that the zzso efficiency could be precisely controlled according to the portion of zzso and the capping zzso that covers the surface of the zzso zzso The zzso and temperature dependence on zzso measured by a zzso quantum interference device, demonstrate that there was no size effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The size distribution and zzso zzso of prepared zzso were measured using magnetic resonance imaging for analysis of the effect of zzso and it was verified that zzso of the zzso zzso provide enhanced relaxation zzso
