In group average zzso we zzso the classical zzso zzso test to account for zzso zzso uncertainties associated with the estimated zzso Our test statistic is defined as the maximum likelihood ratio corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso significance level is zzso using the same sign zzso framework as in Holmes et zzso allowing for exact specificity control under a mild symmetry assumption about the subjects' zzso Because our likelihood ratio test does not rely on zzso it is potentially more sensitive than both the standard zzso test and its zzso zzso We present results from the zzso Imaging Analysis Contest 2005 zzso to support this zzso
