The zzso sign is a newly described form of zzso tear progressing from the zzso zzso of zzso ligaments zzso through the lateral zzso wall; the tear occurs during anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zip sign on knee zzso within the context of zzso zzso 

From a series of 261 MR examinations for acute knee injury, we selected 97 patients with both MR and zzso data for a retrospective blinded zzso The zip sign was defined on zzso thin MR sections as a straight line from the zzso zzso of zzso in association with five zzso images lateral to the zzso cruciate ligament zzso where the zzso were zzso zzso and specificity in detecting lateral zzso tears before and after having defined the zip sign were zzso 

zzso in detecting the tears of the zzso horn of the lateral zzso zzso reached zzso zzso zzso after zip sign criteria were zzso The zip sign has excellent zzso agreement, zzso 

The zip sign indicates a zzso at the zzso site of zzso into the zzso on thin zzso images associated with zzso MR sections that may improve MR sensitivity in detecting zzso zzso
