zzso resonance zzso zzso is a zzso in zzso imaging technique that can directly assess the living zzso in localized brain regions without involving zzso zzso This review provides a brief description of zzso followed by a literature review of the key zzso findings in bipolar zzso 

We conducted a zzso literature review for the period zzso and included all the controlled studies using MRS in bipolar disorder, as well as other relevant papers with important zzso 

Studies showed an increase in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso and cingulate, and a decrease in zzso prefrontal cortical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso levels were decreased in the zzso state and were higher in the manic and depressive zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso treatment and this decrease was positively correlated with treatment zzso 

The findings from MRS studies of bipolar disorder demonstrate zzso in the zzso of key brain regions participating in the zzso circuits implicated in the zzso of the zzso These findings suggest abnormalities of the membrane zzso zzso cellular energy metabolism and zzso formation zzso in the zzso cingulate, zzso and zzso zzso in bipolar zzso Further studies are needed to distinguish between the changes that are due to the zzso of bipolar disorder and those due to the effects of zzso
