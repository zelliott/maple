Recent developments in magnetic resonance zzso have made it possible to obtain zzso of the zzso within brain zzso zzso blood volume zzso maps calculated from dynamic zzso MR imaging are particularly sensitive for depicting the zzso and can enable the detection of zzso as well as its zzso in relative zzso The purpose of the present work is to compare the results of zzso maps calculated from MR imaging with those from zzso examination of the same region of zzso the biopsy zzso zzso patients with brain zzso were studied (18 brain tumors and one case of multiple zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso and calculation of zzso was performed from zzso MR zzso Three zzso parameters were zzso the number of vessels zzso zzso the vessel size and the surface area filled by vessels zzso We observed a statistically significant correlation between the vessel density and the zzso which is consistent with some previous zzso A zzso imaging method for characterizing the functional properties, especially zzso activity, of zzso processes seems to be of great benefit to clinical zzso
