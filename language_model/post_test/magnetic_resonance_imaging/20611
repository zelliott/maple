The role of extent of tumor zzso in improving outcome for patients with zzso zzso zzso is still under zzso 

To analyze zzso and zzso agreement of manual zzso as a method for zzso assessment of zzso zzso 

Three observers performed zzso assessment of zzso tumor volume zzso and zzso tumor volume zzso by manual zzso on zzso zzso zzso data sets of 8 zzso zzso were repeated after a minimum zzso of 2 zzso zzso and zzso agreement for zzso zzso and residual tumor volume zzso percentage were expressed in zzso correlation zzso zzso 

zzso agreement is high for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement is high for zzso zzso zzso zzso but low for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso assessment of zzso volume seems to offer high zzso agreement, but low zzso zzso Using absolute zzso values to relate extent of tumor zzso with survival may be zzso More research is needed before this method can be used as a valid end point for clinical zzso zzso tumor volume calculation may increase zzso agreement in the zzso
