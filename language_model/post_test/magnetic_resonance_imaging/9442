While the zzso of zzso syndrome zzso remains zzso it is assumed that both peripheral and central components are zzso 

To investigate central zzso patterns following zzso muscle pain we zzso injected zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution into the left zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle of female zzso patients and female healthy control subjects zzso The injection of zzso has the advantage that it is not prone to zzso compared to zzso and zzso saline zzso During the repetitive injections continuous pain ratings were recorded and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso were zzso 

zzso of zzso led to zzso of the anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso primary sensory cortex, bilateral zzso and thalamus, left zzso zzso left zzso zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso were found only in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the primary zzso zzso The contrast between the groups revealed significantly stronger zzso for zzso patients in the left anterior zzso Peak pain ratings were comparable between HC and zzso patients, but pain duration zzso zzso was prolonged in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of muscle tissue led to a more prolonged perception of pain and more zzso zzso in zzso brain areas in zzso especially in the left zzso zzso whereas acute zzso pain processing was similar in the two zzso These data provide further evidence for enhanced central pain processing in zzso zzso
