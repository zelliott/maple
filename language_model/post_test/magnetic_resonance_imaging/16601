Although previous animal studies have shown structural changes in zzso hypertension such as zzso of the zzso such changes have not been thoroughly studied in human glaucoma patients nor correlation made with clinical zzso Our aim was to investigate zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso using zzso MR imaging and correlation with the clinical stage of zzso 

Twenty-six patients with known zzso and 26 zzso healthy volunteers were included in this institutional review zzso zzso All subjects underwent imaging on a zzso MR imaging system with a zzso and zzso zzso zzso height and volume were measured by 2 blinded zzso zzso were compared and correlated with clinical glaucoma severity as assessed by zzso threshold visual field zzso 

Average maximum zzso height in patients with glaucoma on zzso images was zzso zzso zzso zzso (right) and zzso zzso zzso zzso (left), significantly less zzso zzso zzso than respective zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso With the zzso zzso such respective zzso were also less zzso zzso zzso in patients with glaucoma zzso zzso zzso zzso right, zzso zzso zzso zzso left) versus respective zzso in volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso right, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Average zzso volumes in the patient group were zzso zzso zzso zzso (right) and zzso zzso zzso zzso (left) with the zzso sequence versus respective zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso All height and volume zzso were greater in volunteers zzso zzso zzso In the patient group, both maximum height and volume of the zzso with both sequences were significantly correlated with cumulative clinical glaucoma stage zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging zzso of zzso height and volume are diminished in patients with glaucoma, with the extent of zzso zzso to clinical stage, suggesting a novel imaging marker of disease zzso
