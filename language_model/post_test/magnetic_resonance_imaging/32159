zzso patients were known to have zzso abnormalities for decades and several studies had found zzso impairment to be a biological marker of zzso In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the neural circuits responsible for zzso deficits in zzso Ten normal controls and 10 zzso schizophrenia patients performed zzso tasks and control tasks during zzso Data were analyzed and zzso zzso were identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso In normal subjects, zzso tasks activated bilateral frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, inferior frontal zzso superior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso visual cortex, zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso zzso By contrast, schizophrenia patients failed to show zzso in bilateral zzso nucleus, bilateral thalamus, and left inferior frontal zzso during zzso zzso Our findings suggest that schizophrenic zzso deficits are associated with dysfunction of zzso circuits previously demonstrated to be responsible for suppression of the reflexive zzso Left inferior frontal zzso which was known to be responsible for response zzso on zzso testing, also plays an important role in schizophrenic zzso zzso
