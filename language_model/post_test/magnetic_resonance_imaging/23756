The value of zzso with zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso short zzso inversion recovery zzso sequences that suppress fat zzso to detect and characterize cervical zzso zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied in patients with zzso cell zzso of the head and zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso displayed in similar planes, were compared with the zzso findings in 15 neck dissection specimens from 12 patients with zzso cell zzso of the head and neck (9 with unilateral and 3 with bilateral neck zzso zzso were evaluated zzso with regard to the zzso zzso compartments zzso of the zzso In addition, in 8 of these patients, the zzso activity of dissected zzso zzso of 10 neck sides was measured immediately after surgery in a gamma counter and expressed as percentage of the injected dose per gram tissue zzso 

zzso zzso zzso levels were evaluated zzso The high sensitivity of zzso zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso which correctly detected zzso zzso involvement in 22 of 24 levels, and the high specificity of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso for zzso which correctly characterized as negative 35 of 38 zzso zzso levels without zzso on zzso led to a combined zzso zzso accuracy of zzso zzso zzso was particularly effective in excluding involvement in 9 zzso neck levels with zzso enlarged zzso zzso on zzso but failed to confirm involvement in 5 other zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso in 53 zzso zzso with confirmed zzso involvement was significantly higher than zzso in 145 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso muscle and fat tissue but clearly lower than zzso zzso zzso 

Although zzso zzso is not sensitive enough to be used as an independent imaging zzso for staging of the neck, its zzso application with zzso appears to be an accurate method for the assessment of regional spread in head and neck zzso cell zzso The ability of zzso zzso to characterize neck zzso detected by zzso appears to be based on the difference in zzso concentration found in zzso zzso with and without tumor zzso
