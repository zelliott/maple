In zzso lobe zzso it remains to be clarified whether zzso sclerosis is the cause or the consequence of zzso We studied the zzso evolution of the zzso in the zzso model of zzso in the rat with magnetic resonance imaging zzso to determine the progressive zzso changes occurring before the appearance of chronic zzso 

zzso was performed on an MR scanner operating at zzso zzso We followed the evolution of zzso using zzso and zzso sequences before and after the injection of zzso from 2 h to 9 zzso 

At 2 h after status zzso zzso a zzso barrier breakdown could be observed only in the zzso it had disappeared by 6 zzso At 24 h after SE, zzso was present in the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso together with extensive zzso zzso it disappeared progressively over a zzso zzso During the chronic phase, a cortical signal zzso in all zzso this signal corresponded to zzso which appeared on zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso stained sections as zzso zzso with thickened zzso In the zzso the correlation between zzso and zzso signal underscored the progressive constitution of zzso and zzso starting 2 days after zzso 

These data show the zzso of the zzso that characterizes the initial step leading to the development of zzso and the late zzso that could result from the spontaneous zzso Moreover, it appears that zzso sclerosis progressively worsened and could be both the cause and the consequence of zzso zzso
