To investigate the role of zzso zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso rendering for diagnostic information of symptomatic zzso zzso in zzso transitional zzso 

The study population consisted of 18 patients with symptomatic zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) in zzso transitional zzso Each patient underwent zzso zzso zzso echo sequences with selective water zzso using the principles of the selective zzso technique zzso zzso zzso changes of the zzso nerve roots at the symptomatic and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated on zzso MR rendered images of the zzso zzso 

Ten cases with symptomatic zzso zzso showed zzso and degenerative zzso of the zzso zzso and/or zzso at the lateral margin of the zzso zzso On zzso MR zzso zzso zzso of the zzso nerve roots was found in two cases, while swelling of the nerve roots was seen in eight cases at the zzso nerve zzso Eight cases with zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and degenerative zzso of the zzso zzso and/or zzso at the lateral margin of the zzso zzso Based on zzso MR zzso zzso zzso or swelling of the zzso nerve roots was not found in any cases with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso MR zzso zzso zzso the zzso or swelling of the zzso nerve root in symptomatic zzso zzso Based on these findings, zzso MR zzso may be helpful in the diagnosis of the symptomatic zzso zzso with zzso transitional zzso
