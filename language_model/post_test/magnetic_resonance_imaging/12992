A dramatic paradigm shift is taking place in our understanding of the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso An important contribution to such a shift has been made possible by the advances in magnetic resonance imaging zzso technology, which allows structural damage to be zzso in the brains of patients with zzso and to be followed over the course of the zzso Modern quantitative MR techniques have reshaped the picture of zzso leading to the definition of the zzso called zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso or density are important zzso of functional impairment in zzso zzso derived from zzso transfer and zzso zzso enable us to zzso the extent of structural changes occurring within zzso zzso and zzso zzso (including gray zzso with increased pathological specificity over conventional zzso to irreversible tissue zzso zzso MR zzso adds valuable pieces of information on the zzso nature of such zzso Finally, functional zzso can provide new insights into the role of cortical zzso changes in limiting the clinical consequences of zzso irreversible structural zzso Our current understanding of the zzso of zzso is that this is not only a disease of the white matter, characterized by focal inflammatory zzso but also a disease involving more subtle and diffuse damage throughout the white and gray zzso The inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process are present from the earliest zzso zzso of the disease, but appear to be, at least zzso zzso In addition, recovery and repair play an important role in the genesis of the clinical manifestations of the disease, involving both structural changes and plastic reorganization of the zzso This new picture of zzso has important implications in the context of treatment options, since it suggests that agents that protect against zzso or promote tissue repair may have an important role to play alongside agents acting on the inflammatory component of the zzso
