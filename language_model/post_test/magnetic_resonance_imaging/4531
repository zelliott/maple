zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a new zzso technique for imaging cerebral zzso Studies of the human central auditory zzso examined responses in eight normal hearing volunteers following auditory zzso including narrative speech and zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated by zzso is modeled on an increase in regional blood flow with increased zzso zzso The zzso signals represent zzso concentration changes in zzso within the region of the brain that is zzso Brain zzso was zzso in the superior zzso zzso during text reading and pure zzso zzso in both text and zzso presentation did not vary with the intensity of the auditory stimulus and zzso a dominant response in the left zzso zzso These observations demonstrate the capability of zzso to correlate zzso and functional relationships in the human central auditory zzso
