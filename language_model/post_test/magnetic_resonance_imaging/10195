Performance of automated methods to isolate brain from zzso zzso in magnetic resonance zzso structural images may be influenced by MR signal zzso type of MR image set, regional zzso and age and diagnosis of subjects zzso The present study compared the performance of four zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso Smith zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Research Institute, Medical College of zzso in zzso a zzso Watershed zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and Brain Surface zzso zzso Sandor and Leahy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso to manually stripped zzso The methods were applied to zzso and zzso zzso Legacy and Contemporary zzso image zzso and four diagnostic groups zzso zzso young and elderly zzso To provide a criterion for outcome assessment, two experts manually stripped six zzso sections for each zzso in locations where brain and zzso tissue are difficult to zzso zzso were compared on zzso similarity zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso tended to perform better on contemporary zzso bias correction did not significantly improve method zzso zzso sections were most difficult for all zzso Although zzso image sets were most difficult to strip, zzso and zzso were more robust across diagnostic groups compared with zzso and zzso With respect to zzso zzso tended to perform best across all groups, whereas zzso was more sensitive than other zzso The results of this study may direct users towards a method appropriate to their zzso zzso and improve the efficiency of processing for large, zzso zzso zzso
