The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of dynamic MR zzso with the zzso enhanced zzso Fast zzso sequence in the zzso zzso The zzso Fast zzso sequence was used for sequential imaging of the zzso system with a frame rate of 3 zzso in a 256 zzso 192 zzso Dynamic sequential acquisition was performed for 51 zzso before and after the injection of 30 zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso Dynamic images of the zzso system were obtained in the rabbit zzso Dynamic MR zzso provides better functional information than conventional MR zzso
