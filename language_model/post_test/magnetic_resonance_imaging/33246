zzso who are exposed to a traumatic event are at increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders such as zzso stress disorder zzso Studies have shown that increased zzso activity is frequently found in patients with zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso number in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso has been found to be a significant predictor for the development of zzso zzso Research in zzso has shown that the response of zzso zzso zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated zzso number in zzso and zzso function in zzso 

To investigate whether peripheral zzso number is related to zzso zzso we assessed zzso number in zzso of healthy soldiers before their deployment to zzso zzso functioning was assessed with zzso before and after zzso 

We found that zzso zzso number was significantly zzso correlated to zzso zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso number predicted the increase in zzso activity by zzso 

Our results demonstrate that peripheral zzso number is associated with zzso functioning and predicts the increase in zzso activity following military deployment in healthy individuals who did not develop zzso It is uncertain how this relationship is zzso zzso but future studies should examine the relation of zzso and zzso activity to determine whether this is part of a common zzso leading to increased vulnerability to stress-related zzso
