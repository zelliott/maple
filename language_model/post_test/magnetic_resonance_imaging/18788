The relation between blood pressure level and degree of global brain zzso is zzso We evaluated past and present blood pressure levels and change in blood pressure over 20 years in relation to the degree of cortical zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso In zzso we measured blood pressure and performed zzso in zzso zzso elderly (age zzso zzso For zzso of these, we had information on a blood pressure level 20 years zzso The degree of cortical zzso was zzso scored zzso zzso In late life, a high zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso blood pressure were associated with more cortical zzso than a zzso blood pressure level between zzso zzso zzso difference zzso units zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso units zzso zzso zzso whose zzso blood pressure had declined more than 10 zzso over 20 years had more cortical zzso than those with stable blood pressure levels zzso difference zzso units, zzso Both high and declining zzso blood pressure levels are associated with more global brain zzso on zzso
