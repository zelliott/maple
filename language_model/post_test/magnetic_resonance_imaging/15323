We used zzso to study brain activity associated with the performance of a zzso sequence of complex movements of the zzso zzso in a group of 13 Parkinson's disease patients and a group of 11 control zzso Patients were scanned zzso zzso In controls, sequential movements led to the zzso of bilateral zzso and zzso cortex, bilateral inferior zzso cortex, supplementary motor area, bilateral zzso and zzso zzso and the left zzso lateral nucleus of the zzso zzso movements in the Parkinson's disease group were associated with a similar pattern of zzso although relative decrease of zzso in zzso and zzso areas was zzso Patients in comparison with controls showed a zzso in zzso zzso areas and a zzso in structures of the zzso motor zzso Furthermore, patient scores in the motor scale of the zzso correlated positively with the zzso zzso and motor cortical areas during the sequential motor zzso We concluded that in Parkinson's disease there is a zzso mechanism of the zzso deficit in zzso motor circuits that increases participation in the execution of motor tasks of zzso zzso zzso
