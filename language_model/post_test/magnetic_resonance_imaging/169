Although elevated zzso has been speculated to play a key role in zzso aneurysm zzso zzso little is known about the specific zzso zzso that triggers zzso vascular zzso We previously demonstrated zzso zzso characteristic of zzso initiation occurring in zzso regions of combined high wall zzso stress zzso and high zzso zzso near the zzso of an zzso created carotid zzso This study examines whether this zzso zzso the molecular changes found in zzso and whether molecular changes also zzso to specific zzso zzso 

De zzso zzso were surgically created using both native common carotid arteries in each of 6 zzso zzso were zzso 2 weeks or 2 months after surgery by high-resolution zzso zzso from which flow fields were obtained by zzso fluid dynamics zzso zzso harvested zzso demonstrating early zzso changes near the zzso were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these molecules were zzso with zzso fluid dynamics zzso 

The zzso wall showed decreased zzso zzso oxide zzso expression compared with surrounding zzso the feeding artery, and native controls, whereas all other markers zzso zzso zzso indicated the absence of inflammatory cells in the zzso zzso zzso molecular marker zzso with flow fields revealed confinement of these molecular changes within the zzso region of high zzso and high, positive zzso zzso 

zzso zzso induced by combined high zzso and high, positive zzso zzso is associated with molecular changes implicated in zzso
