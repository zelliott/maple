The zzso scheme can significantly affect the quality of fast zzso zzso images because the echo zzso is modulated as a function of the echo position in zzso The effects of the zzso in two-dimensional zzso imaging include zzso and blurring artifacts and resolution loss in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso imaging, the use of two zzso directions presents the opportunity for improved zzso zzso A new scheme for assignment of echoes to views in zzso zzso termed zzso has been zzso This scheme distributes zzso effects along both zzso directions, allowing considerable flexibility in the selection of blurring artifact zzso In a set of simulations, phantom experiments, and in zzso experiments, the performance of the generalized zzso scheme for zzso zzso imaging was compared with the performance of existing zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the generalized zzso scheme can be used to reduce blurring artifacts greatly relative to other zzso techniques that are presently in zzso This approach to zzso can be used to manipulate the blurring artifact appearance and to zzso acquisition zzso
