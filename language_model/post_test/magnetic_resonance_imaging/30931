To determine the extent to which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may improve detection and definition of the zzso zone in patients with focal zzso of cortical development zzso 

zzso zzso zzso to magnetic resonance zzso images zzso were constructed for 22 consecutive patients with focal zzso who underwent zzso zzso injection (18 zzso and four zzso In the 17 patients who had zzso surgery, zzso between the site of zzso zzso and site of surgical zzso was determined by zzso of zzso images with zzso zzso 

zzso images were zzso in 19 zzso patients, including eight of the 10 with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso with scalp zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso Eight patients whose zzso zzso was zzso with the surgical zzso site had lower zzso seizure frequency scores zzso p zzso zzso and greater zzso improvement in zzso zzso zzso zzso than the nine patients whose zzso was either zzso or zzso On multiple zzso analysis, a model combining zzso zzso with surgical zzso site and extent of zzso zzso zzso was zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso using the zzso technique provides useful information for seizure zzso in patients with focal zzso even when zzso is zzso
