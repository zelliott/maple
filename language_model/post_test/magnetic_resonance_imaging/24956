We studied the relation between quantitative zzso zzso zzso data and visually defined zzso zzso zzso findings in children with intractable zzso zzso and determined whether zzso zzso data are zzso of zzso zzso onset zzso 

Thirteen children zzso zzso zzso underwent prolonged zzso zzso recording, using zzso to zzso zzso zzso Three distinct zzso segments of the continuous zzso zzso recording were selected for each patient, and the spike frequency for each channel was determined by using an automatic zzso zzso zzso the average spike frequency of each zzso was compared with zzso assessment zzso spread, and no early zzso zzso In addition, 50 distinct zzso spikes were averaged for each patient, and the zzso and zzso after the leading spike zzso spike showing the earliest zzso were measured for each zzso and analyzed with respect to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso pattern derived from three zzso segments was high zzso W, zzso zzso zzso zzso showing the highest spike frequency, the highest spike zzso and the leading spike were found to be a part of the seizure onset in 13 of 13, 12 of 13, and 10 of 13 cases, zzso There was significant correlation between zzso assessment and spike frequency as well as spike zzso A receiver operating characteristics analysis showed that a zzso threshold at zzso of the zzso spike frequency resulted in a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of zzso for the detection of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso may predict zzso zones in children with intractable zzso zzso
