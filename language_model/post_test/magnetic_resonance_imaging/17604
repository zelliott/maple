The paper analyzes the experience gained in using a molecular resonance zzso in 145 patients with tumors of the base of the skull and zzso The zzso zzso zzso molecular resonance apparatus is an zzso bipolar device that is specially designed for zzso zzso on the zzso Due to the fact that the temperature at the site of a cut does not exceed zzso degrees C, the apparatus has the minimum effect on zzso nerves, nerve ending, and blood vessels, permitting a surgeon to make interventions into sophisticated zzso zzso The apparatus operates in the modes zzso and zzso that enable operations to be performed on particularly minor and fine zzso While working on brain zzso it is particularly important that there is no zzso injury, tissue zzso or sticking effect due to low working zzso The possibility of zzso making zzso and tissue dissection reduces the time of an operation and considerably decreases the extent of blood zzso The clinical case given in this paper demonstrates the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso molecular resonance apparatus used in an zzso tumor of the bases of the zzso One zzso operated in different modes may provide sparing zzso of minor cortical zzso reduce the volume of a tumor through its bloodless zzso arrest bleeding from the zzso zzso sticking zzso prepare nerves in the upper lid slit and cavernous zzso The zzso zzso zzso molecular resonance surgical apparatus is recommended for zzso care to perform brain operations requiring great caution in handling the zzso being operated zzso
