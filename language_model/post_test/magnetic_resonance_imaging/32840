zzso zzso limits the zzso of pelvic floor motion measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Our aim was to develop a zzso program measuring pelvic floor motion in a zzso and refined zzso 

zzso floor anatomy and motion during voluntary contraction zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso in 64 women with zzso zzso zzso and 64 zzso zzso A zzso measured zzso angles and zzso junction zzso A zzso program did the same and also dissected zzso motion into perpendicular zzso representing the zzso and other pelvic floor muscles, assessed the zzso angle, and evaluated pelvic zzso 

Manual and zzso zzso of zzso junction motion zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso during squeeze and zzso were zzso as were zzso angles at rest, zzso and zzso angle change during squeeze or zzso was less zzso zzso zzso of zzso and pelvic zzso motion were also zzso within zzso During zzso zzso injury was associated zzso zzso zzso with smaller zzso but not pelvic floor motion zzso reflecting impaired zzso zzso The zzso angle, reflecting zzso pelvic floor motion, was smaller during squeeze and larger during zzso However, zzso angles and pelvic rotation during squeeze and zzso did not differ significantly between zzso and zzso 

This zzso program provides a zzso efficient, and refined analysis of pelvic floor motion by zzso zzso injury is independently associated with impaired motion of zzso not other pelvic floor muscles in controls and women with zzso
