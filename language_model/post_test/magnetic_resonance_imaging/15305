In middle cerebral artery zzso stroke, zzso usually is zzso distributed within the zzso zzso We sought to investigate which brain structures are critical for the acute neurological deficit in severe zzso zzso 

We used magnetic resonance zzso imaging and statistical zzso mapping in 64 consecutive stroke patients zzso zzso zzso to study the pattern of the initial zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso progression had more severe zzso zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso in the inferior frontal zzso superior zzso zzso zzso and underlying zzso white matter than those with zzso zzso Also, patients with zzso progression had more severe zzso abnormalities on day 8 than those with zzso zzso In contrast, the changes of water diffusion were similar among the two groups resulting in a zzso mismatch in zzso zzso zzso were related to the neurological deficit score zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and cerebral artery abnormalities assessed on zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In major zzso stroke zzso was most severe in the central portion of the zzso zzso It is suggested that involvement of zzso white matter zzso the neurological deficit probably by affecting zzso and zzso zzso
