The goal of this work was to determine the molecular basis for the induction of zzso zzso and progression by zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso studies demonstrated that administration of wound fluid derived from zzso injuries in pigs reduced the lag for zzso and initiation of growth of zzso zzso zzso implanted in nude mice, and accelerated zzso doubling zzso The former effect can be attributed to the zzso capacity of wound fluid as detected in zzso by zzso and in zzso in promoting zzso cell zzso The latter effect, namely the induced rate of zzso growth, is consistent with the zzso activity of wound fluid as well as with the finding that wound fluid was directly zzso to the zzso cells, and accelerated growth of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Of the multiple growth factors present in wound fluid, two key factors, zzso zzso growth factor zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso were identified as the dominant zzso for zzso zzso and zzso of their activity using specific zzso zzso suppressed the zzso effect of wound fluid on DNA synthesis in zzso zzso This study suggests that the zzso effect of injury on zzso progression can possibly be attenuated by therapeutic targeting directed against a limited number of specific growth zzso
