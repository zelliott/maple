The detection and prognosis of prostate cancer in its early stages are critically zzso It is therefore essential to improve the existing dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques commonly used for the assessment of the zzso vascular zzso The goal of this study was to describe a method for the zzso of the zzso input function zzso in zzso zzso by measuring zzso * values in the zzso artery of patients with zzso prostate zzso The calculation of contrast agent zzso was based on zzso zzso determined in whole blood samples for a range of normal zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso corrected for zzso were compared with individual zzso zzso with a mean whole blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso curve at an assumed zzso zzso zzso as well as a population zzso at an assumed zzso zzso zzso The area under the curve of the zzso zzso ranged between zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in magnitude at peak contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Using zzso simulations, the accuracy of the kinetic parameters estimated using individual zzso corrected for zzso demonstrated that, for the use of individual zzso zzso with zzso values differing by more than zzso zzso and zzso values were largely underestimated (up to zzso difference for zzso Moreover, blood volume estimates were severely zzso Estimates of kinetic parameters in zzso prostate cancer patients demonstrated that the zzso rate constant zzso was influenced significantly by the definition of zzso Regardless of whether an individually zzso zzso or a population zzso zzso of all individually zzso zzso was used, zzso mapping of zzso and zzso in the prostate zzso appeared to be more sensitive than with the usual zzso zzso
