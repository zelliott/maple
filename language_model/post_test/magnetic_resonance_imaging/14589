Training can induce significant changes in brain functioning and behavioral zzso One consequence of training is changing the pattern of brain zzso zzso training is of interest because abacus experts gain the ability to handle digits with unusual speed and zzso However, the neural zzso of zzso memory in zzso children remain zzso In the current study, we aimed to detect a training effect of zzso mental calculations on zzso working memory in zzso We measured brain functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso patterns in 17 zzso children and 17 control children as they performed two zzso working memory tasks zzso and zzso zzso zzso results revealed higher zzso in zzso children than in the controls in the right zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the right supplementary motor area zzso in both zzso When these regions were used as seeds in a functional connectivity analysis of the resting brain, the zzso children showed significantly enhanced integration between the right zzso and the right inferior frontal zzso zzso The zzso is considered to be the key region for the control of zzso These findings demonstrate that extensive engagement of the zzso network occurs during zzso memory tasks in the zzso zzso Furthermore, abacus training may increase the functional integration of zzso circuitry, which and thus enhances high-level cognitive zzso
