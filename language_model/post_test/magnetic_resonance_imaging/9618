Variations in frontal lobe zzso functional zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that mapping on an individual rather than group level may give greater insight regarding zzso of the neural zzso involved in depression, as well as potentially provide more specific or individualized treatment plans for depressed zzso We designed a functional zzso task capable of imaging FL activity in individuals, including the zzso region, using a transient sadness zzso We sought to develop a method that may better detect individual differences of FL zzso related to sadness, since this region has been implicated to show zzso in zzso The task was based on a block design that also zzso individual differences in zzso to a sadness induction zzso Individual differences from nine zzso healthy volunteers were zzso We also performed functional connectivity analyses to further characterize our findings to the networks associated with the zzso in each zzso The study was designed to account for individual variation rather than using a true experimental zzso therefore, no control group was zzso As expected, due to zzso zzso the specific site of zzso zzso during sadness varied across zzso zzso was also observed in other brain regions consistent with other studies of induced sadness and zzso zzso of functional connectivity to the zzso also highlighted neural circuits known to zzso sadness and zzso This task promises to more precisely zzso a given zzso functional organization of the brain zzso underlying sadness, and potentially depression, in an efficient, standardized zzso This task could potentially aid in providing individualized targets in the treatment of zzso
