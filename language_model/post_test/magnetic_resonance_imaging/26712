In this study, we compared the blood oxygen zzso zzso signal changes between zzso load of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which elicit the zzso zzso An zzso load of 30 zzso zzso or 60 zzso zzso induced a zzso signal increase in several brain regions, including the nucleus of the solitary tract zzso lateral zzso zzso and insular zzso Only zzso increased the zzso signal in the zzso zzso The time course of the zzso signal changes in the zzso and the zzso in the zzso group was different from that of the zzso zzso We further compared the brain regions correlated with the zzso signal change in the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso responses in the zzso and the zzso zzso were associated with zzso of the zzso in both zzso and zzso groups, but the association in the AMG and the zzso was only in zzso zzso These results indicate that gut stimulation with zzso and zzso evoked zzso responses in distinct regions with different zzso patterns and that the mechanism of perception of zzso and zzso in the gastrointestinal tract differed from that in the zzso zzso
