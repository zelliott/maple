Children with zzso demonstrate zzso zzso deficits in a number of areas, including memory zzso However, there is no definitive understanding of the zzso underlying these functional zzso Previous literature has reported that zzso integrity is crucial to the acquisition of new episodic zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso volume zzso are abnormal in patients with zzso and thereby provide a possible zzso for explaining memory zzso 

Twenty-five pediatric patients underwent 159 serial MR imaging examinations zzso zzso six examinations per zzso for up to 5 years after zzso and chemotherapy treatment for zzso Right and left zzso volumes were obtained by manually tracing zzso zzso zzso sections through the zzso Random zzso models were used to examine zzso change in zzso volume as a function of time after zzso 

Both right and left zzso volumes initially decreased after zzso This abnormal volume pattern continued until approximately 2-3 years after diagnosis, when zzso volumes returned toward a normal positive growth zzso Volume loss occurred predominately in the zzso zzso Female sex, low parental education, shunt placement, and positive seizure history all had a significant negative impact on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso survivors demonstrate an abnormal pattern of zzso volume development after zzso zzso dose mapping may expand our understanding of zzso changes in zzso zzso Further exploration of the relationships between radiation therapy, memory dysfunction, and zzso pathology in this population is zzso
