The hardware chosen for zzso data analysis may depend on the platform already present in the laboratory or the supporting zzso In this study, we ran zzso software on multiple platforms to examine whether we could analyze zzso data by zzso and to compare their differences and limitations in processing zzso data, which can be attributed to hardware zzso Six normal right-handed volunteers participated in a study of zzso to obtain zzso zzso Each subject performed a run that consisted of 98 zzso The run was measured using a zzso zzso echo zzso imaging sequence on a zzso apparatus with a head zzso We used several personal computer zzso Unix and Linux machines to analyze the zzso zzso There were no differences in the results obtained on several PC, Unix and Linux zzso The only limitations in processing large amounts of the zzso data were found using PC zzso This suggests that the results obtained with different machines were not affected by differences in hardware zzso such as the zzso memory and hard zzso Rather, it is likely that the limitations in analyzing a huge amount of the zzso data were due to differences in the operating system zzso
