zzso of the cortical zzso network zzso are activated during muscle zzso However, it is not known to what extent CAN zzso patterns reflect muscle sensory zzso zzso signals from the motor cortex, and/or motor drive to cardiovascular zzso The present study explored the functional representation of zzso zzso input within the CAN with an a zzso interest in the zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso Heart rate zzso and functional zzso data were acquired during 1) 30s periods of electrical stimulation of the wrist zzso at zzso zzso Type zzso zzso and 2) motor thresholds zzso Type zzso zzso 3) zzso wrist zzso at zzso zzso voluntary contraction zzso to match the zzso tension zzso and 4) zzso zzso at zzso zzso to elicit zzso zzso Compared with rest, zzso did not change during zzso zzso or zzso but increased during zzso zzso High frequency zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso at rest and zzso zzso during zzso zzso High frequency zzso zzso was decreased during zzso compared to rest zzso zzso increased activity in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased activity in the left zzso zzso and zzso During zzso activity increased in the right zzso zzso zzso was associated with activity in the bilateral zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the left zzso zzso processes sensory input from muscle during passive conditions and specifically that Type I and/or II muscle zzso stimulation during zzso impacts the zzso and/or zzso zzso regions believed to be involved in brain default mode and zzso zzso
