zzso zzso has been associated with a dysfunction of a brain region in the left inferior zzso cortex, called the zzso zzso zzso zzso In adult normal readers, the zzso is specialized for print processing and sensitive to the zzso familiarity of letter zzso However, it is still unclear whether these two levels of zzso specialization are affected in zzso zzso Specifically, we investigated whether zzso these two levels of specialization are impaired in dyslexic children with only a few years of reading experience and zzso whether this impairment is confined to the left inferior zzso zzso or extends to adjacent regions of the zzso with its zzso zzso of print zzso Using zzso we measured brain activity in 18 dyslexic and 24 zzso control children (age zzso zzso while they indicated if visual stimuli zzso words, zzso zzso and zzso sounded like a real zzso Five adjacent regions of interest zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso covered the full zzso extent of the zzso We found that control and dyslexic children activated the same main areas within the reading zzso However, a zzso of print specificity zzso anterior activity to letter strings but higher zzso activity to zzso as well as a constant sensitivity to zzso familiarity zzso activity for unfamiliar than familiar zzso along the zzso could only be detected in zzso In conclusion, analyzing responses and specialization profiles along the left zzso reveals that children with zzso show impaired specialization for both print and zzso
