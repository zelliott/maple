Smaller zzso volumes have been reported in the brains of alcoholic patients than in those of healthy subjects, although it is unclear if the zzso is zzso smaller than the brain as a zzso There is evidence that alcoholic women are more susceptible than alcoholic men to liver and cardiac damage from zzso It is not known whether the zzso of the female brain are more vulnerable to zzso 

We compared the zzso volumes in 52 hospitalized alcoholic men and women with those of 36 healthy zzso men and zzso All subjects were between 27 and 53 years of zzso The zzso volumes were measured from zzso zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso 

The alcoholic women had less lifetime drinking and a later age at onset of heavy drinking than alcoholic zzso Both alcoholic men and women had significantly smaller right zzso and larger zzso fluid volumes than healthy subjects of the same zzso Only among women were the left zzso and the zzso brain volume also significantly zzso The proportion of zzso volume relative to the rest of the brain volume was the same in alcoholic patients and healthy subjects, in both men and zzso The right zzso was larger than the left among all zzso Women demonstrated larger zzso volumes relative to total brain volume than zzso Psychiatric zzso including zzso stress disorder, did not affect zzso zzso 

In chronic alcoholism, the reduction of zzso volume is zzso to the reduction of the brain zzso Alcohol consumption should be accounted for in studies of zzso zzso
