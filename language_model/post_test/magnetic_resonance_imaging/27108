Most animal experiments in zzso require zzso of the experimental zzso For zzso experiments most zzso would prefer zzso a zzso zzso that would zzso allow strong zzso responses which are zzso zzso obtained for the same animal in repetitive zzso Strong zzso responses are particularly needed if weak zzso stimuli like zzso zzso are zzso zzso in contrast to zzso zzso the need for strong zzso but has been traditionally considered as a terminal drug due to its negative zzso side zzso Here it is demonstrated, that new commercial zzso in a careful application scheme allows for repeated zzso studies on the same animal with similar responses after zzso zzso Only minor effects on the normal behavior were observed between zzso These include a longer time to return to baseline values of food zzso and slower tail reaction for the zzso zzso
