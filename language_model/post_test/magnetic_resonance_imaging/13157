To evaluate the efficacy and safety of gamma knife zzso zzso in treating zzso lobe zzso zzso was performed in four adult patients with zzso complex partial zzso who underwent incomplete anterior zzso zzso zzso but were reluctant to undergo a second zzso zzso A marginal dose of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso curve, was delivered to the treatment target that included the residual zzso and the head and anterior body of the zzso None of the patients had severe acute side effects but three patients had zzso zzso signal changes around the target volume 13, 20, and 24 months after zzso zzso All four patients had significant seizure reduction during the first zzso period and clinical efficacy persisted throughout the zzso follow-up zzso All of the patients also had improved zzso profiles, including memory function and zzso compared to their zzso zzso In conclusion, the safety and clinical efficacy of zzso make it a reasonable and suitable therapeutic alternative for patients with zzso zzso after incomplete zzso A higher marginal dose of zzso and wider coverage may be more clinically beneficial but warrant further zzso
