Early and accurate prediction of tissue outcome is essential to the clinical decision-making process in acute zzso zzso We present a quantitative zzso model of tissue fate that combines regional imaging features available after zzso A key component is the use of zzso randomly sampled during the learning zzso Models trained with zzso feature zzso zzso from zzso weighted images zzso are compared to the ones obtained from the apparent diffusion zzso zzso The prediction task is zzso as a zzso problem where the zzso are the local zzso extracted from zzso or zzso images at zzso and the output is the segmented zzso intensity of the tissue 4 days after zzso zzso on 25 acute stroke patients demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting tissue zzso zzso on our zzso show the superiority of the regional model zzso a zzso approach, indicate that zzso regional models outperform zzso models, and demonstrates that a zzso zzso model significantly improves the results in comparison to a linear zzso
