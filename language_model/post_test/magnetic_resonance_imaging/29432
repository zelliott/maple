The purpose of this study was to compare the value of different zzso techniques for the assessment of zzso zzso zzso AND zzso zzso zzso patients zzso age zzso zzso 62 zzso 8 zzso with zzso zzso were examined using zzso before and after zzso The zzso study before treatment consisted of an evaluation of zzso zzso zzso function at rest and during zzso stress, and delayed zzso zzso were correlated with zzso and global cardiac function after zzso 

In initially dysfunctional zzso the likelihood of functional recovery after zzso was zzso for segments without delayed zzso zzso for segments with delayed zzso with zzso extent of zzso or less, and zzso for segments with delayed zzso with zzso extent of more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function at zzso stress zzso indicated functional recovery in zzso whereas functional recovery was observed in only zzso of segments not responding at zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was found between the results of zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso The ejection fraction after zzso was best predicted by the zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A simple protocol consisting of baseline zzso and delayed enhancement zzso studies is adequate to differentiate dysfunctional but viable from zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso zzso studies offer little or no additional zzso
