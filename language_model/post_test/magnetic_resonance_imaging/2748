zzso was revolutionized by the development of zzso zzso zzso and standard zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso resonance imaging and CT can adequately distinguish zzso from zzso and depict zzso stroke 12 to 24 hours after zzso However, during the critical initial hours after the onset of zzso stroke, these imaging technologies do not adequately demonstrate the location and extent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging, as well as advances in magnetic resonance zzso will enhance our ability to evaluate zzso stroke shortly after zzso Some of the uses of zzso techniques are as zzso zzso zzso imaging can depict the location and extent of the zzso zzso as soon as a stroke patient is available for zzso zzso zzso imaging evaluates blood flow within the zzso zzso and can reveal regions of zzso deficits corresponding to major vascular zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso evaluates zzso abnormalities associated with focal brain zzso by specific zzso zzso These zzso techniques will rapidly provide important information to clinicians about zzso guiding diagnosis and helping in the development of acute stroke interventions to improve zzso
