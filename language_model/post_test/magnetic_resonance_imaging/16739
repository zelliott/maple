zzso white matter zzso zzso are recognized with magnetic resonance imaging zzso as zzso on zzso imaging and zzso on zzso zzso Our aim was to assess how often a zzso component was present in zzso using zzso imaging zzso 

zzso zzso zzso age, zzso and seven zzso infants (age at zzso zzso with zzso were zzso Seven zzso infants had sequential zzso zzso were diagnosed with conventional zzso and compared with zzso where signal loss is suggestive of zzso The pattern of associated brain zzso was taken into account, and the percentage of zzso with signal loss on zzso was calculated for each zzso 

A significantly higher percentage of signal loss on zzso zzso zzso was found among infants with zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the primary diagnosis zzso compared to those with a primary diagnosis of white matter injury zzso zzso zzso zzso In the infants with serial zzso a reduction in the number of zzso and/or signal loss on zzso was noted at term equivalent zzso In the patient who died, zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso were demonstrated on zzso 

zzso can distinguish zzso and zzso zzso Signal loss on zzso was more common when zzso were associated with an zzso zzso zzso imaging showed a decrease in the number of zzso over time, with some zzso no longer showing signal loss on zzso suggesting early zzso
