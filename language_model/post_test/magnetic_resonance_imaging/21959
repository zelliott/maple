This study describes the magnetic resonance imaging zzso anatomy of the blood vessels and nerves of the orbit to provide a zzso basis for the interpretation of clinical zzso 

Seven volunteers aged 29 to 54 years underwent high-resolution zzso of the orbit on a 1 zzso unit zzso Siemens, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were obtained using a surface zzso zzso structures on the magnetic resonance images were identified by comparison with corresponding zzso sections of the zzso 

The zzso artery and most of its branches zzso retinal artery, zzso zzso zzso zzso artery, anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso artery, zzso artery, zzso zzso zzso are zzso The superior zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the inferior zzso zzso the zzso and lateral collateral zzso and the zzso veins are also zzso Furthermore, branches of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the frontal zzso the zzso zzso the zzso nerve and the zzso nerve are identified in the magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso is capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso This is mainly based on two zzso First, blood vessels appear mostly dark on magnetic resonance images because of the signal void of flowing zzso Second, the bright background of the zzso fat on zzso magnetic resonance images accounts for the good zzso contrast in the zzso With improved zzso technology and reduced imaging time, zzso may be applied routinely for diagnostic zzso
