To report a reduction in zzso zzso cell complex zzso thickness detected with zzso optical zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso following acquired cerebral zzso 

We analyzed case reports of three patients with unilateral zzso cerebral artery zzso zzso Three patients zzso 66, 68, and 71 zzso with left zzso zzso due to zzso of the right zzso territory were studied using zzso The duration of the zzso from the onset ranged from 12 to 36 zzso 

In all of these patients, although zzso zzso and retinal nerve fiber layer defects were not detected on zzso zzso thinning was demonstrated in the zzso corresponding to the affected zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the localized defects of retinal zzso cells zzso more clearly than zzso retinal nerve fiber layer zzso Total and outer retinal thicknesses were not found to be significantly zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso of zzso can occur within a few years after zzso zzso
