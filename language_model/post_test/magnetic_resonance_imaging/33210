zzso zzso differentiation between old and fresh left zzso zzso after zzso zzso would be of clinical importance to estimate the risk for zzso and the necessity of zzso 

zzso patients, aged 41 to 87 years, with a zzso after zzso zzso were included in this zzso zzso In zzso 20 patients, 10 each with a zzso diagnosis of fresh or old zzso were zzso In the subsequent prospective zzso 32 consecutive patients with an incident zzso after zzso zzso but unknown zzso age were started on zzso and followed for 6 zzso Data on medical history, standard zzso zzso zzso imaging and magnetic resonance zzso were zzso In zzso analysis of zzso deformation revealed the most rapid change in zzso during the zzso relaxation period when cavity pressure decreases zzso Fresh zzso zzso zzso and old zzso zzso zzso could be zzso without overlap by peak zzso during the zzso relaxation period, using a zzso value of 1 zzso zzso this threshold value in zzso 17 zzso were zzso classified as fresh zzso zzso zzso and 15 as zzso After 6 months in the fresh zzso group, 16 of 17 zzso had disappeared zzso and in 1 patient the zzso size was diminished by zzso (now presenting an old zzso zzso zzso In contrast, 14 of the 15 old zzso remained unchanged in size and deformation (1 zzso zzso 

Fresh and old zzso zzso can be reliably differentiated by deformation zzso In fresh zzso zzso with zzso results in zzso resolution in most zzso
