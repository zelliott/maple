To study pure motor bilateral arm zzso of acute zzso This syndrome is as yet a barely described clinical feature attributed to zzso in the territory of the anterior spinal artery zzso 

We present 2 patients with acute onset of pure motor deficit in both upper zzso 

zzso resonance imaging of the cervical spinal zzso revealed zzso in the territory of the zzso In 1 case, zzso further suggested discrete gray matter zzso 

In patients with acute weakness of both arms without further neurological deficits, an incomplete zzso syndrome should be considered with the anterior horns predominantly being zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso are valuable tools to further confirm both location and extension of the spinal zzso
