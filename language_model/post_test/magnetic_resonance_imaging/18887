A new concept of protein dynamics has emerged quite recently, and a crucial link between protein dynamics and function has been largely established using recent zzso techniques in the solution zzso zzso structure is governed by the zzso principle and may not necessarily be unique in the solution zzso zzso zzso protein folding or zzso transition occurs on the zzso to zzso time scale, zzso that in order to prepare the specific nuclear coordinate for the electronic state transition, a protein must rearrange its nuclear coordinates zzso and this process may generally take a long period of time almost comparable to that of protein zzso zzso coordinates zzso for the electronic reaction may form an energy zzso may be called an zzso zzso is zzso distinct from the native zzso In contrast, the native state is called a zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques developed recently may also have useful application to zzso since the critical time scale of various reactions in a living system is also around zzso to zzso
