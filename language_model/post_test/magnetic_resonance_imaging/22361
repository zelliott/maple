Using zzso an increased recruitment of the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso supplementary motor area, and middle frontal zzso has been detected in patients with cervical zzso zzso of possible zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso using zzso whether the level of zzso involvement influences cortical reorganization by comparing patients with isolated zzso of the cervical and the zzso portions of the cord, and to investigate whether the extent of cortical reorganization is associated with the extent of cervical zzso pathology measured using zzso transfer zzso zzso We studied 24 right-handed patients zzso with a previous involvement of the cervical zzso and 10 with an involvement of the zzso zzso in a chronic and clinically stable phase following an isolated zzso of possible zzso origin and 15 zzso and zzso healthy zzso During a single session, we obtained zzso during repetitive zzso of the last four fingers of the right and left hands and cervical zzso zzso zzso Average zzso zzso was lower in patients with cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso Compared to controls and for both tasks, patients with zzso had an increased recruitment of the zzso primary zzso which was independent of the level of zzso zzso On the contrary, patients with cervical zzso had a more widespread recruitment of frontal and zzso regions, whereas those with zzso zzso had a more widespread recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso Strong correlations zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso were found between relative zzso of cortical areas and the severity of cervical zzso zzso Patients with isolated zzso have different patterns of zzso cortical zzso according to the level of zzso zzso This zzso functional reorganization of the zzso is likely to have an zzso role in limiting the clinical outcome of zzso damage and should be considered when designing rehabilitation strategies for these zzso
