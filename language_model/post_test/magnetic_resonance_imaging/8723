We measured brain activities with a whole head zzso zzso to investigate the influence of a background odor on alphabetical zzso of words in 20 healthy volunteers (10 zzso zzso stimulation and control air stimulation were both accomplished with a computer-controlled zzso by providing permanent stimulation zzso zzso data revealed significantly prolonged reaction times in men under the influence of zzso alcohol zzso compared to the control zzso Women did not show a change in reaction time during stimulation with zzso A comparison of men and women revealed significantly shorter reaction times in women for both the odor conditions, as well as for the control zzso Analysis of performance accuracy showed no significant differences between the odor and the control condition within and across zzso Analysis of grand zzso zzso fields and zzso of the underlying equivalent current zzso revealed higher zzso strength in the zzso compared to the control condition in the right hemisphere, over the zzso brain areas, in the time range between 200 and 500 zzso after zzso only in male zzso Within this time range, the zzso effect is interpreted to reflect zzso zzso of word zzso The findings suggest zzso processing strategies in the present task with implications for differences in zzso zzso
