In extending the use of functional zzso to zzso a primary area of concern is that peripheral blood pressure changes induced by pharmacological agents could independently produce a change in the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in difficulties distinguishing or interpreting drug-induced neural zzso In the present study, we zzso intravenous zzso a zzso zzso zzso to increase the mean zzso blood pressure zzso while examining the effects of zzso changes on the zzso signal in zzso zzso zzso infusion significantly increased the zzso from 93 zzso 8 zzso zzso to 106 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not produce a significant global zzso zzso Yet, a few zzso in the anterior zzso showed zzso signal changes that paralleled the changes in blood pressure zzso Our observations support the conclusion that following the infusion of psychoactive agents, brain zzso signals accurately reflect zzso activity, even in the face of relatively large peripheral cardiovascular effects that zzso increase systemic zzso
