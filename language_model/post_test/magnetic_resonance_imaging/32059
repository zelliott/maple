Previously, zzso of zzso transport in the brain zzso was shown to be one of the mechanisms of focused zzso zzso barrier zzso zzso In the present study, we aimed to estimate the rate of the zzso zzso traffic after focused ultrasound zzso in the rabbit brain, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a zzso In the zzso the mean zzso zzso zzso (the number of zzso zzso per zzso of the cell zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 1 h after zzso with ultrasound zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso these zzso were zzso and zzso zzso values zzso and zzso times zzso In control locations, the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso A small number of zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso delivery of zzso zzso was also observed in light zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso play an important role in zzso zzso traffic through the zzso zzso zzso which should be considered in the future development of zzso drug delivery zzso
