A best evidence topic in zzso surgery was written according to a structured zzso The question addressed was which diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combination zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides the best diagnostic and staging information in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, 61 papers were found using the reported search, of which 14 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical zzso The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group zzso study type, relevant outcomes and results are zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is superior to zzso and CT but inferior to zzso in terms of diagnostic zzso sensitivity and staging of zzso Four studies reported outcomes using zzso to diagnose zzso PET diagnosed zzso with high sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso Mean zzso zzso value zzso was higher in zzso than benign disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected with higher accuracy zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Three studies assessed the utility of zzso to diagnose zzso Mean zzso was higher in zzso than benign disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed with high sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and accuracy zzso zzso had low sensitivity for stage zzso zzso and T4 zzso zzso zzso needle biopsy definitively diagnosed zzso after just one biopsy zzso zzso zzso much more often than a zzso zzso CT had a lower success rate zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso biopsy but was equivalent to zzso in terms of detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso and visceral zzso zzso zzso CT had a lower specificity for stage II zzso zzso zzso zzso and stage III zzso zzso zzso zzso disease compared to zzso Overall, the high specificity and sensitivity rates seen with open zzso biopsy make it a superior diagnostic zzso to CT, zzso or PET for diagnosing patients with zzso
