A single brief visual stimulus accompanied by two brief tactile stimuli is frequently perceived incorrectly as two zzso a phenomenon called zzso illusion zzso We investigated whether the zzso is accompanied by changes in rhythmic zzso activity, using zzso in human zzso Twenty-two subjects received zzso stimulation and reported the number of perceived visual zzso We sorted trials with identical physical stimulation according to the reported zzso zzso and assessed differences in spectral power in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso trials, zzso sensors displayed a zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso activity in response to zzso In zzso sensors, the zzso was associated with an increase of spectral power for low zzso zzso zzso around stimulation and a decrease of spectral power in the zzso zzso range between 450 and 750 zzso zzso In zzso several components of rhythmic activity predicted variable zzso experience for constant physical zzso zzso the enhanced zzso zzso activity during zzso was similar in time and frequency extent to the zzso zzso response to tactile zzso We speculate that the zzso might therefore occur when the zzso zzso is transmitted to visual zzso This transmission might be supported by the observed zzso in zzso zzso
