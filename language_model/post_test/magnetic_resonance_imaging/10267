According to the distinctiveness zzso subjects rely more on detailed recollections (and less on zzso when memory is tested for pictures relative to words, leading to reduced false zzso If so, then neural regions that have been implicated in zzso zzso monitoring zzso zzso prefrontal zzso might be recruited less heavily when trying to remember zzso We tested this prediction with the zzso recollection zzso zzso studied black words, paired with either the same word in red font or a corresponding colored zzso Red words were repeated at study to equate recognition hits for red words and zzso During zzso zzso alternating red word memory tests and picture memory tests were given, using only white words as test stimuli zzso zzso only if you zzso a corresponding red word or picture, zzso These tests were designed so that subjects had to rely on memory for the zzso zzso zzso prior behavioral work, we found enhanced rejection of zzso on the picture test compared to the red word test, indicating that subjects had used a distinctiveness zzso zzso zzso prefrontal activity was reduced when rejecting familiar zzso on the picture test, relative to the red word zzso These findings indicate that reducing false recognition via the distinctiveness zzso is not heavily dependent on zzso zzso zzso monitoring zzso
