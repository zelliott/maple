An original method for simultaneous display of functional and zzso images, based on frequency zzso zzso zzso color PET with zzso MR brain images, and zzso PET with zzso color MR zzso A comparison with two other methods reported in the literature for image fusion zzso and intensity zzso zzso was zzso 

For zzso the zzso transform of the merged image was obtained summing the low zzso of the PET image and the high zzso of the MR zzso For image zzso the merged image was obtained as a weighted average of the zzso of the two images to be zzso For intensity zzso the red, green and blue components of the color image were multiplied on a zzso basis by the zzso zzso A comparison of the performances of the three techniques was made by three independent observers assessing the zzso of specific zzso and PET information in the merged zzso For evaluation purposes, images from seven patients and a zzso zzso phantom were zzso Data were compared with a zzso test applied to zzso 

For the depiction of zzso and PET information when merging color PET and zzso MR images, zzso was rated superior to intensity zzso and averaging techniques in a significant number of zzso For merging zzso PET with zzso color MR images, zzso and intensity zzso were rated superior to image averaging in terms of both zzso and PET zzso 

The data suggest that improved simultaneous evaluation of zzso and PET information can be achieved with a method based on zzso
