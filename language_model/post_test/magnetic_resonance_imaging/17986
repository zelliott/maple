The single zzso zzso zzso within the zzso and Sushi multiple zzso zzso gene on zzso has been identified as zzso significant for schizophrenia zzso This gene is of unknown function but has been implicated in multiple zzso disorders that impact upon zzso leading us to zzso that an effect on brain structure and function underlying cognitive processes may be part of the mechanism by which zzso increases illness zzso To test this hypothesis, we investigated this zzso zzso in zzso in healthy participants in a magnetic resonance imaging zzso study comprised of both zzso of spatial working memory zzso and a zzso zzso investigation of zzso and white matter zzso volume zzso zzso of these data indicated that the risk zzso zzso was associated with comparatively reduced cortical zzso in zzso that is, middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso brain regions that support maintenance processes during performance of a spatial working memory zzso zzso there was an absence of significant structural differences in brain volume zzso zzso or zzso In accordance with previous evidence, these data suggest that zzso may mediate brain function related to cognitive processes zzso executive zzso with the relatively deleterious effects of the identified zzso risk zzso on brain activity possibly zzso part of the mechanism by which zzso increases schizophrenia zzso
