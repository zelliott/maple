zzso zzso analysis zzso has been proposed recently as a method to detect time windows of brain responses in functional zzso zzso studies when the timing and location of the zzso are completely zzso zzso to the zzso technique are introduced in this report to further improve the sensitivity in detecting brain zzso The modified zzso is based on the integrated signal intensity of a zzso cluster at each time point, while the original zzso is based only on the size of a zzso cluster at each time zzso A zzso cluster at each time point is zzso in both zzso methods, as a group of zzso reaching their maximum (or zzso values at the same zzso Both computer simulation and in zzso zzso experiments have been zzso Compared with the original zzso the modified zzso shows a significant improvement in the sensitivity to detect zzso zzso for determining time windows of brain zzso
