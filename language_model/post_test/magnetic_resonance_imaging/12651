Assessment of left zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso volume are essential for the evaluation of prognosis in cardiac zzso zzso and zzso volumes can be measured with several imaging zzso such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso however, these are relatively expensive and time zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso assessment is a zzso fast, and reliable technique, but zzso for zzso volumes calculation is less zzso 

zzso of a new hybrid geometrical zzso method zzso in comparison with two zzso methods zzso and a geometrical method zzso for the calculation of zzso volumes with zzso using zzso as zzso 

Thirty cardiac patients underwent routine zzso with a standard dose of 500 zzso of zzso and additional cardiac zzso as reference zzso zzso volumes of zzso data were calculated by four different zzso The zzso and zzso are based on the assumption that the shape of the zzso can be zzso by an zzso or sphere, and the new zzso extracts the volume from the projected count rates zzso 

All methods underestimated the zzso volumes as compared with the zzso zzso The difference zzso of zzso volume zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The correlation zzso for zzso between zzso methods and zzso were r zzso zzso for zzso and r zzso zzso for zzso The zzso showed poor correlation r zzso zzso with the zzso data and a high zzso The difference of zzso volume zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The correlation zzso for zzso between zzso methods and zzso were r zzso zzso for zzso and r zzso zzso for zzso r zzso zzso for zzso and zzso Although zzso showed a slightly higher correlation than zzso the difference of zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso was much higher for zzso in comparison with zzso Both zzso showed poor agreement with zzso zzso 

zzso using the new zzso method in comparison with other methods is an easy and accurate method to determine zzso zzso However, all methods underestimate zzso and zzso slightly as compared with zzso
