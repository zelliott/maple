zzso zzso zzso using various energy sources are being developed to perform pulmonary vein zzso isolation to treat zzso zzso Prior evaluations of zzso zzso images are limited by the frequent elliptical shape of the zzso zzso the zzso orientation of the zzso to the left zzso zzso chamber, and difficulty in appreciating zzso zzso To provide anatomical data relevant to balloon zzso zzso zzso surface reconstructions of zzso were generated and analyzed to define zzso architecture and zzso 

Using zzso zzso obtained from 101 zzso zzso patients, the zzso were segmented to generate zzso zzso surface zzso Using both external and zzso projections, the zzso zzso and zzso regions were identified and zzso In the left zzso a common zzso zzso was identified in 94 patients, with an zzso circumference of 95 zzso 15 zzso zzso of the left zzso occurred zzso zzso away from the common left zzso in 43 patients zzso zzso zzso away from the common zzso in 37 patients zzso and zzso zzso away from the common zzso in 14 patients zzso In patients with either distinct left zzso zzso or common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the individual zzso zzso zzso were 67 zzso 12 zzso and 58 zzso 9 zzso zzso Mean left zzso circumference was 114 zzso 17 zzso In the right zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso were 68 zzso 11 zzso and 66 zzso 11 zzso zzso Mean right zzso circumference was 107 zzso 19 zzso Assuming ideal deformation of the LA chamber zzso the minimal diameters of a balloon zzso zzso required to isolate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso and right zzso are 29 zzso 28 zzso 29 zzso 24 zzso 40 zzso 46 zzso and 47 zzso zzso 

Analysis of zzso surface reconstructions of zzso anatomy reveals that balloon zzso zzso of the zzso is likely feasible in most patients, but balloon zzso of the common zzso zzso would be zzso
