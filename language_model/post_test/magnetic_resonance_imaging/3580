This work characterizes the zzso of zzso in prostate cancer zzso benign prostate zzso and normal prostate tissue in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical markers to evaluate the potential utility of zzso for zzso zzso tumors in a population of patients with localized zzso 

Thirty-nine men with presumed localized zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso and zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso images were registered to MR images using pelvic bones for initial zzso followed by manual adjustments to account for prostate motion and deformation from the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathology specimens were zzso using an zzso zzso mold resulting in improved registration between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso PET standardized zzso values were compared with zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso was rapid but zzso zzso at 3-5 zzso after injection and reaching a relative plateau at approximately 10 zzso The average maximum standardized zzso value zzso zzso of tumors was significantly higher than that of normal prostate tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso however, it was not significantly different from that of benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso comparison with zzso including all tumors greater than zzso zzso revealed a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso The zzso accuracy was comparable to that of zzso when only tumors greater than zzso zzso were zzso In a small cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent of fatty acid zzso expression using zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrates higher zzso in tumor zzso than in normal prostate zzso however, zzso zzso in tumors is similar to that in benign prostate zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is not likely to have utility as an independent zzso for evaluation of localized zzso the high zzso in tumors may make it useful for monitoring focal therapy when tissue damage after therapy may limit zzso imaging zzso
