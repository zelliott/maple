Marathon running is gaining in zzso Its benefits regarding the cardiovascular system as well as the metabolism are beyond zzso However, whether or not there are zzso side effects to the musculoskeletal system such as wear and tear is an zzso zzso We therefore zzso looked at zzso and experienced runners at a city marathon during training and after the competition for zzso to the Achilles zzso zzso or zzso 

73 healthy subjects were zzso included in our zzso They were recruited from the applicants of the city marathon or zzso They underwent an initial clinical zzso as well as three magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso were conducted at the time point of study zzso near the end of training and directly (up to 72 zzso after the zzso zzso evaluation zzso saturated T zzso zzso STIR zzso was performed by two independent experienced zzso blinded to the clinical zzso The results were compared for zzso of zzso also a zzso analysis was zzso zzso results were deemed significant for zzso 

32 women and 41 men were zzso In the end there were 53 zzso and 20 zzso 28 seasoned runners and 25 zzso 57 runners had no foot complaints, while 14 had foot pain during training and 13 during the zzso Mean body weight was zzso height was zzso age was zzso zzso Mean AT diameter was zzso and showed no change during training or after the zzso There was no significant influence of gender on other variables zzso There was a significant and positive correlation between AT diameter and weight zzso also AT and height zzso while there was negative correlation between height and signal intensity of zzso zzso The signal intensity of the AT decreased during zzso The signal intensity of the zzso decreased from inclusion until after the zzso while the mean zzso zzso volume and AT zzso volume zzso Some of the zzso stopped the training because of zzso zzso These runners generally had an apparent zzso visible in their initial zzso zzso Regarding the zzso analysis of the data, there were no risk factors predicting zzso or development of new zzso to be zzso zzso reliability was moderate for zzso zzso while it was good to excellent for AT diameter and zzso MR signal zzso 

In our sample of primarily zzso German zzso the AT diameter was higher than in symptomatic American zzso The diameter did not change during training or after the zzso zzso with zzso reasons generally had a zzso on zzso in the initial zzso Apart from this, no new zzso to the AT or zzso are to be expected during normal zzso zzso processes seem to be the main effect of this zzso
