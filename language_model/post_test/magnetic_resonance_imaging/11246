zzso AND zzso To evaluate the cortical response to visual stimulation in patients with age-related zzso zzso zzso we conducted a functional zzso study in ten patients presenting unilateral or bilateral zzso and five zzso controls, using white flashes during zzso zzso (see Part zzso 

After anatomical zzso eight patients and four controls showed significant cortical zzso response to zzso zzso Individual analysis was preferred to group zzso because of the differences in visual loss in a small number of zzso In controls, we observed cortical response in the primary visual cortex, especially at zzso poles corresponding to the zzso Patients showed a qualitative and quantitative restriction in cortical response and exclusion of zzso poles after stimulation of the affected eye, whereas zzso was found in the peripheral zzso and zzso zzso zzso response showed zzso asymmetry in some zzso 

Our study demonstrated an zzso zzso in the zzso projected zzso cortex, corresponding to visual impairment in zzso zzso Nevertheless, at a given visual zzso cortical response may vary among zzso zzso zzso apprehension may account for such variations, as well as objective visual capacity stemming from residual functional retinal areas within the affected zzso The zzso asymmetry in cortical zzso may result from gaze zzso onto the new fixation area in the zzso zzso thus altering the global visual zzso Enhancement in the peripheral zzso and zzso areas suggests changes in cortical zzso possibly by a lowering of the feedback from zzso projected zzso Finally, cortical evaluations must take into account degenerative phenomena delaying the zzso response in the zzso 

zzso at a specific population of weakened patients with a serious visual zzso we obtained significant results concerning cortical plasticity for visual perception in central vision zzso Our preliminary findings must be confirmed in a larger population and correlated with other techniques exploring vision, in particular with zzso zzso for retinal zzso
