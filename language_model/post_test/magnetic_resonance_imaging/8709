Previous zzso studies have clearly identified zzso neural events underlying early and late components of response zzso zzso zzso studies, however, have so far failed to account for this zzso Here, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of an anticipation paradigm in 12 healthy adult subjects that reliably produced early and late expectancy waves in the zzso We zzso compared zzso zzso zzso during early and late anticipation to those associated with response zzso Our results demonstrate the existence of distinct cortical and zzso brain regions underlying early and late zzso Although late anticipatory behavior was associated with zzso in zzso zzso frontal cortex, and thalamus, brain responses linked to the early expectancy wave were localized mainly in motor and zzso cortical areas as well as the zzso zzso Additionally, late anticipation was associated with increased activity in zzso zzso zzso very likely corresponding to the zzso zzso Furthermore, whereas regions involved in late anticipation proved to be very similar to zzso zzso by response conflict, this was not the case for early zzso The current study supports a distinction between early and late anticipatory zzso in line with a plethora of zzso work, and for the first time describes the brain structures zzso involved in these zzso
