The protective effect of the zzso E zzso zzso zzso against Alzheimer's disease zzso is zzso 

Our purpose was to clarify if the zzso zzso affects regional cortical thicknesses and zzso 

Regional cortical thicknesses and volumes were measured with an automated pipeline in 109 subjects with mild cognitive zzso 114 zzso patients and 105 zzso healthy zzso 

In the mild cognitive impairment group, the zzso carriers had thicker regional zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than the subjects with zzso and a larger cerebral gray matter and smaller lateral zzso than the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso group, the zzso carriers had significantly thicker zzso and zzso zzso zzso a larger whole cerebral gray matter, and smaller lateral zzso than the subjects with the zzso zzso and a significantly thicker zzso zzso and larger cerebral gray matter than zzso zzso No zzso effect was found in the control zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is associated with larger regional cortical thicknesses and volumes in mild cognitive impairment and zzso
