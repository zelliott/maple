Diagnosis of central nervous system zzso abnormalities in dogs can be challenging zzso Historically, zzso fluid zzso analysis has been used for routine diagnostic evaluation of animals with suspected zzso zzso however, with increasing availability of magnetic resonance zzso imaging, the need for concurrent zzso analysis may be zzso 

The purpose of this study was to zzso assess and compare the diagnostic information contributed from MR imaging and zzso analysis in a population of dogs presenting with zzso zzso 

zzso of concurrent MR imaging and zzso analysis were evaluated in dogs presented for zzso zzso Based on clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of zzso analysis and MR imaging for detecting a nervous system zzso was zzso Dogs with diagnoses confirmed by other diagnostic zzso were also evaluated zzso 

A total of 256 dogs were included in the zzso For clinical diagnoses in which abnormalities were expected, MR imaging abnormalities were found in zzso and zzso abnormalities in zzso of dogs; zzso abnormalities were more common than MR imaging abnormalities only in inflammatory zzso zzso The majority of zzso abnormalities were zzso an zzso diagnosis was determined in only zzso of zzso zzso MR imaging excelled in detecting structural disorders, revealing zzso of zzso zzso In confirmed cases zzso zzso zzso zzso of MR images and zzso of zzso samples were zzso When zzso disk disease zzso and zzso zzso were excluded from analysis zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso of MR images and zzso of zzso zzso results were highly indicative of the confirmed zzso zzso zzso results provided the diagnosis in zzso of these zzso 

zzso analysis may not be necessary when MR findings of zzso or zzso zzso are zzso however, when the cause of zzso disorder is uncertain, concurrent MR imaging and zzso analysis provides the greatest assistance in establishing a clinical zzso
