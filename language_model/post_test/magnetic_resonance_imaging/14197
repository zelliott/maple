MR imaging of the brain, performed in 86 normal subjects and 113 patients with objective memory disorder or zzso demonstrated zzso and zzso areas of high signal intensity on long zzso images (short and long zzso zzso were analyzed with respect to size (on a scale of zzso and location: zzso were zzso zzso or zzso The patients with memory disorder and zzso were zzso as having zzso zzso disease, a combination of zzso disease and zzso cognitive disorder, or zzso cognitive disorder alone on the basis of clinically determined zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between age and scores for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso in normal zzso zzso were also found between the zzso zzso score and scores for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso in subjects with memory zzso Comparing zzso cognitive disorder, zzso disease, and normal groups, the mean scores for zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while mean scores for zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in zzso of patients with zzso disease and zzso cognitive zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso which were identified in zzso of patients with zzso cognitive disorder, were present in only about half of the patients with zzso zzso Thus, scores for both zzso and zzso zzso are positively correlated with age and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and also are significantly increased in the presence of objective memory disorder or zzso These results imply that in the subject groups considered here, elderly patients with vascular zzso are most likely to have severe zzso abnormalities on MR zzso The score for zzso zzso appears to be more helpful than the score for zzso zzso in distinguishing vascular zzso from zzso disease and normal aging, so that a patient with prominent zzso zzso abnormalities is more likely to have a diagnosis of vascular than degenerative zzso
