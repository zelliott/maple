To describe zzso zzso zzso imaging with single shot zzso zzso zzso and to compare zzso zzso zzso with zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso 

zzso subjects (15 zzso 21 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso who had abdominal zzso examinations including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso Two zzso independently evaluated the sequences zzso for extent of artifacts, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso grading of liver zzso zzso evaluation was performed by one zzso and included liver fat index, liver and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

Respiratory zzso was more pronounced on zzso zzso zzso zzso The degrees of parallel imaging residual artifacts, zzso and blurring were significantly higher on the zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bounce point artifacts were only observed with zzso zzso Pixel zzso was more apparent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence, and zzso were considerably higher on zzso Visual appreciation of zzso was superior on zzso zzso image quality was superior on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Higher image quality and improved zzso zzso were present with zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared techniques may represent an important evolution for zzso zzso image at zzso The good image quality of zzso sequences acquired in a free breathing manner should recommend its use in patients unable to suspend zzso
