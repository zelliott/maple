Our goal was to use functional zzso zzso to measure brain zzso in response to imagination of tastes in zzso 

zzso brain scans were obtained in 31 subjects (12 men, 19 zzso using zzso zzso zzso and echo zzso imaging zzso in response to imagination of tastes of salt and sweet in zzso sections selected from anterior to zzso zzso brain zzso zzso images were derived using correlation analysis, and ratios of areas of brain activated to total brain areas were zzso Total activated zzso counts were used to zzso regional brain zzso 

zzso was present in each section in all subjects after imagination of each zzso zzso was similar in response to imagination of either salt or sweet and was zzso similar to that previously reported in response to imagination of zzso of banana and zzso zzso was similar in both men and women as opposed to previous results of odor memory in which zzso in men was greater than in zzso However, zzso responses of intensity of imagined tastes were significantly greater than those previously obtained for odor memory and were consistently, albeit not significantly, greater in women than in men, similar to results previously reported for odor zzso Brain regions activated in response to taste imagination were consistent with regions previously described as involved with actual taste perception in both humans and zzso Regional brain zzso for salt and sweet memories could not be zzso 

These studies indicate that zzso tastes can be zzso zzso brain regions activated for taste imagination are consistent with regions previously described for actual taste perception, and zzso similar to odor memory for banana and zzso regional brain zzso for salt or sweet taste memories could not be zzso
