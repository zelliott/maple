We present our technique for zzso functional mapping in awake children with zzso tumors near eloquent zzso This technique may help zzso tumor zzso and/or the functional outcome, especially when an awake zzso is not possible or in the setting of zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso functional mapping and seizure focus mapping were performed, followed by staged tumor zzso Gross total zzso was achieved in 6 patients and zzso zzso in zzso No complications due to zzso placement or invasive monitoring were zzso zzso zzso of pediatric brain tumors near the eloquent zzso appears safe, allows functional mapping in awake patients, and may assist in decisions between zzso tumor zzso and optimal functional zzso
