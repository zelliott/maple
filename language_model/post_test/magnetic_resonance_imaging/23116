A distributed network of brain regions is linked to drug-related cue zzso However, the relationships between smoking zzso zzso activity and possible underlying differences in brain structure, zzso zzso activity and connectivity between these brain areas are as yet zzso Twenty-two smokers and 22 controls viewed zzso and neutral pictures during a functional zzso spin labeling scanning zzso zzso resting functional, and diffusion zzso imaging data were also zzso Six brain areas, zzso lateral prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso cortex, zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso showed significant smoking zzso activity in smokers when compared with controls and were subjected to secondary analysis for resting state functional connectivity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strength between zzso and zzso was positively correlated with the zzso activity in zzso Similarly, zzso strength between zzso and zzso was positively correlated with the zzso activity in zzso while zzso strength between zzso and zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso activity in both zzso and zzso suggesting these brain circuits may facilitate the response to the salient smoking zzso Further, the gray matter density in zzso was decreased in smokers and correlated with zzso activity in the same brain area, suggesting a zzso mechanism for the impaired cognitive control associated with drug zzso Taken together, these results begin to address the underlying zzso of smoking cue zzso and may speak to novel treatment strategies and targets for therapeutic zzso
