To determine whether the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso area zzso of the hamstring zzso can predict zzso bundle diameters during zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso 

A prospective study of 34 patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring zzso was zzso zzso of independent and combined hamstring zzso diameters were correlated to zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso diameter measurement positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and final graft size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than or equal to 5 zzso in diameter had a mean zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared with a mean of zzso zzso for zzso less than 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than or equal to 6 zzso had a mean zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for zzso less than 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso Final zzso of diameter greater than or equal to 7 zzso had a mean zzso zzso total zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for zzso under 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a clinically useful tool to assess hamstring zzso graft zzso We recommend zzso zzso threshold values of 10 zzso and 17 zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to reliably predict the potential for a zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso
