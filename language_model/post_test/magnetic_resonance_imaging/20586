Multiple sclerosis zzso is an zzso disease of the central nervous system characterized by damage to the zzso zzso zzso which results in different levels of muscle paralysis that can lead to zzso zzso In most zzso mouse models, the zzso damage mostly affects the spinal zzso with limited damage to the brain, which cannot be monitored by magnetic resonance imaging zzso as used for zzso We show that zzso of non-obese diabetic zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to the development of zzso zzso evident from days 20 to 70, which then develops into a chronic progressive zzso This cycle is similar to zzso stages found in zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso image analysis showed an increased zzso barrier zzso in brain gray and white matter specific to the corpus zzso zzso and internal capsule as found in zzso zzso fractional zzso analysis showed zzso and zzso damage in identical zzso zzso analysis supported the zzso zzso No evidence of brain zzso was found in a common model of zzso using zzso zzso We suggest that an increase in zzso toxicity in experimental zzso zzso zzso mice may be linked to brain zzso zzso We suggest using zzso mice as a suitable model for studying zzso using zzso methods toward future diagnostic and drug zzso
