To examine the effects of social support provided by the presence of patient's significant other on pain ratings, pain zzso and brain activity associated with tactile stimulation in 18 zzso zzso patients and 18 migraine patients zzso and to assess the influence of emotional context on zzso pain perception and processing of zzso zzso 

zzso pain thresholds and zzso brain magnetic responses zzso by tactile stimulation at the elbow (a painful tender point in the zzso zzso and at the finger zzso zzso were evaluated under 2 experimental conditions of social zzso patient alone and patient's significant other zzso Brain activity was recorded using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the emotional context during presentation of tactile stimuli was manipulated by presenting zzso zzso pictures and neutral pictures and asking the patients to imagine that they were experiencing the situations zzso 

zzso pain thresholds indicated greater sensitivity in zzso patients than in migraine patients, as well as enhanced sensitivity at the elbow than at the zzso Specifically, in zzso patients, there were significant reductions in pain sensitivity and zzso pain ratings when patients were zzso at the painful tender point in the presence of their significant others as compared with the ratings when the patients were zzso Brain activity zzso by elbow stimulation was also significantly reduced in zzso patients when a significant other was present as compared with the activity when the patient was zzso These effects were not observed in the migraine zzso 

When the significant other was present, zzso patients reported less pain and zzso pain sensitivity and showed diminished brain activity zzso upon tactile stimulation of a tender point compared with these levels when the patients were zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that social support through the presence of a significant other can influence pain processing at the zzso level as well as the central nervous system zzso
