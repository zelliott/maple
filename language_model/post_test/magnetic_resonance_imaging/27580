zzso is often assumed to comprise a group of biologically distinct disorders, yet it has been difficult to dissect zzso using biological zzso We review recent brain imaging zzso studies addressing the issue of zzso within the diagnostic category of zzso Studies of zzso of schizophrenia patients have mostly used either symptom structure or clinical course for the zzso of potentially meaningful zzso Studies defining zzso according to outcome, zzso good versus poor outcome (or zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that while these two zzso might overlap in the extent (and possibly also zzso of prefrontal deficits, they differ in zzso and zzso areas, where zzso patients show stronger zzso More recent studies have investigated zzso of schizophrenia based on factor analysis of zzso They have demonstrated a complex pattern of regional changes, where the typical three zzso might overlap in prefrontal changes, but show divergence in structural deficits in other areas such as the thalamus, zzso or zzso Altogether, these studies demonstrate that brain structure per zzso is not a uniform zzso but rather a combination of regional deficits highly zzso in both meeting zzso criteria as well as in their distribution within the disease zzso
