zzso zzso rats zzso are considered to represent a genetic animal model for zzso zzso disorder zzso In the present studies, we compared the locomotor activity, learning and memory functions of juvenile male zzso with zzso and zzso genetic control zzso rats zzso In addition, we investigated potential differences in brain zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso In other complimentary studies of the central nervous system, we used real-time zzso to examine the levels of several zzso zzso including those coding for the five major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso those coding for zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and those coding for the zzso zzso Our data revealed that zzso were more active than zzso in the open field zzso zzso Also, zzso appeared less zzso exhibiting zzso deficit, but in the absence of memory deficits relative to spatial zzso The zzso studies revealed that zzso had a significantly smaller zzso zzso and zzso zzso and there was also a significantly lower level of zzso zzso zzso gene expression and protein synthesis in the prefrontal zzso zzso of zzso However, there were no significant differences between the expression of other zzso genes in the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso cortex, zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso The data are similar to the situation seen in zzso patients, relative to normal volunteers, and it is possible that the zzso state involves a down regulation of zzso zzso zzso rather than a general zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, the molecular and zzso data that we obtained provide new information that may be relevant to understanding zzso in zzso
