We previously developed an zzso method for the measurement of left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso volume zzso and zzso volume zzso using zzso zzso zzso equilibrium zzso zzso zzso zzso We aimed to compare our zzso zzso method with cardiac zzso zzso for the determination of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and RV zzso and zzso and zzso were carried out by zzso zzso and zzso in a group of patients who had zzso zzso due to left anterior descending coronary artery zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso provided similar zzso of the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso (23) zzso 61 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 141 zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was slightly but significantly smaller than that by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso produced similar mean zzso values of RV zzso zzso zzso zzso 67 zzso zzso zzso and RV zzso zzso zzso zzso 149 zzso zzso zzso and somewhat larger mean zzso RV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Excellent correlations were found between zzso zzso and zzso for combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and combined RV zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

This study further zzso zzso zzso as a method to measure zzso and RV zzso zzso and zzso
