Spinal zzso zzso have been divided by location into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso juvenile zzso zzso and zzso direct zzso zzso zzso zzso We report two cases of an unusual zzso proliferation of zzso zzso that do not fit into any of these zzso 

A 27-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man presented with zzso progressive zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed focal spinal zzso enlargement, high signal on zzso images, and zzso enhancement with zzso consistent with zzso No zzso flow voids were zzso on the surface of the spinal zzso Spinal zzso revealed nothing zzso No abnormal zzso was zzso visible on open zzso zzso examination of the tissue specimens revealed a proliferation of zzso vessels with varying degrees of vascular wall changes ranging from zzso zzso to concentric zzso suggesting ongoing evolution of the zzso zzso neural tissue demonstrated zzso changes characterized by zzso and zzso loss and zzso but no zzso 

Patients were treated with chronic zzso which seemed to slow, but not halt, symptomatic disease zzso 

Although the pathological zzso seems to be an acquired zzso vascular zzso characterized primarily by zzso zzso the cause of this zzso is zzso This disease differs from zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso by an absence of abnormal surface vessels and a lack of zzso zzso The zzso findings are reminiscent of the process that occurs in the kidney and various end zzso from long-standing mild to moderate zzso in blood pressure or chronic zzso zzso zzso may result from zzso obstruction by severe zzso and zzso Because the natural history of this disease is unknown, it is unclear whether zzso slowed disease zzso
