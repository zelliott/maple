zzso and early zzso seem to be the most opportune times for exercise to improve bone strength in girls, but few studies have addressed this issue in zzso This study investigated the zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes in bone mass and geometry in young zzso The zzso effects of loading were analyzed by comparing the playing and zzso zzso of 43 male zzso zzso and zzso competitive tennis players zzso zzso of zzso Total bone area, zzso area, and cortical area were determined at the mid zzso and zzso zzso zzso of both arms using zzso zzso bone mass zzso was derived from a whole body zzso zzso In zzso boys, zzso was zzso greater in the playing compared with zzso arm zzso zzso zzso which was accompanied by a zzso greater cortical area, because of greater zzso expansion than zzso expansion at the zzso and zzso expansion associated with zzso contraction at the zzso zzso Compared with zzso the zzso differences in zzso zzso and cortical area zzso were greater in zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were found between zzso and zzso despite longer playing history in the zzso zzso The zzso response to loading was greater in zzso compared with zzso boys, which is in contrast with our previous findings in girls and may be caused by differences in training zzso This suggests that the window of opportunity to improve bone mass and size through exercise may be longer in boys than in zzso
