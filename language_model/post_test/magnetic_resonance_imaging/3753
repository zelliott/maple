zzso in cerebrovascular function are evident acutely in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury zzso although less is known about their chronic zzso Adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe zzso have been reported to demonstrate diffuse zzso throughout the brain during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Because zzso is a measure related to blood flow, it is possible that any deficits in blood flow may alter zzso An zzso spin labeling zzso zzso sequence was performed on seven adolescents with chronic moderate to severe zzso and seven typically developing zzso adolescents during the same session in which they had performed a social zzso task during zzso In the TD group, prefrontal zzso was positively related to prefrontal zzso and zzso related to zzso zzso brain zzso This relationship was not seen in the zzso group, who demonstrated a greater positive relationship between prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso than the TD zzso An analysis of zzso data independent of zzso showed reduced zzso in the right zzso region zzso in the zzso zzso To understand any role reduced zzso may play in diffuse zzso we then related the right zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the right zzso region in the TD group was positively associated with prefrontal zzso suggesting an interactive role of zzso and prefrontal blood flow throughout the right zzso in healthy zzso However, the zzso group demonstrated a positive association with zzso constrained to the right zzso zzso These data suggest a relationship between impaired zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso where the region with more limited blood flow is associated with zzso limited to that zzso In a secondary analysis, pathology associated with zzso on zzso zzso imaging over the whole brain was related to whole brain zzso revealing a negative relationship between zzso volume and frontal zzso and a positive relationship between zzso volume and zzso zzso These preliminary data, albeit collected with small sample sizes, suggest that reduced zzso zzso and possibly pathological tissue associated with zzso may provide contributions to the zzso primarily zzso zzso observed in adolescents following moderate to severe zzso
