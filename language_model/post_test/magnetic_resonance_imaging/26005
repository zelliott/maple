The goal of this report is to demonstrate the utility of zzso brain single zzso zzso zzso zzso in a 39-year-old man with complex partial zzso arising from the anterior zzso zzso zzso originating from the anterior zzso zzso are difficult to zzso because they have variable zzso zzso are usually brief, and have rapid cortical zzso 

Clinical zzso examination, zzso extended zzso with scalp and zzso electrodes, magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso with zzso zzso were performed to identify the seizure zzso The patient's regional cerebral blood flow zzso findings were compared with those of eight normal controls, and changes in zzso were assessed by comparing the patient's zzso scan with those of normal controls at rest by using statistical zzso mapping zzso 

Clinical and zzso evaluations failed to demonstrate the zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso showed a focal region of zzso in the anterior zzso zzso By using zzso the zzso blood flow increase in the right anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 42, 24 zzso was found to be statistically significant when compared with normal controls zzso score, zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings with zzso zzso positioned over this location confirmed that the zzso zzso was the origin of the seizures, and surgical zzso resulted in zzso seizure zzso 

We concluded that zzso brain zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso confirmation is a useful test in the zzso evaluation of difficult to zzso zzso zzso
