The presence of a zzso cavity increases the rate of neurological complications on the course of surgical treatment of zzso We have evaluated the results of monitoring of zzso evoked zzso zzso in these zzso 

Four patients presenting a zzso associated with zzso have been operated through a zzso with CD zzso zzso monitoring was performed zzso and zzso We studied the zzso and the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso showed in all cases zzso spinal zzso involvement (even without clinical zzso During monitoring, we noted in one case no zzso In one case a zzso of the response with zzso within 5 zzso In two cases a persistent zzso with zzso within 10 and 15 minutes following modification of the zzso In all cases, zzso neurological status was identical to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can make the diagnosis of zzso spinal zzso involvement even when clinical status is zzso The extent of the zzso zzso abnormalities may zzso the risk of zzso neurological zzso zzso zzso can be performed with the same zzso protocol and the same technique used when operating idiopathic zzso The results seem zzso When zzso occur as for idiopathic zzso zzso of the zzso appears earlier than zzso of the zzso zzso Restoration of normal responses appears later than in idiopathic zzso 

zzso monitoring should diminish the risk for neurological complications in the course of surgical treatment of zzso associated with zzso
