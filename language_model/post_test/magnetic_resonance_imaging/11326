To evaluate the efficacy of a new zzso zzso laser to generate in zzso tissue zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in pig liver and zzso of these zzso 

Each of four animal subjects received eight treatments at four different constant temperatures zzso 80, 90, and 100 degrees zzso and at two out of three different intervals zzso 6, 9 zzso resulting in a total of 32 zzso After zzso the liver was examined in an open zzso zzso zzso necrosis was measured zzso and compared with the size measured by zzso 

The size of the necrosis was energy dependent with the largest extent at 100 degrees C at 9 minutes zzso zzso The correlation between zzso zzso size and zzso findings was significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso excluded zzso in every zzso 

zzso carried out with the zzso laser provides zzso zzso of pig liver in zzso zzso results compared favorably with those obtained by zzso zzso
