To evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of zzso multiple quantum zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for single cell zzso we obtained zzso double quantum zzso zzso and conventional zzso echo zzso images of zzso cells labeled by contrast agents in zzso The zzso images obtained with zzso zzso zzso the labeled cells effectively and with a higher contrast than seen in conventional GE images, especially at low zzso resolutions and with thick zzso This implies that zzso imaging with contrast agents could be a good alternative to conventional MR imaging for detecting labeled single cells or cell tracking under favorable zzso
