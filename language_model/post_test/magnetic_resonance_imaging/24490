To examine whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso bone shape predicts the onset of zzso knee zzso zzso 

We conducted a zzso study using data from the zzso Initiative by identifying knees that developed incident zzso zzso knee zzso zzso knees) during zzso and matching them each to 2 random control zzso Using knee zzso we performed active appearance modeling of the zzso zzso and zzso and linear zzso analysis to identify zzso that best classified knees with zzso versus those without zzso zzso were scaled such that zzso and zzso represented the mean zzso and mean zzso shapes, zzso We examined the relation of 3-D bone shape to incident zzso zzso zzso and Lawrence zzso grade zzso occurring 12 months later using conditional zzso zzso 

A total of 178 case knees zzso zzso were matched to 353 control zzso The whole joint zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3-D bone shape zzso had the strongest magnitude of effect, with knees in the highest zzso having a zzso times higher likelihood of developing incident zzso knee zzso 12 months later compared with those in the lowest zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The associations were even stronger among knees that had completely normal zzso before zzso zzso grade of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso Bone shape at zzso often several years before zzso predicted later zzso 

zzso 3-D bone shape predicted the later onset of zzso zzso Further study is warranted to determine whether such methods can detect treatment effects in trials and provide insight into the zzso of zzso zzso
