The aim of this study was to document and zzso the course of several zzso parameters in 49 patients with a zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso 

Patients received conservative management and absence of zzso growth was zzso by means of serial magnetic imaging zzso zzso zzso and speech zzso were performed at yearly zzso 

zzso zzso revealed a significant increase in thresholds at all zzso except for zzso zzso The maximum yearly threshold increase was zzso zzso hearing level at zzso and zzso zzso Speech zzso revealed a significant decrease in maximum discrimination over the course of zzso No significant changes were observed in the following zzso the intensity level at which maximum discrimination was zzso the zzso zzso the speech reception zzso and the slope of the curve in the speech zzso No change was observed in the relation between zzso zzso thresholds and speech zzso zzso Apparently, the deterioration of zzso perception and speech discrimination ran parallel zzso 

The results of this study indicate that hearing loss is a zzso symptom in patients with a zzso zzso as is also known in patients with a growing zzso Moreover, it seems unlikely that the hearing loss in VS patients is merely the result of mechanical influences on zzso neural or vascular zzso
