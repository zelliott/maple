The purpose of this study was to determine whether the position of the zzso zzso in patients with anterior disc displacement zzso is different from that of a control group with normal zzso using a novel method to zzso the irregular shape of the zzso joint zzso 

Twenty-six magnetic resonance images of zzso with zzso were evaluated and compared with 14 normal zzso The position of the zzso was determined by using 2 different zzso 1) measuring the horizontal and vertical zzso distances in zzso between the geometric centers of the zzso zzso and the zzso and 2) calculating the zzso joint space zzso 

Using the first method, the horizontal distance between the centers of the zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso The vertical distance was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso The ratio of the horizontal and the vertical zzso displacement in the zzso group was zzso Using the second method, the zzso joint space ratios in the zzso group and in the control group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso 

This study found that zzso of patients with zzso were situated more zzso and superior in the zzso than those in the control zzso Moreover, in the zzso group, the zzso zzso displacement was noted to be zzso times greater than the superior zzso zzso
