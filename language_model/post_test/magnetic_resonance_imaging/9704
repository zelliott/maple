We present a new automatic method for zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso in magnetic resonance zzso The method performs tissue zzso using a model of zzso of the normal appearing brain zzso In order to estimate the model, a trimmed likelihood zzso is zzso with a zzso random approach in order to be robust to zzso zzso and other zzso present in real zzso The zzso is first evaluated with simulated images to assess the importance of the robust zzso in presence of zzso The method is then validated using clinical data in which zzso zzso were delineated manually by several zzso Our method zzso an average zzso similarity zzso zzso of zzso which is close to the average zzso obtained by zzso zzso
