Human memory is not a zzso zzso it consists of multiple memory systems, with different characteristics and zzso that are implemented in the zzso The cognitive zzso of human memory tries to comprehend how we zzso store, and retrieve memory items within and across those zzso The emergence of functional zzso techniques offered the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the brain regions engaged in memory zzso Brain imaging techniques can roughly be divided into those measuring the electric or magnetic fields generated by zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and those measuring the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Out of these techniques, the following two will be discussed in detail: zzso and zzso Although functional zzso is able to acquire images of the brain engaged in consolidating or retrieving zzso these processes are not clearly visible in the zzso zzso techniques are needed to reduce the complexity of the data and to extract the processes of zzso This article outlines the experimental and zzso procedures of zzso studies with PET and zzso We will use a zzso on episodic memory in human volunteers to illustrate design, analysis, and interpretation of functional imaging studies on zzso
