In this study, the first to explore the cortical zzso of signed language zzso processing under zzso display conditions, the observer identified either a zzso or a zzso sign from a display in which different zzso were seen producing a number of different individual zzso Many of the regions activated by zzso under these conditions zzso those previously reported for zzso displays, including regions within the inferior zzso zzso that are zzso for face and zzso zzso although such body parts were invisible in the zzso Right frontal regions were also recruited - a pattern not usually seen in zzso zzso zzso This zzso may reflect the recruitment of information about person identity from the reduced zzso A direct comparison of zzso and zzso conditions showed these tasks relied to a different extent on the zzso inferior zzso zzso identification zzso greater zzso than sign identification in zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle and zzso portions of the middle zzso zzso zzso 37 and zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso 22 and zzso Right inferior frontal zzso was a further focus of differential zzso zzso These findings suggest that the neural systems supporting zzso displays for the processing of zzso rely on a cortical network including areas of the inferior zzso zzso specialized for face and body zzso While this might be predicted from other studies of whole body zzso actions zzso Solomon, zzso zzso & zzso 2001) it is not predicted from the perspective of spoken language processing, where voice characteristics and speech content recruit distinct cortical regions zzso 2004) in addition to a common zzso In this respect, our findings contrast with studies of zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso regions associated with the visual recognition of a person appear to be required during zzso processing, for both carrier and content zzso
