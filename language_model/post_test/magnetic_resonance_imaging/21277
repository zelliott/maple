We describe the case of an original zzso and course of the zzso zzso zzso muscle on the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso The anomalous muscle was only present on the left zzso Various studies have reported the frequency of anomalous muscles in approximately 22 to zzso of hands and it was in majority an anomalous zzso zzso zzso zzso The knowledge of this original zzso is important because it can sometimes be correlated with zzso nerve zzso at zzso zzso But zzso canal syndrome is less common than zzso tunnel syndrome, and the zzso of zzso nerve zzso in relation with anomalous muscle is approximately zzso of zzso It is possible to diagnose the anomalous muscle through ultrasound or zzso This variation should be taken into consideration by surgeons during surgical procedures for zzso nerve zzso at zzso canal and when performing zzso approach to the wrist between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
