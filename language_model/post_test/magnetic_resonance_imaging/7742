This study aimed to assess the qualitative and quantitative utility of zzso imaging to illustrate the magnitude and duration of the effect of a standard 100 zzso dose of zzso in a commercially available zzso that also contains aromatic zzso 

This was a randomized, open label, single dose, parallel group study in 21 adult male and female subjects who reported moderate to severe zzso congestion due to acute upper respiratory tract infection or hay zzso zzso scans were acquired using a zzso Philips zzso scanner with a 16 channel head receive zzso High resolution zzso scans of the zzso zzso were obtained immediately prior to dosing zzso and at approximately 1, 8, 10, 11, and 12 h after zzso The efficacy variables of primary interest were inferior zzso total volume at 8 and 12 h zzso The secondary efficacy variables zzso were inferior zzso total volume at 1, 10, and 11 h zzso middle zzso total volume at 1, 8, 10, 11, and 12 h zzso 

Changes from baseline volumes measured for the inferior and middle zzso of subjects receiving the zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso zzso decreases at all times up to and including 12 h zzso No significant decreases from baseline were detected in subjects receiving a sham zzso zzso control - spray bottles with no spray zzso zzso zzso results of inferior and middle zzso volume indicated significant differences zzso zzso zzso at all measurement points up to and including 12 h zzso between the zzso treatment group and the zzso control with the only exception the middle zzso volume at 10 h zzso zzso zzso The significant changes were likely to be clinically relevant though this was not measured in the zzso No zzso were reported during this study and no other safety evaluations were zzso 

This study showed that zzso assessment of zzso congestion in human volunteers is a zzso zzso and viable measurement zzso The application of a 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decongestant zzso zzso zzso delivered a highly significant reduction in inferior and middle zzso volumes compared with the application of a control, measurable by the zzso method up to and including a 12 h zzso zzso
