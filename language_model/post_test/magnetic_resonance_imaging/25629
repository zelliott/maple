A zzso technique, based on three-dimensional CT and MR imaging data for precision zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso for zzso included zzso tumors, gross disease remaining despite surgery, and zzso The patient's head was fixed in a zzso zzso system which is usable at the CT, MR and the linear accelerator zzso The geometrical distortion of MR imaging data was evaluated in three dimensions by phantom zzso The geometrical distortion was zzso zzso zzso to the size of a zzso by calculations based on zzso the distortion as a fourth order two-dimensional zzso The target volume was defined in three-dimensional MR imaging data after application of zzso zzso zzso zzso solution and transferred precisely from MR onto CT data to provide a map of the radiation zzso zzso for dose zzso The superior soft tissue contrast of MR showed an excellent tumor zzso especially when the zzso base of the skull obscured the target in CT zzso Target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures could be transferred between CT and MR imaging data and displayed as three-dimensional shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose zzso With the described planning system a more precise target definition of zzso zzso was possible by integration of the superior tumor zzso in MR compared with zzso
