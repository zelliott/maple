To describe the imaging features of aggressive zzso in a rare benign zzso zzso most frequently arising from the zzso in young female zzso 

We reviewed the zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging features of patients with aggressive zzso who were referred to our zzso The imaging features were correlated with clinical information and pathology in all zzso 

Four CT and five MR studies were available for five patients (all women, mean age 39, range zzso Three patients had zzso zzso at zzso CT and MR imaging demonstrated a zzso zzso adjacent zzso The zzso was of low zzso relative to muscle on zzso On zzso the zzso was zzso relative to muscle on zzso image, zzso on zzso image and enhanced avidly after zzso contrast with a characteristic zzso internal zzso MR imaging demonstrates the extent of the zzso and its relation to the pelvic zzso zzso zzso has a similar appearance to the primary zzso 

The MR appearances of aggressive zzso are zzso and the diagnosis should be considered in any young woman presenting with a zzso mass arising from the zzso
