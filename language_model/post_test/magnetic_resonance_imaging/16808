To compare zzso and zzso disease in the anterior zzso space zzso with regard to the zzso of the disease and the zzso of the central zzso as seen on zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

In this institutional review zzso zzso study, the data of patients who had AES disease determined at MR imaging and underwent diagnostic biopsy were zzso Two blinded observers reviewed the MR images and assigned the patients to one of two groups on the basis of the zzso of AES disease: those with a centrally convex disease zzso zzso and those whose disease zzso was zzso in the zzso to the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso zzso results served as the standard of zzso The zzso Fisher exact test, the zzso test, and zzso statistics were used to compare zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso of AES disease for the detection of zzso were zzso 

The data of 32 patients (16 men, 16 zzso mean age, 68 zzso were zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso zzso Fifteen patients had zzso zzso disease: Six patients had zzso and nine had zzso A greater proportion of AES zzso (13 zzso and 14 zzso of 17 zzso for observers 1 and 2, zzso than zzso AES zzso (four zzso and three zzso of 15 zzso for observers 1 and 2, zzso demonstrated zzso zzso of the central zzso For observers 1 and 2, a zzso or zzso appearance of AES disease had sensitivities of zzso (13 of 17 zzso and zzso zzso of 17 zzso zzso zzso of zzso (11 of 15 zzso and zzso (12 of 15 zzso zzso and zzso of zzso (24 of 32 zzso and zzso zzso of 32 zzso respectively, for the detection of zzso The mean zzso value for zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

AES disease preserving the zzso zzso of the central zzso is more common with zzso disease than with infections or zzso
