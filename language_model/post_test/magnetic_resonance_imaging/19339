MR findings reported in conjunction with spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso include zzso zzso increased zzso signal within the spinal cord, and zzso enhancement, each of which is zzso zzso vessels on the zzso surface, the most specific MR finding, is noted in only half of zzso zzso Nevertheless, we have frequently observed MR peripheral zzso of the spinal zzso in zzso on zzso images, which is not characteristic of zzso or zzso causes of zzso and which has not been described in association with zzso We hypothesized that peripheral zzso zzso might reliably suggest the diagnosis of zzso or other causes of zzso zzso zzso 

We reviewed the MR findings in 11 consecutive cases of zzso confirmed symptomatic zzso and in four cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso with spinal zzso a zzso that also causes spinal zzso deficits zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

In each case, zzso zzso involving the zzso periphery was zzso This sign has not been previously described in association with either zzso or other causes of zzso zzso zzso It appears, however, to be a relatively constant imaging feature of zzso 

In the absence of spinal zzso zzso zzso involving the periphery of the spinal zzso suggests zzso zzso zzso as a cause of spinal zzso zzso
