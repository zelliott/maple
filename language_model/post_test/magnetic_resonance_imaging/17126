The purposes of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of a zzso zzso zzso echo sequence with zzso data sampling zzso zzso zzso in abdominal zzso compared with a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examination zzso sequence for imaging of cooperative patients and to perform a preliminary assessment in imaging of zzso zzso 

Fifty-five zzso registered patients who underwent zzso and zzso abdominal zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso technique constituted the study zzso Two readers independently and blindly evaluated the zzso 

zzso image quality with the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was lower than but rated at least nearly as good as that with the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Higher scores were recorded for zzso zzso zzso images with respect to zzso zzso zzso artifact, and sharpness zzso zzso zzso to p zzso zzso Except for sharpness of vessels on zzso images, results for the zzso zzso zzso sequence did not differ significantly in the comparison of cooperative and zzso patients zzso zzso zzso For imaging of zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso images of children had higher ratings for zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso artifacts on zzso images zzso zzso zzso than did those of zzso zzso image quality was higher for pediatric zzso In zzso analysis, use of the zzso zzso zzso sequence was associated with significantly greater zzso confidence, and zzso than was use of the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence is feasible for abdominal zzso and may find application in imaging of patients who are unable to suspend zzso especially zzso
