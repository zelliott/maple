Although zzso zzso tumors zzso frequently destroy the zzso zzso bone and cause hearing loss, the anatomical origin of these zzso is zzso To determine the precise zzso origin of zzso the authors analyzed the imaging, zzso and pathological findings in patients with von zzso disease zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso patients with small zzso zzso zzso zzso who underwent zzso at the National Institutes of Health were zzso zzso imaging, zzso and pathological findings were zzso 

Ten consecutive zzso patients (6 male and 4 zzso with 10 small zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 left, 1 right) were zzso zzso imaging captured the development of 6 zzso and revealed that they originated within the zzso zzso zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso Imaging just before surgery demonstrated that the epicenters of 9 zzso (1 zzso was not visible on zzso zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso during surgery established that all 10 zzso were limited to the zzso zzso zzso and the immediately surrounding zzso zzso analysis confirmed tumor within the zzso portion zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in all 10 zzso 

zzso originate from zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso imaging through the region of the zzso aqueduct is essential for zzso zzso exploration of the zzso duct and zzso is required for complete zzso
