The objective of this study was to compare a newly developed zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso sequence with standard zzso zzso zzso sequences regarding image quality and diagnostic performance in assessing abnormal findings of the zzso MR imaging was performed at zzso T in 50 zzso Images were assessed independently by three zzso Image quality was rated significantly higher zzso zzso zzso for the zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso zzso for cartilage zzso was slightly higher for the zzso zzso but specificity was zzso Low contrast objects were better zzso with zzso zzso while high contrast objects were better shown with the zzso zzso zzso scores were higher for zzso than for zzso zzso but differences were not zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging may enhance standard knee zzso by increased zzso of high contrast zzso however, zzso zzso image quality was zzso
