The aim of this study was to survey acute zzso stroke services in seven Italian zzso 

Regional hospital discharge registers were searched to identify hospital services that record at least 50 acute stroke zzso per year and the doctors in charge of these services were zzso 

Only 31 zzso out of zzso services could be classified as stroke units zzso Of these, only 9 zzso were found to have vital function monitoring systems available for all zzso The most striking differences between zzso and mixed stroke services emerged when comparing zzso ratios in the two types of zzso 

There are still not enough zzso in Italy, and fewer than zzso of stroke patients can be admitted to such zzso
