zzso transfer zzso zzso can provide in zzso markers reflecting the severity of zzso zzso brain damage occurring within and outside zzso zzso 

To assess the effect of zzso zzso zzso treatment on the zzso of brain damage in patients with secondary progressive zzso zzso measured using zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso from five centers participating in a European, zzso zzso zzso trial of zzso in zzso underwent brain zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso follow-up data were available for 75 patients at 12 months, 54 at 24 months, and 47 at 36 zzso zzso zzso scans were zzso and analyzed to obtain zzso of zzso ratio zzso values from the whole zzso A region of zzso analysis of zzso values from the zzso white matter zzso was also zzso 

In both the treatment arms, there was a decrease of average brain zzso values from baseline to month 24 zzso change zzso and month 36 zzso change zzso These changes were significant for the zzso group at both zzso and for the zzso group at month 24 only, with no significant treatment zzso A decrease of zzso zzso was also observed, with no significant difference between the two treatment zzso 

In this cohort of patients with secondary progressive zzso zzso zzso did not show an overall effect on the worsening of zzso transfer zzso measures, when compared with zzso The data show that change in zzso transfer ratio is a promising tool for monitoring disease evolution in secondary progressive zzso and that the information obtained from zzso transfer zzso zzso that obtained from zzso measures of zzso load and zzso
