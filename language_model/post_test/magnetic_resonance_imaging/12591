The neural mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of hypnosis still remain zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso we assessed changes in brain zzso and connectivity related to the hypnotic state as compared to normal zzso in 13 healthy zzso zzso a difference in zzso ratings was found between normal zzso and hypnotic state for both zzso and painful zzso stimuli applied to the left zzso In normal zzso zzso range stimuli activated zzso zzso primary zzso zzso and bilateral insular zzso zzso stimuli activated additional areas encompassing thalamus, bilateral zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso In zzso zzso stimuli in both the zzso and painful range failed to elicit any cerebral zzso The interaction analysis identified that zzso thalamus, bilateral zzso and zzso activated more in normal zzso compared to hypnosis during painful versus zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated zzso increases in functional connectivity between zzso and distant anterior insular and prefrontal zzso possibly reflecting zzso zzso
