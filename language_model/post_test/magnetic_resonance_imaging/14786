Douglas zzso proposed a new zzso of tumor penetration in the zzso wall zzso zzso in an attempt to incorporate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso 

This study aimed to evaluate if the accuracy of zzso ultrasound and zzso in predicting zzso cancer T staging improves when using a modified zzso zzso 

This prospective series compares local standard zzso staging and a modified zzso zzso 

This study was conducted by a specialized zzso zzso Team at a zzso teaching zzso 

zzso patients underwent surgery for middle or low zzso cancer between 2002 and 2008 without zzso zzso We compared the zzso staging with the pathological staging to determine the zzso accuracy of zzso ultrasound and zzso when using a modified zzso zzso vs the standard zzso zzso 

A modified version of zzso zzso was used for zzso and pathological zzso 

The primary outcome measured was the accuracy in the zzso T zzso 

The overall accuracy of zzso ultrasound and zzso in assessing T staging was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using the proposed modified zzso zzso the overall accuracy of zzso ultrasound and zzso improved to zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso in zzso assessment was not zzso 

With use of the modified zzso zzso proposed in this study, the overall accuracy of zzso imaging in assessing T staging of zzso cancer is substantially improved, especially when zzso ultrasound and zzso stage match, enhancing the selection of patients for zzso zzso
