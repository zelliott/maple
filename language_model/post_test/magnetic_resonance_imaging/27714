Stroke survivors have less muscle mass in their zzso limbs compared with zzso zzso which may or may not be accompanied by changes in regional and/or whole body fat zzso 

To examine the current evidence regarding differences in regional fat mass between zzso and zzso limbs and changes in whole body fat mass over time in stroke zzso 

A systematic search of relevant zzso Studies measuring whole body or regional fat mass using zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging were zzso 

Eleven trials were zzso Fat mass differences between zzso and zzso limbs and change in fat mass over time were not zzso zzso were conducted using zzso X-ray zzso data from 10 trials zzso There were no differences in fat mass between zzso and zzso legs zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso and slightly greater fat mass in the zzso arms compared with zzso arms zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso Whole body fat mass did not increase significantly between one-month and zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso but there was an increase between zzso and 12 months zzso zzso mean difference 1935 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

There were inconsistent findings regarding changes in fat mass after zzso zzso zzso studies are required to further investigate the impact of body composition changes on the health of stroke zzso
