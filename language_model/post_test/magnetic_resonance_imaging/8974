After successful trials of zzso reconstruction using zzso zzso in canine models, the technique has been applied clinically to human patients since zzso To enhance tissue zzso we have applied a new tissue engineering approach to this zzso zzso 

The zzso consists of a zzso mesh tube reinforced with a zzso spiral and zzso zzso The cervical zzso of 18 beagle dogs were replaced with the zzso The collagen layer was soaked with peripheral blood in 6 of the dogs, with bone zzso zzso in another 6, and with zzso zzso bone zzso cells zzso stem zzso in another zzso The dogs were humanely killed at 1 to 12 months after the zzso 

All 18 dogs survived the zzso zzso zzso 3 of 4 dogs in the peripheral blood group showed zzso whereas no zzso was evident in all 8 of the dogs in the bone zzso and zzso stem cell groups 6 months after the zzso zzso zzso and fewer zzso such as mesh exposure and zzso zzso were observed in these two groups than in the peripheral blood zzso zzso the cells from zzso bone zzso were found to zzso into the zzso tissue during the first zzso zzso movement in these two groups was faster than that in the peripheral blood group and recovered to zzso to zzso of the normal zzso 

Bone zzso zzso and zzso stem cells enhance the zzso of the zzso zzso on this zzso This in zzso tissue engineering approach may facilitate zzso reconstruction in the clinical zzso
