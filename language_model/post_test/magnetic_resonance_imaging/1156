To explore the potential role of zzso resonance imaging zzso for zzso zzso and cortical bone structural parameters in zzso zzso zzso a zzso disorder of bone zzso traditionally evaluated by bone zzso 

zzso zzso patients zzso zzso level zzso 502 zzso 415 zzso were compared with 17 zzso zzso and body mass index zzso control zzso The average dialysis duration for the patients was zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso MR images of the zzso zzso zzso size zzso 137 zzso 137 zzso 410 zzso were processed to yield bone volume fraction zzso From a zzso representation of the zzso bone network, the zzso of each bone zzso was determined providing surface and curve zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso erosion index zzso Further, high-resolution two-dimensional zzso zzso images were collected at the zzso zzso for measurement of cortical bone zzso area zzso relative zzso expressed as a percentage of total bone area zzso and mean cortical thickness zzso 

The data show both RCA and zzso to be lower in the patients zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso were lower, while zzso was increased in the patients, although these differences were not quite significant zzso zzso zzso All of the cortical and zzso findings are consistent with increased bone zzso 

The data suggest that zzso may have potential to characterize the structural implications of zzso bone disease, potentially providing a zzso tool for the evaluation of therapies for zzso
