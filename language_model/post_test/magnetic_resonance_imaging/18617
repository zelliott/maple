Treatment of childhood leukemia may cause zzso defects in the brain observed by zzso zzso zzso is a novel method to study brain zzso which has not been used previously in this zzso This study was performed to compare zzso with zzso zzso in patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso after zzso 

zzso children or young adults underwent zzso zzso at the zzso of treatment zzso zzso 9) or zzso years after the treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso of them also underwent zzso at the time of zzso zzso 0-3 days, zzso zzso zzso or a couple of months later zzso months, zzso zzso zzso zzso images and relative cerebral blood volume zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso maps from zzso zzso were analyzed zzso Relative zzso ratios of gray matter to white matter and zzso to white matter were also calculated from the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso did not show any focal zzso zzso while small defects were observed by zzso in five of 17 children zzso in the zzso frontal or zzso areas on the zzso No significant differences were observed by zzso zzso in the relative zzso ratios in the different treatment zzso Time since treatment, age at diagnosis, brain zzso or findings in conventional zzso or zzso did not have any effect on the relative zzso values zzso 

zzso may show small zzso defects after treatment for childhood leukemia which are not visible by zzso zzso The clinical significance or prognosis of these defects is not zzso
