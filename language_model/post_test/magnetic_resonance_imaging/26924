It is often implicitly assumed that the neural zzso patterns revealed by zzso methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso methods, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso In early sensory processing that seems to be the case, but the assumption may not be correct in high-level cognitive zzso For example, zzso and zzso literature of zzso reading suggests differences in cortical zzso but direct comparisons are zzso Here, while the same human participants performed the same reading task, analysis of zzso evoked responses and zzso blood zzso zzso zzso signals revealed marked functional and spatial differences in several cortical areas outside the visual zzso Divergent patterns of zzso were observed in the frontal and zzso cortex, in accordance with previous separate zzso and zzso studies of zzso Furthermore, opposite stimulus effects in the zzso and zzso measures were detected in the left zzso zzso zzso evoked responses were stronger to letter than symbol strings, whereas the zzso zzso signal was stronger to symbol than letter zzso The zzso recorded simultaneously during zzso and zzso did not indicate zzso differences that could explain the observed functional discrepancies between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the complementary nature of zzso and zzso measures, as reported here in a cognitive task using evoked response analysis in zzso and zzso signal analysis in zzso represents an essential step toward an informed use of zzso imaging that reaches beyond mere combination of location and timing of neural zzso
