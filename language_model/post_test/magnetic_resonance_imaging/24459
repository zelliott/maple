To determine the long-term zzso outcome for children after zzso zzso zzso without major zzso and to examine zzso injury patterns detected on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging zzso in relation to later zzso 

zzso enrolled children with zzso and zzso cerebral zzso data zzso zzso zzso were examined at a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso Eleven children had a major disability zzso cerebral zzso or mental zzso Brain injury was scored according to the region and extent of zzso 

Children without major disability zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso and performance zzso scores compared with norms zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and the proportion of children with an zzso zzso was higher than expected zzso zzso zzso Motor performance on the zzso zzso Assessment was affected in the pure zzso zzso fine zzso and gross motor zzso as well as in the movement quality domain (all P zzso zzso Watershed injury pattern on zzso zzso correlated with zzso and verbal zzso scores zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), but zzso zzso pattern did not correlate with motor performance in children without major zzso 

Children who sustained zzso zzso without major disability are at increased risk for long-term intellectual, zzso and motor zzso The severity of watershed injury is correlated with later intellectual zzso zzso follow-up examinations are necessary for early detection of zzso impairment and early initiation of adequate zzso
