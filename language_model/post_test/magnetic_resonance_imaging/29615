zzso recordings of the zzso zzso zzso and functional imaging data point to an involvement of zzso frontal zzso (including the anterior zzso cortex, zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso in the detection and correction of performance zzso Here, we studied this network by applying trains of rapid zzso magnetic stimulation zzso prior to the recording of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to zzso frontal or lateral frontal regions zzso zzso for 60 s immediately before each 3 zzso zzso recording in 11 healthy young zzso The zzso was obtained by zzso recordings in a typical zzso zzso task with instructions calling for immediate error correction in case a performance error was detected by the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and statistically evaluated using standard zzso 

Compared to a zzso control condition, zzso frontal stimulation led to a small but reliable decrease in the number of corrected errors as well as to an zzso of the zzso and an increase of the subsequent zzso zzso No effect on these components was seen after lateral frontal zzso No reliable effects on the zzso readiness potential were zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso appear to interfere with the functions of the zzso frontal zzso in error detection and zzso
