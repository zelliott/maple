To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Several zzso therapy regimens of zzso have shown varying results in zzso A recent pilot study suggested benefits from zzso 

zzso patients were zzso to receive subcutaneous injections of zzso zzso zzso or zzso million international units zzso (32 zzso or zzso zzso (32 zzso of zzso three times weekly for 6 months, with a further 6 months of zzso Monthly zzso zzso was the primary method of evaluating zzso 

zzso treatment resulted in fewer new zzso zzso during the treatment period zzso zzso zzso The probability of no new zzso during treatment was zzso times higher with zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso The median number of zzso at the end of treatment was lower with zzso treatment than with zzso zzso zzso zzso but the difference disappeared during zzso The total number of zzso zzso increased by zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso during treatment zzso zzso zzso No treatment effect on zzso rate, progression of zzso or quality of life was zzso Nine patients discontinued treatment, five because of adverse zzso 

zzso treatment significantly reduced disease activity as measured by zzso but the efficacy disappeared within 6 months after zzso of zzso A long-term study of more patients using disability as a primary outcome measure is needed to evaluate the clinical zzso
