During the last decade, the development of nuclear spin polarization enhanced zzso molecular zzso has opened up new opportunities for studying the inner workings of living cells in real zzso The zzso zzso are produced ex zzso introduced into biological systems and detected with high sensitivity and contrast against background signals using high resolution zzso zzso A variety of natural, zzso and designed zzso zzso has emerged for diverse biological studies including zzso of zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso probe zzso and export, zzso zzso state, zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso drug efficacy or zzso zzso These zzso are readily used directly under natural conditions in zzso and are often directly developed and zzso for cellular zzso thus leaving little doubt about their specificity and utility under biologically relevant zzso zzso molecular zzso for biological zzso zzso enable the unbiased detection of complex processes by virtue of the high spectral resolution, structural specificity and zzso of zzso zzso Here, we provide a survey of strategies used for the selection, design and use of zzso zzso zzso in biological zzso and describe current limitations and zzso
