The diagnosis of liver zzso relies on zzso The sensitivity of zzso CT and magnetic resonance techniques for detecting liver zzso can only be assessed in comparison with surgical inspection, zzso ultrasound and pathological examination, all methods that are of uncertain accuracy in detecting very small zzso With current imaging technology, we should detect virtually all liver zzso 2 zzso or larger in size, and most of those 1-2 zzso in zzso Even with optimum imaging, at present we detect only about one-half of zzso zzso smaller than 1 zzso in patients undergoing liver zzso and pathological zzso zzso in the earlier detection of zzso will probably require a fundamentally different approach from that of conventional anatomical zzso zzso produce zzso in blood flow that may be recognized by zzso or zzso zzso zzso
