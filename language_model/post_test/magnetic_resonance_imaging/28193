To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging zzso enhanced with zzso zzso for the detection of the inflamed zzso and for the evaluation of the response to therapy in zzso arthritis, we studied 49 patients with zzso arthritis zzso according to the 1987 revised criteria of American zzso Association zzso 6 patients of systemic lupus zzso zzso complicated by arthritis, 3 patients of zzso zzso 2 patients of zzso syndrome, 2 patients of progressive systemic sclerosis and 10 healthy volunteers as an age matched zzso The 49 patients with zzso were divided into three groups: zzso early phase of zzso zzso non progressing zzso and zzso slowly progressing zzso and the stage zzso of plain X-ray film and enhancement pattern of MR images were classified into three zzso zzso enhancement showed a zzso zzso or diffuse zzso Almost all cases in early phase of zzso group and non progressing zzso group showed a linear pattern, a zzso pattern or even no enhancement, while slowly progressing group of stage II or higher showed the diffuse pattern of enhancement in all except 2 zzso Moreover, the linear pattern, the zzso pattern or even no contrast enhancement were seen in all except 1 stage I patient, whereas 26 out of 29 patients with stage II or higher change showed diffuse contrast zzso Furthermore, a comparison of MR images before and after administration of zzso in 10 patients showed that the improvement of clinical symptoms correlated fairly well with reduction of contrast zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
