The anterior zzso zzso is considered to be both the structural and functional link between experience, zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso studies have shown changes in anterior zzso gray matter volume zzso in zzso zzso depression and anxiety disorders in older patients, but few studies have investigated zzso zzso changes in young zzso This study examined the relationship between anterior zzso zzso clinical symptom severity and zzso performance in a zzso cohort of young people presenting for mental health zzso 

Participants with a primary diagnosis of depression zzso bipolar disorder zzso psychosis zzso anxiety disorder zzso or healthy controls zzso underwent structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the bilateral anterior zzso zzso was performed using the zzso zzso zzso analysis examined the linear and zzso correlations between anterior zzso zzso and zzso performance in a battery of clinical and zzso zzso 

Compared to healthy participants, patients had significantly reduced zzso in the left anterior zzso zzso zzso which correlated with reduced performance on a zzso task of zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in right anterior zzso zzso was correlated with increased symptom severity zzso zzso and more positive symptoms zzso zzso 

By using the novel approach of examining a zzso cohort of young depression, anxiety, bipolar and psychosis patients together, this study has demonstrated that zzso zzso changes are associated with zzso deficits and clinical symptoms in such young zzso
