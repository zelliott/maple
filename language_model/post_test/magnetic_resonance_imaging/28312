zzso is often difficult to diagnose in the absence of zzso zzso For the diagnosis of active zzso plain zzso zzso and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso were evaluated in a prospective zzso 

In 44 consecutive patients with complete clinical and laboratory zzso plain zzso quantitative zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed to evaluate the contribution of these imaging techniques to the diagnosis of active zzso zzso and zzso were done in 20 control subjects to define the normal range of imaging zzso We determined the sensitivity and specificity for each imaging method using a reference standard based on clinical symptoms of inflammatory low back pain with or without laboratory signs, and on clinical and zzso followup during zzso years to confirm zzso 

zzso was most sensitive zzso and superior to quantitative zzso zzso zzso or conventional zzso zzso for the detection and confirmation of active zzso For the assessment of inflammatory signs, zzso had higher specificity zzso than zzso zzso or plain zzso zzso At repeat zzso after zzso months, there was persistent zzso signal intensity in the zzso bone area despite clinically successful zzso drug zzso 

For the assessment of active changes in the zzso portion and the zzso bone zzso contrast enhanced zzso is superior to quantitative zzso zzso or conventional zzso zzso picks up an additional zzso of early cases not diagnosed by plain zzso zzso is only of limited zzso zzso zzso signal intensity in the zzso bone zzso seems to be closely associated with previous inflammatory episodes, thus limiting specificity of zzso for active zzso Based on our findings we suggest an zzso for the evaluation of patients with suspected active zzso
