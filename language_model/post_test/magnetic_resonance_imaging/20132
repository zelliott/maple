To clarify the relationships between zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso we compared findings in 37 selected patients who presented with cervical root zzso zzso Nerve root repair with zzso zzso was subsequently performed on 19 zzso The agreement between the two zzso zzso with complete or incomplete zzso of zzso root and zzso or zzso zzso of zzso root was measured for each root zzso Both with zzso and zzso root zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded high agreement values, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso the lowest agreement zzso zzso on zzso root zzso Additionally, zzso in comparison with zzso revealed a higher quantity of implicated injured zzso zzso in turn, detected more zzso components than surgical exploration alone zzso The capability of zzso to recognize zzso leads to the zzso findings between the two zzso The zzso of mild zzso by zzso which cannot be achieved by surgical inspection, results in divergent findings between the two zzso Both zzso and the zzso play crucial roles in zzso assessment, and they may complement each zzso
