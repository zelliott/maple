The trunk muscles of the zzso region were studied using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in five male volunteers placed in neutral and in two twisted zzso Using a zzso zzso system, the positions of trunk muscle zzso and the zzso areas of these muscles were measured from the zzso scans at 1 zzso intervals from zzso to zzso Muscle lines of action were created by connecting the muscle zzso from the successive zzso Changes in zzso areas and zzso of zzso in a three-dimensional coordinate system and the local two-dimensional coordinate system were estimated at each disc zzso In the three-dimensional coordinate system, all muscle zzso were displaced when zzso Thus, the locations and zzso of all muscle lines of action zzso In the local two-dimensional coordinate system, only the muscle zzso of four abdominal muscles were zzso Most of these zzso occurred in the first 25 degrees of zzso Higher up in the zzso spine, the displacement was zzso The changes in moment arms were sometimes as great as zzso Only the abdominal zzso muscles zzso changed their zzso area zzso the area of the right zzso zzso to the side of twisting increased, while that of the left zzso was zzso
