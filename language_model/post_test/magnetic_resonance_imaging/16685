Previous research has consistently shown that the left zzso zzso is critical for zzso processing, but the role of the right zzso lobe has been much less zzso This study used the zzso cortical electrical stimulation approach to investigate neural zzso in the right zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso (as well as picture zzso was not affected by the cortical electrical stimulation on all the targeted sites of the right zzso zzso as well as those of the right zzso zzso In contrast, stimulation at three right zzso sites zzso sites in the right inferior zzso zzso and one in the right angular zzso impaired performance on simple zzso zzso This study provided the first evidence from an zzso cortical electrical stimulation study to show the zzso of zzso operations in the right zzso zzso This zzso between zzso and zzso suggests that the right zzso zzso plays a more significant role in quantity processing zzso than in verbal processing zzso in zzso zzso
