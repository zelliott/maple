To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the zzso local staging of primary zzso zzso 

zzso patients with surgically and zzso proven primary zzso cancer who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in this retrospective zzso Two zzso who were blinded to the pathology results, independently reviewed the MR images and recorded their confidence level for determination of zzso extension, and regional zzso zzso zzso involvement using a zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of each reviewer for local staging was calculated by receiver operating characteristic zzso curve zzso zzso agreement was also calculated using linear weighted zzso zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy zzso under the zzso curve, zzso for determining zzso extension was for reviewer 1, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and for reviewer 2, zzso zzso zzso The zzso for determination of regional zzso involvement was for reviewer 1, zzso zzso and for reviewer 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement included, respectively, good, and moderate agreement for zzso extension, and regional zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can provide accurate information of zzso extension and regional zzso involvement in the zzso local staging of primary zzso zzso
