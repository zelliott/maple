In comprehensive zzso studies of brain function, the data structures often contain zzso ways such as trial, task condition, subject, and group in addition to the intrinsic dimensions of time and zzso While zzso zzso methods such as principal component analysis zzso have been used successfully for zzso information about spatial and zzso features in data from a single zzso run, the need to unfold zzso data sets into zzso zzso has led to zzso that are zzso and to the loss of zzso linkages and interactions present in the zzso These additional dimensions or ways can be retained in zzso models to produce structures that are unique and which admit interpretations that are zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso data from multiple runs of a bilateral zzso paradigm was performed using the parallel factor zzso zzso A zzso model was fitted to a data cube of dimensions zzso by time by zzso Similarly, a zzso model was fitted to a zzso structure of dimensions zzso by time by trial by zzso The spatial and zzso response components were extracted and validated by comparison to results from traditional zzso analyses based on scenarios of unfolding into zzso zzso zzso
