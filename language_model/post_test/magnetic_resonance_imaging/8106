To investigate the zzso significance of premature zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of patients with medically zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso with zzso sclerosis zzso 

We compared the clinical and zzso zzso and zzso seizure outcome of zzso zzso age zzso years, range zzso zzso surgically treated zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Age at surgery was significantly higher and duration of zzso before surgery was significantly longer for zzso patients compared to zzso zzso Although the distribution of zzso zzso zzso abnormalities did not zzso type 1 zzso zzso pattern was more frequent in zzso zzso Among the 21 patients with major zzso psychosis detected prior to zzso surgery, 19 zzso belonged to zzso zzso zzso psychosis was most zzso The zzso zzso outcome was comparable, but significantly more zzso patients were free of zzso zzso 

Overall, our observations support the hypothesis that the pathological process in zzso is zzso zzso patients are predisposed to increased psychiatric zzso In zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso in the future will help us to understand the zzso significance of this zzso
