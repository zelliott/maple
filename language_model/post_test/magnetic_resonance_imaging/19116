To assess the dynamic changes in left zzso volume by zzso three zzso zzso and compare the results with those obtained by magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

30 healthy children (15 boys and 15 girls, aged 8 to 13 zzso underwent examination by three zzso zzso and zzso 

Three zzso zzso of the left atrium was performed using zzso acquisition of planes at 18 degrees intervals from the zzso window with zzso gating and without respiratory zzso Volume zzso by zzso was performed with a slice thickness of zzso zzso and zzso triggering during breath holding in deep zzso A left zzso zzso curve was reconstructed in each zzso 

Left zzso maximum and minimum volumes averaged zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso by three zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso The greater left zzso minimum volume in the latter was at least in part a result of breath zzso Dynamic changes in left zzso volume during the heart cycle were zzso by both zzso The higher zzso resolution of three zzso zzso allowed a more precise evaluation of different zzso 

Three zzso zzso and zzso were both useful methods for studying the zzso volume changes in the left atrium in zzso These methods may be used for further study of the zzso and zzso function of the zzso
