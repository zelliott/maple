zzso and failing zzso has been shown to undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that chronic volume overload zzso due to zzso zzso in the dog causes zzso zzso switching and that this could be reversed by zzso converting zzso inhibitor zzso Thirteen adult zzso dogs had zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso six were treated with zzso for 4 months and seven were zzso for 4 zzso Twelve dogs were zzso six received zzso for 3 months and six were zzso Left zzso zzso volume increased from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso in treated dogs zzso as zzso zzso ratio decreased in both zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and treated dogs zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in normal zzso and increased to zzso and zzso in both treated and zzso zzso zzso dogs; respectively zzso zzso Steady state zzso zzso increased zzso in treated and zzso dogs with zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso while zzso zzso expression did not differ in all zzso Thus, chronic volume overload zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso switching by selective induction of the zzso zzso and zzso therapy does not affect this zzso zzso This may reflect a response to increased zzso stress and more efficient energy zzso in the volume overloaded zzso
