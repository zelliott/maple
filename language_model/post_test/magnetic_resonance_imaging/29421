zzso a zzso zzso product zzso from zzso has been found to be effective against zzso The present study was aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of zzso in zzso in reducing zzso cerebral zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were subjected to middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered twice zzso zzso zzso just prior to 1 zzso of zzso zzso and 1 day after the zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired 1 day after the zzso In the zzso control rats, increases in zzso signals zzso zzso were clearly observed in the zzso and in the cerebral zzso In the zzso group, total volume of zzso was reduced by zzso compared with control group zzso zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso against zzso was more clearly observed in the cerebral zzso zzso by zzso P zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso by zzso P zzso zzso zzso volume in a zzso slice was the greatest at the level of the zzso zzso of cerebral zzso by zzso was more effective zzso than anterior to the zzso zzso appeared to reduce the volume of the zzso sites rather than to shift the signal intensity zzso The present zzso study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of zzso against cerebral zzso formation in zzso animals in zzso especially in the cerebral zzso zzso may be highly useful in preventing cortical zzso such as zzso zzso memory, and psychological zzso associated with zzso zzso
