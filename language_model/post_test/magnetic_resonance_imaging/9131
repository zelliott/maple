Working memory zzso for sign language has an architecture similar to that for zzso languages at both functional and neural zzso However, there are some processing differences between language zzso that are not yet fully explained, although a number of hypotheses have been zzso This article reviews some of the literature on differences in zzso zzso and cognitive processing systems induced by auditory deprivation and sign language use and discusses how these differences may contribute to differences in zzso architecture for signed and zzso zzso In conclusion, it is suggested that zzso reorganization of the zzso system as a result of native zzso use may interfere with the development of the order processing system in zzso
