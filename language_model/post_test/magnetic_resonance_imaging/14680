To assess changes in zzso size and function over time in conservatively treated adult patients with repaired zzso of zzso zzso and significant pulmonary zzso zzso 

Patients with repaired zzso who had undergone more than one cardiac magnetic resonance study were zzso To zzso the cause of zzso size and function zzso to zzso patients with residual zzso zzso zzso more than mild zzso at a valve other than the pulmonary zzso and known coronary artery disease were zzso 

The final analysis included 27 adults with zzso fraction zzso During a follow-up of mean zzso zzso zzso years, there was no change in right zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Left zzso zzso zzso showed a small decrease zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso volume, and peak RV zzso tract zzso did not zzso Additionally, both RV ejection fraction zzso and zzso remained stable over the follow-up period zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Only two zzso patients zzso of the study zzso developed symptoms and the remaining did not zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso remained stable over a mean follow-up of approximately 2 years in the majority of adult patients after zzso repair with significant zzso and a wide range of zzso
