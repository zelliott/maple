The authors studied zzso 42 patients with the magnetic resonance zzso diagnosis of zzso Depending on MR findings, the patients were grouped into early, zzso and late stages of zzso Early stage zzso patients presented with high intensity signal changes on zzso images involving the zzso of the affected zzso The intermediate stage patients were characterized by varying degrees of zzso necrosis of the central gray matter, better seen on zzso zzso Central zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso were prominent features of the late stage of zzso Ten patients had follow-up MR examinations within 6 months of initial zzso Two of the four early stage zzso patients showed improvement in the repeat zzso The follow-up scans of the six intermediate and late stage zzso patients showed either no change or progression of zzso Early stage zzso may be zzso depending on the severity of the initial spinal zzso zzso zzso resonance can serve as a useful tool in the assessment and management of zzso zzso
