Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we investigated processes involved in switching between two ongoing tasks, thought to be zzso of executive control zzso zzso were considerably slower and less accurate when switching between two tasks than when repeatedly carrying out one task, so-called zzso zzso zzso costs, however, generally occur only when more than one task is associated with each stimulus zzso This has led to the zzso that switch costs may be due largely to ongoing interference from previously learned zzso zzso associations, which are no longer relevant for the task at zzso We used a paradigm that specifically assessed this hypothesis and investigated three zzso In Stage 1, a single task was carried out with each stimulus type; in Stage 2, a second novel task was introduced for each stimulus type; and in Stage 3, subjects reverted to carrying out solely the original tasks (as in Stage zzso In Stage 1, only one task was associated with each stimulus type, whereas two tasks were associated with each stimulus type in zzso 2 and zzso We compared images obtained during Stage 3 to those obtained during Stage 1 and show that during Stage 3, there was robust zzso in the network of areas associated with the Stage 2 tasks, even though these tasks were no longer zzso Our data strongly suggest that switch costs may derive largely from continued zzso of areas associated with carrying out the zzso zzso We zzso that a large component of executive control processes involves resolution of competition between potentially relevant zzso Our data also revealed widespread zzso of a zzso network of areas, and we discuss how this network might be involved in zzso this zzso
