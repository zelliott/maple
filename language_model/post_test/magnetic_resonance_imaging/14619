The zzso Education Center's Breast MR With zzso zzso course is designed to provide zzso with an zzso hands-on experience in interpreting breast zzso The aim of this study was to describe zzso performance in breast MR interpretation by case clinical indication, zzso type, and zzso assessment to inform future educational zzso 

Data from 16 consecutive courses held from 2009 to 2012 at the zzso Education Center were zzso For each MR case, the clinical indication zzso vs zzso background zzso enhancement, and zzso type zzso vs zzso zzso were zzso zzso case zzso assessments were zzso as either correct or incorrect in relation to zzso zzso zzso zzso interpretive accuracy on the basis of study indication, zzso type, and background zzso enhancement is zzso 

Data from zzso course participants over 3 years were zzso Of the 96 MR cases included in the analysis, zzso zzso zzso 50) were indicated for screening and zzso zzso zzso zzso for diagnostic zzso Participants provided correct zzso assessments for zzso of screening cases zzso of zzso and zzso of diagnostic cases zzso of zzso Participants more accurately assessed screening compared with diagnostic MR cases zzso zzso zzso and masses compared with zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in performance on the basis of background zzso zzso 

zzso zzso perform more accurately on screening compared with diagnostic MR and when evaluating masses as opposed to areas of zzso zzso Future zzso breast MR education efforts should emphasize strategies for interpreting diagnostic breast MR cases and evaluating zzso zzso
