It has been described that zzso in zzso imaging zzso zzso with high-grade zzso and high zzso in zzso zzso images identifies zzso zzso We aimed to investigate the potential of routine conventional zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso to zzso distinguish between zzso and high-grade brain zzso in zzso zzso 

Two zzso blinded to the zzso diagnosis, rated the aspect and signal intensity of MR images zzso and zzso from 37 children with newly diagnosed brain zzso zzso diagnoses included 18 zzso and 19 high-grade brain zzso 

The zzso agreement was zzso zzso zzso were never zzso on zzso and zzso zzso were usually zzso on zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for high-grade zzso About zzso of the high-grade zzso and about zzso of the zzso zzso were correctly zzso 

The combination of general zzso aspect of the zzso and signals on zzso and zzso yield a high accuracy of zzso differentiation between zzso and high-grade zzso zzso
