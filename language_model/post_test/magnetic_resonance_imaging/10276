zzso of recently acquired zzso memories depends on the zzso but with time, retrieval is increasingly sustainable by zzso representations zzso This process has been zzso as zzso zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed over the course of three months how consolidation affects the neural zzso of memory zzso The duration of zzso sleep during a zzso period after the initial study session and before the first scan session on day 1 correlated positively with recognition memory performance for items studied before the nap and zzso with zzso activity associated with correct confident zzso Over the course of the entire study, zzso activity for correct confident recognition continued to decrease, whereas activity in a zzso zzso prefrontal region zzso These findings, together with data obtained in zzso may prompt a revision of classical consolidation theory, incorporating a transfer of putative linking zzso from zzso to zzso prefrontal zzso
