We studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction in five patients with markedly elevated zzso zzso zzso gain due to zzso zzso All had impaired smooth zzso decreased initial slow phase zzso of zzso and impaired ability to suppress the zzso with real or imagined zzso zzso slow phase zzso gradually built up over zzso zzso reaching normal values for low stimulus zzso zzso or zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso of zzso was increased, but the rate of zzso of zzso was zzso These findings can be explained by models that include separate zzso storage and variable gain elements shared by the zzso and zzso zzso
