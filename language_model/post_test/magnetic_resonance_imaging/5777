zzso for organ rejection is a critical component of care for patients who have undergone heart zzso zzso biopsy is the gold standard screening zzso but zzso alternatives are zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso is well suited to provide an alternative to biopsy because of its ability to zzso zzso function, zzso and characterize zzso zzso zzso is not widely used to screen for heart transplant zzso despite many trials supporting its use for this zzso This review summarizes the different zzso sequences that can detect heart transplant rejection as well as the strengths and weaknesses of their zzso 

zzso zzso by spin echo techniques has been criticized for poor zzso but multiple studies show its utility in screening for zzso Human and animal data estimate that zzso zzso can diagnose rejection with sensitivities and zzso near zzso There is also a suggestion that zzso zzso can predict rejection episodes in patients with normal zzso zzso zzso has also shown association with biopsy proven rejection in a small number of zzso zzso weighted zzso early enhancement appeared promising in animal data, but has had conflicting results in human zzso Late zzso enhancement in the diagnosis of rejection has not been zzso derived measures of zzso zzso and zzso function have insufficient sensitivity to diagnose mild to moderate zzso zzso derived zzso function can demonstrate abnormalities in zzso compared to native human hearts, but its ability to diagnose rejection has not yet been zzso is promising animal data on the ability of iron oxide contrast agents to illustrate the changes in vascular zzso and zzso zzso seen in zzso Despite good safety data, these contrast agents have not been tested in the human heart transplant zzso 

zzso zzso has demonstrated the best correlation to biopsy proven heart transplant zzso Further studies evaluating zzso function, late zzso enhancement, and iron oxide contrast agents to diagnose rejection are zzso Future studies should focus on combining multiple zzso measures into a transplant rejection scoring system which would improve sensitivity and possibly zzso if not zzso the need for zzso zzso
