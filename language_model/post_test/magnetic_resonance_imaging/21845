zzso is an uncommon zzso disorder of cerebral cortical zzso Although a zzso cause of zzso and zzso deficits in children, previous reports describe the range of zzso outcome in only 47 zzso We report the clinical and zzso imaging features of 47 children with unilateral zzso zzso unilateral zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso zzso as defined zzso The zzso zzso occurred more often in the anterior than in the zzso zzso Children with zzso zzso presented with zzso or motor delay whereas patients with zzso zzso presented with zzso or zzso zzso patients zzso had associated cerebral zzso anomalies, most commonly absence of the zzso zzso zzso and focal cortical zzso zzso There was a history of zzso in 57% of cases, a third of which were classified as difficult to zzso zzso outcome was generally poor, with 51% of patients zzso having severe deficits, zzso of patients zzso having moderate zzso and zzso of patients zzso having mild or no zzso Patients with zzso zzso were more likely to have a mild to moderate outcome than those with zzso type zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Children with unilateral zzso had a mild or moderate outcome more frequently than those with bilateral zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Children who had involvement of a single lobe accounted for zzso of those with mild outcomes and zzso of those with moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with the best zzso zzso in contrast, 11 of 12 children with bilateral zzso zzso had severe zzso Language development was significantly more likely to be normal in those children with unilateral zzso than in those with bilateral zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Thus, the presentation and outcome of children with zzso are quite variable but are related to the extent of zzso involved in the zzso zzso
