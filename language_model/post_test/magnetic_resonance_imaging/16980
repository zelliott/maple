zzso is a promising meticulous system for bone cutting, based on ultrasound zzso It is thought that the impact of zzso on the integrity of soft tissue is generally low, but it has not been examined zzso The authors undertook an experimental study to evaluate the brain tissue response to skull bone removal using zzso compared with a conventional drilling zzso In zzso male rats, a circular bone window was drilled to the zzso bone using zzso on one side and a conventional bone drill on the other zzso The zzso performance of animals was evaluated using the motor zzso test and sensory zzso zzso The brains of animals were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso The results of zzso showed significantly increased depth and zzso of the brain zzso in the region of conventional drilling compared with the region where zzso was zzso zzso and zzso 160 zzso confirmed these zzso There was no significant difference in any of the zzso tests between the two zzso In conclusion, zzso is a safe method for the performance of zzso in close relation to soft zzso including an extremely zzso tissue such as zzso
