Endurance exercise is known to promote sustained zzso effects, and there is evidence that the reduction of pain perception zzso by exercise is driven by central zzso zzso To directly investigate the involved brain areas and the underlying neural mechanisms in humans, zzso zzso challenges were applied to 20 athletes during 4 separate functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans, zzso before and after 2 hours of running zzso zzso and walking zzso zzso zzso Imaging revealed a zzso pattern of distributed zzso zzso in all 4 conditions, including the zzso and lateral pain systems, and the zzso gray zzso as a key region of the descending zzso zzso At the behavioral level, running as compared with walking decreased affective pain zzso The influence of exercise on zzso zzso was reflected in a significant time zzso treatment interaction in the zzso along with similar trends in the zzso anterior zzso zzso and the middle insular cortex, where zzso zzso levels were elevated after walking, but decreased or unchanged after zzso Our findings indicate that enhanced zzso recruitment of zzso zzso mechanisms after aversive repeated pain exposure is attenuated by zzso The fact that running, but not walking, zzso elevated zzso levels in plasma indicates involvement of the zzso system in zzso This may argue for an elevated zzso tone in the brain of athletes, zzso zzso zzso Our findings provide the first evidence using functional imaging to support the role of endurance exercise in pain zzso
