zzso MR imaging and the trace apparent diffusion zzso zzso provide important structural information about zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between trace zzso values and the enhancement pattern of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

zzso zzso identified in 24 patients with zzso were characterized by their enhancement pattern on zzso zzso MR zzso There were 57 zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso enhancing zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso zzso The trace zzso means for each type of zzso and for zzso white matter zzso were calculated and compared using zzso zzso 

The mean trace zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were less than those for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a significant difference between the mean trace zzso values of zzso and zzso as well as between those for zzso and zzso There was also a significant difference in the mean trace zzso values between all zzso types and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We found a predictable relationship between mean trace zzso and the pattern of enhancement in zzso zzso corresponding to reported zzso differences in zzso between zzso types and zzso transfer zzso
