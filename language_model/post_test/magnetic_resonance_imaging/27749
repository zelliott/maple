Standard zzso coils are designed by minimizing the zzso or resistance for an acceptable level of zzso field zzso Recently, a new method was proposed to minimize the maximum value of the current density in a zzso zzso The stated aim of that method was to increase the minimum wire spacing and to reduce the peak temperature in a zzso for fixed zzso These claims are tested in this study with experimental zzso of magnetic field and temperature as well as simulations of the performance of many zzso Experimental results show a zzso increase in minimum wire spacing and zzso reduction in peak temperature for equal zzso efficiency and field zzso zzso of many more coils indicate increase in minimum wire spacing of between 50 and zzso for the coils studied zzso This method is shown to be able to increase zzso efficiency when constrained by minimum wire spacing rather than switching times or total power zzso This increase in efficiency could be used to increase zzso strength, duty cycle, or zzso
