zzso PET studies of zzso zzso typically require that zzso input function be zzso The aim of this study was to explore the use of a zzso input function zzso and an zzso input function zzso for zzso kinetic analysis, with the goal of reducing - and possibly eliminating - the number of zzso blood samples needed to measure parent zzso zzso 

A zzso was first generated using zzso parent zzso zzso from 12 healthy volunteers zzso zzso Both invasive zzso zzso and zzso zzso weight, body surface area, and lean body zzso zzso methods for zzso were zzso The zzso method that gave the best estimate of the zzso values was then used to determine the zzso zzso of zzso in Group 1 and then zzso applied to another population of 25 healthy subjects zzso zzso as well as to a population of 26 patients with major depressive disorder zzso zzso zzso were also compared to those obtained with an zzso input function zzso from the internal carotid zzso In some subjects, we measured zzso differences in zzso concentration to see whether zzso samples could be used instead of zzso zzso Finally, we assessed the ability of zzso and zzso to discriminate depressed patients zzso and healthy zzso 

zzso zzso zzso gave better results than any zzso zzso zzso Excellent results were obtained when the zzso zzso was zzso applied to the subjects in Group 2 zzso ratio zzso zzso and Group 3 zzso ratio zzso Equally accurate results were obtained for two zzso of subjects drawn from Groups 2 and 3 who had very differently shaped zzso zzso or zzso input functions compared to zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained via zzso were equivalent to those obtained via zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso for healthy subjects and zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso of zzso was equivalent to that obtained with full input function and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Due to zzso zzso differences, zzso samples could not be zzso for zzso zzso With both zzso and zzso depressed patients had a zzso reduction in zzso binding as compared to control zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results were almost equivalent to those obtained using 23 zzso zzso 

Although some zzso samples are still necessary, both zzso and zzso are accurate and precise alternatives to full zzso input function for zzso PET zzso Both techniques give accurate results with low zzso even for clinically different groups of subjects and those with very differently shaped input zzso
