One of the major aims of therapy in zzso arthritis zzso is to prevent zzso disease and subsequent zzso One of the important goals of therapy assessment must therefore be the accurate measurement of damage zzso We undertook this study to assess the zzso zzso and zzso of measuring magnetic resonance imaging zzso erosion volumes and zzso volumes in the zzso of zzso patients with the use of a zzso computerized zzso 

Twelve subjects with zzso zzso were chosen to reflect a spectrum of zzso severity as determined by the clinical Joint zzso and Motion zzso zzso zzso of the dominant wrist was performed at the same time of day at baseline and at 48 zzso Images were transferred to a zzso zzso volumes and zzso volumes were measured on the zzso images using zzso imaging zzso All images were reread in random order at 72 hours by 1 zzso The results were compared with erosion scores and global zzso scores obtained by the same observer using the zzso zzso in zzso Clinical Trials zzso zzso scoring zzso zzso were performed at baseline and were read on 2 occasions by 1 observer using the Scott modification of the zzso zzso 

Total erosion volume per subject ranged from 0 zzso to zzso zzso The total zzso membrane volume per subject ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso for erosion volumes and zzso volumes demonstrated excellent zzso reliability and zzso zzso There was a strong positive correlation between the total erosion volume and the total erosion zzso The correlation between the zzso volumes and zzso score was less favorable zzso zzso zzso Positive correlations were demonstrated between the erosion volumes, the zzso score, and the modified zzso zzso No significant correlation was demonstrated between the zzso zzso rate, zzso protein level, swollen joint count, tender joint count, or the Disease zzso zzso in 28 swollen and 28 tender zzso and the zzso volumes or zzso zzso 

This study is the first to demonstrate the zzso zzso and zzso of computerized zzso erosion volume zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The method will require further evaluation in terms of zzso zzso with examination of responsiveness in zzso studies, but the method demonstrates excellent zzso and zzso reliability and compares favorably with existing zzso clinical outcome zzso zzso volume zzso demonstrated good zzso reliability and appeared to be more responsive to zzso change over a zzso period in this group of zzso
