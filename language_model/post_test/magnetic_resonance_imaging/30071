The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso quality and accuracy of prospective real-time zzso acquisition correction versus zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Twenty women in whom fetal motion artifacts compromised the zzso quality of fetal zzso taken during the zzso zzso 4 week of pregnancy below diagnostic levels were additionally investigated using a zzso zzso acquired zzso zzso echo zzso zzso Imaging quality was evaluated by two blinded readers applying a rating scale from 1 (not zzso to 5 zzso zzso criteria included depiction of the zzso zzso zzso and white matter, zzso brain stem and zzso zzso ratios zzso in the white matter and zzso zone were zzso zzso Imaging quality improved in zzso patients using the zzso echo technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for all evaluation zzso In zzso patients fetal movement severely impaired image quality in conventional and zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed additional structural brain abnormalities and confirmed diagnosis in zzso zzso The accuracy improved from 50% to zzso Average zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time triggering of fetal head movement is a reliable technique that can deliver diagnostic fetal MR image quality despite vigorous fetal zzso
