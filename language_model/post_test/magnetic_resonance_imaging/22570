zzso function requires a high level of functional interaction between regions of a network supporting zzso Assuming that brain zzso changes zzso an advanced state of disease zzso changes in functional connectivity may zzso changes in brain zzso The objective of this study was to investigate changes in functional connectivity of the right middle zzso zzso zzso in subjects with mild cognitive impairment zzso during performance of a zzso zzso The right middle zzso is a key area for processing face zzso Brain activity was measured using functional zzso There were 16 zzso subjects and 19 zzso healthy zzso The linear correlation zzso was zzso as a measure of functional connectivity between the right middle zzso and all other zzso in the zzso There were no statistical differences found in task performance or zzso between zzso The right middle zzso of the healthy control and zzso groups showed strong bilateral positive linear correlation with the visual cortex, inferior and superior zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and anterior zzso The healthy controls showed higher positive linear correlation of the right middle zzso to the visual cortex, zzso zzso and right zzso than the zzso group, whereas the latter had higher positive linear correlation in the left zzso In the healthy controls, the right middle zzso had negative linear correlation with right zzso frontal zzso and superior zzso zzso and with left inferior zzso zzso zzso angular zzso superior frontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso but the zzso group had negative linear correlation with the left zzso angular zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and to right middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso correlated regions, the zzso group had reduced functional connectivity to the frontal areas, right superior zzso zzso and left zzso Different regions of the zzso and zzso had increased functional connectivity in either zzso The putative presence of Alzheimer's disease zzso in zzso affects functional connectivity from the right middle zzso to the visual areas and zzso frontal zzso In addition, higher linear correlation in the zzso group in the zzso lobe may indicate the initial appearance of zzso zzso The results demonstrate that functional connectivity can be an effective marker for the detection of changes in brain function in zzso zzso
