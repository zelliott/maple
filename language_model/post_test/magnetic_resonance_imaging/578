To observe whether the severity of white matter zzso zzso is related to zzso in zzso 

zzso were divided into 2 categories zzso zzso and zzso zzso and four grades zzso 0, grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3) according to the severity of zzso showing on the zzso sequence of zzso using modified zzso zzso The values of regional cerebral blood flow zzso within zzso and other brain regions were measured using zzso contrast zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso within zzso around zzso areas, in right and left zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in grade 2; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in grade 3 zzso The severity of zzso is associated significantly with reduction of zzso within zzso both in zzso zzso and zzso regions (all P zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso values between grade 0 and 1, but significant differences existed between grade 0 and grades 2 and 3, between grade 1 and grades 2 and 3 (all P zzso zzso zzso significance also existed between the severity of white matter zzso and zzso in bilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The severity of zzso both in zzso zzso and zzso regions is associated significantly with reduction of zzso within zzso
