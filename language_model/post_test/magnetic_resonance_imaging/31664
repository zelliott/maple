The delivery of drugs to the proposed site of action is a challenging zzso zzso and zzso guiding molecules are being used to carry a cargo of therapeutic zzso The cargo molecules need to be zzso in a zzso manner to the therapeutic molecules such that the zzso of these molecules is not zzso 

Using zzso and zzso zzso the sugar zzso with a unique chemical handle is incorporated at a specific site in the cargo or therapeutic zzso making it possible to zzso these molecules through the chemical handle present on the modified zzso 

The modified zzso zzso introduced at specific sites on the cargo zzso make it possible to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for imaging and zzso applications, lipids for the assembly of zzso zzso drugs, zzso or toxins for zzso cancer therapy and the development of a targeted drug delivery zzso
