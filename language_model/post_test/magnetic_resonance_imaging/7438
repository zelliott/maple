zzso refers to a positive, zzso zzso experience under conditions of a perceived fit between skills and task zzso Using functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging, we investigated the neural zzso of flow in a sample of 27 human zzso zzso in the flow condition participants worked on mental zzso tasks at challenging task difficulty which was automatically and continuously adjusted to zzso skill zzso Experimental settings of zzso and zzso served as comparison zzso The experience of flow was associated with relative increases in neural activity in the left anterior inferior frontal zzso zzso and the left zzso Relative decreases in neural activity were observed in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso ratings of the flow experience were significantly associated with changes in neural activity in the zzso zzso and, with trend towards significance, in the zzso We conclude that neural activity changes in these brain regions reflect psychological processes that map on the characteristic features of zzso coding of increased outcome probability zzso deeper sense of cognitive control zzso decreased self-referential processing zzso and decreased negative zzso zzso
