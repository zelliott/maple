The reliable discrimination of emotional expressions in faces is essential for adequate social zzso zzso in facial emotion processing are an important impairment in schizophrenia with major consequences for social functioning and zzso zzso Whether neural circuits underlying emotion processing are already altered before illness onset is yet zzso zzso neural zzso of emotion processing in individuals clinically at risk for psychosis offers the possibility to examine neural processes unchanged by the manifest disorder and to study trait aspects of emotion zzso 

Twelve subjects clinically at risk for psychosis and 12 matched control subjects participated in this zzso zzso data were acquired during an emotion discrimination task consisting of standardized photographs of faces displaying different emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, zzso as well as faces with neutral facial zzso 

There were no group differences in behavioral zzso zzso discrimination was associated with zzso in high-risk subjects in the right zzso and zzso zzso as well as the left middle zzso zzso Further, high-risk compared to control subjects exhibited stronger zzso related to neutral faces relative to emotional faces in the inferior and superior frontal zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso 

The present study indicates that individuals clinically at risk for psychosis show differences in brain zzso associated with processing of emotional zzso zzso facial expressions despite an adequate behavioral zzso The zzso to attribute zzso to neutral stimuli might indicate a biological risk marker for zzso
