The aim of our study was to assess abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso density in patients suffering from zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso Experimental data in animals show that zzso receptors are predominantly located in zzso areas, and that zzso via these zzso mediates an zzso and zzso zzso In zzso patients, we zzso zzso zzso density in zzso and zzso areas, as defined by zzso recordings with zzso zzso Nine zzso patients and 53 control subjects were studied by PET using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of interest zzso were drawn on patient and control zzso zzso with zzso PET data were zzso using a simplified model to assess binding potential zzso values in each zzso with zzso as zzso For each patient, a zzso percentage zzso change was calculated as the relative variation of zzso in each zzso compared with the corresponding zzso in control zzso In patients, zzso explored by zzso were zzso according to their degree of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso and according to their zzso aspect and volume zzso with volume loss, zzso without volume loss, zzso Compared with control values, the binding to zzso receptors in zzso patients was decreased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease was significantly greater in: zzso regions involved in the seizure onset than regions where only zzso zzso or no zzso activity was recorded; and zzso regions where the discharge zzso than regions where only zzso zzso or no zzso activity was zzso zzso decrease was shown to be significantly influenced by the existence of a zzso on zzso However, in the group of zzso with normal quantitative and qualitative zzso zzso zzso decrease remained strongly correlated to the degree of zzso zzso This study shows that in zzso availability of zzso receptors is decreased in zzso patients compared with normal zzso This decrease is highly correlated to the degree of zzso of cortical areas explored by zzso recordings, and does not reflect only pathological changes or zzso loss in the zzso zzso
