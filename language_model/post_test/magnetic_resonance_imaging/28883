The purpose of this work was to assess the presence of subtle changes in zzso white matter on zzso MR images in patients with chronic zzso zzso using zzso transfer zzso zzso 

In 12 patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso white matter, of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the corpus zzso and of the zzso zzso were measured and compared with those of 16 healthy control zzso 

We found a significantly lower zzso in chronic zzso zzso than in the normal group for zzso PC, zzso and zzso but not for zzso 

Our study shows that zzso zzso give additional information that cannot be gained by conventional zzso zzso suggesting that chronic zzso zzso is associated with diffuse white matter damage that also affects zzso cerebral white zzso
