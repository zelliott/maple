CT and MR revealed a case of zzso zzso a zzso in which the soft zzso is not formed, and the hard zzso extends zzso to fuse with the anterior surface of the zzso resulting in complete isolation of the zzso and oral cavities and the absence of a zzso We believe this rare anomaly results from abnormal persistence of the zzso zzso plate and/or anomalous migration of the zzso zzso
