This paper uses the theory of zzso lower bounds zzso to obtain optimal acquisition schemes for in zzso quantitative zzso transfer zzso imaging, although the method is generally zzso to any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fits a zzso model to data collected at different sampling points or settings of zzso and offset frequency in the zzso zzso zzso Here we use simple objective functions based on the zzso to zzso sampling strategies for multiple parameters zzso and use simulated zzso to minimize these objective functions with respect to the sampling zzso zzso compare optimal schemes derived for quantitative zzso in the human white matter zzso at zzso with previously published schemes using both synthetic and zzso zzso zzso show large reductions in error of the fitted parameters with the new schemes, which greatly increases the clinical potential of in zzso quantitative zzso Since the zzso zzso requires specific settings of the zzso zzso we also show that the optimum schemes are robust to these settings within the range of zzso parameters observed in the zzso
