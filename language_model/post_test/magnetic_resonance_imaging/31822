This study described the imaging features of a distinctive pattern of zzso benign zzso zzso collapse zzso that can mimic zzso Among 240 patients referred with painful VC over a 10-year period, we zzso selected 15 cases of benign VC which simulated zzso due to cortical bone destruction on zzso The diagnosis of benign origin was documented by zzso biopsy and zzso of zzso zzso CT and MR images of the spine were zzso zzso suggestive of zzso included destruction involving the zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso body zzso and zzso zzso at CT, zzso zzso masses on CT zzso and MR images zzso and diffuse low zzso zzso of the zzso body zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso Features suggestive of a benign origin included an zzso vacuum phenomenon on zzso and CT zzso fracture lines within the zzso body zzso or zzso zzso at CT and presence an zzso area of high zzso on zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso VC can simulate zzso on zzso The features, above mentioned on CT and MR suggestive of a benign zzso are useful in interpreting biopsy results of such zzso and avoiding unnecessary repeat zzso
