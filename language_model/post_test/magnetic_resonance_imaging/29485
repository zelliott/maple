The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso could provide more useful clinical information than zzso zzso zzso alone in the evaluation of a cohort of patients with zzso zzso zzso and could assist in decisions concerning zzso 

Ten patients (4 zzso median age 43, range zzso with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso diagnosed on zzso underwent zzso MR zzso zzso visible with each technique were recorded and 12 parameters of zzso zzso and zzso measured and zzso 

There was zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso in three zzso In another two patients, MR zzso demonstrated zzso descent zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were similar between zzso only zzso size and lateral dimensions of the zzso were significantly different, being smaller on MR zzso than zzso Two patients were shown on MR zzso to have significant zzso descent and two female patients had significant zzso zzso 

zzso remains the first line investigation for the diagnosis of zzso zzso but may not distinguish zzso from zzso zzso MR zzso further zzso zzso by giving information on movements of the whole pelvic floor, zzso of the patients studied having associated abnormal anterior and/or middle pelvic organ zzso If surgery is planned for patients with zzso zzso MR zzso provides useful information regarding the presence and degree of anterior pelvic compartment descent that may need to be addressed if a good functional outcome is to be zzso
