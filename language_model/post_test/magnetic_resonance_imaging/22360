Visual working memory zzso allows us to hold visual information briefly in our minds after its zzso It is important for bridging the present to the immediate zzso Previous zzso studies on zzso have shown that several zzso zzso and zzso brain regions zzso this zzso Those studies, however, have often focused on zzso for a single property, such as zzso Yet, in behavior, the capacity of zzso is sensitive to the complexity of zzso visual zzso How do different brain areas represent zzso for visual features of different complexity and for combination of zzso To address this question, we used functional zzso to study the response profile of several brain regions in three zzso zzso In all tasks, subjects saw 1 to 7 colored polygons and had to remember their color (a simple zzso shape (a complex zzso or both color and zzso zzso performance showed that zzso reached capacity limit at about 3 colors, 2 shapes, and 2 compound zzso In the zzso data, we found different functional profiles for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to both zzso and zzso load zzso The prefrontal regions were sensitive to zzso load manipulation but relatively insensitive to zzso zzso The zzso regions were sensitive to zzso differences, but not to zzso load zzso We propose that the response properties of these regions can jointly account for several findings in human zzso zzso
