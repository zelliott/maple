To study the anatomy of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

A human zzso tissue block containing the zzso zzso was examined on a clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso of the tissue block were created in a zzso zzso The zzso were photographed and collected on adhesive zzso The zzso sections were stained for zzso in order to detail the zzso structures within the zzso zzso resonance images were compared with surface photos of the tissue block and zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images demonstrated the common zzso structures in the zzso Smaller structures, best viewed at the level of the operation zzso which have previously been obscured on magnetic resonance imaging, could be zzso Some of the zzso zzso zzso branches and the zzso nerve were clearly zzso 

In our experience with one human zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging at 7 zzso seems effective in depicting zzso zzso anatomy and provides previously unseen details through its demonstration of the zzso nerve and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The true viability of depicting the zzso zzso with zzso MR will depend on confirmation of our results in larger zzso
