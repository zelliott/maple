To zzso the ability of zzso to detect ventilation defects in lung transplant recipients, zzso was compared to CT for zzso 

We examined 14 lung recipients using zzso on a zzso T MR zzso CT served as a reference zzso Up to four representative ventilation defects were defined for each lung on zzso and compared to corresponding areas on zzso 

Altogether, 59 representative ventilation defects were defined on zzso zzso CT zzso were found for 29 ventilation zzso less plausible CT zzso were found for eight zzso In 22 defects zzso no corresponding CT changes were zzso CT demonstrated zzso for ventilation defects seen on zzso in only zzso of the zzso 

zzso yields a clear increase in the number of detected ventilation defects compared to zzso This may have an important impact on the early detection of zzso zzso in lung transplant zzso
