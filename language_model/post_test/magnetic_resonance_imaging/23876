An zzso protocol was designed to permit auditory zzso studies minimally affected by the zzso noise zzso a long time zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso between each cerebral volume acquisition was combined with zzso data zzso and zzso zzso were reconstructed with a zzso zzso The cerebral zzso time course to a target auditory stimulus was measured in five individual subjects using this zzso Clear zzso zzso responses were observed zzso in all individuals in primary auditory zzso zzso as well as in zzso extending secondary cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso attained their zzso zzso 3 s after stimulus onset in A1 (4 s for more anterior and lateral regions of auditory zzso and signal had returned to zzso level 6 s after stimulus zzso The zzso zzso method appeared effective in minimizing effects of the interaction between scanning noise and experimental auditory zzso it adds useful zzso information to the spatial resolution afforded by zzso in studies of human auditory function, while allowing presentation of auditory stimuli on a silent zzso
