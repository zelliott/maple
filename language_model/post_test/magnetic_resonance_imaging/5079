zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso is a rare manifestation of systemic cancer and data about the optimal management of these zzso are zzso To clarify the role of surgery, we investigated survival and neurological outcomes after surgical zzso of zzso 

Between 2003 and 2010, we surgically treated 10 zzso in 9 zzso For each patient, we zzso collected the following zzso demographic zzso history of prior cancer, site of primary cancer, extent of cancer on zzso degree of zzso zzso and zzso spinal zzso impairment (American Spinal zzso Association zzso zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the relationship between these zzso overall survival, and preservation of zzso 

Eight zzso were treated with gross total zzso and two were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso survival was zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso standard zzso with one patient still alive at last zzso Patients with a diagnosis of melanoma had higher mean survival than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso months, P zzso zzso Degree of zzso number of organ systems affected, ambulatory status, and ASIA grade zzso zzso or zzso were not significantly associated with zzso Of the nine patients, seven zzso demonstrated no change in ASIA grade zzso one zzso improved, and one patient zzso zzso All patients who were ambulatory preoperatively remained ambulatory zzso and at last zzso 

Although zzso is associated with poor zzso survival appears to be greater in patients with zzso zzso zzso does not appear to significantly zzso survival but may be indicated to preserve ambulatory status in symptomatic zzso
