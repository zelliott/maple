A new magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of disc zzso was correlated with zzso It was also studied for zzso and zzso zzso in interpreting disc zzso and for the capability in predicting symptomatic zzso 

To correlate the results of zzso with a new zzso zzso for disc zzso and the presence of the zzso zzso changes and the high intensity zone zzso 

zzso and zzso have been compared in numerous studies as methods for detecting disc zzso The results were conflicting and the role of zzso in assessing zzso pain remains zzso 

One hundred zzso discs in 55 patients were studied with pain provocation zzso and zzso A new zzso zzso was correlated to zzso and assessed together with the presence of end plate changes and zzso by the sensitivity and specificity in predicting a painful zzso 

zzso zzso had a good zzso and zzso agreement and a significant correlation with zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso in predicting painful disc was zzso and zzso The sensitivities and specificity of zzso was zzso and zzso and for end plate changes was zzso and zzso zzso 

Although zzso is an excellent investigation for assessing disc zzso it should be interpreted along with zzso findings before planning fusion zzso The proposed zzso zzso is a useful aid in predicting painful degenerative zzso The utility of zzso and end plate changes is limited due to low zzso
