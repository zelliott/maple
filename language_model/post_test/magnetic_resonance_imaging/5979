zzso young and middle-aged men were not different with respect to zzso zzso parameters and zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratio zzso of high energy zzso zzso and the zzso zzso filling zzso filling rate ratio zzso zzso were lower in sedentary middle-aged than physically active zzso zzso of zzso zzso function and the zzso ratio were not different in the middle-aged compared with the young trained zzso the zzso peak flow ratio was higher in the middle-aged trained men than in the middle-aged sedentary zzso Within the entire population, the zzso ratio and the zzso peak flow ratio were associated with insulin zzso 

Trained middle-aged subjects showed a better pattern of zzso energy metabolism and of zzso function than their sedentary zzso At this age the zzso cardiac benefits were zzso when physical exercise was performed regularly and for a long period of zzso
