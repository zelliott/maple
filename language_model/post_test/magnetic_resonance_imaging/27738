To assess zzso stability of four functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso resting brain activity zzso the zzso functional connectivity zzso independent component analysis zzso network-based zzso zzso regional zzso zzso and the zzso of low frequency fluctuation zzso 

zzso were used to assess the sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso to noise zzso Repeat resting blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso were acquired from 32 healthy zzso The zzso correlation zzso zzso was used to assess the stability of the four zzso 

Random noise yielded small random zzso small but consistent zzso and zzso A neighborhood size greater than 20 zzso should be used for calculating zzso in order to reduce the noise zzso Both the anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in more zzso extended regions than zzso zzso The two regional spontaneous brain activity zzso measures, zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso in almost the whole gray zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso are robust to random noise zzso The neighborhood size for calculating zzso should be larger than 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso and cluster size zzso 11 should be used to assess the zzso maps for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be reliably measured using zzso zzso zzso and zzso after 2 zzso
