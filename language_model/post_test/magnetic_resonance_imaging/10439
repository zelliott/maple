In zzso eye movements zzso with gain close to one, zzso should be controlled mainly by prediction of target motion because retinal slip is nearly zzso We investigated the neural mechanisms of zzso prediction by the three zzso zzso zzso zzso pursuit zzso subjects pursued a zzso moving target which blinked zzso zzso or did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pursuit zzso subjects covertly pursued the same target with eyes gazed at fixation zzso zzso zzso target zzso subjects brought attention on a stationary target with eyes gazed at fixation zzso In the overt pursuit task, the zzso gain and the delay in the zzso condition were not very different from the continuous condition, indicating good prediction of the blinking target zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso increased in the zzso zzso The zzso activity decreased for this zzso In the covert pursuit task, only the zzso zzso activity remained in the zzso zzso In the zzso target task, the zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso the zzso activity is responsible for target prediction rather than motor commands for eye movements or just target blinking such as visual zzso
