The persistent zzso state zzso is a devastating medical condition characterized by preserved zzso contrasting with absent voluntary interaction with the zzso However, very little is known about the actual degree of perception in these patients and the extent of progressive brain injury induced by very prolonged zzso 

The authors have conducted a zzso zzso study using a zzso zzso protocol in four patients in long-lasting zzso (over 3 years at zzso characterized by various brain zzso 

Although one subject showed initially preserved local brain metabolism and brain activity related to primary perception suggesting the presence of potential residual brain plasticity even in this critical stage, none of the four patients recovered to consciousness during the 2 years of the zzso Moreover, significant deterioration of parameters related to brain zzso metabolism and functional zzso of primary zzso was observed in all patients during the zzso 

zzso of brain injury, consequences of long term minimal brain activity and potential factors that prevent recovery to consciousness are zzso
