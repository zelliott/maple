To define the range of normal contrast medium enhancement, the zzso in contrast medium enhancement patterns in healthy zzso breast zzso and the implications for management strategies in cases with incidental contrast zzso zzso on breast magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Twenty healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso were examined on a zzso system zzso two-dimensional zzso protocol with zzso zzso during each week of a zzso cycle zzso 1) or over 4 months zzso zzso The authors evaluated changes in the number of enhancing zzso and the respective enhancement patterns within a cycle and between zzso 

Both diffuse and zzso enhancement of breast zzso occurred during all zzso of the zzso cycle, especially in weeks 1 and zzso Enhancement was lowest in week zzso A total of 60 enhancing zzso zzso of which resolved completely during zzso were found in 16 of 20 zzso Twenty-six zzso demonstrated enhancement zzso beyond the zzso threshold zzso increase in the 1st zzso 

zzso zzso are normal in healthy zzso zzso even when formal zzso criteria of enhancement zzso are zzso This has to be kept in mind to avoid zzso results, especially in younger zzso
