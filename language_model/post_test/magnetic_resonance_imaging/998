zzso development and use of zzso will improve the productivity of zzso drug zzso zzso of the importance of zzso for speeding drug development is reflected in the precise definitions and concepts proposed by an zzso Working Group to zzso zzso and promote a more coherent and systematic approach to the development and use of zzso Potential clinical zzso of drug efficacy are often identified through zzso studies or basic zzso Identification of potential zzso for use in zzso is moving rapidly forward through continuing advances in clinical imaging technologies, especially molecular and functional zzso Other rapid advances are a product of the growing availability of new scientific zzso for established technologies and of zzso zzso and zzso technologies that can generate hundreds of potential zzso for further zzso In certain cases, conventional clinical diagnostic techniques or zzso can be adapted for use in zzso models to evaluate their ability to serve as zzso for predicting clinical responses to new drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a potential zzso is often the longest stage of zzso development, and standards for evaluation or validation depend on the intended use and stage of clinical zzso zzso verified for use in zzso studies can be used to help select appropriate animal models and lead zzso zzso verified for use in clinical trials can confirm a drug's pharmacological or biological mechanism of action, guide protocol design, aid patient and dose selection, and help to minimize safety zzso Oncology drug development can be zzso by using a tiered set of clinical zzso that predict compound efficacy and safety with increasing confidence at each rise in tier thereby aiding corporate decision-making about advancing zzso In zzso a special class of extensively evaluated zzso of efficacy zzso zzso that generally correlate with desired clinical outcomes can be used as a basis for corporate decisions as well as for gaining accelerated provisional regulatory approval of a zzso
