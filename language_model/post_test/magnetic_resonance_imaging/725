The relationship between performance on information processing efficiency measures and zzso zzso volume including global and regional zzso and zzso zzso volumes was investigated in 20 patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso zzso speed, as measured by the zzso Memory zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso volume and slowed reaction time in seven out of eight patients (six out of seven with zzso with any zzso volume in the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso capacity as measured by the zzso Keeping Track Test was not significantly correlated with the zzso zzso zzso performance did not correlate with Expanded zzso zzso zzso score, depression or fatigue, and patients performed within normal limits on tests of zzso zzso The significant relationship between zzso zzso zzso volume and memory scanning speed in this study suggests that pathological damage in the zzso zzso may contribute to slowed cognitive processing and may be an important direction for future studies of cognitive function in multiple zzso Lack of correlation of cognitive measures with the other zzso measures may be due to low zzso volume relative to other studies, sample zzso and limited pathological specificity of the zzso zzso
