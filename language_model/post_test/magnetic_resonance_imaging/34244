The purpose of this work was to zzso and increase the accuracy of tissue zzso of the brain magnetic resonance zzso images based on zzso zzso feature zzso We used three sets of MR images as input to the in-house developed zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso density zzso and zzso fast spin echo and, zzso spin zzso First, to eliminate the random noise, zzso zzso diffusion type filtering was applied to all the zzso Second, to reduce the zzso of the images, we devised and applied a correction zzso based on uniform zzso Following these steps, the qualified observer zzso zzso training points) the tissue of zzso To reduce the operator dependent zzso cluster zzso was also zzso this zzso zzso identifies the densest clusters pertaining to the zzso Finally, the images were segmented using zzso zzso zzso zzso and a stack of color-coded segmented images were created along with the connectivity zzso to generate the entire surface of the zzso The application of zzso zzso steps substantially improved the zzso tissue zzso zzso
