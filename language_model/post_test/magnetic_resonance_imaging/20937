zzso zzso and zzso zzso injury is common after acute zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most obvious consequence of zzso injury affecting zzso of survivors and is predictable from zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso However there is no equivalent zzso data for other specific zzso Feeding and communication zzso are also common in children following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

To describe, in infants with zzso and zzso injury, the prevalence of feeding and communication zzso and to evaluate the accuracy of early zzso for predicting these zzso 

175 term infants with zzso and zzso injury were zzso Brain zzso were classified by site and severity from the zzso zzso Motor, feeding and communication zzso were documented at 2 zzso 

Feeding and communication zzso occurred in zzso and zzso of 126 survivors respectively and related strongly to the severity of motor zzso zzso children had a zzso or long-term zzso zzso zzso severity in all brain regions was significantly associated with feeding and communication impairment on zzso zzso On zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently associated with feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso was related to the severity of communication zzso 

Feeding and communication impairment are very common in children with zzso and zzso injury of zzso origin and can be well predicted from early zzso zzso
