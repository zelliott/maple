zzso resonance zzso imaging and zzso reconstruction was used to evaluate the zzso and relative position of the spinal zzso in adolescent idiopathic zzso zzso 

To determine the zzso and zzso zzso of spinal zzso in zzso subjects versus normal controls and their correlation with relative position of zzso zzso and zzso cortical evoked zzso zzso 

Our previous studies revealed significantly reduced spinal zzso to zzso column length ratios in zzso patients with severe zzso zzso suggesting the presence of zzso growth between the neural and skeletal zzso A possible neural origin of zzso of zzso is zzso 

MR zzso reconstruction was performed in 97 adolescent girls (35 moderate, 26 severe zzso with zzso zzso curve, and 36 zzso zzso zzso of the ratio of zzso (AP) and zzso zzso diameter of the cord, the zzso and convex lateral zzso space zzso were obtained at the zzso level in zzso zzso zzso parameters were obtained in normal controls at matched zzso zzso zzso were made with zzso to zzso column length ratio, zzso zzso position and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso ratio and zzso ratio were increased in zzso subjects in the presence of reduced spinal zzso to zzso length ratio when compared with normal controls zzso zzso zzso The above ratios were exaggerated in zzso subjects with abnormal zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratio and zzso ratio were zzso correlated with the zzso to zzso column length ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso 

Our study suggests presence of zzso and increased tension along the zzso axis of spinal zzso with associated zzso changes of zzso shape and relative position of the zzso
