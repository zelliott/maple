zzso and zzso artifacts are problematic in clinical MR zzso In this paper we discuss the utility of a zzso real reconstruction to reduce flow zzso This technique is particularly useful when zzso pulse sequences may not be possible, such as when a very short echo delay or small zzso is zzso We will demonstrate that the zzso real reconstruction provides superior results to the magnitude reconstruction either used alone or in conjunction with existing zzso zzso
