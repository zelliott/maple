This study investigated changes in median sensory nerve zzso zzso zzso over several weeks of exposure to a zzso moderately zzso repetitive pinching task performed for food rewards by a small sample of young adult female monkeys zzso zzso zzso derived from peak zzso decreased significantly in the working hands of three of the four zzso The overall decline in zzso was zzso from zzso There was no decrease in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Several weeks after being removed from the task, zzso returned to within zzso of zzso zzso showed enlargement of the affected nerves near the zzso end of the zzso tunnel, at the time of zzso zzso zzso This new animal model demonstrates a temporally zzso relationship between exposure to a moderately zzso repetitive manual task and development of median zzso at the zzso and recovery of zzso following termination of task zzso This study contributes to the pattern of evidence of a zzso relationship between manual work, median zzso and zzso tunnel syndrome in zzso In the future, this new animal model could be used to characterize zzso relationships between risk factors and zzso tunnel zzso
