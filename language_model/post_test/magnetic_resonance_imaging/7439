Most previous zzso studies of age-related brain structural changes in older individuals have been zzso and/or restricted to clinical zzso The present study of 345 zzso zzso individuals aged zzso aimed to examine age-related brain zzso changes over two zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at baseline and at zzso follow-up and analyzed using the zzso Software Library and zzso to investigate cortical thickness and shape and zzso changes of zzso zzso The results showed significant zzso across much of the cerebral zzso with bilateral zzso zzso regions shrinking the zzso zzso was also found in a number of zzso structures, including the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso In some regions, such as left and right zzso zzso right zzso and right zzso area, the rate of zzso increased with zzso Our analysis also showed that zzso middle frontal regions were thicker zzso in older participants, which may indicate its ability to compensate for zzso zzso lobe zzso Compared to men, women had thicker cortical regions but greater rates of cortical zzso Women also had smaller zzso zzso A longer period of education was associated with greater thickness in a number of cortical zzso Our results suggest a pattern of brain zzso with zzso people that resembles a less extreme form of the changes associated with Alzheimer's disease zzso
