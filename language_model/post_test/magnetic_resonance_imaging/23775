To investigate the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the detection of early zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive zzso positive patients with inflammatory low back pain and zzso or zzso grade 2 unilateral zzso on conventional zzso zzso New York zzso were zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso zzso plain zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were obtained at study entry and zzso of the zzso zzso after 3 zzso Each zzso and MR image set was interpreted zzso zzso zzso were scored according to the modified New York zzso for zzso zzso zzso scans were also scored for the presence of zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso or zzso grade 2 zzso (by modified New York criteria for zzso zzso shown on zzso and the subsequent development of zzso or zzso grade 2 zzso on zzso after 3 years was zzso 

At study entry zzso or zzso grade 2 zzso was found on zzso in 36 of 50 zzso zzso zzso was found in 20 of 50 zzso zzso After 3 years zzso or zzso grade 2 zzso was found on zzso in 21 of 44 zzso zzso The positive zzso value of zzso or zzso grade 2 zzso on zzso for the development of zzso or zzso grade 2 zzso on zzso after 3 years was zzso sensitivity was zzso and specificity zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso can be used to identify zzso earlier than zzso
