To determine if defects in zzso respiratory chain zzso complexes zzso contribute to the zzso of childhood zzso 

We reviewed the clinical and laboratory features of 48 zzso patients zzso male, 25 zzso with zzso defects that were confirmed by zzso zzso using muscle zzso 

zzso Thirty-five cases zzso were zzso I zzso one case zzso was zzso II zzso 11 cases zzso were zzso IV zzso and one case zzso had combined zzso I and IV zzso zzso In our clinical diagnosis, there were 10 cases zzso with Leigh disease and one case each with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso episodes zzso or zzso disease zzso Most of the remaining cases zzso had zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso there were two cases zzso of zzso syndrome, 10 cases zzso of West syndrome, 12 cases zzso of zzso syndrome, two cases zzso of zzso syndrome, 14 cases zzso of generalized zzso and eight cases zzso of partial zzso zzso The mean age of seizure onset was zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 month - zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso showed diffuse cortical zzso in 34 cases zzso zzso zzso signal changes in 18 cases zzso and zzso signal changes in 12 cases zzso zzso A zzso diet produced clinical improvements, including seizure reduction and global functional improvement in zzso of 24 zzso 

zzso defects are one of the important causes of probably symptomatic childhood zzso A zzso diet should be carefully considered for treatment of intractable zzso related to zzso zzso
