To bring to the fore the most important zzso factors in Ewing's zzso zzso with current zzso we studied the classical zzso factors, dose intensity zzso of actual received drugs, age and zzso response to induction therapy and their correlation in 39 patients with localized zzso treated from zzso to zzso to identify eventual zzso of zzso survival zzso zzso criteria were age 35 zzso or less, definitive local treatment by our team and chemotherapy including at least 4 drugs: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was the absence of zzso zzso related to the status of patients were tested using the Chi square test or zzso exact zzso The non zzso zzso test was used for quantitative zzso When necessary zzso analysis was done using the Mantel Cox zzso With a median follow-up of 7 zzso overall survival zzso and zzso were both zzso at 7 zzso According to zzso analysis, the significant zzso of survival were the zzso of VCR and zzso the zzso response to zzso chemotherapy zzso the patient's age zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso The risk of zzso was almost tenfold higher in patients with low received zzso of VCR zzso zzso versus zzso and of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso The zzso value of primary tumor characteristics zzso volume or zzso was erased by the comprehensive zzso Following zzso analysis, the actual received zzso of VCR zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response to zzso CT zzso zzso zzso were retained as the only significant independent zzso of zzso Taking into account the actual received zzso of VCR and zzso the zzso value of age zzso In conclusion, this study points out the main role of the drug zzso in zzso zzso VCR and zzso and of zzso response to zzso zzso
