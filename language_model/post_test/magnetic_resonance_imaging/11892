In order to make an attempt at grouping the various aspects of brain functional imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso within a coherent frame, we implemented a model consisting of a system of differential zzso that includes: zzso sodium membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso energy metabolism zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso barrier exchanges and zzso brain zzso all the processes which are involved in the zzso of brain zzso We assumed that the correlation between brain zzso and metabolism could be due to either changes in the zzso of zzso and zzso following zzso of zzso zzso that result from the changes in zzso zzso or the involvement, in different zzso of zzso of a second zzso such as zzso In this article, we show how this type of model enables interpretation of MRS and zzso published data that were obtained during prolonged zzso
