Studies in zzso monkeys indicate that the zzso zzso in the zzso lobe zzso in object zzso This function may be analogous to aspects of human semantic memory zzso of objects, concepts, faces and zzso To date, the status of zzso zzso has not specifically been investigated in patients with semantic deficits as seen in semantic zzso the zzso lobe zzso of zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in subjects with semantic zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso in its early stages by selective episodic memory zzso and in healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were measured by outlining areas on successive scan slices according to recognized zzso The zzso and zzso regions were further subdivided into anterior and zzso zzso In keeping with the hypothesized contribution of the zzso zzso to semantic memory function, we found greater involvement of this region, together with the zzso and anterior zzso zzso in semantic zzso than in either Alzheimer's disease patients or control zzso Performance on a range of semantic tests also correlated with zzso zzso zzso reduction in zzso volume compared with controls was seen in Alzheimer's zzso In conclusion, zzso of the human zzso cortex, and of directly connected areas, was associated with semantic memory impairment but not episodic memory zzso as predicted from the zzso zzso
