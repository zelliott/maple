The ability to study muscle elasticity in zzso would be of great clinical zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso has the potential to zzso zzso the distribution of the zzso zzso in muscle zzso zzso information may be derived by zzso zzso from the wave patterns of zzso zzso zzso In a new approach, zzso wave patterns were reconstructed using zzso coupled harmonic zzso calculations zzso To analyze in zzso zzso zzso of the biceps zzso of healthy volunteers, different zzso zzso structures for the zzso between the muscle elements have to be zzso zzso wave patterns as observed when zzso was applied on the zzso were reproduced by a model, where in a central band of stiff zzso wave propagation was about twice as fast as that in surrounding zzso zzso waves were observed for zzso near the muscle zzso They could be reconstructed by assuming a simultaneous wave zzso of all muscle zzso where fibers along the main muscle axis were coupled more strongly than those perpendicular to the zzso The results show that zzso calculations provide a fast and reliable method for incorporating anatomical information of the investigated tissue in the reconstruction of complex wave zzso
