zzso zzso zzso infection can lead to severe neurological zzso but a defined brain magnetic resonance zzso pattern and MR zzso of clinical outcome are still zzso 

Clinical and MR findings of 14 children with symptomatic zzso zzso infection were zzso zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso and zzso were found in eight, six and seven patients, respectively (all zzso in zzso 12 children developed zzso hearing loss zzso At first zzso zzso age 21 months, range zzso zzso white matter zzso involvement was not zzso in two children due to incomplete zzso zzso abnormalities were common zzso zzso deep zzso was predominantly involved in zzso the largest zzso zzso was in the zzso lobe in zzso zzso zzso lobe abnormalities were found in zzso Six children underwent zzso examination after 2 years of life; in this zzso zzso abnormalities were extensive and zzso zzso bilateral and zzso zzso or absent zzso Four children showed a progression of zzso zzso zzso migration disorders zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated with severe neurological zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso while the presence of zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not predict the zzso 

The spectrum of brain MR abnormalities in symptomatic zzso zzso infection is extremely zzso zzso involvement is zzso difficult to evaluate at a very young age and unrelated to clinical outcome, while cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso seem to be strong zzso of poor outcome except for zzso
