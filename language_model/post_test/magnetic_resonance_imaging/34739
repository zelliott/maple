MR tagging is a recent imaging development that, in cardiac applications, makes possible the tracking of points in the zzso during the cardiac zzso Researchers have developed zzso computer-based methods for analyzing zzso images, but the images are complex and present a challenge to automated tracking zzso zzso can provide an inexhaustible supply of images for testing and validation of tag tracking software and preview the effect of zzso changes in zzso zzso is an interactive computer program that simulates two-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso model used in the simulation and zzso for simulating image noise and object deformation are zzso Examples of the use of simulated images in zzso zzso selection, a comparison of tag contrast in zzso zzso and zzso and simulated images as test sets for zzso software are zzso
