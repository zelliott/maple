To investigate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso zzso 

From 1993 to 1999, zzso patients underwent zzso zzso with state-of-the-art equipment to evaluate zzso zzso Twenty-six patients, two with bilateral and distinct diseases (age range zzso years, mean zzso had an zzso sonogram and were sent for zzso The zzso results were compared with previous US reports and with the final zzso 

zzso yielded additional and correct information zzso with zzso zzso with the final diagnosis in 23 cases zzso In regard to zzso suspected of zzso at US (17 zzso zzso had a great zzso with the final diagnosis and was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results of our study indicate that zzso could help zzso zzso dilemmas found at zzso although the small percentage of zzso zzso confirms this technique as the first choice when imaging is required in zzso zzso
