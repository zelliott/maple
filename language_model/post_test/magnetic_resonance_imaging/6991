The study aimed to validate magnetic resonance zzso zzso studies of forensic tissue specimens zzso samples with electric injury zzso against the results from routine zzso 

zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging are fast becoming important tools in clinical and forensic zzso This study is the first forensic application of zzso to the analysis of electric injury patterns in human zzso zzso high-resolution zzso images of fixed skin specimens provided a complete zzso view of the damaged zzso at the site of an electric injury as well as in neighboring zzso consistent with zzso zzso The image intensity of the zzso layer in zzso zzso images was reduced in the central zone due to zzso or zzso necrosis and increased in the intermediate zone because of zzso zzso A zzso blood vessel with an zzso zzso supports the hypothesis that current traveled through the vascular system before arcing to zzso 

zzso imaging offers a zzso alternative to conventional zzso in forensic wound analysis and can be used to perform zzso virtual zzso
