The current paradigm for early zzso arthritis suggests that persistent zzso leads to zzso joint damage, which results in functional zzso zzso between different forms of early arthritis outcome is relevant for therapeutic decision-making and prevents the occurrence of zzso in diagnostic zzso Implementation of a zzso model into clinical practice is highly zzso 

To identify the zzso factors at entry for the persistence of early inflammatory arthritis and to develop a scoring system to assess the outcome in patients presenting with early inflammatory zzso 

A cohort of 173 patients with early inflammatory arthritis, were assessed in a special early arthritis zzso Case definition of zzso was assessed clinically by the number of tender joint and swollen joint counts as well as symmetry of the affected zzso and data were zzso zzso zzso score, serum zzso factor and zzso zzso were zzso Patients satisfying the American College of zzso zzso criteria for zzso and the European zzso Study Group criteria for zzso were zzso as well as those with a specific rheumatic zzso All the patients were reviewed every 3 months for 24 months zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso both hands, were performed at day of entry and 6 months after initial zzso All patients had zzso both hands and wrist zzso The arthritis outcome recorded at zzso follow up represented the gold standard for the zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to identify the independent factors zzso of persistent arthritis and accordingly a scoring system was invented that involved the zzso revealed from the zzso A zzso curve was set to display the performance of the scoring system and a cut off point was selected taking into consideration a higher sensitivity than zzso as this model will be mainly used as a screening zzso 

During the follow up period, 93 patients showed evidence of zzso arthritis while 80 showed persistent zzso zzso of morning zzso in minutes, percentage change in zzso score after 3 months duration and zzso zzso were the zzso of persistent zzso zzso curve analysis identified a cut off point of 121 above which the early arthritis patient would be more at risk of developing persistent zzso 

Application of a model zzso zzso to zzso patients presenting with early persistent inflammatory arthritis from those with zzso disease can be zzso The developed model was found to be valid on the studied zzso This model is important for standard clinical practice as the value of prediction of persistent arthritis has its great impact not only for identifying the patients but also on the therapeutic outcome as zzso
