zzso fat pad is a mass of zzso tissue occupying zzso zzso By means of a combined magnetic resonance imaging, zzso gross anatomical and zzso study, we show that it has three regions that are closely related to the sides of the zzso Thus, it has parts related to the Achilles and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a wedge of fat adjacent to the zzso The zzso wedge moves into the zzso during zzso as a consequence of both an upward displacement of the zzso relative to the wedge and a downward displacement of the wedge relative to the zzso During zzso the zzso wedge is zzso The movements are promoted by the tapering shape of the zzso wedge and by its deep zzso zzso zzso connections linking the fat to the Achilles zzso anchor and stabilize it zzso and thus contribute to the zzso of its zzso We conclude that the three regions of zzso fat pad have specialized zzso an zzso part which contributes to moving the zzso wedge during zzso an Achilles part which protects blood vessels entering this tendon, and a zzso wedge which we suggest zzso pressure changes in the zzso All three regions contribute to reducing the risk of zzso zzso and each may be implicated in heel pain zzso
