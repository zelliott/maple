Over the coming decades zzso zzso imaging by magnetic resonance imaging zzso will provide an adjunct or surrogate for the destructive zzso and zzso zzso used zzso A number of zzso methods demonstrate image contrast that, although influenced by the zzso zzso is not normally specific to a particular measure of the zzso zzso The most widely used of these is zzso imaging, which zzso reveals collagen zzso zzso (or collagen zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso concentration (each of these zzso metrics is an important zzso of the functional integrity of zzso The lack of specificity of this technique (and others discussed zzso confounds efforts to improve strategies for evaluating zzso However, three methods permit a very specific measure of the cartilage zzso zzso Each of these three methods, explored in detail in this article, is rooted in a zzso theory that relates the image signal intensity to a specific zzso zzso zzso imaging directly measures water content zzso a zzso that might increase approximately zzso with significant zzso zzso imaging, in which the angle dependence of zzso is measured, can provide a specific measure of collagen (or zzso zzso The difficulty in getting the angle dependence presently zzso its use zzso Delayed zzso zzso of cartilage provides a specific measure of the distribution of zzso This method measures the distribution of a charged contrast agent, which in turn reflects the distribution of charge associated with zzso This technique can be used in a clinical setting, and ongoing studies will explore its utility in monitoring therapeutic efficacy and disease zzso Although none of these techniques are presently in routine clinical use, emerging data provide promise that the future will see zzso zzso analysis of cartilage, an outcome almost unimaginable 20 years zzso
