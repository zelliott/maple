To precisely zzso the site of zzso block in elderly patients with cervical zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso shown by zzso 

A total of 44 patients aged 65 and older underwent serial zzso recording of spinal zzso evoked zzso zzso from either the zzso disc or the zzso zzso after zzso zzso The site of zzso block identified by abrupt reduction in size of the negative peak was designated as the 0 level with the other levels numbered in order of distance assigning a minus sign zzso 

A single site of focal zzso block was disclosed in 42 patients, 23 zzso at zzso 17 zzso at zzso and two zzso at zzso At these levels zzso the zzso of the negative component was reduced zzso to zzso and the area to zzso with a zzso increase zzso of the initial positive component to zzso in zzso and zzso in area as compared to zzso level which was taken as the baseline zzso 

A high zzso zzso of focal zzso block at zzso or zzso with normal zzso at zzso and zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso in elderly zzso zzso zzso studies documenting the site of zzso block will help exclude clinically silent zzso zzso directing the surgical intervention to the appropriate level of zzso
