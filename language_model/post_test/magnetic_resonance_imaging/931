Besides painful zzso patients suffering from zzso syndrome often present increasing loss of visual zzso The impairment of the zzso nerve leads to a delay of the zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso Using the method of magnetic resonance imaging zzso some patients present unspecific zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso However, both methods zzso and zzso are zzso to assess the effect of an impaired zzso nerve function on zzso processing in the visual zzso We report one patient suffering from zzso syndrome affecting the zzso zzso We used zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso to show how this impairment of the zzso nerve alters cortical processing of visual zzso The activity of the unaffected visual zzso was zzso reduced when compared to healthy volunteers but greater that obtained from patients suffering from bilateral zzso zzso Our results offer new opportunities to assess the efficiency of therapy in patients with increasing loss of visual perception due to the zzso zzso Further studies are necessary to zzso whether zzso also provides the possibility to assess the efficiency of drug therapy on zzso nerve zzso
