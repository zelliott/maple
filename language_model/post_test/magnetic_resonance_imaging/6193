zzso eye movements, requiring zzso of a zzso toward a briefly appearing peripheral target, are known to be impaired in zzso Previous zzso studies have indicated that patients with schizophrenia show diminished zzso in the frontal zzso and zzso zzso These studies used target fixation as a baseline zzso However, if the levels of brain activities at baseline are not compatible between patients and healthy subjects, zzso comparison on zzso zzso is consequently zzso One possibility is that patients with schizophrenia may present with greater zzso during fixation than healthy zzso In order to examine this possibility, here we investigated brain activities associated with zzso in the two groups without using target fixation at zzso 

zzso brain images were acquired during zzso and zzso in 18 healthy subjects and 18 schizophrenia patients using a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Eye movements were measured during zzso 

In the patient group, the elevated activities in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and thalamus, normally seen in zzso tasks relative to zzso tasks, were no longer zzso Moreover, in normal subjects, activities in the zzso and zzso were greater during the zzso task than during the zzso zzso In patients, no such difference was observed between the two tasks, suggesting that these brain regions are likely to be highly activated even by a simple task such as zzso In particular, the zzso and zzso in patients were not activated at a level commensurate with the difficulty of the tasks zzso 

From these results, it is suggested that schizophrenia zzso zzso in the zzso network associated with motor function zzso
