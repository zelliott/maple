Depending on authors, zzso invasion by a zzso zzso is found in zzso to zzso of zzso In the light of our own experience, we think that such an invasion is probably much less frequent than usually evoked on zzso and zzso In our study, it was confirmed in only one case over 125 zzso though zzso data suspected an zzso invasion 17 zzso An anatomical study on 20 zzso showed that zzso of normal zzso zzso present with a lateral expansion into one or both cavernous zzso zzso These natural zzso were already evoked by Harris and zzso in zzso They can resemble an zzso extension or invasion on zzso views, zzso when an zzso increases the volume of this expansion, and in the absence of any zzso of the zzso wall of the zzso The zzso wall of the zzso is, in fact, constituted by a zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso and its zzso it zzso more or less in the zzso depending on the importance of the zzso lateral zzso In case of a large zzso the zzso lateral zzso of the zzso disappears progressively during the zzso zzso Finally the zzso returns to its normal place back, at the end of the zzso This concept of zzso of the zzso zzso wall, as opposed to that of invasion and therefore of zzso of the zzso plane, explains the wide range of figures concerning the frequency of zzso invasion by zzso zzso in the zzso These figures are all the more variable as there is no absolute criteria of zzso invasion on zzso nor zzso zzso In the same way, no clinical criteria can be retained to assume the existence of such an zzso So, an zzso seems to be usually linked to a zzso of zzso zzso it recovers in a large majority of cases, after the zzso is zzso In conclusion we emphasize the necessity of interpreting with great care zzso imaging when it zzso a possible zzso invasion of a zzso zzso The indication of an eventual zzso should be retained with as much care as possible, since complete removal of an zzso and its lateral zzso is almost always feasible through a zzso zzso
