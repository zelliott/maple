zzso anxiety disorder zzso is a common chronic condition that is relatively zzso compared to other psychiatric zzso zzso studies have begun to zzso particular neural structures and zzso in its zzso however, no genetically zzso research has examined the potential sources of reported brain zzso 

We acquired zzso zzso and diffusion zzso magnetic resonance imaging data from a pilot study of 34 female subjects selected from zzso twin pairs based upon their affection status for zzso and examined brain regions previously implicated in fear and anxiety for their relationship with affection status and genetic zzso 

Lifetime zzso associated with increased zzso levels in the amygdala, smaller left zzso volume, and lower fractional zzso in the zzso zzso which connects zzso and frontal zzso In addition, zzso genetic risk predicted increases in zzso in the zzso and, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The association of lifetime zzso with smaller zzso volume was independent of major depression and might represent a common genetic risk marker for zzso zzso 

These preliminary data suggest that zzso and its genetic risk factors are likely correlated with zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso structures and their connections with the frontal zzso
