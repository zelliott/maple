How content is stored in the human brain during visual short-term memory zzso is still an open zzso Different theories zzso storage of remembered stimuli in zzso zzso or visual zzso zzso at a distinction between these theories, we investigated the zzso of zzso signals from various brain regions during a zzso task using zzso pattern zzso To participate in memory zzso candidate regions would need to have information about the different contents held in zzso We identified two brain regions where local patterns of zzso signals represented the remembered zzso Apart from the previously established storage in visual areas, we also discovered an area in the zzso zzso zzso where activity patterns allowed us to decode the specific stimuli held in zzso Our results demonstrate that storage in zzso extends beyond visual areas, but no frontal regions were zzso Thus, while frontal and zzso areas typically zzso during zzso maintenance of content in the zzso network might be limited to zzso zzso
