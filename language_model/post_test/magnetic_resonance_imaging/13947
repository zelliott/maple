To examine the clinical, zzso and quantitative zzso differences between frontal lobe zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso in zzso 

The population included children who underwent zzso monitoring between 1995 and 2000 who were classified as either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 17) according to the criteria of the International League Against zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso data (including frontal cortical zzso were compared between the two syndromes and a control group zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso were significantly zzso more zzso and predominantly from sleep, and had differing motor zzso The rates of bilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso abnormalities were significantly higher in zzso A zzso zzso was significantly more common in zzso Mean frontal cortical volume in zzso was significantly lower than zzso and zzso zzso freedom after surgery was lower in zzso 

The clinical syndrome of zzso is clearly distinct from zzso The zzso of this disorder is unknown in the majority of cases despite extensive zzso Because of a lack of a clearly defined zzso and frequent zzso zzso changes, few of these children are considered optimal surgical zzso The demonstration of bilateral frontal cortical volume loss and bilateral zzso abnormalities suggests that zzso is a bilateral disease in a high proportion of zzso The outcome in those patients who were deemed surgical candidates was significantly worse than the zzso zzso
