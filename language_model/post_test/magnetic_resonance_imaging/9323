To analyze the distribution of different shapes of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue of patients with zzso arthritis zzso and to compare relative numbers of zzso shapes between patients with zzso and healthy control zzso 

This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board; patients and control subjects gave written informed zzso Dynamic contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the knee joint in five patients with early zzso and in five control subjects was zzso zzso maps showing seven zzso shape types were zzso zzso information of the zzso zzso shape distribution pattern and relative number of zzso shapes were calculated on a three-dimensional region of zzso Relative zzso shape numbers were compared by using a zzso zzso U zzso 

zzso enhancement in patients with zzso consisted of type 2 zzso shapes zzso zzso with zzso zones of types 3 zzso enhancement followed by plateau zzso 4 zzso enhancement followed by early zzso zzso and 5 zzso enhancement followed by slow enhancement zzso zzso shapes, compared with almost only type 2 zzso shapes in control zzso The zzso zones were seen in the lateral and zzso knee compartments and around the cruciate zzso A significantly higher relative number of type 4 zzso shapes was observed in the patient group compared with the control group zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso shape analysis may help distinguish patients with zzso from control subjects on the basis of the relative number of type 4 zzso zzso This study provides the rationale for future research to evaluate the utility of this approach in clinical zzso
