zzso in the human primary motor cortex, the zzso zzso and the supplementary motor area during a delayed cued finger movement task was measured by zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso during movement preparation can be resolved from activity during movement execution in a single zzso All three areas were active during both movement preparation and movement zzso zzso in the primary motor zzso was considerably weaker during movement preparation than during movement execution; in the zzso zzso and the supplementary motor area, activity was of similar intensity during both zzso These observations are consistent with results from single zzso recording studies in zzso
