Despite improvements, spatial resolution and image quality with routine surface coils are too limited when detailed information about the gastrointestinal layers is zzso The objective of our feasibility study was to evaluate the potential of a dedicated zzso zzso to depict different layers of the zzso wall in an in zzso small animal zzso 

A zzso zzso (40 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso was built using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was tuned to a frequency of zzso zzso and matched at 50 zzso for this zzso The zzso was housed in a zzso tube with an outer diameter of 18 F (6 zzso Ten segments of rat zzso surgically excised 5 hours earlier, were completely immersed in an zzso zzso The zzso was introduced through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed on a zzso T MR Symphony system zzso zzso zzso using imaging protocol combining high-resolution zzso zzso fast imaging employing zzso acquisition zzso zzso spin echo zzso and zzso zzso Shot zzso zzso After a 24-hour period of fixation in zzso zzso zzso specimens were excised along the zzso axis for zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso provided high zzso allowing for the zzso of different layers of rat zzso zzso All the performed sequences made it possible to identify at least two different zzso On zzso zzso zzso the zzso was of high signal intensity, whereas the muscle layers had an intermediate to low signal zzso The signal intensity of different wall layers was similar in different zzso zzso analysis identified three main zzso 

These results are well correlated with zzso findings and suggest that zzso MR imaging may have potential for accurate staging of zzso tumor or inflammatory zzso
