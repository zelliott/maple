A patient with zzso zzso underwent serial computerized analysis of zzso zzso defined from magnetic resonance zzso zzso scans obtained over almost a four year zzso The clinical course included tumor zzso with subsequent radiation therapy, a long zzso zzso emergence of a new zzso focus, zzso of that focus, a stroke, and treatment with chemotherapy and zzso zzso Image analysis methods included zzso of vessels from each zzso and statistical comparison of vessel zzso over 4 regions of interest (the initial tumor site, the second tumor site, a distant control region, and the entire zzso to the same 4 regions of interest in 50 healthy volunteers zzso females and 24 zzso mean age 39 zzso zzso suggested that following completion of focal radiation therapy zzso vessel shape zzso if elevated at the time of zzso zzso may progressively zzso for months in focal regions, that progressively severe vessel shape abnormalities can zzso the emergence of a zzso enhancing zzso by months, that zzso zzso can produce a dramatic but highly transient drop in abnormal vessel zzso both zzso and globally, and that treatment with zzso agents does not necessarily zzso vessel zzso zzso zzso of vessel zzso as defined from zzso may provide useful insights into tumor development and response to zzso
