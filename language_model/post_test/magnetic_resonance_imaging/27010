Pulmonary valve replacement zzso is a common therapy for chronic pulmonary zzso However, the use of this strategy is mostly based on the studies performed on patients with zzso of zzso zzso and not in patients with pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate our experience with zzso in patients with zzso and compare them with a matched cohort of zzso zzso 

Between 1995 and 2009, 13 patients with zzso underwent a late zzso zzso zzso control subjects were identified for 12 of these zzso Before and after zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, exercise test, zzso and zzso data were compared between zzso 

There was no mortality in either zzso The zzso improved pulmonary zzso fraction and right zzso volumes in all zzso Patients with zzso had more significant zzso zzso zzso zzso least zzso by zzso and magnetic resonance imaging before zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso versus zzso zzso 1 zzso p zzso zzso and had more zzso valve repairs than zzso patients zzso zzso 9 zzso versus zzso zzso 1 zzso p zzso zzso zzso was undertaken by a combination of zzso Although zzso was improved early zzso only 2 of 9 patients zzso were free from significant zzso at most recent follow-up zzso zzso years; range, zzso to zzso No patient underwent zzso at latest zzso 

Patients with zzso can undergo a late zzso with excellent zzso zzso zzso and repair are more commonly observed among patients with zzso compared with zzso zzso Although zzso valve repair improves zzso early, zzso tends to zzso suggesting the need for further refinement of current surgical zzso
