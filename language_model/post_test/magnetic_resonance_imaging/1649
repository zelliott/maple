The correlation between zzso zzso load zzso detected on conventional MR sequences and disability assessed by the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso is, at best, zzso The present study was performed to determine whether the correlation between disability and zzso is improved by zzso use of the more sensitive three-dimensional fast zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso application of the newly devised zzso functional composite zzso zzso zzso patients with clinically zzso or probable zzso were zzso All had been followed zzso for 14 years since their first zzso zzso and zzso score were zzso Imaging was performed with zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso detected a zzso higher zzso than zzso but did not improve the correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso the correlation was stronger with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso score did not significantly correlate with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The robust correlation in this cohort between zzso zzso and zzso may reflect the homogeneous disease duration and the wide spread of zzso This correlation was not improved by the increased detection of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The stronger correlation between zzso zzso with zzso is consistent with the finding that this zzso of zzso represent areas of more severe tissue zzso The zzso score did not improve the zzso paradox that is found in zzso despite including information on cognitive zzso
