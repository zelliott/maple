Combining zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso necessarily involves an engineering zzso as the equipment needed for the two zzso zzso for the space closest to the region where the signals zzso In one recently described scanner zzso for simultaneous zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso detection scintillating zzso reside in an zzso gap between the 2 halves of a zzso zzso zzso A novel set of zzso and zzso coils has been specially designed for this split zzso scanner to include an zzso gap from which wires are excluded so as not to interfere with zzso zzso An inverse boundary element method was necessarily employed to design the three zzso zzso zzso coils and zzso zzso zzso zzso The coils have been constructed and tested in the hybrid zzso zzso zzso system and successfully used in simultaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso
