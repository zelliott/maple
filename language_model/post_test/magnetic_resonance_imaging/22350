To understand the relationship between zzso function and clinical state in the framework of stroke, the long-term zzso zzso spontaneous zzso activity was studied by means of zzso zzso patients who had suffered a unilateral stroke within the middle cerebral artery were zzso Median time since stroke was zzso zzso In association with zzso features and clinical picture, total and relative band powers and the spectral zzso were analyzed in the affected zzso and unaffected zzso zzso in comparison with an zzso control zzso An increase of absolute and relative slow band powers and a reduction of relative fast band powers were found in patients' zzso with respect to both zzso and control zzso Absolute delta band was higher than in controls also in zzso New findings were the increase of zzso rest activity power also in the alpha band and the decrease of spectral zzso in zzso with respect to both zzso and control zzso Moreover, our results in chronic stroke patients indicate zzso zzso related to specific zzso global clinical status was mostly impaired in patients with larger zzso and increased total and slow band activity powers, whereas hand functionality was mostly disrupted in patients with zzso involvement and reduction of zzso rhythms and spectral zzso Total power increase and spectral richness decrease are in agreement with a higher zzso of local zzso activity, a reduction of the zzso zzso network's efficiency, and an increase of zzso zzso
