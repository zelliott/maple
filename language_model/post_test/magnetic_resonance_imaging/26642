Training one hand on a motor task results in performance improvements in the other hand, also when stimuli are randomly presented zzso zzso Corpus zzso zzso is the main structure involved in zzso information zzso zzso pathology occurs in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and is related to altered performance of tasks requiring zzso transfer of zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso transfer during a pure motor zzso task, we combined motor behavior with diffusion zzso imaging analysis in zzso Twenty-two zzso and 10 controls, all zzso were asked to respond to random stimuli with appropriate finger opposition movements with the right zzso and then the left zzso zzso zzso were able to improve motor performance reducing response times with practice with a trend similar to controls and preserved the ability to transfer the acquired motor information from the learning to the transfer zzso A higher zzso in the transfer process, indicated by a significantly larger standard zzso of mean zzso transfer, was found in the zzso group with respect to the control group, suggesting the presence of subtle zzso in zzso communication in some zzso Then, we correlated the amount of zzso transfer with mean fractional zzso zzso values, indicative of zzso damage, obtained in five zzso zzso identified on zzso zzso zzso A significant correlation was found only in the zzso including zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso which thus seems to be essential for the zzso transfer of information related to pure zzso zzso
