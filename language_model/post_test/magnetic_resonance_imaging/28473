We performed a clinical and magnetic resonance zzso zzso study in 19 patients with benign multiple sclerosis zzso to achieve a better definition of the nature of disability in zzso Patients with higher zzso volumes on conventional zzso images at entry were those with more frequent relapses zzso zzso zzso and more new MR zzso zzso zzso zzso during the follow zzso However, 1/3 of these new zzso were located zzso and about 2/3 were small or intermediate in zzso Two of the 11 patients zzso with higher zzso volumes at entry developed progressive neurological zzso in these two patients the new zzso seen on conventional zzso images had lower zzso transfer ratios zzso zzso zzso than those present in patients who remained clinically stable and a marked increase in zzso zzso volumes on zzso images was also zzso Spinal zzso zzso area at zzso and zzso values for the seemingly normal white matter were similar to those found in normal zzso This study suggests that patients with benign zzso have two different patterns of disease evolution, one characterized by very low clinical and MR activities, the other in which the lack of disabling zzso might be related to factors like site, size and nature of zzso It also indicates that in patients with benign zzso and high MR zzso loads the risk of developing a secondary progressive form of the disease is still present even after many years after zzso
