zzso of zzso tumors in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso can be associated with significant morbidity because of the zzso zzso and the cortical zzso often required in gaining access to this infrequently explored zzso With the use of image guidance, the zzso zzso approach requires neither lateral cortical zzso nor the placement of brain zzso to gain surgical access to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and this approach is associated with a high rate of gross total tumor zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso approach was used to zzso 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumors in 34 consecutive patients during an zzso zzso zzso zzso and surgical outcome data were collected zzso 

The series included operations in 25 men and 15 women, and the patients' average age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five of the 40 procedures were performed to remove zzso in the dominant hemisphere, and previous zzso for zzso had been performed in 12 of 40 zzso In 38 of 40 cases, zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso and 50% of these tumors were high-grade zzso zzso 23 patients were zzso intact before 40 procedures, whereas visual field deficits were noted in 7 patients, mild zzso was documented in 4 patients, and other neurological deficits were present in 9 zzso An excellent outcome zzso zzso zzso Grade 5) was noted after 38 zzso of the 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Permanent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Grade 4) occurred after one zzso and a second patient, despite being zzso unchanged zzso and despite having had an optimal tumor zzso died on zzso Day 33 zzso zzso zzso Grade zzso Complete zzso of the preoperatively defined tumor volume was noted on zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging examinations after 39 zzso of the 40 zzso The average duration of clinical follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso zzso 

We think that the zzso approach is well suited to the zzso of tumors in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso By allowing the zzso to avoid unnecessary brain zzso and zzso this approach reduces the risk of injury to important lateral zzso and zzso lobe zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso of a zzso zzso or zzso zzso mass with the zzso approach zzso zzso horn zzso zzso zzso zzso helps the zzso to maintain precise spatial and zzso orientation and accurately zzso the margin between the tumor and the surrounding neural zzso
