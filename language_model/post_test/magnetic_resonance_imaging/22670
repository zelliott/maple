In patients with multiple sclerosis zzso the severity of clinical signs is not closely related to zzso of structural brain damage provided by conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso patients with zzso may show symptom recovery while progressively accumulating tissue zzso Changes in functional organization of the cerebral zzso have been reported in functional magnetic resonance zzso studies that have compared the zzso patterns during zzso zzso and cognitive tasks of patients with zzso with those of healthy zzso zzso studies on zzso have provided the results that are difficult to compare and may be zzso because of differences in the criteria used for patient selection, the zzso zzso the experimental design, and the MR acquisition zzso Nevertheless, they do provide a new, interesting tool that sheds light on how the brain changes its functional organization in response to zzso In patients with zzso functional brain reorganization mainly consists of an increase in the extent of zzso of the brain areas used by healthy subjects, as well as the recruitment of additional brain zzso These findings have been interpreted as zzso or zzso mechanisms that allow normal performance despite neural damage or zzso However, brain functional activity may also change in response to clinical zzso though the precise role of brain functional changes in zzso has yet to fully zzso zzso studies designed to explore the effects of both rehabilitation and pharmacological agents on brain plasticity might shed light on this zzso
