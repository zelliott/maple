Assessment of the grade and type of zzso is of paramount importance for zzso zzso zzso zzso may provide additional information on the zzso of the zzso its response to treatment and zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between diffusion zzso imaging zzso dynamic zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso grade and zzso zzso index in newly diagnosed zzso 

Study was made of patients with suspected zzso on brain zzso between December 2010 and January 2012, by zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso The zzso activity of each zzso was measured by zzso the zzso proliferation index from zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso was newly diagnosed in 25 patients (17 men, 8 women, aged zzso years, median 55 zzso The zzso index ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso On evaluation of the relationship between the zzso zzso zzso by zzso was found to be significantly correlated with cellular proliferation zzso zzso Regarding zzso significant negative correlation was demonstrated between the apparent diffusion zzso zzso ratio and the zzso index zzso zzso zzso correlation was also observed between the fractional zzso zzso ratio and the zzso index zzso zzso Strong correlation was found between relative cerebral blood volume zzso and zzso index zzso zzso and between the zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso negative correlation was demonstrated between the zzso zzso ratio and zzso ratio zzso zzso These imaging techniques were able to distinguish between zzso and high-grade zzso 

zzso on zzso zzso and brain zzso with zzso metrics were more closely correlated with zzso cellular zzso
