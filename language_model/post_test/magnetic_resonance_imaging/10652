To evaluate by zzso the area size and the degree of iron zzso in zzso zzso zzso that are implicated in the zzso of Parkinson's disease zzso 

40 patients with idiopathic zzso and 40 controls were examined on a zzso 5 zzso MR zzso using a zzso zzso sequence zzso 40, 60, 80, 100, zzso zzso 160 zzso The zzso relaxation time zzso and the area of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso external zzso zzso zzso internal zzso zzso nucleus zzso locus zzso zzso and zzso nucleus zzso were zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso was lower and of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), p zzso zzso The area of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), p zzso zzso A more pronounced decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed when the more affected side of patients was evaluated zzso In patients with disease duration zzso 5 years the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower and the area of zzso was higher zzso zzso zzso compared with those with disease duration zzso or zzso 5 years zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), p zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that dysfunction of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso may affect iron content not only in zzso but in zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso of the remaining zzso fibers could account for the increased area of the zzso and zzso
