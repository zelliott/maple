Basic experiments were done to examine the influence of the extent of curve, direction of flow, vascular diameter, zzso of flow, and course of vessels on MR zzso In the first experiment, two zzso were constructed of vinyl zzso a hairpin type and one with tubes bent to varying zzso These zzso were zzso in two zzso different zzso and of various zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Images of a normal volunteer were also zzso In studies of the hairpin zzso a low intensity artifact appeared at the curve position, and the edge became fuzzy when the flow was perpendicular to the phase zzso zzso These phenomena were more apparent with a smaller zzso smaller zzso more gentle angle, larger diameter, and faster zzso in other words the component along the direction was zzso In the phantom that used bent tubes, another low intensity artifact appeared on the zzso side of the zzso zzso The results obtained from the volunteer corresponded well to those from the basic zzso It was thought that the profile of flow was not well demonstrated due to the coarse zzso In the second experiment, water flowed at various speeds through three-dimensional zzso that were made of vinyl tubes of various diameters and zzso The zzso were zzso with two- and three-dimensional time of flight and phase contrast zzso The lower limits of detection of the phase contrast method were almost the zzso In the zzso plane, the lower limit decreased to zzso zzso for arteries and zzso zzso for zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
