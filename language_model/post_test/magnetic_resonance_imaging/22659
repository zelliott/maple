zzso zzso are WHO grade II or III tumors composed of a mixture of 2 zzso cell types zzso resembling the cells in zzso and diffuse zzso zzso on the genetic profile of zzso may yield important information for their zzso and help for their clinical zzso We have zzso in 94 zzso zzso WHO grade II and 48 WHO grade zzso the patterns of loss of zzso zzso of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were as zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated in zzso other zzso associations were rare zzso Patients had a median follow-up of 30 zzso Patients without zzso on zzso had shorter progression free survival than patients with zzso on zzso 30 zzso 132 months, p zzso zzso zzso indicated that tumors without zzso on zzso were often zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed signal zzso on zzso and zzso images zzso zzso zzso and contrast enhancement zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso on zzso identifies two zzso of zzso zzso without zzso on zzso behave like WHO grade II or III diffuse zzso they have shorter survival, zzso characteristics zzso zzso and genetic zzso associated with tumor zzso zzso with zzso on zzso on the other hand, behave like WHO grade II or III zzso with zzso zzso they are associated with longer survival and do not have zzso or genetic zzso associated with zzso These findings suggest that the definition of zzso or mixed zzso could be reshaped in agreement with the genetic zzso
