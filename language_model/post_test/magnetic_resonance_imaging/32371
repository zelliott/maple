The objectives were to present magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso findings in three patients with deletion on zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso disorders zzso zzso these findings with the percentage of deleted zzso 

Our study confirms the high prevalence of white matter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso ranging from mild to severe zzso The zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso brain stem were more frequently zzso A zzso peak was the most frequent finding at the zzso We found a correlation between the percentage of zzso deletion and degree of MRS zzso 

Our findings showed that MRS is a useful zzso tool in patients with zzso zzso studies are necessary to zzso the correlation of quantitative zzso deletion and zzso zzso
