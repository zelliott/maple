From zzso zzso zzso zzso studies we know that relatively short periods of training can increase regional zzso matter volume in trained cortical zzso In 14 right-handed patients with writer's zzso we employed zzso to test whether suppression zzso zzso or enhancement zzso zzso of manual activity lead to opposing changes in zzso matter in the zzso primary motor hand area zzso We additionally used zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to evaluate concurrent changes in regional zzso Patients were recruited from a clinical trial which was designed to improve zzso zzso zzso the zzso hand was immobilized for 4 weeks with the intention to reverse faulty zzso After zzso patients accomplished a motor zzso for 8 zzso zzso zzso of the whole brain and zzso zzso zzso of the resting motor threshold zzso were performed every 4 zzso zzso of the right hand resulted in a relative zzso matter decrease in the zzso left zzso along with a decrease in zzso zzso as zzso by an increase in zzso zzso training reversed the effects of zzso causing an increase in regional zzso matter density and zzso of left zzso The relative changes in zzso matter correlated with the relative shifts in zzso This prospective zzso zzso study in zzso hand zzso shows that the zzso matter density of zzso is zzso shaped by the level of manual zzso This zzso structural plasticity is functionally relevant as local zzso matter changes are mirrored by changes in regional zzso
