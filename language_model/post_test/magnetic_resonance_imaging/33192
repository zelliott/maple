Previous studies have found varying relationships between cognitive functioning and brain volumes in patients with zzso However, cortical thickness may more closely reflect zzso characteristics than gray matter density or volume zzso Here, we aimed to compare associations between regional variation in cortical thickness and executive functions, memory, as well as verbal and spatial processing in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls zzso We obtained magnetic resonance imaging and zzso data for 131 patients and 138 matched zzso zzso cortical pattern matching methods allowed testing for associations with cortical thickness estimated as the shortest distance between the zzso matter border and the zzso surface at thousands of points across the entire cortical zzso Two independent measures of working memory showed robust associations with cortical thickness in lateral prefrontal zzso in zzso whereas patients exhibited associations between working memory and cortical thickness in the right middle and superior zzso zzso This study provides additional evidence for a disrupted zzso relationship in zzso In line with the prefrontal inefficiency hypothesis, schizophrenia patients may engage a larger zzso network of brain regions other than frontal zzso to recall and manipulate verbal material in working zzso
