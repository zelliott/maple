We zzso analyzed MR studies of 32 patients with intractable complex partial seizures, who later underwent zzso of zzso seizure zzso zzso patients were zzso at zzso 4 at zzso and 1 at zzso zzso zzso was obtained on all patients with zzso and surgical zzso Of 19 patients with zzso zzso sclerosis zzso 13 exhibited an MR zzso at the site of pathology as determined by zzso and zzso zzso included increased zzso or decreased zzso signal intensity, distortion of zzso interface zzso and zzso lobe zzso zzso Six patients had no abnormalities at the site of the diseased zzso MR was more sensitive in patients with other structural zzso which included zzso encephalitis, zzso cryptic vascular zzso and zzso zzso Prior studies indicate some usefulness of MR in intractable seizure patients, but many report relative zzso of MR in defining an zzso (as low as zzso Our results demonstrate the usefulness of high-resolution zzso zzso MR using cardiac gating or flow compensation techniques in this patient zzso
