Left zzso volume zzso is a fundamental zzso factor in a variety of cardiac diseases including zzso zzso heart failure, and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and accurate method of measuring zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso has achieved better zzso of zzso than two-dimensional zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso has often been reported and no previous study has zzso these zzso The present study aimed at revealing existence and extent of bias in zzso measurement by zzso and investigating related factors affecting the zzso 

Studies comparing zzso between zzso and magnetic resonance imaging published before August 15, 2011 were zzso A zzso with random effects model was performed to evaluate the systematic zzso zzso affecting the bias were investigated by zzso followed by zzso zzso 

A total of 14 studies including 395 subjects revealed zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cardiac disease led to more zzso whereas increasing the number of plane included in the analysis zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso for each zzso 

Only by zzso a number of small studies as a zzso could we display zzso of zzso by zzso and factors influencing the systematic zzso These data provide a more detailed basis for analyzing and improving the accuracy of zzso an indispensable step toward further clinical application in zzso zzso
