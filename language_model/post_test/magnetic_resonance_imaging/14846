The purpose of this study was to assess a series of lateral zzso zzso fractures of the zzso 

Over a 17-year period, 10 patients with an acute lateral zzso zzso fracture of the zzso after an inversion injury to the ankle were zzso Diagnosis was made by physical examination, zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso was initially performed on all zzso All patients had an zzso zzso zzso In 8 of 10 patients the zzso was zzso in an open manner in conjunction with lateral ligament zzso The zzso was excised in 2 zzso The mean age of the patients was zzso zzso They were evaluated with the Single Assessment zzso zzso American zzso Foot and zzso Society zzso zzso modified Weber score, zzso and zzso score, and Short Form 36 version 2 zzso Physical and zzso examination was also zzso The mean time to follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso

An zzso zzso fracture of the lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can occur after a twisting injury to the zzso Clinical suspicion should be high, especially in the younger zzso This injury can be successfully managed with a combined zzso and open zzso
