There is increasing evidence zzso the cellular and molecular mechanisms of plasticity of the nervous system including growth, zzso degradation, and even death of zzso Some of these mechanisms directly correlate with zzso behavioral changes, and all provide an understanding of the response of the nervous system to altered zzso The understanding of neural zzso of behavior can then form the foundation for more productive, comprehensive zzso
