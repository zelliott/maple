Visual cortical plasticity induced by overt retinal zzso zzso has remained a controversial zzso Here we studied cortical plasticity in a silent model of retinal zzso cell loss, documented by in zzso optical biopsy using zzso zzso The cortical impact of zzso subtle retinal zzso cell functional and structural loss was investigated in carriers of the zzso DNA zzso zzso causing zzso zzso zzso zzso We used magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure cortical thickness and zzso to define zzso cortical visual areas zzso V2 and zzso in silent carriers and matched control zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a surprising increase in cortical thickness in the younger carrier group zzso 21 years of zzso This effect dominated in zzso cortex, and notably zzso This form of structural plasticity suggests enhanced plastic zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso regions close to zzso and not receiving direct zzso zzso
