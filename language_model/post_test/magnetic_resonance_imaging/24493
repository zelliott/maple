zzso zzso zzso shows various brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities with zzso central nervous system zzso attacks, although predominantly affecting the spinal zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso with extensive involvement of the brain has infrequently been zzso We investigated the clinical, zzso features and zzso changes of zzso patients with extensive brain zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso patients (including 16 zzso patients with zzso and 53 zzso patients without zzso hospitalized during January 2006 and February 2010 were recruited and analyzed zzso Data of clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso features, laboratory zzso treatment details and outcomes were zzso All the patients received the follow-up visits for two zzso 

zzso in zzso were classified into four categories according to their respective zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) Acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) Multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso had higher rates of zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso than zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso changes (including the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in patients with zzso than those without zzso The zzso times in zzso during the follow-up period were more frequent than those happened in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso scores in zzso patients were also much higher than those in zzso throughout all the whole visits of zzso 

The presence of zzso in zzso may indicate a higher diseases activity and portend a worse zzso zzso is a useful marker in monitoring diseases zzso zzso inflammation may be crucial to the formation of zzso in zzso
