The aim of the current study was to monitor the migration of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso cells, which were used to induce zzso tumor growth in an animal model, over time using magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the goal of aiding in tumor prognosis and zzso 

Two groups of male zzso rats were used for the tumor induction zzso In the first group zzso the tumors were induced via the injection of zzso zzso zzso In the second group zzso the tumors were induced via the injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso Blue zzso was performed to analyze the zzso distribution within the zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso cells were injected into the right frontal cortex, and subsequent tumor monitoring and zzso detection were performed using zzso and zzso zzso at a zzso field zzso In addition, zzso tissue was zzso analyzed after performing the zzso zzso 

The in zzso qualitative evaluation demonstrated adequate distribution and satisfactory cell labeling of the zzso At 14 or 21 days after zzso injection, a zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal reduction was observed within the zzso located in the left frontal lobe on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the tumor tissue with zzso Blue revealed a broad distribution of zzso within the zzso zzso 

zzso analyses exhibit potential for monitoring the tumor growth of zzso cells efficiently labeled with zzso
