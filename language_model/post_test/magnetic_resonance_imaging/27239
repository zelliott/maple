A novel technique to zzso the zzso ratio zzso of magnetic resonance images is zzso The image zzso is zzso by zzso the zzso of the signal spectrum using the zzso function of just one single magnetic resonance zzso To test the performance of the zzso zzso measurement data are fitted to theoretically expected zzso It is shown that the technique can be implemented in a highly efficient way for the magnetic resonance imaging zzso
