To assess the efficacy and feasibility of zzso and zzso zzso zzso screw fixation for the treatment of traumatic zzso burst zzso zzso zzso screw zzso is a well described technique to reduce and stabilize zzso and zzso spine zzso It is relatively a easy procedure but can only indirectly reduce a fractured zzso body, and the means of zzso the anterior column are zzso Hardware failure and a loss of reduction are recognized complications caused by insufficient anterior column zzso Patients with traumatic zzso burst fractures without zzso deficits were zzso After a short segment zzso reduction and zzso bilateral zzso reduction of the zzso was performed using a zzso and zzso zzso cement was zzso zzso and zzso central and anterior heights were assessed with zzso and zzso Sixteen patients underwent this zzso and a substantial reduction of the zzso could be achieved with the zzso All patients recovered zzso and the zzso examination revealed no zzso The zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a good fracture reduction and filling of the bone zzso without zzso bone zzso The central and anterior height of the zzso body could be restored to 72 and zzso of the estimated intact zzso zzso zzso were cement leakage in three cases without clinical implications and one superficial wound zzso zzso zzso zzso fixation in conjunction with balloon zzso seems to be a feasible option in the management of zzso burst fractures, thereby addressing all the three columns through a single zzso Although cement leakage occurred but had no clinical consequences or neurological zzso
