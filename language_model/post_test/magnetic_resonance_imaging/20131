Signal changes observed in high-resolution in zzso magnetic resonance zzso images acquired during cerebral zzso in small animal models must be correlated to molecular indicators of tissue damage obtained from digitized zzso brain zzso An effective image registration technique that incorporates both a linear and zzso thin plate zzso transform was developed to compensate the zzso that occur in the brain during the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Features in different layers of the brain were zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso landmark selection method to register tissue layers with few distinguishing zzso zzso analysis using simulated data demonstrated average registration error of 400 zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso in the MR zzso when zzso or zzso landmark points are zzso Visual agreement was obtained between zzso MR images and zzso zzso stained zzso These methods will allow accurate registration of in zzso images with zzso to correlate in zzso surrogate markers of tissue damage with specific zzso indicators of zzso
