A reduction in signal in the zzso zzso on zzso images is said to correlate with a poor response to zzso and may help to identify patients with zzso zzso Our aim in this prospective study was to use the zzso ratio of the zzso signal on zzso images in various parts of the zzso zzso in 43 patients with de zzso zzso Signal intensity zzso were compared to the response to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A reduced zzso ratio in the zzso correlated significantly with a negative response to zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso No additional signal intensity measurement correlated with response to zzso or specific zzso zzso However, there was a considerable overlap of zzso ratios between patients with a positive or negative response to zzso or normal and reduced zzso zzso We suggest that zzso assessment of signal intensity in the zzso shows a significant reduction in patients with probably zzso zzso compared with patients with probably idiopathic zzso However, this method does not exclude idiopathic zzso in a given zzso
