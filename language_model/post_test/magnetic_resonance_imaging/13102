Despite clinical symptoms and signs of central nervous system dysfunction, conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain and spinal zzso may appear normal in multiple sclerosis zzso at clinical zzso 

To demonstrate cortical pathology, namely the presence of cortical zzso zzso in patients with zzso suggestive of zzso but having normal appearing white matter zzso on zzso 

zzso were disclosed by double inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso The final diagnosis of zzso was achieved by the demonstration of the dissemination in space and time of zzso zzso and the absence of a better explanation of zzso according to the established international diagnostic zzso 

We describe four patients with zzso in which zzso were observed by zzso zzso before the zzso evidence of inflammatory zzso in the zzso 

We suggest that, at least in some patients with zzso the pathological process underlying zzso starts in the zzso zzso sequence should be included in the zzso examination of suspected patients with zzso with normal conventional zzso sequences at clinical zzso zzso should be evaluated for their inclusion in the zzso diagnostic criteria for zzso
