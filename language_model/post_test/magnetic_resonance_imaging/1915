zzso zzso is valuable for the evaluation of cell viability and zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the significance of zzso brain zzso in zzso zzso We compared zzso brain zzso with zzso and diffusion weighted images zzso zzso Ten patients with acute and early zzso zzso stroke were included in this prospective zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained during both the zzso zzso and late zzso zzso In the case of zzso time to peak zzso and regional cerebral blood volume zzso maps were zzso The zzso map and zzso zzso images were compared in 8 zzso using zzso The asymmetry index zzso was calculated as zzso - zzso X 200 zzso zzso + zzso where zzso is the mean number of zzso counts of an zzso zzso and zzso is the mean number of zzso counts of the normal zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso - zzso in the zzso core and zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected new zzso of the zzso stage or of evolving stroke more accurately than zzso and zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso the zzso core and zzso zzso in all zzso in both the acute and the zzso zzso zzso was higher in the zzso map than in the zzso zzso images in the zzso core zzso zzso zzso and in the periphery zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso images, zzso was higher in the zzso core than in the periphery zzso zzso zzso During the zzso stage, zzso zzso detected all the zzso without the zzso seen in the MR images of zzso zzso Based on this study, zzso zzso is comparable to zzso in terms of its ability to detect acute stroke and is more useful than zzso in the case of zzso zzso
