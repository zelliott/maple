Three hundred zzso patients harboring zzso zzso presented to the zzso neurosurgery unit between January 1986 and August zzso The patients' records were reviewed to assess symptomatology, results of imaging studies, and outcome according to mode of zzso zzso patients zzso were eligible for this zzso Nine zzso were diagnosed zzso and 24 were identified zzso zzso 0 zzso years, mean zzso zzso The mean follow-up period was zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso Seven zzso were left zzso six zzso detected before birth and one zzso after zzso Of the 26 patients who required surgery, three were admitted elsewhere for complications of shunt zzso A zzso zzso was performed in all three of these patients, but the treatment failed in zzso The primary treatment in the remaining 23 children was: open zzso in two patients, VC in seven, zzso zzso in 13, and zzso zzso shunt in one zzso Both open zzso procedures were successful, as was the zzso shunt zzso The success rate of primary zzso surgery, although not statistically zzso was higher for zzso (11 zzso of 13 zzso than for zzso (four zzso of seven zzso None of the patients' zzso zzso disorders resolved zzso The distribution of intellectual and zzso zzso paralleled the normal zzso Intellectual performance was unrelated to zzso factors or to treatment zzso
