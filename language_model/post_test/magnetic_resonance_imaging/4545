The clinical course of a patient with a zzso zzso zzso depends largely on the ability of the zzso region to zzso and compensate for the loss of the zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that the remaining viable zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of this study was to define the regional distribution of the zzso zzso that occurs after zzso in rat hearts by use of a technique that could be applied zzso to human zzso 

zzso of the left zzso zzso and zzso wall were induced by zzso a coronary zzso Eight to 10 weeks after zzso one-dimensional chemical shift imaging zzso was used to obtain zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso of eight zzso zzso slices along the long axis (from base to zzso of isolated zzso rat zzso Regional zzso and zzso zzso contents were compared in remodeled versus normal zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images identified the mass of each zzso allowing calculations of zzso amount per unit zzso in each zzso zzso MR images identify the zzso of remodeled zzso but do not discriminate between zzso and viable zzso In contrast, zzso zzso does distinguish viable zzso Compared with zzso there was less zzso signal in the slices zzso to the zzso containing mainly zzso tissue and increased signal intensity in slices zzso to the zzso because of zzso zzso The zzso signal intensity changed in direct proportion to the viable tissue mass in the zzso suggesting that the amount of zzso per unit mass in viable remodeled zzso is the same as that of the zzso In contrast, the amount of zzso per unit mass in remodeled zzso zzso This decrease is uniform across the zzso zzso with zzso size, and parallels a similar decrease in tissue zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso hearts shows that zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso independent of the distance from the zzso in the zzso remodeled zzso and its amount zzso zzso with zzso size; and zzso the zzso signal provides a profile of viable zzso and is a zzso marker of zzso zzso and zzso that has occurred in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso provides both a marker that tissue injury has occurred zzso zzso and a marker of the extent of zzso in response to injury zzso zzso in a single set of zzso zzso
