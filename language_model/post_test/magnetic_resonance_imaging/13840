To measure the national practice variations in imaging studies performed for men newly diagnosed with clinically localized prostate zzso 

We created an zzso file from 1991 to 1996 Medicare claims data using files for a random sample of zzso of all Medicare zzso Among men with newly diagnosed clinically localized prostate cancer, we identified those undergoing staging bone scans, staging zzso zzso zzso or staging magnetic resonance imaging zzso at the time of zzso We conducted zzso and zzso analyses adjusting for zzso index score, age group, race, geographic region, and year of zzso 

In all geographic regions, men receiving radiation therapy zzso were more likely than those receiving radical zzso zzso to undergo zzso In the South, zzso patients were significantly more likely than zzso patients to undergo zzso and bone zzso In the West, zzso patients were significantly more likely than zzso patients to have bone zzso In zzso analyses that controlled for all significant zzso findings, treatment with zzso significantly predicted for the use of bone scans zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso CT scans zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso scans zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso Regional differences in the use of imaging technologies for staging persisted in the zzso zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso for clinically localized prostate cancer undergo more bone, CT, and zzso scans than do patients undergoing zzso regardless of zzso age, or zzso In addition, a significant geographic variation was found in the use of these diagnostic zzso These variations suggest that evidence-based staging guidelines have not been met with broad physician zzso
