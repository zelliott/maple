zzso of magnetic resonance zzso images has many clinical and research zzso Because of multiple factors such as noise, intensity zzso and partial volume effects, MR image zzso can be zzso Noise in zzso can cause the classified regions to become zzso zzso volume effects make the assignment of a single class to one region zzso Because of intensity zzso the intensity of the same tissue can vary with respect to the location of the tissue within the same zzso The conventional zzso zzso method restricts each zzso exclusively to one class and often results in crisp zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso has been extensively applied to MR images, in which zzso are partially classified into multiple classes using varying memberships to the zzso Standard zzso however, is sensitive to noise and cannot effectively compensate for intensity zzso This paper presents a method to obtain accurate MR brain zzso using a modified zzso and zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso and zzso fuzzy zzso zzso zzso method with MR intensity correction is presented in this zzso We use a bilateral filter to process MR images and to build a zzso image series by increasing the standard zzso of spatial function and by reducing the standard zzso of range zzso At each scale, we separate the image into multiple blocks and for every block a zzso fuzzy zzso zzso method is applied along the scales from the coarse to fine levels in order to overcome the effect of intensity zzso The result from a coarse scale supervises the zzso in the next fine zzso The zzso method is tested with noisy MR images with intensity zzso 

Our method was compared with the conventional zzso a modified zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on zzso images with various zzso on the simulated brain MR database, and on real MR zzso Our zzso method consistently performed better than the conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso method achieved an overlap ratio of zzso or zzso Experimental results using real MR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso Our zzso zzso method is accurate and robust for various MR zzso 

As our zzso method did not assume a zzso distribution of tissue intensity, it could be used on other image data for tissue zzso and zzso The automatic zzso method can provide a useful zzso tool in zzso and other zzso
