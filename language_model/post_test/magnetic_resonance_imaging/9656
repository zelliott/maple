zzso patients have dysfunctional cortical zzso processing and very often report hypersensitivity and zzso symptoms to zzso during acute headache zzso However, imaging data of how the brain processes associate migraine symptoms, such as zzso zzso or zzso are zzso 

The present study aimed to explore zzso processing in response to zzso stimulation zzso zzso in migraine patients in and outside acute headache zzso Using zzso zzso we studied 20 migraine patients and compared behavioral and imaging data with zzso and zzso healthy zzso Additionally, 13 of the 20 patients were scanned within 6 hours after the onset of a spontaneous migraine zzso 

Imaging data showed that zzso zzso did not differ from control zzso However, during spontaneous and zzso attacks, migraine patients showed significantly higher blood oxygen zzso signal zzso in brain areas including zzso structures zzso and insular zzso and, more specifically, in the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso 

Increased activity in the zzso part of the zzso has previously been specifically linked to the pain of the migraine zzso The present finding suggests that the activity level of this structure can be triggered by zzso input and thus points to the strong zzso relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso of migraine zzso
