One of the major aims of the International Union of zzso Sciences zzso zzso Project is to develop zzso mathematical and computer models that can be used to help understand human zzso We present here a small facet of this broad plan that applies to the gastrointestinal zzso Specifically, we present an zzso and zzso based zzso framework that is capable of simulating normal and pathological electrical activity within the stomach and small zzso The zzso models used within this framework have been created using anatomical information derived from common medical imaging zzso and data from the Visible Human zzso These models explicitly incorporate the various smooth muscle layers and networks of zzso cells of zzso zzso that are known to exist within the walls of the stomach and small zzso zzso activity within individual zzso and smooth muscle cells is simulated using a previously published simplified representation of the cell level electrical zzso This simulated cell level activity is incorporated into a zzso representation of the zzso allowing electrical activity of the entire stomach or zzso to be simulated in the zzso derived zzso This electrical zzso framework successfully replicates many of the qualitative features of the slow wave activity within the stomach and zzso and has also been used to investigate activity associated with functional zzso of the zzso
