To evaluate long-term effectiveness of a strategy for managing the zzso root and zzso zzso according to the pathology in ascending zzso zzso 

From 1978 to 1995, 208 patients underwent operations for acute zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso zzso ascending zzso zzso zzso strategies included valve zzso with zzso zzso root repair and ascending zzso graft for normal zzso and valve zzso zzso zzso composite valve and ascending zzso graft for abnormal zzso and valve zzso zzso zzso and valve replacement and zzso ascending zzso graft for normal zzso and abnormal valve zzso zzso zzso zzso extended into the arch only if the zzso tear originated in or extended to the zzso arch zzso zzso zzso 

Hospital mortality was zzso zzso shock zzso zzso and zzso coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso were associated with increased zzso use of circulatory arrest zzso zzso decreased zzso Survival was zzso zzso and zzso at 30 days, 5 years, and 10 years, zzso Advanced age, earlier date of operation, composite zzso and arch zzso were associated with decreased zzso residual zzso dissected zzso was zzso zzso was required for 5 zzso and 8 zzso zzso 

In both acute and chronic ascending zzso zzso zzso circulatory arrest is associated with low early zzso zzso with normal zzso and zzso zzso repair of the dissected zzso root and valve zzso is effective long zzso and zzso residual zzso dissected zzso does not decrease late survival and has a low risk of zzso change and zzso for at least 10 zzso
