This study was developed to test the hypothesis that there is a period in which a painful, traumatic rotator cuff zzso with associated weakness and the inability to zzso above shoulder level, should be repaired to allow for improvement in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso followed patients met the criteria for entrance into this zzso Of those, 36 patients were available for a minimum 9 months follow-up zzso 31 zzso range, zzso by office zzso Patient outcomes were measured using the zzso zzso and zzso scoring zzso Patient zzso including time from injury to repair, tear size, degree of zzso fat zzso patient satisfaction, and improvement in pain, were evaluated for their association with surgical outcome using independent zzso zzso Time to repair was evaluated at 0-2 months, 2-4 months, and greater than 4 zzso 

zzso scores improved from 7 to zzso zzso zzso zzso and active zzso improved from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso scores improved from zzso to zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso All but 2 of the 36 patients were satisfied with their zzso zzso fatty zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso cuff tear size had no influence on patient outcome if repaired before 4 zzso zzso tears repaired after 4 months had the worst zzso 

Our results emphasize that the treatment outcome for traumatic rotator cuff tears of all sizes, with associated zzso is not compromised up to 4 months after their zzso
