A technique is demonstrated for the acquisition and processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso images in the zzso The acquisition is a modification of zzso imaging in which time series images are acquired by sampling a limited segment of zzso corresponding to the low spatial zzso In the modification demonstrated here, zzso samples are divided into two groups that are sampled on alternate cardiac zzso The alternate zzso zzso portions are zzso by zzso zzso zzso of contrast agent zzso by image zzso is zzso A motion artifact reduction process using time domain zzso filtering is used to reduce artifacts from zzso Studies were performed on 46 patients at zzso T using zzso zzso zzso injected into the right zzso vein in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were noted in 27 of these zzso zzso studies were either partially or completely zzso for reasons relating to the differing zzso of zzso versus MR contrast agent zzso
