zzso zzso zzso are usually zzso and, therefore, are commonly detected as accidental findings on spinal zzso No treatment is indicated in these zzso Nevertheless, some zzso may clinically manifest as zzso pain and neurological deficit and may require surgery or other zzso The aim of this study was to assess outcomes of surgical management of symptomatic zzso zzso at two zzso zzso 

Prospective study of patients with zzso zzso zzso managed surgically at zzso Clinic of Faculty Hospital and Medical Faculty zzso and zzso zzso of zzso University in zzso and at zzso Department of zzso zzso Surgery was indicated in patients with confirmed zzso and zzso zzso zzso presenting with zzso eventually with zzso pain and/or neurological deficit, such as zzso or zzso zzso In cases where the only basis for indication for surgery was zzso zzso pain, the procedure included only zzso zzso of the zzso body zzso zzso zzso In cases with neurological dysfunction, zzso zzso using zzso with zzso of zzso tissue protruding into the spinal canal, as well as zzso was zzso During the zzso study period, 7 patients aged from 38 to 80 years (the mean age of zzso zzso were zzso The subjects included 4 males and 3 zzso Follow up examinations were performed during zzso at 6 weeks and at 6 months after the zzso On the last follow up examination, the patients were asked to assess zzso and zzso pain based on the zzso scale, zzso and the surgeons evaluated the degree of zzso according to Frankel and zzso zzso 

zzso had positive impact on the degree of zzso and zzso pain in all subjects zzso zzso and combination of VP with zzso resulted in improvement of zzso symptoms in all the subjects concerned (three zzso No spinal canal cement leak or zzso during VP was recorded, neither surgical wound healing zzso such as zzso or infection, were zzso No surgical revisions were zzso 

The aim of symptomatic zzso zzso therapy include nervous tissue zzso spinal stabilization and prevention of spontaneous or traumatic zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso using zzso or zzso zzso can be indicated only in patients developing severe zzso and may have good zzso It is zzso to combine zzso with zzso or balloon zzso zzso zzso or zzso alcohol zzso
