A procedure is introduced for using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques to identify neural regions associated with attention to semantic and zzso aspects of written words within a single group of zzso Short lists (16 zzso consisting of zzso zzso words zzso zzso or zzso words zzso zzso were presented rapidly to subjects, who were asked to attend to the relations among the zzso zzso zzso involved in attention to semantic relations appeared within left zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso approximate zzso Area, zzso left zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso involved in attention to zzso relations appeared within left inferior frontal zzso (near zzso zzso to the semantic regions within zzso described above) and within bilateral inferior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This method is notable in that a comparison of the two tasks within some of the individual subjects revealed zzso patterns similar to the group average, especially within left inferior frontal and left zzso zzso zzso This fact combined with the efficiency with which the data can be obtained zzso in about an hour of functional zzso and the zzso of the task for many different subject populations suggests a wide range of possibilities for this zzso it could be used to track language development zzso in zzso compare language organization across subject populations zzso for dyslexic or blind zzso and identify language regions within individuals zzso potentially to aid in surgical zzso
