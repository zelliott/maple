zzso zzso a zzso that selectively binds to the central zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is useful for evaluating zzso viability in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we investigated whether there was a correlation between zzso integrity in various brain structures and zzso in patients with zzso 

Twelve patients with extensive zzso on magnetic resonance imaging were divided into groups of patients with or without zzso Based on a zzso zzso model that included zzso zzso input and zzso cerebral zzso the distribution volume of zzso zzso was calculated in various regions of interest by zzso curve zzso Additionally, zzso kinetic analysis was applied for zzso zzso of zzso and data analysis was performed by statistical zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso was associated with a reduced zzso in widespread areas of the cerebral cortex, including the bilateral zzso and zzso areas, the left zzso border areas, and the left marginal cortical zzso 

zzso in zzso integrity in the cerebral zzso might determine whether patients with zzso become symptomatic or zzso
