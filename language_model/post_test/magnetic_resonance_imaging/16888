In two zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso using tasks with different zzso versus zzso recognition zzso measured the responses to the social value of zzso The face stimuli were produced by a zzso model of face evaluation that reduces multiple social evaluations to two zzso dimensions of zzso and power zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso The functional basis of face zzso Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, zzso 105, zzso zzso Independent of the task, the response within regions of the zzso zzso and lateral prefrontal zzso was sensitive to the zzso dimension, with larger responses to zzso zzso Additionally, there were extensive zzso responses in the zzso zzso and zzso amygdala, with larger responses to faces at the extremes of the face zzso zzso than faces in the zzso In all these regions, zzso avoidance decisions correlated with brain responses, with faces more likely to be avoided evoking stronger zzso The findings suggest that both explicit and implicit face evaluation engage multiple brain regions involved in attention, zzso and decision zzso
