Extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso children attaining school age and adolescence often have problems with executive functions such as working memory and selective zzso Our aim was to investigate a hypothesized difference in blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso during a selective zzso memory task in zzso children as compared with zzso zzso 

A regional cohort of 28 zzso children and 28 zzso controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanning at 11 y of age while performing a combined zzso zzso zzso Group differences in zzso zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso zzso 8 analysis software package, and reaction times zzso and response accuracy zzso were compared in a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso pattern in the zzso group involved the same areas zzso zzso and zzso zzso but all areas displayed significantly less zzso than those in the control group, particularly when the cognitive load was zzso The zzso results corresponded with the zzso data in that the zzso group had significantly fewer correct zzso No group difference was found regarding zzso 

Children born zzso displayed reduced working memory and selective attention capacity as compared with zzso zzso These zzso had zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso in areas responsible for online stimulus monitoring, working memory, and cognitive zzso
