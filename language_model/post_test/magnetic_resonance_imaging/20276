The treatment of isolated liver zzso has become a rapidly developing field with many new, technically advanced zzso Here we present the therapeutic efficacy of a robotic zzso for local control of liver zzso from solid zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso to the liver, not qualifying for surgery, were treated with zzso zzso zzso that used robotic zzso real-time tumor zzso All zzso zzso had to be zzso In a prospective analysis, follow-up was performed by magnetic resonance imaging scanning zzso after the treatment, and subsequently at zzso intervals to evaluate local zzso For inclusion into the zzso treatment zzso tumor volumes had to be zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 65 zzso with a total of 54 target zzso were zzso Single zzso were treated in 23 patients and multiple targets in 13 zzso zzso originated from colon cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso pancreatic cancer zzso breast cancer zzso and others zzso Four zzso were of primary liver origin zzso zzso and zzso zzso Median tumor volume was zzso zzso zzso The median follow-up was zzso zzso The disease of 25 patients zzso showed complete or partial local response, 6 patients zzso had stable zzso and 5 patients zzso experienced local zzso Grade 2-4 adverse events due to radiation treatment were not zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso real-time tumor tracking of liver zzso is a new and promising approach for patients with disease that is not eligible for surgical zzso and might enhance the possibilities of multidisciplinary zzso treatment zzso
