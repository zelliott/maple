zzso in the human muscular system makes it challenging to assess age-related changes in muscle mechanical properties in zzso as ethical considerations prohibit direct muscle force zzso We overcame this by using a hybrid approach that combined magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging, zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso to obtain zzso estimates of the mechanical properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscles from young and older zzso We hypothesized that older subjects would have lower zzso zzso forces, slower zzso and stiffer elastic zzso and that zzso muscle properties would give more accurate joint zzso predictions compared to generic zzso Unknown muscle model parameters were obtained by minimizing the difference between simulated and actual subject zzso histories under both zzso and zzso zzso The resulting zzso models showed zzso and zzso differences, with older adults displaying reduced zzso zzso forces, slower zzso and altered zzso properties and stiffer zzso zzso anterior was least affected by zzso zzso models gave good predictions of experimental concentric zzso histories zzso zzso but were less accurate for eccentric zzso With generic muscle properties prediction errors were about twice as zzso For maximum zzso power, musculoskeletal models should be tailored to individual zzso
