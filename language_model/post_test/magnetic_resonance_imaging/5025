Recent theoretical perspectives have suggested that the function of the human zzso like its zzso counterpart, may be best characterized in terms of its information processing zzso In this study, we use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, zzso pattern analysis, and a simple decision making task, to test specific hypotheses concerning the role of the zzso zzso lobe zzso in scene zzso We observed that while information that enabled two highly similar scenes to be distinguished was widely distributed throughout the zzso more distinct scene representations were present in the zzso consistent with its role in performing pattern zzso As well as viewing the two similar scenes, during scanning participants also viewed morphed scenes that spanned a zzso between the original two zzso We found that patterns of zzso activity during zzso trials, even when zzso zzso were held entirely constant zzso in 50% zzso zzso showed a robust relationship with zzso choices in the decision zzso Our findings provide evidence for a specific zzso role for the zzso in sustaining detailed representations of complex scenes, and shed new light on how the information processing capacities of the zzso may influence the decision making zzso
