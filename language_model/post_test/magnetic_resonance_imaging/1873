To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the diagnosis of clinically suspected zzso zzso deficits of the zzso 

A total of 158 consecutive patients presenting with acute signs of zzso dysfunction were investigated using zzso diffusion weighted zzso within 24 hours of the onset of zzso High resolution zzso and zzso weighted imaging was performed as a follow up after a median of six zzso 

Fourteen of the 158 patients had a complete clinical recovery within 24 hours zzso zzso attack zzso and 19 patients recovered in less than one week zzso zzso neurological deficit zzso zzso weighted zzso showed acute zzso deficits in zzso of patients with transient neurological zzso The detection rate seemed to be higher in patients with longer lasting symptoms, but the difference between patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso 

zzso weighted zzso is a sensitive indicator of acute zzso zzso deficits even in patients with zzso neurological zzso Early identification of patients with zzso and increased risk of stroke may influence acute management and improve patient zzso
