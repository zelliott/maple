zzso tissue adaptation, including the development of zzso zzso into bones, is widely believed to be related to zzso intermittent load and stress zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, are generally believed deleterious in tissue zzso Using serial zzso in a natural human experiment zzso and corrective casting of infant zzso we have observed casting produces two zzso zzso the well recognized change in relative positions of the zzso zzso zzso a newly recognized immediate shape change in the zzso These changes seemingly enhance the rate of growth of the zzso and of the zzso zzso The shape change or deformation in the zzso would occur as a result of zzso in the zzso and directions of loading from soft tissue attachments and muscle activity and would necessarily be associated with changes in the stress states within the zzso and, when present, the zzso zzso Given the known role of load and stress history in tissue adaptation, we zzso the reduced stress histories influence the enhanced growth zzso These observations contradict some current theories of tissue adaptation since static, rather than dynamic stresses play a crucial role in accelerating the growth and development of zzso in the infant zzso
