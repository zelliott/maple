A novel zzso neural network based zzso for automatic adjustment of display window zzso and center for a wide range of magnetic resonance zzso images is presented in this zzso The zzso consists of a feature generator utilizing both zzso zzso and compact spatial statistical information zzso from a MR image, a competitive layer based neural network for zzso MR images into different zzso two pairs of a zzso basis function zzso network and a zzso linear zzso for each zzso as well as a data fusion process using estimates from both zzso to zzso the final display zzso Both zzso can adapt to new kinds of MR images simply by training them with those images, which make the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso based zzso performs very well for images that are similar to those in the training data zzso The zzso linear zzso provides reasonable zzso for a wide range of images that may not be included in the training data zzso The data fusion step makes the final zzso of the display parameters accurate for trained images and robust for the unknown zzso The zzso has been tested on a wide range of MR images and has shown satisfactory zzso
