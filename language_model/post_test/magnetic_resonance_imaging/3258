Among zzso smokers, smoking zzso zzso multiple cognitive and affective processes including conflict resolution and emotional information processing zzso However, the zzso basis of zzso effects on resolving emotional interference on zzso remains largely zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to investigate smoking zzso effects on zzso zzso 

Smokers zzso underwent zzso while performing an affective zzso task zzso over two zzso once following zzso zzso and once following smoking as zzso The zzso includes trials that serially present zzso or zzso zzso zzso bracketed by neutral or negative emotional zzso and zzso emotional image zzso zzso analyses were conducted using a statistical threshold of zzso cluster zzso 

Smoking zzso increased zzso zzso response in the right middle frontal and zzso anterior zzso zzso Moreover, zzso negative affect was associated with less zzso in zzso regions during negative emotional information zzso zzso during zzso trials, negative affect predicted greater zzso in frontal regions during negative, but not neutral emotional zzso zzso 

zzso in the frontal executive control network during smoking zzso may represent a need to recruit additional executive resources to meet task zzso Moreover, zzso negative affect may disrupt cognitive control neural zzso during zzso and place additional demands on frontal executive neural resources during cognitive demands when presented with emotionally distracting zzso
