zzso fast zzso shot zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso allows single shot studies of the human heart within measuring times of about zzso zzso depending on the data zzso In contrast to conventional zzso zzso zzso applications acquire data during the approach to steady zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso behavior of the signal is given for the ideal case of a zzso slice zzso In a second step, realistic slice profiles assuming zzso zzso zzso were taken into account by means of a zzso solution of the Bloch zzso It turns out that the signal strength and the resulting image intensity is considerably higher than may be expected from zzso zzso zzso zzso flip angles depend on the number of zzso zzso Assuming long zzso relaxation times as, for example, encountered in muscle and brain tissue and repetition times of 5 zzso or less, optimum flip angles are 12 zzso zzso The use of even higher flip angles zzso than or equal to 20 zzso causes heavily distorted slice profiles and a dynamic increase of the effective slice zzso Flip angles of the order of the Ernst angle (6 zzso zzso to zzso conditions and lead to considerable signal zzso The theoretical results are confirmed by zzso zzso zzso studies of the human heart using a zzso T zzso system zzso zzso
