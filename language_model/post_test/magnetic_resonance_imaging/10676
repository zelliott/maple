Only few zzso zzso small vessel diseases of the brain zzso have been reported so zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the most frequent of zzso zzso we report a family affected by a zzso distinct from zzso 

After the occurrence of a small deep zzso associated with white matter zzso both in a 46-year-old man and in his 52-year-old sister, clinical and zzso investigations were conducted in 13 of their relatives originating from zzso Other investigations included zzso skin biopsy zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the 23 zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso a zzso locus zzso zzso 

zzso white matter zzso were observed on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in six zzso In contrast with zzso results in the father and paternal uncle of the zzso who were zzso white matter zzso were extensive in the mother who had no vascular risk zzso zzso data in four zzso family members together with the results in the two initial cases were suggestive of an underlying zzso small vessel disease of the zzso zzso biopsy and zzso gene zzso screening were zzso zzso analysis excluded the zzso zzso 

These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a novel zzso small vessel disease of the brain and that the zzso gene is distinct from zzso
