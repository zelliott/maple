zzso cartilage contributes to transferring enormous loads as zzso as possible from one skeletal segment to the zzso Whether it manages this task when subjected to the high repetitive loading cycles occurring during long-distance running and can remain intact is still the topic of zzso 

To investigate the changes in zzso volumes of the zzso zzso and zzso and lateral zzso after extreme dynamic loading as occurs in long-distance zzso 

Controlled laboratory zzso 

Forty-eight knees of male athletes were studied zzso zzso 14 zzso The subjects ran around a predetermined and precisely measured course zzso 10, 20 zzso the beginning and end of the run being in the magnetic resonance imaging investigation zzso The scan protocol was zzso rest period, first zzso run, zzso zzso and second zzso 

Overall, there were significant reductions in volume zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso There was evidence of significant change after a running distance of 5 zzso A further statistical reduction of the volume could only be demonstrated for the zzso zzso after 10 and 20 zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes show not only zzso volume changes but also an zzso zzso This is the first time that zzso volume changes due to loading have been used as an indicator of the important mechanical contribution that the zzso make to sustaining the knee during repetitive zzso 

On the basis of the results of this study, the authors assume that the cartilage is able to adapt well to the loads caused by zzso
