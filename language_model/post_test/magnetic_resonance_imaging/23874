In this paper we present an approach to making zzso about generic zzso in groups of subjects using zzso In particular we suggest that zzso common to all subjects reflect aspects of functional anatomy that may be zzso of the population from which that group was zzso These zzso can be identified by a conjunction analysis of the zzso effects in which the zzso testing for an zzso are specified separately for each zzso A conjunction is the joint zzso of multiple zzso zzso in this instance, of no zzso in any zzso The motivation behind this use of zzso is that zzso analyses are generally more zzso than equivalent zzso zzso This is because zzso analyses can harness the large degrees of freedom and small zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in responses from subject to zzso when assessing the significance of an estimated zzso The price one pays for the apparent sensitivity of zzso analyses is that the ensuing zzso pertain to, and only to, the subjects zzso However, a conjunction analysis, using a zzso model, allows one to zzso zzso that every subject studied activated and zzso that at least a certain proportion of the population would have shown this zzso The second zzso depends upon a zzso zzso in terms of a confidence region for this zzso This approach retains the sensitivity of zzso analyses when the zzso that only a substantial proportion of the population activates is zzso
