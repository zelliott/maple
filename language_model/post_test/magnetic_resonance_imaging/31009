Von zzso zzso disease is a zzso zzso syndrome mapping to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors have been identified as a zzso manifestation of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso the natural history of inner ear disease in a large population of patients with confirmed or suspected zzso disease and to correlate the clinical features with the zzso zzso 

The authors collated and analyzed clinical and zzso data obtained in patients enrolled in an Institutional Review zzso protocol in which families and individuals affected by zzso disease were zzso These data included results from multidisciplinary history zzso and physical zzso imaging studies, and a battery of zzso zzso One hundred zzso patients were enrolled in the study, 129 with confirmed zzso disease and 46 of their family members in whom test results for zzso disease were negative and who served as zzso zzso patients had zzso tumors that were evident on magnetic resonance zzso three of them had bilateral zzso zzso Hearing loss, often sudden in onset and severe to profound in nature, zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented the primary symptoms of zzso zzso zzso patterns of auditory and zzso dysfunction occurred at different stages of the zzso zzso data showed that 17 of 21 patients with zzso tumors did not have zzso whereas all had zzso disease affecting the zzso all but two had zzso disease affecting the central nervous system, and all but one had disease affecting the zzso zzso revealed 10 zzso zzso zzso eight single zzso zzso and one zzso zzso Although there was no difference in the zzso of hearing loss between zzso symptoms of imbalance and zzso fullness were more common in patients with zzso disease but without imaging evidence of zzso tumor than they were in family members who did not have zzso disease zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tumors are frequently associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso fullness in patients with zzso disease may be an early indication of zzso zzso Patients with zzso disease provide a unique opportunity to examine the effects of specific gene zzso and a discrete zzso process on the human inner zzso The study of zzso tumors in this group also provides a pathological model of zzso function and supplies evidence for a role of the zzso in clinical zzso zzso
