zzso controlled, animal zzso 

To use zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to corroborate invasive studies showing progressive expansion of a zzso zzso during the early hours after spinal zzso trauma and to assess the effect of zzso which blocks zzso channels implicated in post-traumatic zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso 

Adult female zzso rats underwent unilateral impact trauma to the spinal zzso at zzso which produced zzso but not zzso primary zzso In series 1 (six control rats and six administered zzso zzso zzso expansion was characterized using zzso at 1 and zzso after zzso In series 2, zzso zzso size was characterized on zzso tissue sections at zzso zzso zzso and at zzso after trauma zzso control rats and eight administered zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso expanded zzso zzso during the first zzso in control rats, but only zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the areas of zzso zzso on tissue sections at the epicenter showed that zzso expanded zzso zzso during the first zzso in control rats, but only zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment was associated with significantly better neurological function zzso zzso zzso at zzso in both the zzso zzso scores, 9 vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso scores, 12 vs 2; zzso zzso 

zzso is an accurate zzso imaging zzso of zzso expansion and is a sensitive measure of the ability of zzso to reduce zzso zzso
