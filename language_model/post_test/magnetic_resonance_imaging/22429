To demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of zzso two functional prostate magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso into inverse treatment planning for definition and potential zzso of a dominant zzso zzso zzso as a zzso target volume for high-dose zzso boosting with zzso zzso zzso 

In 5 patients, four gold markers were zzso An zzso balloon was inserted for both CT and zzso A zzso volume was defined by zzso and zzso using different prostate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso registration was performed automatically by matching three-dimensional gold marker surface models with the zzso closest point zzso zzso plans, consisting of whole prostate zzso to 70 zzso and a zzso boost to 90 zzso and standard zzso plans, in which the whole prostate was zzso to 78 zzso were zzso The tumor control probability and zzso wall normal tissue complication probability were calculated and compared between the two zzso zzso 

Combined zzso and zzso yielded a clearly defined single zzso volume zzso zzso zzso in all zzso In this small, selected patient population, no differences in tumor control probability were zzso A decrease in the zzso wall normal tissue complication probability was observed in favor of the zzso plan versus the plan with zzso to 78 zzso 

Combined zzso and zzso functional zzso high-dose zzso zzso planned as a boost to 90 zzso is theoretically zzso The preliminary results have indicated that zzso may improve the therapeutic ratio by decreasing the normal tissue complication probability with an unchanged tumor control zzso A larger patient population, with more variations in the number, size, and zzso of the zzso and a feasible mechanism for treatment zzso has to be studied to extend these preliminary tumor control and toxicity zzso
