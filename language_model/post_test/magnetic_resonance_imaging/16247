By magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso bone attrition zzso can be seen in early zzso zzso but the significance of this is zzso We therefore evaluated whether zzso was associated with cartilage loss within the same zzso of the zzso 

The zzso zzso Study is a cohort of individuals who have or are at high risk for knee zzso At baseline and 30 months, zzso knee zzso were graded using the zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso in the 10 zzso of the zzso joint for cartilage zzso and zzso We conducted analyses within a knee to eliminate zzso zzso using an zzso zzso matched zzso approach with the 10 zzso of a person's knee forming a matched zzso Cases within a knee were defined as zzso with cartilage loss, while controls were zzso in that same knee without cartilage zzso We evaluated the association of cartilage loss over 30 months with the presence of baseline zzso in the same zzso within that knee using conditional zzso zzso 

zzso was associated with an odds ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso for cartilage loss in the same zzso compared with zzso without any baseline zzso in our sample of zzso knees from participants, zzso of whom were women, with a mean age of 63 years and a mean body mass index of zzso zzso 

zzso is strongly associated with cartilage loss within the same zzso of a zzso zzso may directly influence zzso cartilage loss or serve as a marker of an area undergoing great zzso stress and in which cartilage loss is zzso
