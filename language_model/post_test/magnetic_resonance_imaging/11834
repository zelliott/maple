In a long-term zzso study of aging in zzso zzso a primary objective has been to determine the effects of aging and caloric restriction zzso on behavioral and neural zzso Through the use of automated devices, locomotor activity can be monitored in the home cages of the zzso Studies completed thus far indicate a clear age-related decline in activity consistent with such observations in many other species, including zzso However, no consistent effects of zzso on activity have been zzso zzso groups of monkeys have also been involved in brain imaging studies, using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies completed thus far reveal a clear age-related decline in the volumes of the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso nucleus, with no change in total brain zzso PET analysis has revealed an age-related decline in the binding potential of zzso zzso receptors in the same brain zzso These results are consistent with findings in zzso Although additional zzso analysis is needed to confirm the present results, it would appear that locomotor activity, volume of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso binding potential provide reliable, zzso zzso of aging in zzso zzso
