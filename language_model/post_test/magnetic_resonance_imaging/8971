The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso in adults by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The secondary objective was to evaluate the morbidity of zzso 

A zzso zzso clinical study with a follow-up time of 12 months was conducted of 10 consecutive patients with the median age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was delivered in an zzso setting in a zzso care zzso academic teaching zzso 

The change in zzso volume after zzso was evaluated with zzso by two zzso independently and blinded to the treatment zzso The morbidity was assessed with a visual analogue scale zzso a questionnaire for the pain medication needed, and inflammatory laboratory zzso zzso and use of pain medication results were compared with those of two earlier cohort groups undergoing conventional zzso with two different techniques at our zzso 

The zzso volume reduced significantly with a median reduction in the total zzso volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso volume, p zzso zzso zzso of the morbidity symptoms and the amount of pain medication needed were significantly lower in the zzso group than in the two historical zzso zzso The laboratory parameters showed a significant zzso 

zzso in adults with zzso zzso zzso zzso is a minimally invasive procedure causing a zzso volume reduction demonstrated by zzso The procedure seems to be associated with acceptable zzso
