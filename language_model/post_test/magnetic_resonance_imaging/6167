Our goal was to zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tract zzso with areas of zzso on functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to acquire useful, highly accurate zzso zzso We investigated the usefulness of the technique and our method of precisely evaluating the depicted zzso in patients with brain zzso 

zzso subjects underwent zzso zzso imaging for anatomical zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso The target point for zzso was placed within activated areas in the primary motor area on zzso and the seed point was placed in the cerebral zzso zzso was depicted with the seed and target zzso We examined the precision of zzso using this method by assessing the zzso relationship of depicted zzso of the upper and lower zzso in the zzso limb of the internal zzso 

zzso was depicted in 18 of 19 cases of the upper zzso and in 12 of 19 cases of the lower zzso In the evaluation of precision, zzso reflected the zzso limb of the internal capsule in all zzso In terms of the zzso relationship of zzso nine of 12 cases showed that fibers in the upper zzso passed in front of fibers in the lower zzso 

This technique allows depiction of zzso associated with a local brain function in the zzso in patients with brain disease and may be useful for operative zzso Our method of evaluating precision is also likely to prove zzso
