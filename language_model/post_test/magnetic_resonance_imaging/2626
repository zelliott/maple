zzso zzso cells are implicated in regulating and zzso the immune response that occurs within the zzso as part of multiple sclerosis zzso and its animal model experimental zzso zzso zzso The peripheral zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso We examined the utility of using in zzso and in zzso zzso binding to the zzso as a measure of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a combined zzso and zzso approach to spinal zzso and brain zzso from mice with zzso we found a correlation at sites of inflammatory zzso between zzso binding and zzso for the activated zzso marker zzso In zzso zzso zzso binding correlated with sites of zzso for the zzso marker zzso at the edges of chronic active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso showed zzso zzso only at sites of active zzso zzso defined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Our results indicate the potential to develop markers suitable for both in zzso and in zzso use, which will serve to help correlate zzso and functional properties of cells which participate in disease or injury responses within the zzso
