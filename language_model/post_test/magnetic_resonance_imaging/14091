To zzso determine the value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso with flow zzso in the portal vein for the follow-up of patients with zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso were evaluated with MR of the liver zzso and zzso of flow in the portal zzso MR examinations were correlated with zzso zzso and conventional zzso including measurement of the portal pressure zzso zzso In cases of zzso zzso zzso additional examinations with zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

MR flow zzso in the portal vein correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas no correlation of both methods with the zzso was zzso No threshold zzso in the portal vein could be determined to predict shunt zzso All shunt zzso zzso zzso 5) were diagnosed correctly by zzso Thirty zzso before and after successful zzso interventions revealed a significant increase in portal flow zzso and a significant decrease of the zzso zzso resonance images enabled a reliable detection of procedural complications zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extra and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 each) and newly occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) in the follow-up zzso 

zzso resonance imaging in the follow-up of zzso enables a zzso assessment of the liver and an accurate zzso zzso but is not suited to predict shunt dysfunction as a single zzso
