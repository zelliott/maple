To compare the sensitivity of zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso focus in patients with medically intractable complex partial zzso zzso 

zzso analysis was performed on patients with zzso who underwent anterior zzso zzso from January 1993 zzso when PET became available to us for clinical studies at the Indiana University Medical zzso There were 38 female and 29 male patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso 10 to zzso years of age zzso 31) and duration of their zzso from zzso years zzso zzso zzso PET was evaluated for evidence of focal zzso and zzso zzso for focal zzso zzso zzso or zzso by visual zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies were obtained in 36 patients with zzso PET showed zzso zzso in 30 and questionable zzso in an additional two zzso zzso zzso correctly localized the seizure focus in 27 patients by demonstrating zzso zzso whereas in one the zzso was falsely zzso In an additional seven patients the zzso zzso provided probable zzso by demonstrating zzso zzso in the appropriate zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso PET was zzso and zzso respectively, the difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, P zzso zzso In six of the 36 patients the two tests were complementary to each other in providing zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso PET are equally sensitive and reliable techniques in zzso the zzso focus in patients with zzso They play a critical role in providing zzso in zzso negative patients allowing surgical zzso to be undertaken in many without additional invasive zzso zzso
