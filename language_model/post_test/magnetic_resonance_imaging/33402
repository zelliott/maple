With a newly developed magnetic resonance zzso technique for blood flow zzso qualitative and quantitative information on both flow volume and flow zzso in the great vessels can be zzso MR flow zzso is performed with a zzso MR sequence with high zzso resolution enabling zzso at frequent intervals throughout the cardiac zzso MR flow zzso uses the phase rather than the zzso of the MR signal to reconstruct the zzso These images, often referred to as MR zzso maps or zzso zzso MR images, are two-dimensional displays of flow zzso From these zzso zzso zzso and volume flow data can be zzso Previous validation experiments have demonstrated the accuracy of MR zzso zzso and this technique is now being applied successfully in several clinical zzso MR zzso mapping may be of considerable value when zzso zzso results are unsatisfactory or zzso particularly because MR is suited for the analysis of zzso flow and complex flow zzso Among the vastly growing number of clinical cardiovascular applications that have been reported are the great arteries and zzso coronary vessels, zzso disease, and the abdominal and peripheral zzso These items are zzso and some aspects of the technique that need improvement are zzso
