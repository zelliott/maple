zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic hybrids were zzso by a zzso zzso The reaction temperature significantly affected the structure of the zzso zzso hybrids, which varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso coated on the zzso at zzso to zzso zzso zzso particles threaded by zzso and forming zzso zzso at zzso Based on the zzso property at room temperature and high zzso the zzso hybrids prepared at zzso zzso were further investigated for biomedical applications, which showed a high zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso solutions, a significant negative contrast enhancement effect on cancer cells and, more importantly, low zzso and negligible zzso zzso The zzso drug zzso zzso can be loaded onto the hybrids and subsequently released in a sustained and zzso zzso The zzso hybrids exhibited notable zzso to zzso cancer cells due to the zzso release of zzso These results suggest that zzso hybrids may be used as both effective magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and zzso drug delivery systems for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and zzso
