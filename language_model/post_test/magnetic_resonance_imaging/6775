To describe magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in patients with suspected zzso Turner syndrome and to emphasize the value of an additional whole body MR scan to improve specificity of this zzso 

Three patients with proven zzso Turner syndrome referred for conventional zzso of the shoulder zzso and additional whole body zzso zzso were included for zzso 

In each case, imaging revealed zzso in the muscles of the shoulder zzso Whole body zzso zzso scan confirmed localized unilateral changes in each case improving specificity and confidence in the diagnosis of zzso Turner syndrome in each zzso 

Whole body zzso MR imaging is a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with suspected zzso Turner zzso zzso of the brain, neck, zzso zzso and zzso zzso at whole body imaging allows differentiation from zzso and elimination of additional causes of shoulder zzso pain and weakness including gross zzso in the brain, neck, and zzso zzso by a single zzso zzso
