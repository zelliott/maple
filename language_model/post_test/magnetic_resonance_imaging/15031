To compare the usefulness of brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso in predicting the conversion of possible zzso with zzso bodies zzso to probable zzso 

We examined 94 patients with possible zzso based on the Consensus zzso for the Clinical Diagnosis of zzso by zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After 1 year of zzso 33 of 94 patients met the criteria for probable zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were tested as zzso of the conversion from possible zzso to probable zzso A receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis was zzso 

The areas under the zzso zzso for zzso for predicting the conversion to probable zzso from possible zzso based on the zzso and zzso zzso ratios of blood flow counts were zzso and zzso zzso The areas under the zzso zzso for zzso based on the early heart to zzso zzso ratio, delayed zzso ratio, and zzso rate were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a good predictor of the future conversion of possible zzso to probable zzso
