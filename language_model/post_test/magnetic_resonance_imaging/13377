In this study the exchange between zzso zzso in zzso water zzso and that in a pool with restricted motion zzso was observed in zzso in zzso using zzso zzso transfer zzso Exchange between these two pools was demonstrated by a decrease in the zzso zzso and relaxation times of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso The zzso rate constant for the movement of zzso from zzso to zzso was approximately 1 zzso in kidney and approximately 3 zzso in skeletal muscle in zzso zzso zzso imaging demonstrated that this exchange was tissue specific and generated a novel form of zzso image zzso The extent of exchange between zzso and zzso as well as the zzso correlation of the exchange with relaxation weighted images suggests that this zzso is a major zzso of the observed relaxation properties of water zzso in zzso
