zzso analysis of kinetic magnetic resonance zzso 

To define the prevalence of degenerative cervical zzso in symptomatic patients and to analyze the motion characteristics and influence on the spinal canal at the affected zzso 

When compared with zzso zzso there are few studies evaluating cervical zzso and the prevalence and motion characteristics of cervical zzso are not well zzso 

Four hundred zzso symptomatic patients underwent upright cervical kinetic magnetic resonance images in neutral, zzso and extension zzso zzso displacement and zzso angles were measured in 3 positions using computer analysis zzso zzso was defined as the zzso displacement more than 2 zzso and graded based on the magnitude into 2 groups at each zzso grade 1 zzso zzso grade 2 zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso motion exceeding 3 zzso 

Grade 1 and 2 zzso at a minimum of 1 level were observed with a prevalence of zzso and zzso of all patients, zzso The most affected levels were zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motion was greater in levels with grade 1 as compared with segments without zzso but there was no difference in angular motion between the 3 zzso zzso instability was observed with a prevalence of zzso in grade 2, zzso in grade 1, and zzso in segments without zzso Space available for the zzso at the affected level was decreased and spinal zzso zzso grade was higher in grade 1 and grade 2 as compared with levels without zzso 

zzso zzso of at least 2 zzso was observed in zzso of patients and was most common at zzso and zzso The presence of zzso was associated with increased zzso motion and decreased zzso spinal canal zzso
