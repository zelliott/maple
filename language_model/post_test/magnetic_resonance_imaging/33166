Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and imaging zzso suffer from intrinsic low sensitivity because even strong external magnetic fields of zzso T generate only a small zzso zzso of the sample at room temperature zzso zzso most zzso and zzso applications rely on the detection of molecules at relative high concentration zzso water for imaging of biological zzso or require excessive acquisition zzso This limits our ability to exploit the very useful molecular specificity of zzso signals for many zzso and medical zzso However, novel approaches have emerged in the past few years: zzso of the detected spin species prior to detection inside the zzso magnet can dramatically increase the zzso and therefore allows detection of molecules at much lower concentration zzso Here, we present a method for polarization of a xenon gas mixture zzso zzso zzso zzso He zzso in a compact setup with a zzso zzso signal zzso Modern zzso zzso zzso allow efficient polarization zzso and immediate use of gas mixture even if the noble gas is not separated from the other zzso The zzso apparatus is explained and determination of the achieved spin polarization is demonstrated for performance control of the zzso The zzso gas can be used for void space imaging, including gas flow imaging or diffusion studies at the zzso with other materials zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso signal is extremely sensitive to its molecular environment zzso This enables the option to use it as an zzso contrast agent when dissolved in zzso solution with zzso molecular hosts that temporarily trap the gas zzso zzso detection and zzso indirect detection of such zzso is demonstrated in both zzso and imaging zzso
