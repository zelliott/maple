Children who are less fit reportedly have lower performance on tests of cognitive control and differences in brain zzso This study examined the effect of an exercise intervention on brain function during two cognitive control tasks in overweight zzso 

Participants included 43 zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso children 8- to zzso old zzso zzso who were randomly divided into either an zzso exercise zzso or attention control group zzso Each group was offered a separate zzso after-school program every school day for 8 zzso Before and after the program, all children performed two cognitive control tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso 

Compared to the control group, the exercise group decreased zzso in several regions supporting zzso performance, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortex, and increased zzso in several regions supporting zzso performance, including anterior zzso and superior frontal zzso 

Exercise may zzso impact these two task conditions, or the zzso in which cognitive control tasks were presented may be sensitive to distinct types of brain zzso that show different effects of zzso In sum, exercise appears to alter efficiency or flexible zzso of neural zzso supporting cognitive control in overweight zzso
