zzso is a common symptom affecting about zzso of people over the age of zzso 

To investigate the hypothesis that structural abnormalities of the brain and cervical zzso are more common in dizzy than in zzso zzso 

A zzso study of subjects over the age of 65 with and without zzso 125 dizzy subjects and 86 zzso subjects were recruited from the community through articles in the local zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso of the brain and neck was performed, and was read by a consultant zzso blind to the clinical zzso 

All dizzy subjects and all controls had at least one structural zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso of dizzy subjects and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso At least one white matter zzso was found in zzso of dizzy subjects and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso White matter zzso in the zzso were more common in dizzy than in zzso subjects zzso v zzso p zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the prevalence of zzso zzso cervical zzso facet joint zzso zzso artery zzso or zzso artery zzso between dizzy and zzso zzso 

zzso abnormalities of the brain and neck are common in both dizzy and zzso zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to reveal a specific cause for zzso The observation of more frequent white matter zzso in the zzso in dizzy subjects requires further study to determine whether small vessel changes could cause zzso in older zzso
