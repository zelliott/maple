In a randomized, zzso zzso study 10 subjects were exposed to a simulated altitude of zzso m for 10 h after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic zzso images zzso and diffusion weighted zzso were obtained directly after exposure to altitude under hypoxic zzso Although eight of 10 subjects had moderate to severe acute mountain sickness zzso we found no evidence of cerebral zzso irrespective of the medication zzso Almost all subjects showed a decrease in inner zzso fluid zzso volumes zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso symptoms and fluid zzso However, we found a significantly positive correlation of large zzso zzso zzso volume and more severe zzso after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to severe zzso after high altitude exposure for 10 h is associated with a decreased zzso independent of zzso severity or medication without signs of cerebral zzso
