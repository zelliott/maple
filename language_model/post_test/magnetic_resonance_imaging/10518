Grey matter zzso are commonly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings have shown that zzso activity can be generated within these zzso and also at a distance in the zzso zzso seem to be part of a more complex zzso involving also the surrounding and distant cerebral zzso Blood zzso zzso zzso changes to zzso spikes using continuous zzso and functional zzso zzso can help to understand zzso the mechanisms of zzso in these zzso We studied 14 patients with zzso and zzso using simultaneous recording of zzso zzso was continuously acquired from inside the scanner during 2 h zzso zzso spikes were visually identified in the filtered zzso and each type of spike determined one zzso zzso We looked at positive zzso and negative zzso changes in the zzso zzso Eleven patients had zzso zzso and three band zzso Four patients had more than one type of zzso with a total of 26 zzso zzso We excluded three with less than three zzso and therefore a total of 23 studies (12 with zzso and 11 with band zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in nine studies, with involvement of the zzso or surrounding zzso in six, three of which had zzso distant zzso zzso was also observed in nine studies, with involvement of the zzso and surrounding zzso in four, three of which had zzso distant zzso Band zzso zzso was present in all 11 studies, and always involved the zzso and surrounding cortex, 9 of which had zzso distant zzso zzso was also observed in all 11 studies, with involvement of both the zzso and surrounding cortex, in addition to distant zzso in 5 zzso zzso studies zzso zzso zzso responses in the zzso despite the fact that spikes are generated in the zzso The responses, zzso or zzso had different correlation with the zzso and surrounding or distant cortex, zzso reflecting intense zzso activity, or zzso and zzso a possible distant zzso zzso zzso may become a useful tool to understand the zzso of such zzso
