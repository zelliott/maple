We presented zzso matching and conflicting audiovisual zzso to 10 dyslexic and 10 zzso young adults during zzso volume zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 3 zzso We further assessed zzso between the dyslexic readers' zzso processing abilities, as zzso by zzso test scores, and zzso signal change within the visual cortex, auditory cortex, and zzso zzso Both dyslexic and fluent readers showed increased zzso during observation of zzso conflicting compared to matching zzso within the classical motor speech regions zzso area and the left zzso zzso this zzso difference being more extensive and bilateral in the dyslexic zzso The zzso zzso difference in conflicting zzso matching contrast reached significance in the motor speech regions and in the left inferior zzso zzso with dyslexic readers exhibiting stronger zzso than fluent zzso The dyslexic readers' zzso signal change zzso with their zzso processing abilities within the visual zzso and zzso area, and to a lesser extent within the auditory zzso We suggest these findings as reflecting dyslexic readers' greater use of zzso and visual strategies during phonetic processing of audiovisual speech, possibly to compensate for their difficulties in auditory speech zzso
