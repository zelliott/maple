This study aims at investigating cortical thickness in cluster headache patients as compared with a healthy control zzso 

The zzso of cluster headache is not yet fully zzso although a dysfunction of the zzso has been suggested to be zzso Previous studies in migraine and zzso zzso pain have demonstrated changes in cortical thickness using zzso zzso techniques, but no data have been published on cluster zzso 

We investigated 12 men with episodic cluster headache during a phase without acute headache as well as age and zzso healthy controls using high resolution zzso magnetic resonance imaging acquired at zzso and performed a zzso zzso zzso comparison of cortical thickness between zzso Furthermore, a correlation analysis of disease duration and cortical thickness was zzso 

In comparison with control subjects, we found a reduction of cortical thickness in the angular zzso and the zzso zzso in cluster headache patients zzso to the headache zzso These reductions did not correlate with disease zzso The cortical thickness of an area within the primary sensory zzso correlated with disease zzso 

This study demonstrates zzso in cortical thickness in cluster headache patients suggesting a potential role of cortical structures in cluster headache zzso However, it cannot be determined from this study whether the changes are cause or consequence of the zzso The correlation of cortical thickness with disease duration in the zzso zzso may suggest zzso plasticity in the zzso zzso
