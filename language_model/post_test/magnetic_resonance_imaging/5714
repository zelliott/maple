The aim of this work was to demonstrate the correspondence between a zzso zzso computer model of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with MR data and experimental characterization of action potential propagation in large zzso hearts, ex zzso using optical methods (based on zzso zzso A secondary goal was to use one of these studies to demonstrate an zzso method for regional adjustment of critical model parameters zzso adjustment of the local zzso from the zzso maps obtained via optical zzso There was good agreement between model zzso and experiment using fusion of optical and MR data, and model parameters from previous work in the zzso Specifically, qualitative comparison between zzso and measured zzso maps gave good zzso Adjustment of the zzso zzso within 26 regions fitting data from the current experiments in one heart reduced absolute error in local zzso times by a factor of 3 zzso from 30 to 10 zzso
