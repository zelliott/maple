To evaluate the efficacy of magnetic resonance zzso imaging for the diagnosis of zzso in the diabetic foot by using zzso and zzso studies of the zzso tissue as a standard of zzso 

Thirteen diabetic patients with high clinical suspicion of zzso underwent a total of 15 MR examinations before zzso zzso was made between MR findings and the zzso features of the zzso zzso which included 57 zzso 

zzso signal intensity on the zzso or short inversion time zzso images of the bones was due to zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso bones with increased signal intensity showed only zzso of the zzso The range of signal intensity in zzso overlapped that in zzso but was zzso The use of zzso zzso improved zzso of zzso inflammatory masses, but this contrast material was not useful in distinguishing zzso from zzso 

zzso zzso cannot be reliably distinguished from zzso with MR zzso zzso zzso is of limited zzso Some previously published zzso reports of zzso were most likely due to zzso of the zzso MR imaging is useful in planning surgery of the infected diabetic foot, as it enables reliable distinction between normal and abnormal zzso
