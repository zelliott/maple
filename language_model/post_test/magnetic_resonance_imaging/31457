zzso invasive zzso therapy as local treatment of benign and zzso diseases has received increasing interest in recent zzso Safety and efficacy of the treatment require accurate temperature measurement throughout the zzso zzso zzso temperature monitoring is feasible with magnetic resonance zzso imaging based on zzso MR parameters such as the zzso resonance frequency zzso the diffusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times, zzso transfer, the zzso density, as well as zzso contrast zzso In this article the principles of temperature zzso with these methods are reviewed and their usefulness for monitoring in zzso procedures is zzso Whereas most zzso give a temperature change relative to a baseline condition, zzso contrast agents and zzso imaging can provide absolute temperature zzso The excellent zzso and temperature dependence of the zzso and its near independence of tissue type have made zzso phase mapping methods the preferred choice for many in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging techniques for real-time monitoring with the zzso method are zzso Special attention is paid to acquisition and reconstruction methods for reducing temperature measurement artifacts introduced by tissue motion, which is often unavoidable during in zzso zzso
