A comparison was made of the ability of plain chest zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect and assess the zzso extent of lung cancer in 46 zzso The chest zzso zzso were obtained with a high zzso zzso zzso The CT scans were obtained with a GE zzso machine and the zzso studies with a zzso zzso permanent magnet imaging zzso The primary tumor was well demonstrated by all 3 imaging zzso however, the zzso of zzso was best demonstrated by zzso zzso was superior to zzso and CT for demonstrating zzso involvement in 4 zzso CT and zzso were generally comparable for demonstrating zzso involvement but were superior to zzso In 2 cases, small normal size zzso seen on CT were considered to be a single large abnormal zzso on zzso Because of the paucity of signal from flowing blood, zzso and displacement of vessels were easier to identify with zzso In 1 case, a small zzso zzso was better seen with CT than with zzso or with zzso zzso chest wall involvement in 1 case was not seen by zzso zzso body zzso in another case was seen only by zzso and not by zzso or zzso At present, zzso with its long scanning time, motion degradation of the image, and poor spatial resolution, is inferior to CT for imaging lung zzso For evaluation of zzso extent of lung cancer, CT remains the procedure of choice after performing plain chest zzso
