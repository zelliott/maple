We assessed the diagnostic yield of zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso aspiration zzso biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with invasive breast zzso compared with final zzso zzso by zzso zzso biopsy or by zzso zzso zzso zzso From January 2003 to March 2009, 520 zzso ultrasound examinations and 105 zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies were zzso Compared with final zzso zzso ultrasound zzso aspiration showed positive zzso value of zzso negative zzso value of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso In cases of negative zzso the rate of positive zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso combined with zzso aspiration as appropriate must be included in the zzso zzso of patients considered for zzso zzso biopsy to definitively establish such an indication while minimizing the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging did not improve the zzso zzso
