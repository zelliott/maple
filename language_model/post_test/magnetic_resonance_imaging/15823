Because of their location and biological behavior, zzso cavernous zzso zzso pose a formidable clinical challenge to the zzso The optimal management of these zzso requires considerable zzso zzso zzso the authors reviewed their experience with the management of pediatric zzso zzso at the Hospital for Sick zzso 

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who had received diagnoses of a zzso CM at the Hospital for Sick Children over the past 20 zzso 

Twenty patients were diagnosed with zzso zzso The mean age at diagnosis was zzso zzso zzso years, and the patients included 13 boys and 7 zzso The mean zzso diameter of the CM was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were evenly distributed on the right and left sides of the zzso with 4 zzso 13 zzso and 3 zzso zzso Seven patients underwent surgery for the management of their zzso with a mean age at presentation of zzso years, and a mean CM size of zzso zzso Of note from the surgical group, 2 patients had a family history of zzso 2 zzso were zzso the CM reached a zzso surface in 6 of 7 patients, and 6 of 7 zzso were located on the right zzso The mean age at presentation among the 13 patients in the zzso group was zzso years, and the mean CM size was zzso zzso Seven of these patients had a prior history of radiation for zzso and only 3 had zzso that reached a zzso zzso 

The management of zzso zzso in children is influenced by multiple zzso The majority of patients received conservative management and tended to be zzso with smaller zzso Patients with larger zzso and direct zzso zzso in whom symptoms arose at a younger age were more likely to undergo surgical zzso A history of familial CM was also a predictor for receiving surgical zzso No patients with a prior history of radiation therapy underwent surgery for zzso The presence of multiple zzso seemed to have no impact on the type of management zzso Patients who underwent surgery did suffer morbidity related to the zzso and tended to improve clinically over zzso Conservative management was associated with new deficits arising in children, some of which improved with zzso Consideration of many clinical and zzso parameters is thus prudent when managing the care of children with zzso zzso
