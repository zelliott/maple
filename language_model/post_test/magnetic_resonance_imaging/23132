The last decade has seen considerable discussion regarding a theoretical account of zzso prefrontal zzso zzso function with particular focus on the anterior zzso zzso The proposed theories have included conflict zzso error likelihood zzso volatility monitoring, and several distinct theories of error zzso Arguments for and against particular theories often treat zzso as functionally zzso or at least nearly so, despite some evidence for distinct functional zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to simultaneously contrast multiple effects of error, conflict, and zzso that have been individually construed in support of various zzso We found overlapping yet functionally distinct zzso of zzso with zzso related to dominant error, conflict, and zzso effects successively found along a zzso to zzso zzso within zzso prefrontal zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zone zzso were strongly correlated with the zzso of outcomes suggesting a role in outcome prediction and preparing control systems to deal with anticipated zzso The results as a whole support a resolution of some ongoing debates in that distinct theories may each pertain to corresponding distinct yet overlapping zzso of zzso
