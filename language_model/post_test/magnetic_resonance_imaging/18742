Spinal zzso zzso are rare zzso zzso that may occur either alone or in the context of a complex zzso disorder including typical zzso and zzso zzso The interest of the case of a spinal zzso zzso described here lies in its rare zzso location and in the false mural zzso image on the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso A further distinctive feature is the association with a zzso spinal zzso 

A 28-year-old woman presented with a zzso history of progressive zzso and urinary zzso A magnetic resonance imaging study disclosed a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mural zzso formation on the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso exposed a zzso zzso that had translucent walls and contained a milky zzso No mural zzso were zzso Once the zzso had been emptied, a collateral finding was a zzso that was clearly observed in the anterior spinal zzso The zzso diagnosis was a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso found on the zzso scan was attributed to zzso clots deposited at the bottom of the zzso 

This case report demonstrates that zzso zzso can vary widely in zzso appearance, depending on the contents of the zzso These differences become especially important if the associated zzso are lacking and the zzso diagnosis rests on magnetic resonance imaging scan appearance zzso
