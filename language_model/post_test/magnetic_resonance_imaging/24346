A knowledge of the exact cerebral zzso territory which is supplied by any artery is of great importance in the understanding and diagnosis of cerebrovascular zzso The development and zzso of territorial zzso spin labeling zzso zzso techniques in the past two decades have made it possible to zzso and determine the cerebral zzso territories in individual patients and, more importantly, to do so without contrast agents or otherwise invasive zzso This review provides an overview of the development of zzso techniques that aim to zzso the general cerebral zzso territories or the territory of a specific artery of zzso The first efforts of zzso with zzso continuous and zzso techniques are summarized and subsequent clinical studies using zzso are zzso In the healthy population, the zzso territories of the zzso arteries are highly zzso This high zzso requires special consideration in specific patient groups, such as patients with cerebrovascular disease, stroke, zzso disease of the large arteries and zzso zzso In the past, zzso zzso with selective contrast injection was the only available method to zzso the cerebral zzso territories in zzso Several zzso methods, sometimes referred to as regional zzso imaging, are now available that can easily be combined with conventional brain zzso examinations to show the relationship between the cerebral zzso territories, vascular anatomy and brain zzso or other zzso Increased availability of zzso techniques on clinical zzso scanners will allow zzso and other clinicians to gain further knowledge of the relationship between zzso and patient diagnosis and zzso Treatment decisions, such as surgical zzso may, in the near future, be guided by information provided by zzso zzso in close correlation with structural zzso and quantitative zzso zzso
