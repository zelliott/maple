zzso age is associated with significant declines on zzso tasks that demand substantial mental zzso zzso imaging studies of mental abilities indicate that older adults faced with cognitive challenges tend to activate more regions, particularly zzso than their younger counterparts, and that this recruitment of additional regions may reflect an attempt to compensate for inefficiency in cortical zzso The neural basis of emotion processing in aging has received little attention, and the goal of the present study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine the influence of age on facial emotion processing and zzso in cortical and zzso zzso Participants zzso old and eight young zzso viewed facial displays of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, zzso and neutrality in alternating blocks of emotion and age zzso We predicted that in response to an emotion discrimination task, older adults would demonstrate increased use of frontal regions relative to younger adults, perhaps combined with diminished use of regions recruited by younger adults, such as zzso zzso During the emotion discrimination task, young participants zzso zzso frontal and zzso regions, whereas older participants activated zzso zzso and frontal zzso A direct comparison between emotion and age discrimination revealed that while younger adults activated the zzso and surrounding zzso regions, older adults activated left frontal zzso The results of this study suggest that older adults may rely on different cortical networks to perceive emotional facial expressions than do their younger zzso
