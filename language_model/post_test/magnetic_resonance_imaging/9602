Studies using various zzso techniques have shown that a zzso concentration zzso exists in the zzso zzso Because this concentration is higher in the core relative to the lens zzso a zzso in zzso index is established in the zzso To investigate how the zzso concentration profile is zzso bovine zzso were incubated in different solutions, and changes in zzso concentration ratio monitored using zzso density weighted zzso imaging in the absence and presence of heavy water zzso zzso incubated in artificial zzso humor zzso maintained the steady state zzso concentration zzso but zzso zzso in high zzso zzso zzso or low temperature zzso zzso caused a collapse of the zzso due to a rise in water content in the core of the zzso To zzso water zzso zzso were incubated in zzso which acts as a contrast zzso zzso in zzso and low zzso dramatically slowed the movement of zzso into the core but did not affect the movement of zzso into the outer zzso zzso seemed to zzso enter the lens zzso at the anterior and zzso poles before moving zzso toward the equatorial zzso This zzso of zzso influx into the lens zzso was abolished by zzso zzso in high zzso or low zzso and resulted in zzso influx of zzso into the outer zzso Taken together, our results show that the zzso concentration ratio is actively maintained in the core of the lens and that water zzso zzso enter the lens at the zzso
