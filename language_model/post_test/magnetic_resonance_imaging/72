Earlier studies in zzso zzso and zzso zzso twins showed genetic zzso on zzso determined heart zzso However, cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso is more precise and zzso We performed a twin study relying on zzso focusing on left zzso zzso mass and zzso muscle, since there are no genetic reports on this zzso 

We measured left heart dimensions of 25 healthy twin pairs with a zzso MR zzso zzso with the mass, zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis and tests for genetic influences shared between cardiac zzso We found that zzso zzso estimates zzso zzso zzso substantially exceeded estimates based on zzso We also found significant genetic influence on zzso muscle mass zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso muscle mass revealed significant genetic influences shared by both zzso zzso correlation zzso and suggested an additional genetic component specific to zzso zzso We observed correlations between body mass index, surface area, and zzso blood pressure with cardiac dimensions, even in this small zzso Environmental influences were relevant as well, indicating zzso influences on zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso 

zzso magnetic zzso even with few subjects, allows a genetic assessment of cardiac structures that cannot be attained with zzso zzso fore unappreciated relationships can be uncovered by this zzso
