The biology of prostate cancer may be influenced by the index zzso The definition of index zzso volume is important for appropriate decision making, especially for image guided focal zzso We determined the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for determining index tumor volume compared with volumes derived from zzso 

We evaluated 135 patients zzso age zzso zzso with a mean prostate specific zzso of zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and subsequent radical zzso Index tumor volume was determined zzso and independently by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso The zzso formula was applied to determine zzso tumor volume, whereas manual tumor zzso was used to determine magnetic resonance tumor zzso zzso tumor volume was correlated with age and prostate specific zzso whereas magnetic resonance tumor volume involved zzso correlation and linear zzso zzso In addition, the zzso power of magnetic resonance tumor volume, prostate specific zzso and age for zzso zzso tumor volume zzso than zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso The same analysis was also conducted for the zzso shrinkage factor corrected zzso data zzso 

There was a positive correlation between zzso tumor volume and magnetic resonance tumor volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso but a weak correlation between prostate specific zzso and zzso tumor volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso On linear zzso analysis zzso tumor volume and magnetic resonance tumor volume were correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso On zzso analysis zzso values for magnetic resonance tumor volume, prostate specific zzso and age in zzso tumors larger than zzso zzso at zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were found in the analysis with shrinkage factor corrected tumor volumes at zzso 

zzso resonance imaging can accurately estimate index tumor volume as determined by zzso zzso resonance imaging has better accuracy in predicting zzso tumor volume in tumors larger than zzso zzso than prostate specific zzso and zzso Index tumor volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in planning treatment, specifically in identifying tumor margins for image guided focal therapy and possibly selecting better active surveillance zzso
