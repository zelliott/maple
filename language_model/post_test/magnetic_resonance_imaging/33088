In international guidelines, basic restriction limits on the exposure of humans to zzso magnetic and electric fields are set with the objective of preventing the generation of zzso visual sensations of flashing light not caused by zzso Measured data on zzso zzso zzso caused by a zzso induced electric field on the zzso are available from volunteer zzso However, there is no simple way for determining the retinal threshold electric field or current density from the measured threshold magnetic flux zzso In this study, the experimental field zzso of a previous study, in which zzso were generated in volunteers by exposing their heads to a magnetic field between the poles of an zzso is zzso zzso The zzso method is used for determining the induced electric field and current in five different zzso anatomical models of the zzso The direction of the induced current density on the zzso is zzso zzso to the zzso and the maximum induced current density is observed at the superior and inferior sides of the zzso which agrees with literature data on the location of zzso at the periphery of the visual zzso On the basis of zzso data, the zzso retinal threshold current density for zzso at 20 zzso can be estimated as 10 zzso zzso zzso to + zzso depending on the anatomical zzso this current density zzso to an induced zzso current of 14 zzso zzso to + zzso and about zzso of this zzso current flows through each zzso The zzso basic restriction limit for the induced electric field in the case of occupational exposure is not exceeded until the magnetic flux density is about two to three times the measured threshold for zzso so the basic restriction limit does not seem to be zzso However, the reasons for the zzso are purely zzso removal of the highest zzso of electric field values by taking the zzso zzso as recommended by the zzso leads to the zzso of the induced electric field, and there are difficulties in applying the basic restriction limit for the retinal electric zzso
