Progressive zzso zzso zzso is an zzso degenerative zzso characterized by zzso instability, zzso gaze zzso and frontal zzso Recent imaging studies revealed that the volume of zzso zzso and zzso were reduced in zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso studies demonstrated a zzso involvement in zzso showing an impairment of functional connectivity between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso primary motor zzso zzso zzso brain zzso 

To investigate the plasticity of the zzso circuits in ten zzso patients after two-week course of zzso intermittent zzso burst stimulation zzso a form of repetitive zzso 

Before and after the zzso sessions we measured functional connectivity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso short zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and short zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also performed resting state functional magnetic resonance zzso and we administered clinical rating scale zzso 

At baseline zzso patients had decreased efficiency of zzso zzso and zzso in comparison to zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso zzso increased the deficient functional zzso connectivity as assessed by zzso No effect was seen for zzso and zzso zzso Following zzso there was an increased signal in the head of the zzso nucleus zzso as shown by zzso Moreover, zzso showed an improvement of zzso in all zzso 

zzso enhanced functional connectivity between the zzso hemisphere, the zzso nucleus and the cortex, that was paralleled by some clinical zzso Future randomized, zzso controlled studies are warranted to support the clinical efficacy of this zzso
