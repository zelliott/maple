Remembering is more than an zzso of a memory zzso As retrieval cues are often not uniquely related to one specific memory, cognitive control should come into play to guide selective memory retrieval by focusing on relevant while ignoring irrelevant zzso Here, we investigated, by means of zzso and zzso how the memory system deals with retrieval interference arising when retrieval cues are associated with two material types zzso and spatial zzso but only one is zzso The topography of slow zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signal in zzso storage areas indicated that in such situations not only the relevant but also the irrelevant material becomes zzso This results in retrieval interference that triggers control processes zzso by the zzso and lateral zzso which are presumably involved in zzso target representations by boosting the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso conflict was found to be zzso from response conflict that arises when the relevant and irrelevant materials imply different zzso The two types of conflict show different zzso in the zzso frontal cortex, supporting the claim of zzso prefrontal control zzso
