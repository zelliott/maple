Assessment of fluid volumes and flow through the small zzso has in the past only been possible by means of invasive zzso studies on human zzso zzso very likely zzso gut zzso and stimulates zzso 

The aim of this study was to zzso the new technique of zzso magnetic resonance imaging in order to zzso zzso the changing volume of water in the small zzso zzso 200 zzso of test solution was zzso and water volume assessed using a zzso scanning technique on 3 separate zzso The solutions were pure water, pure water plus zzso or 10 g of zzso These were taken on separate days by 8 healthy male zzso zzso of interest were constructed in the area of the lower pelvis excluding zzso zzso 

The water content of the lower small zzso did not change significantly over the 4 hours after the control zzso By contrast after both zzso solutions there was an increase in the amount of water in the zzso zzso as assessed by the area under the curve of the volume time profile zzso 51 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 115 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L Trend test showed that the trend for the volume to increase with increasing zzso concentration to be statistically significant at the zzso level zzso zzso zzso 

The study highlights the potential of zzso magnetic resonance imaging to zzso changes in gastrointestinal physiology in a zzso zzso
