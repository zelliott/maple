To investigate the distribution of MR findings in the zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

We blindly evaluated MR scans for zzso and signal changes occurring in the amygdala, zzso head, zzso body, and zzso tail in 57 consecutive patients with zzso sclerosis proved by zzso zzso 

Regional zzso or signal change was present in zzso zzso zzso was detected in 52 patients, occurring in the zzso in 7 zzso zzso head in 29 zzso zzso body in 50 zzso and zzso tail in 35 zzso zzso signal on zzso images was observed in 49 patients and involved the zzso in 2 zzso zzso head in 22 zzso zzso body in 46 zzso and zzso tail in 28 zzso Thirty patients zzso had abnormal MR findings distributed through the entire zzso zzso 25 zzso had regional rather than widespread involvement of zzso structures, and 2 zzso had no MR zzso 

Signal and volume changes associated with zzso sclerosis affect the entire zzso in most zzso However, a substantial number of patients have MR abnormalities that are zzso involving only portions of the zzso and zzso The most frequently affected region was the zzso zzso These findings can have important implications for surgery and quantitative image analysis, if the seizure generator is related to MR zzso
