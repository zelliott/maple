The chronic zzso zzso defining zzso zzso Type I zzso is thought to result from overcrowding of a normally developing zzso within a zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso The goals in the present study were to zzso the zzso zzso in a group of patients with zzso and to discuss new zzso aspects according to which part of the zzso bone was zzso 

The authors zzso examined a group of 17 patients with zzso zzso of zzso and neural structures of the zzso were made on MR images of the zzso The results were compared with findings in 30 healthy controls by using the zzso zzso 

zzso of the neural structures did not differ between the 2 groups of zzso The mean length of the zzso was significantly shorter in the zzso group zzso zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso p zzso zzso The mean diameter of the zzso zzso was larger in the zzso group, but this difference was not statistically zzso The dimensions of the zzso and the mean angle of the zzso zzso were identical in the 2 zzso 

Data in this study support the idea that zzso zzso is the main cause of overcrowding within the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso feature of the zzso shallow zzso and could proceed from a zzso disorder of the zzso zzso of the zzso plate or occur later in the infancy because of premature zzso of the zzso zzso
