zzso zzso (or tone zzso is a lifelong disability that prevents otherwise zzso individuals from developing basic musical zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso is due to a severe deficit in pitch processing, but very little is known about the neural zzso of this zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the structural neural zzso of zzso zzso To this aim, zzso zzso was used to detect brain anatomical differences in zzso individuals relative to musically intact controls, by zzso zzso magnetic resonance images from two independent samples of zzso The results were consistent across samples in highlighting a reduction in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal zzso of zzso zzso This anatomical anomaly was correlated with performance on zzso musical zzso The results are consistent with zzso findings implicating right inferior frontal regions in musical pitch zzso and melodic pitch zzso We conceive the present results as a consequence of an impoverished communication in a zzso network involving the inferior frontal zzso and the right auditory zzso Moreover, the data point to the integrity of white matter tracts in right frontal brain areas as being key in acquiring normal musical zzso
