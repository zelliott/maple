The zzso brow lift technique relies on brow zzso and often soft fixation to the underlying zzso While the zzso brow lift has been used zzso there are anecdotal reports of zzso fluid zzso We sought to measure zzso thickness to improve the safety of zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of zzso weighted zzso of the face of 28 zzso zzso thickness was measured on 10 zzso planes, from 3 zzso zzso anterior to 6 zzso zzso to zzso zzso Fifteen points were measured on each zzso plane, starting in the zzso and extending zzso for 7 zzso There were a total of 150 zzso zzso per patient, covering the surface area used in zzso brow zzso zzso comparison was performed using analysis of zzso 

zzso thickness ranged from zzso to zzso with a mean of zzso The skull was thickest 2-4 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and thinnest zzso anterior to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso as it extends zzso with an average thickness of zzso at seven zzso from zzso Average skull thickness for males was zzso versus zzso in zzso There was no relationship between age and skull zzso 

zzso thickness increases zzso and zzso and is larger for females compared with their male zzso Given the risk of zzso zzso surgeons need to be aware of how zzso thickness varies by location along the zzso
