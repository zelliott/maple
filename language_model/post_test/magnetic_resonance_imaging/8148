zzso E syndrome is a zzso disorder with abnormalities of the zzso zzso zzso and skeletal tissue zzso Central nervous system abnormalities have not been considered a feature of zzso E zzso We aimed to determine whether central nervous system abnormalities detected on brain zzso exist in zzso E syndrome and to characterize any identified zzso 

Fifty patients aged from 3 to 52 years zzso 24 zzso with established diagnoses of zzso E syndrome had zzso of the brain as part of an zzso E syndrome natural history zzso zzso were zzso measured, zzso and zzso Patient charts were reviewed for zzso findings and blood pressure zzso 

zzso brain zzso exhibiting high signal zzso on zzso inversion recovery and on zzso techniques were found in 35 of the 50 zzso The focal zzso were predominantly in the white matter of the cerebral zzso and the number ranged from 2 to zzso The zzso occurred more frequently in adults than in children, and no association with elevated blood pressure was zzso Five patients had zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso were found in 9 of 50 zzso Two patients had infectious complications presenting on zzso as zzso in 1 patient and as a zzso zzso in the zzso both were found on autopsy to be zzso zzso abnormalities were present in 1 patient with a zzso zzso the 2 patients with infectious zzso and in 1 patient with a zzso zzso secondary to a berry zzso 

Central nervous system abnormalities are common in zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso not appreciated zzso represent a prominent feature of this rare disease that may assist in zzso The zzso and clinical implications of these abnormalities remain to be zzso
