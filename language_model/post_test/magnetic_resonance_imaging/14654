zzso muscle asymmetry in zzso area zzso and composition have been associated with low back pain and zzso However, substantial zzso muscle asymmetry also has been reported in men who were zzso and little is known about other factors influencing zzso 

The goal of this study was to identify zzso zzso and constitutional factors associated with zzso muscle zzso 

A zzso study of 202 adult male twins was zzso 

Data were collected through a structured interview, physical examination, and magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso muscle zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso to total zzso were obtained from zzso zzso images at zzso and zzso 

In multivariable zzso greater asymmetry in zzso zzso at zzso was associated with lower occupational physical demands and less disk height zzso zzso was the only factor associated with zzso muscle zzso asymmetry at zzso For the zzso zzso muscle, greater age, zzso and disk height narrowing were associated with zzso asymmetry at zzso and sports activity, zzso disk height zzso and familial zzso were associated with zzso asymmetry at zzso In multivariable analyses of asymmetry in muscle zzso familial zzso explained zzso to zzso of the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso muscle zzso differences at both levels zzso In addition, zzso and pain severity entered the model for zzso zzso muscle asymmetry at zzso and zzso zzso and disk height narrowing entered the model for zzso muscle asymmetry at zzso 

zzso on zzso recall for low back pain history, occupation, and physical activity levels was a limitation of this zzso 

Few of the factors investigated were associated with zzso muscle zzso and associations were inconsistent and modest, explaining little of the zzso in zzso muscle zzso
