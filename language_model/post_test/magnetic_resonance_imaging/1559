zzso and problem solving depend on the ability to represent and integrate complex relationships among zzso For example, deciding whether an animal is dangerous requires zzso information about the type of animal, its size, its distance from zzso and one's proximity to zzso Relational complexity increases with the number of such zzso elements that must be simultaneously considered to solve a zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain regions that respond selectively in processing high levels of zzso zzso Performance on zzso reasoning problems in which zzso complexity was varied zzso was compared with performance on control problems in which zzso complexity was held constant while difficulty was manipulated by adding zzso forms to the zzso zzso complexity and adding zzso both led to increased zzso in zzso and in zzso prefrontal cortex, with high levels of zzso complexity selectively zzso anterior left prefrontal zzso Our data provide evidence that brain regions specific to zzso complex relations among stimuli are distinct from those involved in coping with general task difficulty and with zzso zzso
