In zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso on body weight, zzso and blood pressure in zzso zzso From birth half of the animals zzso were given water to drink, while the remainder were administered zzso in their drinking water (2 zzso Food zzso water intake and body weight were measured zzso Blood pressure was measured by tail cuff zzso at zzso Body fat content and distribution were assessed using dual energy X-ray zzso and zzso zzso Imaging at 12 zzso Animals administered with zzso had a body fat proportion that was half that of zzso This was consistent with, but disproportionately greater than the observed differences in food intake and body zzso zzso treatment completely removed zzso We conclude that the chronic zzso of zzso II synthesis from birth specifically reduces the development of zzso in the zzso
