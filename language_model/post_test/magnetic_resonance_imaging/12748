Clinical zzso criterion zzso 

To determine if the clinical measure of zzso zzso is comparable to measures obtained from magnetic resonance imaging zzso An additional purpose of this study was to assess the zzso and zzso reliability of the clinical zzso 

zzso zzso is commonly assessed as part of the physical zzso however, limited and inconsistent data exist on the zzso and reliability of the clinical zzso 

zzso healthy adults (9 zzso 9 zzso mean zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso years; body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each underwent 3 data collection zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso zzso clinical testing of zzso zzso measured independently by 2 physical therapists, and zzso repeated clinical zzso zzso and reliability were assessed using zzso correlation zzso zzso and standard error of measurement zzso 

zzso agreement was found between the clinical test and zzso measures of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for examiners 1 and 2, zzso The zzso was similar for both examiners zzso degrees and zzso degrees zzso Both zzso tester zzso of zzso and zzso for examiners 1 and 2, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability was found to be zzso 

In persons with a low body mass index, the clinical test to assess zzso zzso was shown to exhibit substantial zzso but only moderate agreement with zzso zzso When performing the clinical test, one can be zzso confident that the true value of zzso zzso will fall within zzso degrees of the clinically measured zzso This relatively wide confidence zzso calls into question the clinical utility of the clinical test for assessing zzso zzso
