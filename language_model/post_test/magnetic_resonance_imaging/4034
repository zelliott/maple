The aim of this study was to assess changes in prostate volumes and organ movement during a course of external beam zzso using serial computerized zzso zzso scans and three-dimensional treatment planning zzso Ten zzso prostate cancer patients underwent repeat CT scans at biweekly intervals during the course of external beam zzso The spacing of 5 zzso was used because this spacing mimics our clinical treatment zzso zzso locations were determined by merging CT images using zzso anatomy and comparing the differences in the prostate volumes, the edges zzso zzso superior, inferior, and zzso and centers of the prostate zzso and zzso zzso Compared to the 10 initial treatment planning CT scans, the prostate volume determined by the repeat CT scans tended to be smaller zzso zzso P zzso zzso The prostate volumes determined by repeat CT scans tended to be stable with a mean volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the initial zzso When assessed by changes in the zzso superior movements appeared to be the most common source for concern for adequate coverage of the zzso while inferior movement was not zzso When assessed by changes in zzso movement of zzso or zzso 3 zzso was noted in zzso of the studies in the superior direction, with the average displacement being approximately zzso zzso In this study, the prostate volume tended to be smaller 2 weeks after the start of zzso Moreover, the prostate volumes defined by the serial CT scans were less zzso than zzso Superior displacement of the prostate is the most common and significant type of zzso while inferior movement is least frequent when patients are simulated with their zzso zzso Because of the magnitude of daily setup zzso organ movement, and problems with zzso in target definition, additional field edge reductions do not appear to be warranted during the delivery of three-dimensional zzso zzso Efforts should be directed at improving our ability to reduce organ movement and accurately targeting the zzso
