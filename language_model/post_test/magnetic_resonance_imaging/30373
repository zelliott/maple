A previous study of zzso zzso of the zzso branches of the zzso nerve for hip joint pain produced modest zzso Based on an anatomical and zzso study, we sought to define a potentially more effective zzso zzso 

Ten zzso were zzso four of them zzso The zzso nerve and its zzso branches were marked by zzso Their zzso relationship to the bone structures on zzso was zzso and zzso A magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was undertaken on 20 patients to determine the structures that would be encountered by the zzso zzso during different possible zzso zzso 

The zzso branches of the zzso nerve vary in location over a wide zzso The previously described method of zzso the hip joint did not take this variation into zzso Moreover, it approached the nerves zzso Because optimal zzso requires zzso to lie parallel to the nerves, a perpendicular approach probably produced only a minimal zzso In addition, zzso demonstrated that a perpendicular approach is likely to puncture zzso zzso zzso puncture can be avoided if an zzso pass is zzso Such an approach zzso the angle between the target nerves and the zzso and increases the likelihood of the nerve being captured by the zzso zzso Multiple zzso need to be made in order to accommodate the zzso in location of the zzso zzso 

The method that we described has the potential to produce complete and reliable nerve zzso Moreover, it zzso the risk of penetrating the great zzso The efficacy of this approach should be tested in clinical zzso
