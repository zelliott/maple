zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have reported multiple zzso zzso associated with a variety of conditions, stimuli or zzso However, most of these studies used fewer than 40 zzso 

After zzso data zzso of subjects, condition zzso number of zzso identified and zzso from 94 brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unique zzso published through December of 2011, we analyzed the correlation between individual study sample sizes and number of significant zzso zzso We also performed an analysis where we evaluated each zzso to test whether there was a correlation between the sample size of the zzso and the number of zzso that it had zzso zzso zzso were then combined across all zzso to obtain a summary correlation zzso with a fixed effects model and we combine correlation zzso using a zzso zzso zzso 

There was no correlation between sample size and the number of zzso reported in single studies zzso zzso zzso but there was a strong correlation between sample size and number of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only studies with sample sizes zzso identified larger zzso numbers of zzso and claimed as many discovered zzso as studies with sample sizes zzso 45, whereas zzso yielded a limited number of zzso relative to the yield that would be anticipated from smaller single zzso 

These results are consistent with possible reporting biases affecting small zzso studies and suggest the need to promote standardized large-scale evidence in this zzso It may also be that small studies may be analyzed and reported in ways that may generate a larger number of claimed zzso or that small zzso studies with inconclusive, zzso or not very promising results may not be published at zzso
