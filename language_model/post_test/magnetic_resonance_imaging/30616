There is controversy about extensive surgical treatment for a zzso zzso zzso in more elderly patients who may have poorer outcomes and higher complication zzso This retrospective study investigated outcome in elderly patients with zzso zzso zzso before and after the adoption of routine clinical use of magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

During 1982 through 1999, 88 patients with zzso zzso zzso aged 60 years or over were treated in our zzso zzso patients had an zzso zzso and 51 had a zzso zzso patients treated from 1982 to 1988 did not have zzso evaluation by MR imaging zzso zzso 26 patients treated from 1989 to 1995 had zzso MR imaging evaluation zzso B), and 25 patients treated after 1996 underwent zzso MR imaging with functional brain mapping and zzso navigation system monitoring zzso zzso 

The median survival time was zzso months in Group A, zzso months in Group B, and zzso months in Group zzso Patients with zzso in Group B zzso months, zzso zzso zzso and Group C zzso months, zzso zzso zzso had significantly longer median survival time than in Group A (6 months, zzso zzso 17) zzso zzso zzso between Groups A and B, P zzso zzso between Groups A and zzso Better zzso performance status, more thorough surgical zzso and better performance status after the initial treatment was obtained after the introduction of MR imaging, and patients with the optimal indicators showed significantly longer survival time compared with the patients without these zzso 

zzso MR imaging may contribute to longer survival time by providing an earlier diagnosis in patients with better performance status, by allowing more thorough surgical zzso and resulting in better performance status after the zzso
