Slice thickness is a primary operational zzso in the evaluation of the performance of an zzso system with regard to providing accurate imaging of a slice of zzso Of the various methods that have been zzso to evaluate slice zzso a continuous zzso ramp has gained the most support as the method of zzso However, problems with the accuracy of the measurement method have been associated with the finite thickness of the zzso This report considers the accuracy of the measurement method as a function of ramp zzso
