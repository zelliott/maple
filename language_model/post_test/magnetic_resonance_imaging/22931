The nucleus zzso zzso towards an area of least zzso in response to offset zzso however, there is a lack of data reporting the deformation patterns of nuclear material in rotated positions of the zzso zzso Our purpose was to assess a novel methodology using zzso to track nuclear deformation in response to zzso and extension positions, and the combined positions of zzso with left rotation and extension with left zzso at zzso and zzso 

Three zzso female subjects, mean age 27 years, underwent zzso weighted zzso sequences in zzso extended, and left rotated positions combined with zzso and zzso A zzso profile technique was employed to determine direction and magnitude of nuclear zzso 

In 5 of 6 discs zzso deformation of the nucleus occurred zzso in extension and zzso in zzso Left rotation resulted in migration of nuclear material to the right in 9 of 12 zzso Of the three discs that demonstrated a right nuclear migration, two occurred at zzso and one at zzso 

This methodology demonstrated that nucleus zzso deformation can be measured reliably in various positions achieved within the confines of the zzso The consistent migration of nuclear material following zzso plane movement and the less consistent response to rotation positions suggest other zzso loading on the zzso disc may accompany zzso
