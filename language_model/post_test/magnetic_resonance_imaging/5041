zzso models of auditory processing often zzso that optimal zzso zzso those zzso a zzso neural response, will increase in bandwidth and decrease in zzso rate as one ascends the auditory zzso Here, we tested how bandwidth and zzso rate interact at several zzso along the human central auditory zzso using functional zzso in a zzso sparse acquisition zzso Participants listened passively to both zzso zzso and broadband zzso carriers zzso or zzso pink zzso which were zzso about a mean zzso zzso zzso rate of 0, 3, 29, or 57 zzso The zzso was introduced to minimize zzso zzso The results revealed a clear difference between spectral bandwidth and zzso zzso rate: sensitivity to bandwidth zzso zzso zzso decreased from zzso structures to zzso auditory cortex, whereas sensitivity to slow zzso rates was largest in zzso auditory zzso and largely absent in zzso zzso Furthermore, there was no zzso interaction between bandwidth and zzso zzso These results challenge simple zzso models, in that zzso stimuli evoked stronger responses in primary auditory zzso (and zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso Furthermore, the strong preference for slow zzso rates in zzso zzso demonstrates the compelling global sensitivity of auditory zzso to zzso rates that are dominant in the principal signals that we process, zzso zzso
