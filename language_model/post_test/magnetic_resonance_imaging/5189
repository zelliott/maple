zzso functional zzso is a leading application for very high field (7 zzso human MR zzso Though higher field strengths promise improvements in zzso ratios zzso and zzso contrast relative to zzso at 3 zzso these benefits may be partially offset by accompanying increases in geometric distortion and other zzso zzso Such effects may be especially pronounced with the zzso zzso pulse sequences typically used for zzso at standard field zzso As an alternative, one might consider zzso pulse zzso which may lead to somewhat lower zzso zzso than standard zzso but which are also often substantially less susceptible to zzso zzso Here we consider zzso mapping of human visual zzso as a practical test case by which to compare examples of these sequence types for high-resolution zzso at 7 zzso We performed polar angle zzso mapping at each of 3 zzso resolutions zzso zzso and zzso zzso using both accelerated zzso zzso zzso and accelerated zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso We found that zzso zzso indeed led to greater zzso zzso and zzso ratios zzso than the zzso zzso However, additional distortion correction in zzso was required in order to fully realize these advantages, particularly at higher zzso The zzso maps produced by both sequence types were zzso comparable, and showed equivalent zzso zzso Thus, when zzso analyses are planned, or in other circumstances where geometric distortion is of particular concern, zzso pulse sequences could provide a viable alternative to zzso zzso
