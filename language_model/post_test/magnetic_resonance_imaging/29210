Multiple zzso are uncommon brain tumors occurring zzso in several zzso locations in the same zzso In the present study, we determined the zzso zzso status of zzso acid, and relationship of genetic zzso in eight zzso from one female zzso 

Six molecular genetic techniques, including two zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso islands by zzso zzso chain reaction, loss of zzso zzso instability, and zzso analysis of the zzso gene on zzso 22, were used in comparative investigations on zzso and genetic zzso 

The presence of zzso tumor cells was demonstrated by 1) loss of the same copy of zzso 22 in all eight zzso 2) zzso of the human zzso gene from the same zzso in six of eight zzso 3) a common zzso zzso at the zzso locus in all eight zzso and 4) the identical zzso zzso zzso in zzso 9 of the zzso gene in six of eight zzso In addition, loss of a copy of the X zzso in one tumor zzso and zzso instability in another zzso were zzso 

Taken together, this case of multiple zzso was most likely zzso in zzso Loss of zzso 22 was an early event during the development of multiple zzso and was followed by zzso at the zzso zzso Later events, including loss of the X zzso variation of zzso gene zzso or zzso instability, may also have played a role in the development of multiple zzso in this zzso
