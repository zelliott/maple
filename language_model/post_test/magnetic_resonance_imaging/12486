The influence of the pore size of zzso zzso zzso scaffolds on bone zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso scaffolds were implanted into a zzso in the zzso head of zzso zzso sizes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested and compared to zzso defects as zzso Two and four weeks after zzso the specimens were zzso and zzso zzso and de zzso zzso zzso generation were investigated by zzso quantitative solid-state zzso and mass zzso 

The pore size of the scaffolds had a pronounced influence on the quantity of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso most collagen was zzso within the first 2 weeks of zzso while the amount of zzso increased in the second 2 zzso After 4 weeks, the scaffolds contained large quantities of newly formed zzso bone while the control defects were filled by zzso woven zzso Best results were obtained for scaffolds of a pore size of zzso zzso 

Our analysis showed that the structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso was very similar to that of the native bone, suggesting that zzso was significantly enhanced by the choice of the most appropriate implant zzso
