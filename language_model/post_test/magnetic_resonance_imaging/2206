zzso assessment of the extent of zzso zzso zzso represents the basic step towards optimal zzso We compared the capacity of CT and zzso in assessing the extent of zzso in 67 zzso zzso was superior to CT in demonstrating zzso in the zzso zzso skull base, zzso area, carotid space, zzso zzso muscle and zzso zzso zzso Of 25 cases in which zzso zzso was zzso only on zzso seven had been reported as showing zzso involvement and 18 as primary extension to the carotid space on zzso zzso showed zzso involvement in 40 patients compared with 27 on CT and zzso involvement in 38 patients versus 24 on zzso There was not a single case in which skull base invasion was seen on CT but not on zzso zzso enabled improved recognition of zzso zzso of zzso zzso muscles zzso cases compared with 15 on zzso It allowed us to clarify 12 questionable zzso zzso on zzso Overall, zzso was changed in 18 of 67 patients zzso including zzso in 15 cases and zzso in 3 cases, after comparing CT with zzso The zzso status was changed from negative on CT to positive on zzso in 4 of 67 patients zzso We believe that zzso allows more accurate evaluation of the extent of zzso than CT and should be the primary mode of zzso
