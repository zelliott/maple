zzso the middle cerebral artery of small animals with an zzso filament to build a stroke model has gained increasing zzso In light of the growing demand for magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies using the clinical zzso zzso large animal models can be superior to small animal zzso In this work, we developed a modified rabbit model of stroke, which was assessed using clinical zzso scanner and compared with a most commonly zzso filament zzso 

We presented a focal cerebral zzso in zzso The key feature of this modified method is the use of a guide wire as a zzso zzso At 3 days after zzso the percentage of brain zzso volume, zzso score, zzso zzso zzso and dynamic changes of zzso and apparent diffusion zzso values were assessed respectively and compared between the focal cerebral zzso 

zzso models had more severe brain zzso size with less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso than that with filament models zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso There were more significant zzso changes in the early stage, higher rate of technique success zzso zzso filament, zzso and less zzso zzso zzso zzso filament, zzso in zzso models than in zzso rabbits zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso method can provide a useful tool for the earlier research of zzso
