To zzso the two principal forms of zzso storage iron, zzso soluble iron zzso zzso and zzso zzso iron zzso zzso using a new zzso method in patients with zzso iron zzso 

Six healthy volunteers and 20 patients with zzso zzso syndromes and iron overload were zzso zzso and zzso iron were determined based on the measurement of two distinct relaxation zzso the zzso zzso relaxation rate, zzso , and the zzso zzso A, using three sets of zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso simulating the relaxation and zzso properties of tissue with different zzso of dispersed zzso and zzso zzso iron, were used for zzso 

Both phantom and in zzso human data confirmed that zzso relaxation components associated with the dispersed and zzso iron could be separated using the zzso zzso , zzso zzso The zzso total zzso storage iron was highly correlated zzso with zzso derived from biopsy or zzso As total zzso storage iron increased, the proportion stored as zzso iron became zzso 

This method provides a new means for zzso zzso determination of the partition of zzso storage iron between zzso and zzso in iron overload zzso
