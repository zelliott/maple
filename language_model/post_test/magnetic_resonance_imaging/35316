We aimed to describe zzso findings of patients with zzso diagnosed zzso zzso zzso vein zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We zzso reviewed CT zzso zzso zzso color zzso US zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3) findings of 9 patients with zzso diagnosed zzso zzso of the zzso veins from our zzso zzso zzso and US examinations were performed in 4 zzso only CT in 2; zzso CT, and zzso in 1; US and zzso in 1; and CT and zzso in 1 zzso Liver zzso presence, and location of zzso zzso were zzso 

Middle zzso vein zzso zzso 6) was the most commonly zzso zzso zzso followed by left zzso vein zzso zzso zzso Mean length of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found close to zzso vein zzso in all but 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso vein zzso can cause zzso zzso zzso 5) or retrograde zzso zzso 1) flow in the affected vein on color zzso examination, depending on presence of zzso zzso zzso In the patient with retrograde flow, zzso segment was very short, and no zzso shunt was zzso Patients were zzso and no change in liver zzso (including zzso lobe zzso was zzso 

We propose that zzso zzso syndrome can be a valid zzso for zzso patients with zzso zzso vein zzso most likely developing as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of practicing zzso to this phenomenon may be highly useful in the prevention of the diagnostic confusion and potentially unnecessary zzso
