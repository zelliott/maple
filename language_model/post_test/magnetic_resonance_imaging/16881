zzso of late zzso enhancement zzso as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging has been attributed to various zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso is associated with left zzso zzso wall zzso 

We examined 300 patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance was used to assess zzso volume, mass, wall stress, and zzso Increased zzso zzso wall stress zzso 4 zzso was found in 112 patients zzso zzso and increased zzso wall stress zzso zzso in 121 patients zzso zzso of zzso was observed in 93 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso 79 zzso 42 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes (62 zzso 44 zzso 44 zzso 37 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso mass (95 zzso 34 zzso 78 zzso 31 zzso P zzso zzso were increased in patients exhibiting zzso In particular, zzso zzso and zzso wall stress were increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Late zzso enhancement was observed more frequently than would be expected from random occurrence in patients with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso wall stress (41 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Both normal zzso and zzso wall stress had a high negative zzso value for zzso (75 and zzso 

The present study shows that occurrence of zzso in zzso is associated with increased zzso wall stress and zzso zzso causes are an increased zzso leakage by stretch, impaired contrast agent zzso or increased diffusion zzso It is proposed that zzso should be considered as a potential zzso zzso of heart failure and severe zzso
