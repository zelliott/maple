In human conditions, chronic pain is associated with widespread anatomical changes in the zzso Nevertheless, little is known about the time course of these changes or the relationship of anatomical changes to perception and zzso In the present study, we use a rat model of zzso pain zzso nerve injury, zzso and 7 T zzso to determine the zzso zzso changes associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats and sham controls were scanned at seven time points, 1 week before surgery, 2 weeks after, and then once a month for 5 zzso At each time point we performed zzso tests, including zzso and mechanical sensitivity, and tests of locomotion and exploratory zzso zzso field and elevated plus zzso We found that zzso rats had early and sustained zzso and mechanical zzso and developed zzso zzso several months after zzso Compared to sham controls, zzso rats had decreased frontal zzso volumes several months after surgery, zzso with the onset of zzso zzso There was also decreased volume in zzso and zzso zzso We also explored areas that correlated with mechanical zzso and found that increased zzso was associated with decreased volumes in bilateral zzso zzso area, anterior zzso zzso zzso areas 32 and 24), and zzso Overall, our results suggest that long-term zzso pain has widespread effects on brain anatomy related to the duration and magnitude of the zzso
