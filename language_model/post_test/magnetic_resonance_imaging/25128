A transient zzso attack zzso in the brain is classically considered a syndrome lasting zzso zzso Having previously shown that an experimental challenge with the zzso zzso zzso in recovered stroke patients can zzso the acute clinical state, we determined whether zzso patients would demonstrate a similar zzso 

Four right-handed patients zzso 3 with clinical zzso presumed to have affected the left zzso within the previous 24 to 72 hours and no evidence of a new zzso on zzso and zzso inversion recovery imaging, and 1 patient with an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso duration ranged from 30 minutes to 3 zzso Each patient underwent baseline testing for motor function and zzso after which intravenous zzso was delivered until mild zzso was zzso Patients were tested during the peak drug effect and again after 2 hours when sedation had zzso 

No patient showed weakness or zzso at zzso After administration of zzso all 3 zzso patients demonstrated zzso of features that characterized their recent transient neurological syndromes zzso weakness and/or zzso but no zzso zzso The zzso zzso patient who had never been symptomatic showed no drug zzso Two hours later, all zzso patients returned to their normal clinical zzso 

Patients who had suffered recent transient cerebral zzso episodes and were zzso intact with negative zzso imaging showed zzso of prior focal deficits after administration of a zzso in a dose that produces light zzso These findings suggest that presumed zzso may produce zzso dysfunction beyond the symptomatic zzso
