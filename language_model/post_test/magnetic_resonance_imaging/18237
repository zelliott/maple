In the zzso of everyday life, people can stop particular response tendencies without affecting zzso A key requirement for such selective suppression is that subjects know in advance which responses need zzso We hypothesized that zzso setting up and implementing selective suppression relies on the zzso zzso and, specifically, regions consistent with the zzso indirect zzso for which there is scant functional evidence in zzso zzso with this hypothesis, we show, first, that the degree of proactive motor suppression when preparing to stop selectively zzso by zzso magnetic zzso zzso to zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso by functional zzso Second, we demonstrate that greater zzso zzso at the time of selective stopping zzso with greater behavioral zzso Third, we show that people with zzso and zzso volume reductions zzso with zzso zzso disease) have both absent proactive motor suppression and impaired behavioral selectivity when zzso Thus, stopping goals are used to zzso set up specific zzso zzso channels that may then be triggered to implement selective zzso By linking this suppression to the zzso and zzso these results provide compelling functional evidence in humans of the zzso zzso zzso indirect zzso
