The frequency of the diagnosis of brain zzso has increased in recent years, probably due to an increased diagnostic zzso Site zzso of brain zzso in zzso patients at the time of zzso may suggest mechanisms of zzso vulnerability to zzso The aim of the study is to determine the spatial distribution of zzso brain zzso by using zzso statistics in breast and lung cancer zzso For this retrospective zzso study, clinical data and MR imaging of 864 zzso at first diagnosis in 114 consecutive advanced cancer patients from 2006 to 2011 were zzso zzso zzso zzso weighted images were registered to a standard zzso zzso zzso masks were created after zzso of volumes of zzso The zzso zzso mapping approach was used to calculate a zzso statistic describing the differences between zzso It was found that the zzso were more likely to be located in the zzso zzso and zzso for the total cohort and for the non small cell lung cancer group, and in the zzso for the breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso comparisons showed the largest significant clusters in the zzso for the breast cancer group zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the non small cell lung cancer zzso We conclude a zzso distribution of zzso brain zzso in breast and lung cancer patients that suggest differential vulnerability to zzso in the different regions of the zzso
