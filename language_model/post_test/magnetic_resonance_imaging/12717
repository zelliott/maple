zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 4 zzso depicts details of the internal structure of the zzso not visible at zzso zzso and so allows for in zzso zzso of different zzso zzso The aim of this study was to test if distinct zzso zzso patterns can be detected in zzso lobe zzso zzso with zzso zzso sclerosis zzso and without zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso images were acquired in 34 zzso 15 zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso volumes were determined using a manual zzso zzso 

zzso had significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso volume than controls or zzso Mean zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower than zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the various zzso or zzso zzso on either the zzso or the zzso side in zzso Using a zzso zzso to identify severe volume loss, the following zzso patterns were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and global zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in three zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Using a manual zzso scheme on 4 zzso high-resolution zzso we found the characteristic zzso zzso and zzso zzso described in zzso zzso percent of the zzso had zzso zzso despite normal total zzso zzso These findings indicate that high-resolution zzso and zzso zzso provide superior information compared to standard zzso zzso
