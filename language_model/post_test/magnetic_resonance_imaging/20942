Animal data suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso We have demonstrated that anorexia zzso zzso a disorder characterized by food zzso low weight, and zzso is associated with decreased nocturnal zzso zzso We have also reported functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso in anorexia in brain regions involved in food zzso The relationships between zzso zzso zzso and zzso eating zzso have not been investigated in zzso 

The objective of the study was to determine whether the zzso response to feeding in anorexia differs from healthy women and to establish the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso eating zzso and zzso zzso 

This was a zzso zzso 

The study was conducted at a clinical research zzso 

Participants included 35 zzso 13 anorexia zzso nine zzso anorexia zzso and 13 healthy controls zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured zzso and 30, 60, and 120 zzso after a standardized mixed zzso The Eating Disorder zzso was used to assess zzso eating zzso zzso was performed during visual processing of food and nonfood stimuli to measure brain zzso before and after the zzso 

Mean zzso levels were higher in AN than HC at 60 and 120 zzso and lower in zzso than HC at 0, 30, and 120 zzso and AN at all time zzso Mean zzso area under the curve zzso was highest in zzso intermediate in zzso and lowest in zzso Mean zzso levels at all time points and zzso were lower in AN than HC and zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso in zzso and HC but not in zzso zzso zzso was associated with the severity of zzso eating zzso in AN and zzso independent of zzso zzso and was associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso in food motivation brain regions, including the zzso amygdala, zzso zzso cortex, and zzso 

zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso
