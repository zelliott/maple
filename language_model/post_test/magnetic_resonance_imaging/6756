The zzso has an influence on motor zzso We investigated if the location of a zzso zzso was crucial for changes of motor zzso zzso and if the zzso findings were correlated with motor zzso 

zzso magnetic stimulation was applied to study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motor zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a measure of motor performance was tested with the zzso Test zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso and zzso ratios were zzso correlated with zzso ratios in all patients zzso Compared with an zzso control group, patients with zzso in the territory of the superior zzso artery zzso zzso or a zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus zzso had zzso enhanced zzso and a loss of zzso (3 zzso zzso was impaired in all 4 zzso Motor zzso and motor performance zzso over the subsequent zzso Patients with an zzso either in the territory of the anterior inferior zzso artery zzso or in the territory of the zzso inferior zzso artery zzso displayed motor zzso and motor performance within the normal zzso 

The superior part of the zzso has a strong influence on motor zzso zzso We suggest that the enhancement of motor zzso and reduction of motor zzso is zzso by an impairment of the deep zzso zzso
