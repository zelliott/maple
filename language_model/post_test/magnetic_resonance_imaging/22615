The purpose of this study was to observe the zzso relationship between maxillofacial skeleton and zzso by zzso the zzso image constructed by MR image scanning on the zzso Sixteen subjects with different zzso plane angle were examined in this zzso zzso and MR images of each subject were taken, and the images were input to a computer by using a zzso The areas of zzso were selected in each MR scan image which were projected to the zzso layer of the MR scan zzso The zzso image of zzso and zzso was obtained by completely zzso zzso images of the zzso with the zzso MR image on the zzso The inclination of zzso was determined by the center of gravity on the zzso of zzso These zzso images of zzso and zzso showed various shapes of zzso according to different zzso plane zzso The inclination of zzso had a close correlation with some skeletal parameters zzso plane angle, zzso zzso facial angle, zzso zzso of zzso zzso The volume of the zzso also had a close correlation with skeletal parameters zzso plane angle, zzso angle, zzso These results revealed that zzso analysis using zzso images of zzso and zzso is useful, and that the inclination and the volume of zzso may have an influence on the shape of the zzso bone and its vertical and zzso zzso
