This study evaluated the role of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso in assessing the response of zzso brain tumors to a zzso treatment zzso Specifically, it was of interest to assess if zzso zzso could detect early tumor response to therapy prior to magnetic resonance imaging zzso changes, and to establish which spectral markers were sensitive to regional changes within and around a zzso tumor zzso A total of 14 patients with zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso Changes associated with chemotherapy were assessed by zzso comparisons of regional levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to total zzso These changes were, in turn, compared to changes on zzso and zzso MR images and to each patient's clinical zzso In enhancing tumor regions, there was a significant association between an increase in zzso during treatment and decreased zzso survival zzso At zzso a low zzso in zzso brain tissue adjacent to zzso tumor was associated with decreased zzso survival time, as was an increase in zzso during zzso An increase in zzso and zzso in zzso brain regions next to zzso tumor in one patient was noted 2 months before zzso showed progressive zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso can be a powerful adjunct to zzso in the assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy, and that zzso and zzso appear to be the most reliable markers of tumor progression and may predict response prior to zzso zzso
