Total zzso zzso usually leads to zzso of the knee zzso Preservation and zzso of the injured zzso are therefore of great clinical zzso 

The present study examines 40 zzso injuries in 37 patients that were zzso treated with zzso zzso screws zzso zzso zzso in the period from August 1999 to December zzso The mean patient age was zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine patients were zzso A total of 24 patients (27 zzso zzso also had an anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso and 5 patients had cartilage zzso Twenty-two patients were treated within the first 2 weeks following the zzso 10 patients within 8 weeks, and 5 patients after 8 zzso The zzso were a zzso tear of the zzso zzso in 11 cases and a zzso tear of the lateral zzso in 2 zzso The zzso horn of the zzso zzso was torn in 13 cases, and the zzso zzso in 3 zzso The zzso horn of the lateral zzso was torn in 8 cases, and the zzso zzso in 3 zzso The mean tear length was zzso zzso zzso zzso and was fixed with an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso In 7 cases, the anterior horn was treated with an additional zzso zzso A total of 35 patients were examined after an average of 18 zzso zzso zzso 

In the event of a moderate outcome, zzso was performed as part of the follow-up zzso The average zzso score was 93 zzso zzso the zzso activity index was zzso zzso zzso before the accident and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso the Marshall knee score was 47 zzso zzso The zzso pain assessment was zzso zzso zzso and the zzso function assessment was zzso zzso zzso Of the 7 patients with a moderate result, 2 patients without additional ligament zzso suffered zzso after and 13 months, zzso The other 5 patients with a moderate result each had multiple accompanying injuries or pre-existing damage to the affected knee zzso 

The zzso screws achieved a clinical success rate of zzso in isolated zzso tears in stable knee zzso and a clinical success rate of zzso with additional zzso zzso In view of the good clinical results and the simple procedure for use, the implant should be recommended for zzso zzso
