To determine the changes in prostate shape and volume after the introduction of an zzso zzso zzso by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso 

A total of 44 consecutive patients with zzso prostate cancer underwent separate zzso examinations at zzso with a body array zzso and subsequently with an zzso inflated with 50 zzso of zzso zzso two experienced readers independently evaluated all data sets in random zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate zzso as well as the total prostate and peripheral zone and central zzso volumes were measured before and after zzso zzso The changes in prostate shape and volume were analyzed using zzso test for paired zzso 

The introduction of the zzso significantly changed the prostate shape in all three directions, with mean changes in the zzso zzso and zzso diameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean total zzso peripheral zone, and central zzso volume decreased significantly after zzso introduction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso introduction as observed by zzso zzso changed the prostate shape and volume zzso The mean zzso diameter was reduced by nearly zzso of its original diameter, and the mean total prostate volume was decreased by approximately zzso This could cause difficulties and should be considered when using zzso zzso for zzso zzso fusion and zzso zzso
