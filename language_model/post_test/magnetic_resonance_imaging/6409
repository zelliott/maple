To evaluate zzso versus zzso in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic zzso in a prospective zzso zzso 

Fifty patients with suspected pancreatic zzso underwent both zzso zzso zzso and state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso T zzso In correlation with zzso findings or in case of a zzso diagnosis by follow-up zzso zzso we evaluated zzso versus CT in a zzso analysis (2 reader zzso for: zzso diagnostic zzso zzso examination time; zzso accuracy of potential zzso zzso zzso analysis of observer zzso and zzso overall diagnostic zzso 

A total of 28 zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso were present in the cohort group versus 22 patients without a focal zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 12 no zzso For zzso zzso CT had a sensitivity of zzso % zzso pair zzso and specificity of 77 zzso and zzso had a sensitivity of zzso % and specificity of zzso zzso For the zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 17), we found a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 61 % for CT versus a sensitivity of zzso % and a specificity of zzso % for zzso The accuracy for determining the zzso was zzso % for CT and zzso % for zzso The zzso analysis showed a good correlation for CT zzso and a moderate correlation of both groups for zzso zzso 

CT and zzso showed comparable results in the detection of pancreatic zzso as well as in the determination of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso was the major factor of a missed zzso The results of zzso analysis for both reading groups were almost identical with a moderate to good zzso zzso There is no reason to prefer zzso (more expensive) over CT for patients with the zzso diagnosis of pancreatic zzso
