To systematically analyze existing zzso systems for idiopathic zzso inflammation zzso and propose and test a new best practice zzso zzso 

A systematic literature search was conducted to find all studies that described and applied a zzso system for zzso zzso categories used in more than two studies were zzso and criteria for these categories were defined using common zzso Using patient data, these newly defined zzso systems were zzso zzso was tested by zzso and zzso agreement of two zzso and distinction tested by evaluating clinical differences among zzso zzso zzso face zzso and content zzso were zzso zzso 

The most frequently encountered zzso zzso systems were based on onset zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Systems based on zzso and zzso showed good reliability zzso values range zzso were easy to apply zzso and described the zzso process zzso zzso Because of zzso zzso zzso systems had moderate content zzso and moderate distinction between zzso zzso Being a zzso measure, zzso had moderate content zzso but good zzso It was found that content zzso was improved by combining zzso and zzso into a two-dimensional zzso zzso 

This combined zzso and zzso zzso system provides a zzso easy to use, zzso and complete zzso system that can be used to further advance the research of zzso
