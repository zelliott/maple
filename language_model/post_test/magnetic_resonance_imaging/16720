With zzso prediction of liver volume becoming increasingly important to safely carry out complex zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to validate the accuracy of a three-dimensional zzso liver surgery operative planning software in performing zzso zzso 

Between 1999 and 2007, we performed 29 live donor liver zzso for zzso Eleven patients had zzso zzso performed by zzso from either zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso imaging with documentation of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso images were uploaded into zzso where 3-D models of each case were generated to perform zzso A zzso analysis was performed followed by an accuracy zzso 

zzso by both zzso and zzso were significantly correlated with the zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso significantly improved overall accuracy zzso cent error zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of the left lateral section zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This 3-D planning software is a valid tool for use in zzso zzso is greatest for zzso models of the left lateral zzso This approach gives surgeons the ability to assess zzso and actively plan zzso
