In this zzso study, we aimed at identifying the cortical areas engaged in zzso processing of language zzso zzso changes were recorded in 19 healthy right-handed subjects reading or listening to a zzso During the visual control tasks the volunteers attended to a series of continuous zzso or a fixation zzso while during the acoustic control tasks either a reversed text or white noise were zzso The conjunction of the visual and acoustic story processing yielded zzso zzso which in comparison to zzso stimuli focused to the left middle zzso zzso as well as to the zzso zzso We conclude that the core structure representing zzso language comprehension is the left zzso lobe at both banks of the superior zzso zzso
