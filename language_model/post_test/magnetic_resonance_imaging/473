Past experience is hypothesized to reduce zzso demands in zzso by providing bottom-up zzso information that informs subsequent zzso zzso The present zzso study measured cortical activity reductions zzso zzso zzso during repeated stimulus zzso to investigate the mechanisms through which learning from the past decreases demands on the prefrontal executive zzso zzso of learning at three levels of zzso decision, and zzso zzso neural zzso effects in distinct zzso regions, supporting a zzso model of neural zzso zzso three distinct patterns of neural zzso were identified in lateral frontal cortex, indicating that frontal zzso demands are reduced by three forms of zzso zzso cortical tuning of zzso zzso zzso retrieval of learned zzso zzso and zzso retrieval of learned zzso zzso The zzso distribution of these neural zzso effects suggests a zzso organization of executive function in lateral frontal zzso
