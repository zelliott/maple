zzso organization units of the cerebral zzso exist over a wide range of spatial zzso from local circuits to entire cortical zzso In the last decades, zzso representations of zzso data suited to probe the zzso nature of cortical functional organization have been introduced and zzso zzso For this purpose, responses are statistically detected over a range of spatial scales using a family of zzso zzso with small filters being related to fine and large zzso coarse spatial zzso The goal of the present study was to investigate the degree of zzso of zzso patterns over a broad range of observation zzso To this aim, the same zzso data set obtained from 18 subjects during a zzso task was analyzed with a range of filters from zzso to zzso full zzso at zzso zzso We found substantial zzso zzso For example, using filter zzso of 6- to zzso zzso in the zzso results, significant responses in the right secondary visual but not in the primary visual zzso were zzso However, when larger filters were used, the responses in the right primary visual zzso reached zzso Often, responses in zzso defined areas were significant when both small and large zzso but not intermediate filter zzso were zzso This suggests that brain responses can be organized in local clusters of multiple distinct zzso zzso Our findings illustrate the potential of zzso zzso analysis to reveal novel features in the spatial organization of human brain zzso
