zzso administration of iron oxide zzso after experimental stroke has been shown to produce focal signal intensity changes in the zzso boundary on zzso zzso These changes have been attributed to the influx of zzso zzso zzso although it has been suggested that this effect might not always be completely specific to inflammatory zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate this phenomenon in a zzso time frame that is more relevant to the peripheral inflammatory zzso Imaging experiments zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were acquired in zzso rats 6 days after transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Animals were zzso infused with different doses of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso 600 or zzso zzso or saline and zzso and zzso again zzso zzso zzso was immediately processed for zzso with the zzso marker zzso in combination with zzso blue for zzso zzso tissue exhibited a large increase in zzso values, and overall contrast enhancement was apparent in the brain and surrounding zzso In contrast with previous reports, there were no regions of focal signal intensity changes in the zzso territory in any of the images, although a region of interest analysis revealed a trend towards iron zzso in the zzso hemisphere, particularly in the zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso examination revealed that, despite extensive zzso zzso zzso in the entire zzso territory, none of these cells were zzso blue positive, except in the zzso of one animal that received a high dose of zzso zzso These results imply that the observed trend is a result of the presence of contrast agent in the blood, or zzso and not zzso inflammatory zzso
