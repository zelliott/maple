We recently implicated a cluster of nine single zzso zzso from seven zzso genes in the risk of Alzheimer's disease zzso in a European zzso and we proposed calculating an zzso zzso genetic score zzso to characterize a person's zzso In a separate study, we found that zzso E zzso zzso gene dose, an established zzso risk factor, was correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso brain regions in a cognitively normal American zzso and we proposed using PET as a zzso zzso to help assess putative zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the objective in the present study is to determine whether zzso is related to PET zzso of zzso in zzso brain zzso DNA and PET data from 141 cognitively normal late middle-aged zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between zzso and regional PET zzso zzso genetic risk scores were associated with zzso in zzso brain regions, even when controlling for the effects of zzso zzso gene zzso The results support the role of zzso genes in the predisposition to zzso and support the value of zzso in the zzso assessment of putative zzso of zzso zzso
