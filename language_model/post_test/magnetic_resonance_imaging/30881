White matter zzso integrity was assessed using diffusion zzso imaging zzso in 25 young adults, 25 zzso older adults, and 25 zzso older adults with zzso of the zzso type zzso For each individual, measures of zzso and zzso were obtained from zzso images in the anterior and zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso white zzso These data revealed age differences in zzso and zzso in all assessed zzso Age effects were greater in the anterior as opposed to the zzso corpus zzso and greater in the frontal white matter than in the zzso zzso and zzso white matter, suggesting zzso differences in white matter that exhibit a roughly zzso zzso In contrast, individuals with zzso zzso exhibited zzso if any, additional change in anterior regions but did show greater deterioration of white matter in zzso zzso zzso Taken zzso these results indicate that zzso aging is characterized by significant changes in white matter most prominently in anterior brain zzso The zzso between the regional effects of age and zzso status suggests that the mechanisms underlying zzso cognitive decline are likely distinct from those underlying zzso
