zzso can attend to different objects independent of their spatial zzso While selecting an object has been shown to zzso object processing in high-level visual areas in zzso cortex, zzso behavioral importance zzso zzso for objects is represented is zzso Here we examined the patterns of distributed neural activity during an zzso selection zzso We measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while participants viewed two zzso dynamic objects zzso and zzso zzso and were cued to attend to one of the triangle zzso zzso zzso response was observed for the attention conditions compared to a neutral condition, but no significant difference was found in overall response zzso between two attention zzso By using zzso pattern zzso zzso however, we were able to distinguish the neural patterns associated with attention to different objects in early visual zzso zzso to zzso and lateral zzso complex zzso Furthermore, distinct zzso patterns were also observed in frontal and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso attention has a zzso zzso effect along the visual hierarchy and suggest that zzso priority information is represented by patterned neural activity in the zzso zzso zzso
