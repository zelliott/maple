Children with residual zzso zzso birth zzso often develop internal rotation zzso with subsequent zzso zzso seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso head zzso and angular zzso zzso by zzso zzso have been zzso We zzso that the location of the biceps zzso characterizes zzso zzso 

A retrospective study was performed on 91 children zzso age zzso zzso who lacked external rotation beyond neutral and had magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of bilateral shoulders performed at our institution between 2000 and zzso The charts were reviewed for the measurement of the external rotation of the involved shoulder with the arm zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso angle zzso zzso the percentage of the zzso head anterior to the middle of the zzso zzso zzso and the angle of rotation of the biceps zzso zzso zzso were measured on zzso scans of both zzso zzso analysis was performed to compare these zzso zzso for the involved and zzso sides, and to identify the correlations between them and the external zzso 

The average biceps angle was zzso degrees on the zzso side and zzso degrees on the involved zzso The average differences between the 2 shoulders in the biceps angle zzso zzso the version zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were all significant zzso Only the biceps angle correlated significantly with external rotation zzso This correlation remained significant even when the version and the zzso were held constant zzso 

The biceps angle is a measure of zzso zzso in patients with residual zzso zzso birth zzso and zzso better with external rotation than either the zzso version or the zzso The biceps angle may be a useful measure of zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso
