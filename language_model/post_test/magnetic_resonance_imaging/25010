The purpose of this study was to characterize the normal pattern of zzso tracking and to investigate whether tissue tracking imaging is more useful for evaluation of regional zzso function than zzso harmonic zzso in patients after zzso zzso 

Left zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cardiac contraction, and can be evaluated online by a new zzso tissue imaging zzso 

We included 40 healthy participants and 40 patients after zzso zzso They underwent tissue tracking imaging and zzso harmonic imaging by an experienced and an inexperienced zzso zzso accuracy of zzso evaluation of left zzso function was compared using magnetic resonance imaging as reference zzso 

zzso zzso decreased from zzso to zzso segments in healthy zzso zzso tracking imaging has a higher diagnostic sensitivity than zzso imaging for the diagnosis of regional zzso abnormalities zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso whereas specificity remained unchanged zzso zzso vs zzso not zzso zzso zzso vs zzso not zzso 

zzso tracking imaging is feasible and evaluates regional zzso zzso function zzso with high diagnostic accuracy compared with magnetic resonance imaging in patients after zzso zzso and is more accurate than zzso harmonic zzso
