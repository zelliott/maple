Children with zzso zzso are usually able to wear an eye zzso but the zzso aspect is determined by the size of the zzso volume zzso Instead of using a ball shaped standard zzso zzso or a regular zzso zzso which would zzso zzso of the zzso eye, this study investigates the feasibility of volume zzso with zzso zzso zzso as formerly suggested for acquired zzso in adults zzso 

The zzso zzso is made from a self inflating zzso that takes up water by zzso zzso state: length 8 zzso diameter 2 zzso volume zzso zzso in zzso hydrated state after around 1 day: length 15 zzso diameter 4 zzso volume zzso zzso swelling zzso zzso This report concerns six patients zzso girls and four zzso aged between 4 months and 42 months with unilateral zzso who were treated by injection of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso Volume zzso was zzso zzso The zzso were injected using a zzso zzso and placed behind the zzso directed into the zzso zzso 

The increasing zzso volume was noticeable within 2 days and was confirmed by zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The final result can be anticipated by the volume zzso effect produced by the amount of saline solution injected in the zzso zzso zzso All patients were fitted with an artificial eye, which was subsequently enlarged every 3-5 zzso zzso zzso was fully compensated with this zzso No complications have been encountered to zzso 

zzso volume zzso with zzso self inflating zzso zzso zzso is apparently a safe, zzso and minimally invasive technique for various indications in zzso zzso zzso example, to treat an zzso appearance in zzso and zzso or acquired zzso
