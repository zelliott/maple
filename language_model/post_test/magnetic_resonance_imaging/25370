Small cell zzso of the prostate zzso although relatively rare, is the most aggressive zzso of prostate cancer, currently with no successful zzso It was therefore tempting to evaluate the response of this violent zzso and its bone zzso to zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso already proven by us to efficiently eradicate other aggressive zzso solid zzso zzso is a novel zzso second-generation zzso recently, developed by us for the treatment of bulky zzso This zzso is endowed with strong light zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso in the near infrared region zzso allowing deep tissue zzso The zzso protocol targets the tumor zzso leading to zzso zzso necrosis and tumor zzso The zzso zzso rapidly from the circulation within a few hours and does not accumulate in zzso which is compatible with the treatment of localized tumor and isolated zzso Briefly, male zzso mice were grafted with the human zzso zzso in 3 relevant zzso locations: subcutaneous (representing tumor zzso zzso (representing bone zzso and zzso within the zzso prostate zzso The zzso protocol consisted of zzso administration of zzso (4 zzso followed by immediate zzso zzso zzso from a xenon light source or a zzso laser emitting at 770 zzso zzso included zzso animals or animals treated with light or zzso zzso zzso volume, human plasma zzso A levels, animal well being and survival were used as end zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were used to define the tumor zzso zzso tumors exhibited complete healing within zzso days, reaching an overall long-term cure rate of zzso followed for 90 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso responded with complete tumor elimination in 50% of the treated mice at zzso days after zzso as documented zzso The response of the zzso model was also analyzed zzso with similar zzso The study with this model suggests that zzso zzso can reach large tumors and is a zzso efficient and zzso approach for minimally invasive treatment of local and zzso zzso
