zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso has demonstrated zzso of language functions with greater involvement of the zzso zzso The structural brain connections supporting this zzso language dominance have not previously been zzso We performed zzso of language functions and imaging of white matter connections using MR zzso in 14 patients with unilateral zzso and zzso sclerosis and 10 zzso zzso generation and reading comprehension zzso were used to define functional regions which were used to generate starting regions for zzso zzso and right zzso patients had a zzso pattern of both zzso zzso and the associated structural zzso Left zzso patients showed more symmetrical language zzso along with reduced left zzso and increased right zzso structural zzso zzso with more zzso functional zzso had also more highly zzso connecting zzso We provide evidence for structural zzso of white matter tracts that reflects the altered functional language zzso in left zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso offers a promising tool for studying the zzso of language functions in many neurological conditions and may prove useful in predicting language deficits following zzso lobe zzso
