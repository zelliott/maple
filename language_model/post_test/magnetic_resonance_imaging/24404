This study tested the efficacy of zzso reading training in nine patients with pure zzso an acquired reading disorder caused by damage to the left zzso zzso zzso As well as testing the zzso impact on reading speed, we investigated the functional reorganization underlying zzso zzso changes using zzso Reading ability was tested twice before training zzso and zzso and twice after completion of the zzso training period zzso and zzso At zzso there was a significant improvement in word reading speed and reduction of the word length effect for trained words zzso zzso at zzso demonstrated significant differences in reading network connectivity for trained and untrained zzso The training effects were supported by increased zzso connectivity between the left zzso and zzso zzso zzso cortex, and increased feedback connectivity from the left inferior frontal zzso zzso connection strengths between right zzso regions became weaker after zzso
