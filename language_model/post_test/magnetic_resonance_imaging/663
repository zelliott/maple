In this paper, we frame the strategy and motivations behind developments in statistical zzso mapping zzso for the analysis of electroencephalogram zzso zzso This work deals specifically with zzso procedures for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso We place these developments in the larger context of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of evoked brain responses through the fusion of zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we consider some fundamental issues when selecting an appropriate statistical model that enables diverse questions to be asked of the data and at the same time retains maximum zzso The three key issues addressed in this paper are as zzso zzso should zzso or mass zzso analyses be adopted, zzso should time be treated as an experimental factor or as a dimension of the measured response zzso and zzso how to form appropriate explanatory variables in a zzso observation zzso We review the relative merits of the different options and explain the rationale for our zzso In brief, we motivate a mass zzso approach in terms of sensitivity to zzso zzso This involves modeling responses at each zzso or space bin zzso In zzso we treat time as an experimental factor to enable zzso about temporally distributed responses that zzso multiple time zzso In a companion paper, we develop statistical models of zzso in the time domain that follow from the zzso established here and illustrate the approach using simulated and real zzso
