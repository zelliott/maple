zzso of cortical development zzso are commonly complicated by intractable focal zzso zzso in these disorders is not well understood and may depend on the type of zzso The cellular mechanisms involved in zzso and zzso events are notably different, and could be influenced independently by the type of zzso We evaluated the relationship between zzso and zzso zones in eight patients with different types of zzso in order to better understand the generation of these activities: four had zzso zzso two focal cortical zzso and two zzso band zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso technique to record simultaneously all cerebral structures with a high zzso zzso We recorded zzso and zzso events during the same zzso zzso events were either electrical only or clinical with minimal zzso zzso changes were found in the focal cortical zzso during zzso and zzso zzso events in the two patients with this zzso zzso and normal zzso were involved in zzso changes during zzso and zzso events in the two patients with double cortex, but the maximum zzso response was in the zzso band in both zzso Only two of the four patients with zzso zzso showed involvement of a zzso during zzso zzso During seizures, although zzso changes affected the zzso in two patients, the maximum was always in the zzso zzso and never in the zzso For two patients zzso recordings were available and confirm our zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of band zzso were involved in zzso and seizure zzso Even if the zzso gray matter zzso may have the cellular zzso to produce zzso events, the often abnormal zzso zzso is more likely to be involved during the zzso The zzso zzso study of zzso and zzso events in zzso patients may help to understand the role of the zzso in zzso and also determine the potential surgical zzso
