zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used for imaging acute zzso zzso We used zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso to study the dynamics of zzso human zzso We examined 30 patients zzso age zzso years, range zzso years, median 57 zzso with a diagnosis of zzso They were examined in the acute zzso zzso to 47 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso and chronic zzso zzso stages of zzso using clinical scores and zzso Imaging was performed on an zzso zzso zzso zzso with diffusion zzso in all three zzso an zzso zzso trace pulse zzso sequence and zzso zzso were zzso In all patients both zzso sequences showed a decrease in the apparent diffusion zzso zzso in the acute stage, even when zzso images did not reveal signal zzso Clinical features correlated with zzso site but not zzso The zzso was initially zzso less than that of zzso tissue and increased to normal after 7 days in conventionally treated patients and after zzso days in patients who underwent zzso zzso In the chronic stage the zzso rose by up to zzso zzso In patients who did not undergo zzso zzso changes correlated with the final zzso size zzso It was possible to differentiate acute from chronic zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a sensitive and zzso tool for detecting early cerebral zzso It is possible to predict in the acute stage the final size of an zzso zzso may be helpful for clinical decisions and for monitoring zzso
