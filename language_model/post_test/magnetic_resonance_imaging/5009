The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between brain zzso zzso zzso levels and the detection rate of new documented zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso stroke zzso enrolled within 24 hours of zzso Patients with zzso on admission zzso or with histories of zzso were zzso The plasma zzso level was measured on admission, and the factors associated with new documented zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the detection rates of zzso according to zzso level were zzso A total of zzso patients were zzso zzso was detected in 40 patients (new zzso zzso zzso The median zzso level of the new zzso group was significantly higher than for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso p zzso The zzso level, sensitivity, and specificity of zzso levels to distinguish the new zzso group from the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and a plasma zzso level zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso were independently associated with new zzso The detection rates of zzso according to zzso level were as zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso of those with 50 to zzso zzso zzso of those with 100 to zzso zzso zzso of those with 200 to zzso zzso and 38% of those with zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso levels can predict new zzso in patients with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso levels result in an increase in the frequency of detection of new zzso
