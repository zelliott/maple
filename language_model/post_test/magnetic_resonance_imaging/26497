To evaluate the safety and feasibility of magnetic resonance zzso imaging at zzso T in patients with implanted cardiac zzso 

zzso models of zzso and 44 zzso zzso were exposed to in zzso MR imaging with continuous registration of zzso output and temperature at the lead zzso Prior to MR imaging examination, zzso were programmed to an zzso mode zzso zzso or zzso zzso were examined before and after MR zzso zzso patients with implanted zzso underwent 51 MR imaging examinations under zzso zzso continuous zzso pulse zzso and zzso zzso 

MR imaging was safely performed in all zzso None of the zzso displayed a pacing dysfunction at MR zzso No changes occurred in the programmed parameters in any device tested in zzso or in zzso zzso increases in the temperature at the lead tips were zzso degrees C at a specific zzso rate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso degrees C under a worst-case zzso zzso heating condition with an zzso of zzso zzso 

MR imaging at zzso T can be safely performed in patients with implanted zzso in carefully selected clinical circumstances when appropriate strategies zzso to an zzso mode, adequate monitoring techniques, limited zzso zzso are zzso
