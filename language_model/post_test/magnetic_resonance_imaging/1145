The zzso ability of established diagnostic criteria for zzso of the breast is zzso and their relative relevance using artificial neural networks zzso is zzso A total of 89 women with 105 zzso verified breast zzso zzso invasive zzso 2 in zzso zzso and 30 benign zzso were included in this zzso A zzso zzso zzso sequence was acquired before and seven times after the intravenous administration of zzso zzso at a dose of zzso zzso body zzso ANN models were built to test the zzso ability of zzso zzso and combined MR zzso The subjects were randomly divided into two zzso a training set of 59 zzso and a zzso set of 46 zzso The training set was used for learning, and the performance of each model was evaluated on the zzso set by measuring the area under the zzso curve zzso An zzso minimized model was constructed using the most relevant input variables that were determined by the automatic relevance determination zzso zzso ANN models were compared with the performance of a human zzso zzso type, zzso enhancement, and zzso ratio showed the highest zzso ability among diagnostic criteria and comprised the minimized zzso Compared with the expert zzso zzso zzso zzso using the same prediction scale, the minimized ANN model performed best zzso zzso zzso followed by the best kinetic zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso model zzso zzso zzso The performance of a neural network prediction model is comparable to that of an expert zzso A zzso approach is preferred for the analysis of diagnostic criteria when many parameters are involved and complex zzso relationships exist in the data zzso
