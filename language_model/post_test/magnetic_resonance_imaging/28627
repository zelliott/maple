The long-term changes during late delayed zzso brain damage were investigated by serial magnetic resonance zzso imaging of eight patients over a mean follow-up period of 45 months after zzso The radiation damage appeared as an enhanced zzso on zzso MR images with zzso acid zzso at 3 to 30 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso In all patients, an abnormal high signal intensity area on zzso imaging preceded the enhanced zzso The volume and number of enhanced zzso continued to increase for 3 to 23 months zzso zzso zzso The high signal intensity area on zzso imaging simultaneously zzso The zzso were subsequently zzso and in four long-term survivors, the zzso zzso then decreased in size, the intervals from onset to zzso were 12, 13, 17, and 35 months zzso zzso zzso zzso However, two patients showed a zzso of the enhanced zzso with zzso periods of 8 and 9 months, zzso Finally, the zzso brain became zzso including the high signal intensity area on zzso zzso Late delayed zzso brain damage continues to progress for over a year and then zzso but thereafter a zzso may zzso
