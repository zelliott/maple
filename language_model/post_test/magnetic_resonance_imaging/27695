The aim of this study is to analyze the zzso distribution of zzso and zzso syndromes in children and to describe the magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities found in these zzso 

Data from zzso children aged 1 month to 15 years at the time of diagnosis of zzso were zzso A routine zzso has been requested in all patients with zzso at diagnosis according to a standardized pediatric seizure zzso zzso on zzso were classified as either significant or zzso zzso scoring zzso International League Against zzso criteria were used for zzso 

The prevalence of significant zzso abnormalities was zzso (in infants zzso in childhood zzso and in adolescents zzso The most common abnormalities included zzso zzso zzso volume loss zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enlargement zzso 

The use of zzso and a reliable standardized scoring system at diagnosis of zzso in children identified a high rate of significant abnormalities zzso This may have important implications for practice guidelines in this zzso
