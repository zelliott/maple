Parkinson's disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting zzso zzso in the zzso zzso leading to dysfunctional zzso zzso In addition to the characteristic motor symptoms, zzso patients often show cognitive zzso affective changes and other zzso symptoms, suggesting zzso effects on brain zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso based analysis methods to investigate altered zzso intrinsic functional connectivity in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso compared to healthy controls zzso zzso zzso Global network properties indicated less efficient processing in zzso Analysis of brain network zzso pointed to increased connectivity within the zzso network, but decreased interaction of the visual network with other brain zzso We found lower connectivity mainly between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso To identify regions of altered zzso we mapped the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity both on zzso and on zzso across the zzso Compared to healthy controls, zzso patients showed lower connectedness in the zzso and middle zzso zzso The degree of connectivity was also decreased in the zzso lobe zzso and zzso but increased in the superior zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and supplementary motor zzso Our results on global network and module properties indicated that zzso zzso as a zzso zzso This was most apparent in the visual network zzso The higher connectedness within the zzso module in zzso patients may be related to compensation mechanism in order to overcome the functional deficit of the zzso motor zzso or to loss of mutual zzso between brain zzso zzso connectivity in the visual network may be related to adaptation and compensation processes as a consequence of altered motor zzso Our analysis approach proved sensitive for detecting zzso localized effects as well as changes in network functions on intermediate and global zzso
