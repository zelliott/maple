To determine the natural history of zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso syndrome after composite graft repair of the zzso zzso 

A total 224 magnetic resonance zzso images obtained in 48 patients with zzso syndrome over a period of zzso years zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso On each image, the diameter of the zzso zzso was measured and the presence of dissection or major peripheral artery zzso was zzso 

In 31 zzso of the 48 patients, no statistically significant change (3 zzso or less increase in zzso in the diameter of the zzso occurred during the study zzso zzso in the remaining 17 zzso patients, a significant change occurred zzso than 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean initial diameter of the native zzso was slightly larger in group 2 zzso 27 zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso than in group 1 zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso In group 1, the mean rate of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in group 2, the rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patients with zzso dissection were in group 1, whereas 14 such patients were in group 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso that involved major peripheral arteries were present in four zzso of the 31 group 1 patients and in 12 zzso of the 17 group 2 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso intervention was necessary in two group 1 patients and in 14 group 2 patients zzso zzso zzso 

A subset of patients with zzso syndrome zzso multiple forms of zzso including progressive zzso zzso zzso and peripheral artery aneurysm after composite zzso graft repair of the ascending zzso Patients with these characteristics merit more frequent MR follow-up since further surgery was often necessary in these zzso
