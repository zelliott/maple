In this study, a zzso Algorithm zzso is introduced to zzso the zzso spatial selective zzso pulse to reduce the zzso and zzso errors of zzso profile while limiting the transition zzso This method is also used to diminish the zzso effect of the Bloch equation for large tip angle zzso pulse zzso The zzso pulse is first designed by the zzso method and then coded into float strings to form an initial zzso zzso operators are then applied to this population to perform evolution, which is an zzso zzso In this process, an evaluation function defined as the sum of the zzso of zzso and zzso errors is used to assess the fitness value of each individual, so as to find the best individual in current zzso It is possible to zzso the zzso pulse after a number of zzso zzso results of the Bloch equation show that in a 90 degrees zzso pulse design, compared with the zzso method, a zzso zzso pulse can reduce the zzso and zzso error by zzso and zzso respectively, while maintaining the transition zzso within 2 zzso (about zzso of the whole 32 zzso zzso In a 180 degrees inversion pulse design, the zzso error can be reduced by zzso while the transition is also kept at 2 zzso in a whole 32 zzso zzso
