zzso substances used to achieve zzso during zzso procedures comprise 3 principal classes based on chemical zzso zzso gelatin zzso zzso oxidized zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aides include various forms of cotton and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso agents have been reported to cause symptomatic mass zzso most commonly following zzso zzso zzso examination typically shows a core of zzso zzso agent surrounded by an inflammatory zzso Each agent exhibits distinctive zzso features that often permit specific zzso zzso mass zzso have been variously referred to as zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

The aims of this study were to zzso identify cases of zzso proven cases of zzso in zzso operations, zzso characterize the specific zzso agent associated with zzso formation, and zzso characterize the zzso magnetic resonance imaging appearance of zzso 

Cases in which a zzso constituted the sole finding on repeat surgery for zzso brain zzso or was a clinically significant component of a zzso identified mass zzso together with residual zzso constituted the study zzso 

Five zzso were identified and zzso The primary zzso was different in each case and included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In all cases, zzso magnetic resonance imaging suggested zzso zzso zzso included all categories of zzso zzso zzso Other foreign bodies were present in some zzso the origin of these foreign bodies was traced to fibers shed from zzso zzso material placed temporarily during surgery and removed before closure zzso and zzso zzso reactions included giant cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso were associated with a striking zzso zzso that was not seen with any other zzso zzso 

zzso agents may produce clinically zzso zzso apparent mass zzso When considering a mass zzso arising after zzso surgery, the differential diagnosis should include zzso along with zzso tumor and radiation zzso
