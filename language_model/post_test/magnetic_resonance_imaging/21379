To evaluate zzso using zzso and zzso mapping sequences in patients with suspected zzso iron overload zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive patients with clinically suspected zzso were zzso zzso All underwent zzso and liver zzso For the zzso of liver zzso values we used a zzso zzso zzso echo sequence with 12 echoes zzso zzso zzso flip angle zzso zzso values were obtained using a fast zzso mapping sequence based on an inversion recovery snapshot zzso zzso zzso maps were zzso using regions of zzso 

zzso analysis calculated zzso points at zzso and zzso for zzso in the determination of zzso with accuracy zzso sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso zzso correctly classified 20 patients zzso All patients with zzso only had decreased zzso and zzso relaxation zzso There was a significant difference in zzso between patients with zzso only and patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso relaxation diagnoses zzso very accurately, even at low iron zzso Important additional information may be obtained by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso accurate and zzso technique for zzso the evidence of even low zzso iron zzso 

zzso zzso iron overload causes fibrosis, zzso and increases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detects iron because of the field zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso relaxation is very accurate in diagnosing zzso iron zzso zzso Additional information may be obtained by zzso and zzso zzso
