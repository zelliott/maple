In human spatial recognition, right and left are not recognized zzso Although there have been many studies on the zzso asymmetry of the human brain, zzso in high-level recognition (such as independence from input or output zzso have not been studied zzso We found that the human brain recognizes right and left zzso in high-level zzso zzso were performed in which participants crossed their hands and were required to judge the side of a tactile stimulus on the index finger in two different zzso zzso hand was zzso or zzso which side of the space the touched hand was zzso The right inferior frontal region was significantly more activated by the zzso defined zzso stimulus zzso stimulation in the zzso zzso context and zzso stimulation in the zzso zzso zzso than by the zzso defined zzso zzso However, no zzso that was more activated by the zzso defined zzso than by the zzso defined zzso was zzso This zzso zzso suggests that zzso is the more outstanding side for human spatial zzso
