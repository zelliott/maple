The relation between recovery of brain function and neurological status after clinical and experimental cerebral zzso is incompletely zzso We assessed the evolution of zzso injury, behavioral status, and brain activity at acute to chronic periods after transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso in zzso 

Male zzso rats were subjected to 20-minute zzso zzso or sham operation zzso zzso behavioral testing and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso were performed before and up to 21 days after zzso zzso and zzso parameters were evaluated in 5 regions of interest within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were calculated according to previously established viability zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were present during zzso but disappeared completely and permanently within 30 minutes after zzso with no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and behavioral deficits did not zzso until 1 and 21 days after zzso zzso zzso demonstrated selective zzso cell death at 7 and 21 days after zzso 

zzso zzso produced distinct changes on zzso zzso zzso and behavioral parameters acutely and zzso zzso findings on zzso after transient zzso may not indicate normal tissue status, as behavioral and zzso anomalies zzso zzso dysfunction zzso long after the recovery of zzso parameters may relate to the subtle zzso damage seen on zzso Together, these results may help explain unremitting neurological deficits in stroke or transient zzso attack patients with normal zzso zzso
