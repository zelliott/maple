To measure prostate motion with magnetic resonance imaging zzso during a course of zzso zzso 

Seven patients with prostate zzso were scanned zzso on a zzso zzso system with weekly zzso and zzso zzso zzso images in 3 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso volumes and position of the zzso zzso zzso and margins relative to the zzso pelvis were zzso 

All zzso positions were at the mean position as zzso from the zzso scans in each zzso The zzso zzso zzso as 1 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso directions was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The largest zzso occurred at the zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso A strong correlation was found between large zzso volume zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso A weak correlation was found between zzso volume and superior zzso zzso 

All zzso positions were representative of the subsequent zzso zzso A clinical target volume zzso expansion of zzso zzso in any direction was sufficient to ascertain a zzso coverage of the zzso within the planning target volume zzso provided that a zzso zzso is administered to avoid zzso zzso and that the patient has a comfortably filled zzso zzso zzso
