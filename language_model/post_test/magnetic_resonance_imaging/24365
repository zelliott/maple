To investigate zzso zzso of clinical functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging, including influence of task zzso on zzso and use of various parameters to inform the zzso whether the reliability of a given functional zzso is high or zzso 

Local ethics committees approved the study; all participants gave written informed zzso Eight women and seven men zzso age, 40 zzso were zzso investigated at three experienced functional MR sites with zzso zzso zzso or zzso (one zzso zzso zzso motor and highly standardized zzso versions of a frequently requested clinical task zzso of the primary zzso zzso were zzso zzso functional MR zzso was assessed zzso zzso zzso center of mass zzso zzso zzso correlation values, overlap ratio zzso zzso size zzso Data quality measures for functional MR images included percentage signal change zzso zzso ratio zzso and head motion zzso Data were analyzed with analysis of zzso and a correlation zzso 

zzso of zzso functional MR activity differed by 8 zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso zzso among zzso Peak zzso varied up to zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity range, zzso zzso Signal strength zzso zzso was significantly lower for the zzso task zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso than for the motor task zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was larger with low signal strength zzso correlations between signal strength and peak zzso zzso even if the task was highly standardized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Clinical practice and clinical functional MR zzso studies should consider that the center of zzso brain zzso may vary up to zzso zzso with the investigating site, and should maximize functional MR signal strength and evaluate reliability of local results with zzso and zzso
