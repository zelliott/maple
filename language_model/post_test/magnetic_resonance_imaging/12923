zzso and zzso are nitrogen retaining and zzso but the impact of long-term exposure to zzso zzso and zzso either from zzso overproduction in zzso or zzso sources, on skeletal muscle zzso mass is not zzso 

The objectives of the study were to assess zzso mass by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso and test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso lean tissue zzso estimates of zzso accurately estimate true zzso zzso 

The design was a zzso study in 27 zzso patients compared with predicted models developed in 315 zzso subjects and to matched zzso 

Mass of zzso from zzso zzso and lean tissue from zzso were zzso 

zzso mass did not differ from predicted or control values in active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue mass zzso was higher in zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference between lean tissue mass zzso and zzso in zzso patients was higher than that in controls zzso zzso zzso consistent with an enlarged zzso lean compartment in zzso zzso mass predicted by zzso correlated highly with zzso mass by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso indicating high agreement of these measures of zzso 

zzso mass in active zzso patients did not differ from predicted zzso zzso mass estimated from zzso agreed highly with zzso by zzso supporting the zzso of the zzso model in assessing zzso in zzso and other disorders of zzso zzso
