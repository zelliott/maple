The objective of this study was to use advanced MR techniques to evaluate and compare cartilage repair tissue after zzso zzso zzso transplantation zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirty-four patients treated with zzso underwent zzso zzso of the zzso Patients were treated on either zzso zzso zzso 17) or zzso zzso zzso 17) cartilage and were matched by age and zzso zzso For zzso zzso the MR observation of cartilage repair tissue zzso score was used, with a zzso zzso For zzso assessment, zzso mapping was prepared by using a zzso zzso approach with particular attention to the cartilage zzso zzso zzso evaluation was done by analyses of zzso The zzso score showed no significant differences between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso With regard to zzso zzso relaxation, higher zzso values were found throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso values from deep to superficial was significant for control cartilage zzso zzso zzso and cartilage repair tissue zzso zzso zzso with an earlier onset in the repair tissue of the zzso The assessment of cartilage repair tissue of the zzso and zzso afforded comparable zzso results, whereas zzso zzso values showed differences, possibly due to dissimilar zzso loading zzso
