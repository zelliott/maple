The effect of the inhalation of pure oxygen on the kidney was evaluated by measuring zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times in nine volunteers using a zzso zzso spin echo and multiple echo zzso echo zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso decreased significantly when breathing pure oxygen as compared to zzso (from zzso zzso 59 to zzso zzso 70 zzso P zzso zzso while that of the zzso zzso was zzso No significant changes were seen in the zzso of either zzso Dynamic imaging using an inversion recovery sequence with an zzso inversion time typically produced signal changes of zzso in the zzso zzso Studies to assess if zzso changes in flow contributed to this effect showed that the flow contribution was not zzso Although longer inversion times zzso zzso produced optimal contrast, acceptable contrast was also obtained at shorter inversion times zzso zzso in the zzso cortex, zzso and zzso with the latter being of opposite polarity to the other two zzso zzso a shorter zzso zzso than previously reported in the zzso The results are consistent with oxygen acting as an zzso contrast agent which zzso a zzso of zzso in the zzso blood zzso
