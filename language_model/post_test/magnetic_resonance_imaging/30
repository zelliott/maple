To improve the zzso of zzso input function zzso registration and absolute cerebral blood flow zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso at zzso we zzso the zzso by use of a zzso output function zzso We compared zzso estimates of 20 healthy, elderly volunteers, obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on two consecutive zzso zzso calculated without the zzso zzso did not result in any significant correlation with zzso The zzso zzso showed fair to moderate correlation with zzso for the central gray matter zzso and the whole zzso Our results indicate that the method used for correction of partial volume effects zzso improves zzso experiments by reducing zzso zzso at zzso
