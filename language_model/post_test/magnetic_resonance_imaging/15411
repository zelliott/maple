Novel strategies for cancer treatment involving zzso therapeutic agents have been recently developed and show promising zzso zzso and zzso zzso in tumor tissue has been shown to be a major obstacle for these compounds in clinical cancer zzso Such zzso have been difficult to account for in zzso zzso A three-dimensional zzso model was developed to investigate the role of zzso zzso on zzso transport within a zzso zzso The model accounts for zzso and zzso transport in a porous zzso zzso variation of fluid zzso rate per unit volume of tissue and vascular zzso were estimated from a dynamic zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso maps were embedded in a model of tumor tissue and used to predict zzso fluid pressure zzso and fluid zzso As in previous studies, pressure profiles were predicted to be elevated within the zzso The model predicted zzso variation in zzso directed zzso zzso with lower zzso predicted near the skin zzso zzso tissue distribution of a zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 60 zzso was found to be zzso with lower zzso predicted in certain central zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso were less zzso than zzso zzso In sensitivity analysis, predicted zzso zzso was enhanced by increasing vascular zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso relative to the surrounding tissue reduced the overall drug zzso
