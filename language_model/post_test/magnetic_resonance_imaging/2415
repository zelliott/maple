The purpose of this study was to evaluate detection of urinary tract zzso depiction of obstruction level and determination of cause with zzso MR imaging in an acquisition time of zzso zzso Heavily zzso zzso MR images in 50 patients with zzso as suspected by ultrasound were zzso compared with IV zzso and clinical zzso Imaging techniques were obtained within a maximum time zzso of 4 h and assessed independently on the same zzso zzso MR zzso was able to demonstrate zzso and obstruction levels in 96 % of urinary tracts in accordance with X-ray zzso In 4 patients with a unilaterally negative IV zzso obstruction levels were demonstrated in zzso MR zzso zzso MR zzso did not depict 2 of 7 collecting systems with mild zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not adequately zzso zzso MR zzso consistently zzso zzso urinary tracts and obstruction levels in moderate and severe zzso zzso MR zzso may be an alternative for IV zzso in cases of zzso zzso when zzso contrast or the application of zzso is zzso and may help in avoiding direct zzso zzso MR zzso rarely allows determination of the cause of urinary tract zzso
