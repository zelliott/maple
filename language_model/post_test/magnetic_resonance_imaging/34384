To demonstrate the utility of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the diagnosis of complete and partial zzso injuries in patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso 

Five patients with suspected zzso had MR imaging performed within an average of 4 days after zzso MR scans were reviewed with specific analysis of zzso zzso zzso Charts were reviewed to obtain clinical information regarding zzso treatment, hospital course, and zzso 

Two patients demonstrated MR evidence of complete zzso One had disruption of all zzso major zzso structures at the zzso junction with zzso and evidence of zzso zzso The second had injuries to the zzso zzso superior band of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ligament at C zzso The remaining three patients sustained incomplete severance of the zzso structures at the zzso zzso All patients demonstrated subtle zzso findings suggestive of zzso including soft tissue swelling at the zzso junction without zzso The two patients with complete zzso zzso The three patients with partial zzso were treated with zzso On zzso these three children were zzso following their zzso zzso 

MR imaging of acute zzso provides accurate identification of the zzso ligaments injured, zzso of full versus partial zzso zzso and analysis of accompanying spinal zzso zzso This information is important for early appropriate zzso management and preservation of zzso function in zzso
