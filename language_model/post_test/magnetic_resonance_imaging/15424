Because zzso iron oxide is actively taken into the zzso system, the signal intensity observed on zzso images is reduced not only in the liver but also in the zzso There is no difference in the reduction in signal intensity in the liver after contrast between the zzso and zzso but the reduction in signal intensity in the zzso is zzso In the present study, we examined the efficacy of zzso imaging to compensate for the reduction in signal intensity in the zzso by administering zzso 

We examined the images obtained from 35 patients who underwent zzso with zzso zzso images and zzso images were obtained before and after administration of zzso and the changes in signal intensity in the liver and zzso were then zzso 

A reduction in signal intensity was observed in the liver by both zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso the signal intensity was reduced on zzso images but was not reduced on zzso zzso 

The reduction in signal intensity due to administration of zzso is low in the zzso Thus, it was considered necessary to approach the problem of diagnosing zzso zzso tissue using zzso with zzso
