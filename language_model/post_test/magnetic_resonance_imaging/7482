The purpose of this study is to determine whether benign whole body tumor volume of zzso zzso zzso is a risk factor for zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso in individuals with zzso type 1 zzso Thirty-one zzso patients with zzso and 62 zzso and zzso zzso patients without zzso who had undergone whole body magnetic resonance imaging zzso were analyzed for benign whole body tumor zzso zzso U test, zzso signed ranks test, zzso exact test zzso and zzso zzso analysis were used for statistical zzso Sixteen percent of all patients with zzso did not have internal zzso The median whole body benign tumor volume in patients with zzso was zzso zzso among the zzso group and zzso zzso in the comparison group zzso zzso zzso When the patients were zzso by age as younger or older than 30 years zzso age of zzso zzso the median benign whole body tumor volume was zzso zzso in zzso patients and zzso zzso in control patients younger than 30 years zzso zzso zzso The mean number of zzso in zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso median zzso and zzso zzso zzso median zzso in patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of zzso development increased zzso % with each additional zzso of benign zzso volume zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso 95 % confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and was higher in patients younger than 30 years zzso OR zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso p zzso zzso Higher numbers of zzso larger whole body benign tumor volume, and younger age are important risk factors for zzso We identified a zzso of patients with zzso without internal zzso on zzso and the lack of correlation of zzso development with tumor burden in older zzso These findings may alter our belief that all zzso arise from pre-existing zzso and suggest that surveillance zzso based on clinical suspicion may be warranted in older patients, zzso
