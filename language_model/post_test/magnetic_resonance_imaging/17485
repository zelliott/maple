zzso use of high field zzso has greatly contributed to the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, because zzso enables to zzso degenerative process showing either zzso of the specific areas or zzso of specific zzso Among many specific zzso signs which have been zzso proposed to be diagnostic for certain neurodegenerative disorders, the author discussed here some clinically useful ones with zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly diagnostic for progressive zzso zzso zzso because it represents focal zzso of the zzso portion of zzso zzso where the neural centers for vertical gaze specifically affected in zzso are zzso zzso Wilson disease patients show frequently zzso of giant panda zzso of zzso which disappears after successful zzso Although the sign is zzso for Wilson disease, zzso entity of this zzso zzso has not been known zzso zzso enables to discriminate two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso fibers are lost, and zzso zzso in which loss of zzso cells is the main pathological zzso In zzso zzso zzso white matter shows zzso high signal due to the zzso of nerve fibers in it but zzso low signal of zzso nucleus is usually well zzso This combination of degenerative process zzso black teeth zzso of zzso nucleus in zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso shows zzso teeth zzso of zzso nucleus, because the loss of zzso cell zzso causes signal change of zzso nucleus where the zzso of zzso cells are zzso zzso teeth zzso could also be observed in case of the zzso of zzso nucleus itself, like in zzso but differential diagnosis between zzso cell loss and zzso zzso is not so difficult, because the zzso of the superior zzso zzso is zzso in the latter but never seen in the former zzso
