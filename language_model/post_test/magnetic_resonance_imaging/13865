The aim of this study was to review the outcome of patients who underwent surgery for treatment of cerebral zzso zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed in 147 patients with cerebral zzso from melanoma who were treated surgically at a single institution between 1979 and zzso Almost all patients underwent zzso zzso radiation zzso The mean patient age was 53 years zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients were zzso A single cerebral zzso was identified in zzso of patients, although zzso had zzso zzso zzso The 30-day zzso mortality rate was zzso and neurological symptoms resolved or improved in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso disease was seen in zzso of patients and zzso died of zzso zzso zzso patients underwent zzso for zzso cerebral zzso The median survival duration from the time of surgery for all patients was zzso zzso the 3- and zzso survival rates were zzso and zzso zzso zzso that significantly influenced survival on zzso analysis were the number of cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso complete zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for recurrence zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso did not significantly influence zzso On zzso analysis only the number of cerebral zzso significantly affected survival zzso zzso zzso 

For the majority of patients with cerebral zzso from melanoma, surgery with zzso radiation therapy is a treatment option that improves neurological symptoms and produces minimal zzso zzso survival zzso 3 zzso most likely occurs in patients with a single cerebral zzso and no zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cerebral disease may be appropriate in selected zzso
