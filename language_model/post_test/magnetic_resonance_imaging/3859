zzso peripheral zzso access zzso presents many advantages over the reference zzso technique in both adults and children in emergency zzso 

To compare zzso with the blind technique in children zzso years undergoing general zzso 

After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee and informed consent from the parents, we included all children zzso years scheduled to undergo general zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso who presented difficult zzso zzso The children were zzso into two groups: the US group zzso and the B group zzso The primary zzso was time to zzso (from zzso placement to successful IV zzso compared between zzso group and B group by zzso zzso Secondary outcomes were success rate at the first zzso number of zzso and diameter of the zzso zzso requiring zzso zzso were considered as zzso In case of failure in group B, zzso was attempted for a further 15 zzso 

Twenty children were included in each zzso Groups were comparable for sex, age, and zzso zzso differences were observed in median time to zzso zzso s vs zzso zzso zzso vs B respectively, P zzso zzso median number of zzso (1 vs zzso zzso vs B, P zzso zzso and success rate at first zzso zzso vs zzso zzso vs B, P zzso zzso In contrast, overall success rate did not differ significantly between groups zzso vs zzso zzso vs B, P zzso zzso 

zzso peripheral zzso access leads to faster peripheral IV access and should therefore be recommended in children presenting with difficult zzso zzso
