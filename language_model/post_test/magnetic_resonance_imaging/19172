zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso have been extensively used to explore the functional zzso of cognitive zzso Here we review 275 PET and zzso studies of attention zzso selective, zzso orientation, zzso perception zzso face, zzso zzso imagery zzso zzso language zzso word recognition, zzso spoken zzso working memory zzso object, zzso problem zzso semantic memory retrieval zzso zzso episodic memory zzso zzso object, zzso episodic memory retrieval zzso zzso success, effort, mode, zzso zzso zzso zzso and procedural memory zzso zzso and zzso skill zzso To identify consistent zzso patterns associated with these cognitive operations, data from 412 contrasts were summarized at the level of cortical zzso areas, zzso thalamus, zzso lobe (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso For perception and imagery, zzso patterns included primary and secondary regions in the zzso and zzso zzso For attention and working memory, zzso were usually found in prefrontal and zzso zzso For language and semantic memory zzso typical regions included left prefrontal and zzso zzso For episodic memory zzso consistently activated regions included left prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso For episodic memory zzso zzso patterns included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso in prefrontal zzso or zzso zzso regions were consistently zzso For procedural memory, zzso were found in motor as well as in zzso brain zzso Analysis of regional zzso across cognitive zzso suggested that several brain regions, including the zzso are engaged by a variety of cognitive zzso These observations are discussed in relation to functional specialization as well as functional zzso
