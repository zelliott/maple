A method zzso for obtaining optimum zzso field zzso at zzso located away from the magnet zzso for use in zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso may be zzso using only zzso X, Y, and Z zzso to produce three-dimensional zzso current zzso thus avoiding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prior to volume selection ensures optimum spectral resolution and improves the efficiency and accuracy of the zzso zzso The benefits of the technique are illustrated by a high-resolution zzso spectrum of human zzso zzso
