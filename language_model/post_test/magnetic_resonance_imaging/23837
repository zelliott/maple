zzso transfer imaging zzso refers to an application of magnetic resonance imaging zzso designed as a means of exploring characteristics of zzso components in zzso Compared with conventional MR imaging, where differences in brightness on images reflect differences in observed relaxation times, zzso theory incorporates the influence of additional zzso specifically those reflecting the exchange of zzso between molecules of water and molecules of zzso structural zzso Thus, zzso offers the potential of a window on tissue structure, and structural components that are normally not resolvable with zzso The theory arises from the idea that the spin zzso of zzso components of tissue can be indirectly observed via observation of the conventionally visible spins of tissue zzso The extent of influence of the zzso transfer process can be reflected in a zzso index derived from two magnetic resonance images, which is known as the zzso transfer zzso zzso of this effect is of current interest in multiple sclerosis because it offers the potential for gains in specificity as well as sensitivity of the magnetic resonance zzso
