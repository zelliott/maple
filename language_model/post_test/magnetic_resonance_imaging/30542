To determine the enhancement phase providing the highest zzso ratio zzso between zzso and liver or portal vein on dynamic and delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso dynamic zzso and delayed zzso zzso of the liver was performed in 25 patients with zzso and correlated with surgical findings, pathology, and other imaging zzso zzso ratios for tumor relative to adjacent liver and portal vein were calculated from signal zzso determined from regions of interest obtained for each phase of zzso A zzso assessment of the signal intensity of the zzso zzso relative to the portal vein was made for each set of delayed zzso 

A mass was visible in 24 of 25 zzso zzso masses were zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of patients relative to liver on zzso zzso portal zzso and delayed images, zzso No single phase of zzso enhancement demonstrated consistently superior zzso zzso Delayed imaging demonstrated the highest zzso zzso in zzso of patients and the lowest in zzso The portal zzso phase demonstrated the highest zzso vein zzso in zzso of zzso Delayed zzso images demonstrated the lowest zzso vein zzso in 38% of zzso zzso zzso were zzso to portal vein in all but 1 patient on delayed zzso 

No single phase of dynamic and delayed zzso zzso demonstrates superior zzso between zzso and normally enhancing liver, although the portal phase provides the best zzso between tumor and portal vein in most zzso Although delayed enhancement is typical of zzso delayed imaging does not necessarily offer superior contrast between tumor and liver zzso compared with other zzso of zzso zzso between tumor and portal vein and zzso zzso may be difficult on delayed zzso
