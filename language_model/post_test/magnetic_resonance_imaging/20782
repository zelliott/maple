zzso zzso is attributed to a large extent to genetic and zzso zzso zzso investigating zzso might offer important evidence for disturbed zzso mechanisms in zzso As an extension of recent zzso analyses of zzso in schizophrenia the present study is the first to compare on a zzso basis mean zzso as a sensitive zzso for the identification of local zzso changes of the whole zzso in zzso zzso 

A group of 54 patients with zzso schizophrenia according to zzso and 54 age and gender matched healthy control subjects were zzso All participants underwent high-resolution zzso zzso scans on a zzso T zzso Mean zzso was calculated dividing the sum of the principal zzso by two at each point of the curved surface as implemented in the zzso Software zzso zzso cortical maps were created to estimate zzso differences between groups based on a zzso zzso 

A significantly increased zzso was observed in zzso schizophrenia patients relative to controls in a right zzso zzso zzso The cluster zzso a surface area of 750 zzso A further analysis of cortical thickness of this cluster demonstrated concurrent significant reduced cortical thickness of this zzso 

This is the first study to reveal an zzso zzso of the zzso surface in zzso zzso This finding is in line with substantial evidence showing zzso zzso lobe abnormalities in zzso The present zzso data provide further support for an early disruption of cortical maturation in zzso
