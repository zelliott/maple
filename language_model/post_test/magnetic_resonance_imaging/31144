The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using zzso TE zzso pulse sequences to image the zzso zzso 

Pulse sequences of zzso zzso were used to image the zzso spine in 5 normal subjects and 14 patients with degenerative zzso zzso enhancement was administered in 11 zzso 

The sequences showed high signal in the anterior and zzso zzso ligaments, the zzso end plate, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso ligaments and insertions of zzso zzso contrast enhancement was seen in these zzso Enhancement of zzso ligaments and zzso tissue was readily zzso Long zzso suppression techniques were useful in distinguishing enhancement of zzso tissue from zzso Enhancement in discs was more obvious than with conventional zzso In a case of zzso bands of high signal were seen in the zzso discs parallel to the end zzso 

The zzso sequences offer new options for visualizing discs, zzso zzso ligaments and other structures of the zzso spine in health and zzso
