We investigated the relative involvement of cortical regions supporting zzso control in older and younger adults during performance on a modified version of the zzso zzso Participants were exposed to two different types of zzso zzso One of these, an zzso condition, produces conflict at the zzso level, while the second, an zzso condition, produces conflict at both zzso and response levels of information zzso Greater zzso control is needed to perform the zzso condition compared to other zzso We examined the cortical recruitment associated with this task in an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm in 25 older and 25 younger zzso Our results indicated that while younger adults demonstrated an increase in the zzso of cortical regions responsible for maintaining zzso control in response to increased levels of conflict, such sensitivity and flexibility of the cortical regions to increased zzso control demands was absent in older zzso These results suggest a limitation in older adults' capabilities for zzso recruiting the zzso network in response to increasing zzso zzso
