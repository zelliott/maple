To assess the frequency, zzso and fate of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso and to compare this to the frequency in patients without liver zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso but no other known liver disease and who underwent 2 abdominal magnetic resonance imaging zzso examinations at least 1 year apart formed one study zzso zzso subjects without zzso or other known liver disease and who also underwent 2 zzso examinations at least 1 year apart formed a control zzso Two zzso evaluated the initial study for the presence and characteristics of zzso enhancing zzso not visible on other sequences and assessed the fate of these zzso on the follow-up zzso 

Of the patients with zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a total of 108 zzso enhancing zzso compared with 20 zzso enhancing zzso in zzso of controls zzso zzso zzso Both the number of subjects with at least one zzso enhancing focus and the mean number per subject were significantly greater in the zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso The zzso enhancing zzso were generally small and peripheral in location in both zzso On follow-up examination, all zzso disappeared, decreased in size, were stable, or increased slightly in size while remaining zzso on other zzso 

zzso consistent with zzso zzso were observed at an unexpectedly high frequency in the control group but at a significantly greater frequency in the zzso zzso All zzso exhibited benign behavior on long-term zzso Future studies may assess for clinical implications of this finding in patients with zzso zzso
