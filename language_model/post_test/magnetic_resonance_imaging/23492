To describe the zzso imaging framework for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso assessment of zzso changes in Alzheimer's disease and report on early results from the first 24 months of the zzso 

A zzso study similarly to a faux clinical trial has been established to assess zzso zzso changes in zzso disease zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and healthy control subjects using an image acquisition protocol compatible with zzso disease zzso initiative zzso Comprehensive quality control zzso measures have been established throughout the zzso An intelligent zzso database holds details on both the raw images and data processed using a sophisticated image analysis zzso 

A total of zzso subjects have been recruited zzso zzso 131 zzso 117 healthy zzso of which a high percentage zzso of the zzso volumes passed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso whole brain volume and whole brain cortical thickness showed significant differences between zzso and controls, zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso 

A framework for zzso zzso studies of Alzheimer's disease has been established consisting of a zzso zzso acquisition protocol across zzso rigorous zzso at both the sites and central data analysis hub and an automated image analysis zzso Early results demonstrate the high quality of the images acquired and the zzso of the automated image analysis techniques zzso
