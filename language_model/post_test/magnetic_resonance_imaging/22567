The objective of this prospective study was to verify changes in the position of the zzso joint zzso disc by means of magnetic resonance images zzso in adolescent patients treated with the zzso zzso 

Twenty consecutive Class II Division 1 patients treated with zzso appliances were selected for the zzso zzso were analyzed at 3 zzso immediately before zzso treatment zzso 8 to 10 weeks after zzso placement zzso and at the end of the 12-month zzso treatment, immediately after zzso removal zzso 

Class I or zzso Class I zzso relationships were observed after zzso zzso The qualitative evaluation showed that each patient had the disc within normal limits at zzso At zzso a slight tendency toward disc zzso because of zzso advancement was observed, but, at zzso the disc returned to normal, similar to zzso zzso By using a quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso of the zzso showed that there was no change of disc position from zzso to zzso except in the central zzso which had a zzso position of the zzso disc at zzso 

During the 12-month period of zzso zzso treatment, mild changes in the position of the disc occurred in patients whose zzso discs were within normal limits at zzso These changes were within normal zzso limits when evaluated in the short zzso
