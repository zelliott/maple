: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a zzso system and integrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

: The approval from the institutional review board was zzso and the requirement for informed consent was zzso We zzso evaluated 135 zzso in 68 patients zzso men, 31 zzso mean age: 68 years; age zzso zzso zzso who underwent both zzso and zzso A total of 103 zzso were confirmed during surgery and 32 were confirmed by imaging findings during zzso The images were independently reviewed by 2 zzso The diagnostic zzso of zzso and zzso were determined by calculating the areas under each zzso receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity were compared using the zzso zzso 

: The mean area under the zzso on zzso versus zzso was zzso versus zzso for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso zzso in size zzso zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso values, and negative zzso value on a patient basis were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 57% for zzso zzso 

: zzso using a zzso system is more accurate than zzso especially for the detection of small zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso has a higher sensitivity and negative zzso value than zzso
