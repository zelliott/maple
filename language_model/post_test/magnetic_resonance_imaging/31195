Until now, patients with a shoulder instability being examined using magnetic resonance imaging have been placed in a position with the arm zzso or in the zzso position, as a result of the way conventional MR systems are zzso zzso resonance systems with an open zzso have made it possible, for the first time, to examine patients in the zzso position, which is a representative diagnostic position for anterior shoulder zzso This new examination position requires an exact understanding of layered imaging anatomy in order to clearly identify MR zzso The purpose of this study is to make possible a direct comparison of the respective abilities of MR zzso imaging and zzso zzso to clearly identify all MR structures of the shoulder positioned in the zzso zzso The two shoulders of a body donor were separated and stored in special position supports in the zzso zzso The magnetic resonance examination was carried out using a vertically open zzso MR system zzso zzso General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, zzso The following sequences were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE 20 zzso layer zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso The coronary und zzso MR zzso segments were subsequently planned in conjunction with zzso zzso for both zzso Using a direct comparison of MR images with the corresponding zzso zzso it was possible to clearly identify all MR zzso
