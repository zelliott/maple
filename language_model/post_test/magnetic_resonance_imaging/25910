zzso normal zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso (and in one case zzso dynamic zzso before and immediately after injection of zzso using zzso sequences with a short repetition zzso Images were obtained at 1 zzso intervals for 6 zzso at zzso zzso A zzso focal area with marked enhancement was seen in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso on the first image after injection of zzso The size of the early enhancing area in the zzso zzso zzso was compared with the high signal of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso was larger than the zzso in 10 cases zzso The two were equal in size in seven cases zzso The zzso was zzso convex in 11 cases zzso whereas zzso was zzso convex in 4 cases zzso We believe that zzso closely represents the real extent of the zzso zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso may involve only a portion of the zzso zzso
