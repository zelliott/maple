Surface zzso analysis was used to assess local shape variations in the zzso and zzso zzso of children with fetal alcohol spectrum zzso zzso structural magnetic resonance imaging images were acquired for 31 children (19 controls and 12 children diagnosed with fetal alcohol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were manually zzso and surface zzso were zzso An zzso closest point zzso was used to register the template of one control subject to all other shapes in order to capture the true geometry of the shape with a fixed number of landmark zzso A point distribution model was used to zzso the shape variations in terms of a change in zzso zzso Using the localized zzso zzso method, regions of significant shape variations between the control and exposed subjects were identified and mapped onto the mean zzso zzso masks of zzso and zzso zzso were generated from the segmented volumes of each zzso These were used to zzso the volumes and for further statistical zzso The zzso test was performed to predict volume differences between the zzso Although the exposed and control subjects did not differ significantly in their volumes, the shape analysis showed the zzso to be more zzso at the head and tail regions in the zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso nucleus zzso were dispersed across the tail and head zzso zzso analysis showed associations between the degree of zzso and the level of alcohol zzso These findings demonstrate that shape analysis using three-dimensional surface measures is sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure and provides additional information than zzso measures zzso
