Spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently diagnosed after unacceptable delays and are therefore treated at a zzso advanced zzso There is controversy regarding their treatment and the respective roles of zzso zzso and zzso We present our series of 47 patients to illustrate the necessity for early treatment and the value of an interdisciplinary zzso 

All patients exhibited suspicious magnetic resonance imaging and/or zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso revealed the zzso Twelve patients were treated primarily by surgical interruption of the zzso zzso draining zzso and eight patients underwent surgery after unsuccessful zzso Twelve patients were surgically treated several months after zzso because of the recruitment of collateral zzso zzso zzso was achieved for 15 zzso All patients were monitored with magnetic resonance imaging and at least one control zzso zzso zzso periods ranged from 2 months to 8 zzso 

There was an obvious male zzso with 35 male and 12 female zzso Only six of the patients were less than 50 years of zzso The zzso were found twice as often on the left side, compared with the zzso A total of zzso of the zzso were located between zzso and zzso zzso signs were most often progressive zzso with zzso of the patients exhibiting progression to a condition in which they could not walk without support or were confined to a zzso For 50% of the patients, the time at which the correct diagnosis was established was more than 15 months after the onset of the first zzso After treatment, 18 patients showed improvement zzso the conditions of 26 patients zzso were unchanged (without further zzso and the conditions of three patients zzso had zzso 

Attempts at zzso should be made at the time of zzso because no adverse effects were recorded in our series and there was a zzso chance of the patients being cured by that zzso zzso Even if zzso occurs, the internal labeling of a feeding vessel with zzso zzso material allows exact zzso zzso zzso of the origin of the draining zzso zzso minimally invasive surgical zzso
