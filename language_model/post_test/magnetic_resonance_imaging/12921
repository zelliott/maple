Action disorganization syndrome zzso is a frontal lobe zzso syndrome characterized by deficits in the performance of familiar sequential tasks such as making a cup of zzso In this study, we examined the performance of familiar sequential tasks by 3 patients with right frontal brain zzso and no other areas of brain zzso When zzso objects were presented as zzso in addition to the target objects, all patients used the zzso in accordance with the target zzso These patients showed few of the sequential and omission errors that had been previously reported in patients with zzso Although normal participants could suppress the zzso of zzso objects, these patients had difficulty with this process, which would normally be carried out by the right frontal lobe to determine the most suitable action zzso The intact left frontal lobe may receive bottom-up zzso from the zzso and modify this zzso to match the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that patients with only right frontal lobe damage may be characterized more by action zzso than by zzso
