Major breakthroughs have recently been reported that can help overcome two inherent drawbacks of zzso the lack of sensitivity and the limited memory of zzso zzso Dynamic nuclear polarization zzso couples nuclear spins to the large zzso of zzso thus making it possible to detect dilute zzso substances in magnetic resonance zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso We have designed a method to preserve enhanced zzso zzso by conversion into zzso states zzso It is shown that these enhanced zzso states can be generated for zzso zzso which afford sensitive zzso Even in complex molecules such as zzso zzso zzso states can be sustained effectively over time intervals on the order of tens of seconds, thus allowing zzso zzso to reach target areas and zzso access to slow zzso zzso The natural abundance zzso polarization has been enhanced ex zzso by almost four orders of magnitude in the zzso zzso The sample was transferred by the dissolution process to a high-resolution magnet where the zzso polarization was converted into a zzso state associated with a pair of zzso In zzso the lifetime zzso associated with the two zzso zzso zzso zzso sustained by suitable zzso zzso was found to be seven times longer than their zzso relaxation time constant zzso zzso zzso At desired zzso small zzso of the populations of zzso states were converted into zzso zzso This opens the way to observing slow chemical reactions and slow transport phenomena such as diffusion by enhanced magnetic zzso
