For nearly 100 years it has been believed that the main zzso of zzso occurs in zzso projections into the superior zzso zzso but a significant number of experiments and cases conflict with this zzso According to recently published studies, zzso is permanently produced and absorbed in the whole zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are speculated to have a role in the zzso of zzso have recently been revealed in the zzso root of the spinal zzso zzso zzso surface areas of zzso have been suggested to serve a putative role in zzso The zzso aim was to observe direct zzso connections between the zzso space and the zzso zzso 

Eleven adult (6 months old) New Zealand white male rabbits weighing approximately zzso zzso each were used in this zzso After obtaining zzso MR zzso images, zzso access was gained zzso via a zzso approach by using a zzso intravenous zzso zzso One rabbit died as a result of zzso trauma during zzso zzso before contrast administration, but contrast agent was still injected to see the possible MR imaging results of spinal zzso zzso after zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed at 15, 60, zzso and 180 minutes after the administration of contrast zzso After intramuscular injections of zzso 2 rabbits died 120 and 150 minutes after contrast injection, but the MR imaging study at 180 minutes after contrast injection was still zzso 

zzso connections between the zzso space and the zzso veins were observed in all rabbits during serial MR zzso The enhancement power was not affected by the amount of injected contrast agent or by cervical or zzso penetration but was increased at higher contrast zzso or upon seizure (physical zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso has been finally proved with direct zzso confirmation of spinal zzso zzso of zzso using serial MR zzso The authors believe that this study can help to develop a more accurate model of zzso zzso which will allow understanding of many zzso diseases, as well as the development of new strategies for zzso
