Children with zzso central zzso syndrome zzso a genetic disorder characterized by diminished drive to breathe during sleep and impaired zzso sensitivity, show brain structural and functional changes on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans, with impaired responses in specific zzso regions, suggesting localized zzso assessed total volume and regional variation in zzso surface zzso to identify areas affected in the zzso We studied 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso years; 8 zzso and 32 healthy control (age zzso years; 14 zzso children, and traced zzso on 1 zzso resolution zzso scans, collected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Regional zzso volume variations, adjusted for zzso volume, were compared between groups based on zzso of surface distances to the structure zzso with correction for multiple zzso zzso tissue losses emerged in zzso patients on the left side, with a trend for loss on the right; however, most areas affected on the left also showed equivalent zzso volume zzso zzso regional volumes appeared in the left zzso zzso bilateral areas in mid and zzso regions, and a zzso region, adjacent to the zzso volume losses may result from hypoxic exposure following zzso during zzso breathing, or from zzso or vascular consequences of genetic zzso in the zzso The sites of change overlap regions of abnormal functional responses to respiratory and zzso zzso zzso zzso areas have roles associated with memory, mood, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in these behavioral and zzso functions appear in zzso
