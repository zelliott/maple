The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of magnetic resonance zzso to detect zzso zzso obstruction and define zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the clinical consequences of zzso and are not reliably detected by current zzso diagnostic zzso 

zzso zzso were induced in zzso zzso zzso 7) by zzso zzso zzso high-resolution in zzso MR images were obtained using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences in a clinical zzso MR system at 6 zzso 1 day and at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 zzso At each time point one animal was sacrificed and the zzso carotid artery processed for zzso zzso signal intensity zzso was zzso to that of the adjacent zzso zzso age was assessed based on MR appearance by two blinded independent zzso 

zzso appearance and relative zzso revealed characteristic zzso changes in zzso MR images, reflecting zzso changes in the zzso Acute zzso appeared very bright on the zzso images, zzso the zzso Signal intensity was 197 zzso zzso at 6 zzso zzso at 1 week zzso zzso zzso reaching a plateau by 6 weeks zzso zzso zzso At six weeks, complete zzso organization was confirmed zzso The zzso images had similar pattern with lower zzso than zzso Age definition using visual appearance was highly accurate zzso zzso with 4 zzso ranging from 96 to 132 and Cohen's zzso at zzso to zzso zzso between observers was substantial zzso zzso with 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is a promising tool to zzso detect zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the characteristic visual appearance of the zzso have the potential to define zzso zzso
