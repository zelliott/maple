We sought to compare the zzso of the fetal head on MR imaging with zzso zzso in fetuses with and without suspected central nervous system zzso 

zzso retrospective zzso of zzso diameter, head zzso and zzso zzso obtained on MR imaging were assigned a zzso age on the basis of median zzso zzso and compared with zzso and clinical assignment of zzso age in fetuses with no central nervous system zzso In fetuses with central nervous system zzso the same MR zzso were compared with zzso zzso obtained within 1 zzso zzso fast zzso sequences were zzso zzso product moment correlation zzso and paired sample zzso tests were zzso 

In 22 fetuses with no suspected central nervous system zzso significant correlation was seen in the assignment of zzso age by MR zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 25 fetuses with central nervous system zzso significant correlation was also seen between zzso diameter and head circumference zzso The mean zzso diameter on MR imaging was greater than on zzso in those fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging zzso of zzso diameter, head zzso and zzso zzso are strongly correlated to zzso age in fetuses without central nervous system zzso zzso correlation is found between MR imaging and zzso zzso of zzso diameter and head circumference in fetuses with central nervous system zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso were seen with MR imaging than with zzso in the abnormal zzso Fetal central nervous system zzso can be performed as part of the MR imaging evaluation of the fetal central nervous zzso
