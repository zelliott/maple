The present study investigated the extent of cortical activity during overt picture naming using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Participants comprised 20 healthy, adult participants with ages ranging from 20 to 82 zzso While undergoing zzso participants completed a zzso task consisting of 60 zzso zzso 

Linear zzso analysis revealed a positive relationship between age and cortical zzso intensity in zzso and zzso areas as well as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, neural activity in the anterior zzso zzso an area thought to be involved in zzso processing, did not increase as a function of zzso 

These findings suggest age-related increases in cortical zzso during simple language tasks, such as picture naming, in brain areas typically associated with language zzso
