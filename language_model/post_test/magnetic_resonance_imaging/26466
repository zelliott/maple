This paper reviews the relative abilities of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso to detect Parkinson's disease and monitor its zzso Currently, the main role of zzso lies in its ability to discriminate zzso syndromes from Parkinson's zzso however, new zzso approaches may soon allow progression of zzso zzso to be zzso zzso MRS can also detect reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in many patients with zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso are both sensitive means of detecting the presence of impaired zzso terminal function in the zzso and following its zzso PET currently has the greater spatial resolution and provides the added advantages that it also allows zzso zzso function to be zzso
