zzso studies recently have indicated that magnetic fields and zzso zzso radiation have an adverse influence on the living zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the safety of magnetic resonance imaging zzso by observing whether bacterial zzso occurs in an approximate zzso zzso We employed a zzso zzso unit zzso zzso with a magnetic field strength of zzso zzso The zzso zzso tester strains used in the zzso test were exposed, and the zzso of point and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso mixed strains were used to detect zzso and point zzso zzso Tester strains were exposed to the zzso zzso magnetic field with zzso radiation (90 degrees and 180 degrees zzso zzso were repeated using the hydrogen zzso frequency at zzso zzso for 15, 30, 45, and 60 zzso After each exposure, the rate of zzso zzso was zzso The rates of zzso zzso in mixed strains and the zzso strain were not statistically zzso zzso it was concluded that bacterial zzso is not increased by zzso radiation under a zzso zzso magnetic zzso
