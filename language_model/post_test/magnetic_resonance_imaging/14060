Recent zzso studies suggest that episodic memory zzso involves a network of zzso structures which may act zzso with zzso zzso lobe zzso structures to promote the formation of durable zzso and that zzso in certain structures is modulated according to task zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to determine the neural structures recruited during a verbal episodic zzso task and to examine the relationship between zzso during zzso and subsequent recognition memory performance across zzso Our results show zzso zzso during zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with later successful and unsuccessful recognition memory were found to differ not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso These zzso zzso effects, which have not been previously reported, may zzso to zzso differences in zzso zzso
