zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the effects of oral zzso on brain zzso zzso by auditory and simple motor tasks in ten normal right-handed zzso We measured the percent signal change and number of zzso activated by a tone discrimination task and a right hand zzso task after 20 zzso of zzso and after zzso Compared to zzso zzso significantly increased the number of activated zzso in the left and right primary auditory zzso during the tone discrimination task and increased the number of activated zzso in the zzso primary zzso zzso and right middle frontal area during the motor zzso Although highly specific vascular effects of drug cannot be ruled out as an explanation, these results could also mean that zzso increases the zzso activity associated with each of these two zzso
