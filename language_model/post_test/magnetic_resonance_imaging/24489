We review zzso and MR studies on zzso zzso zzso metabolism in human subjects from the point of views of methods, zzso assumptions and use in studies of zzso patients with clinically overt zzso zzso patients with minimal zzso zzso patients with no history of HE and healthy zzso Key results are: zzso zzso oxygen zzso and blood flow are reduced to 2/3 in zzso patients with clinically overt HE but not in zzso patients with minimal HE or no HE compared to healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism is enhanced due to increased blood zzso in zzso patients but the zzso of cerebral zzso zzso and metabolism is not affected by zzso zzso Recent advantages in MR demonstrate zzso cerebral zzso not only in zzso but also in the white matter in zzso patients with zzso
