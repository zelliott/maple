New concepts are presented for inherent decoupling of zzso zzso zzso First, an uneven zzso zzso zzso is reported in which two zzso sections are wound zzso resulting in a zzso sensitivity profile with a zzso zzso Adding a second zzso element near the zzso point forms an zzso zzso zzso Unlike a sandwiched zzso zzso an zzso zzso array allows for signal contribution at the center from both zzso zzso Second, a double zzso zzso zzso is presented in which two zzso points are formed by having one zzso winding on each side of the zzso Two zzso elements can be added to form a zzso zzso Finally, more zzso elements can be added to the array provided that the added zzso elements are zzso zzso These zzso zzso elements can be used as building blocks for more complex zzso zzso These concepts are illustrated using zzso simulations and tested using zzso zzso
