zzso global zzso zzso is a clinical syndrome determined by an episode of less than 24 hours consisting of zzso zzso with retrograde and zzso zzso followed by complete zzso 

To determine whether the presence or absence of vascular risk factors zzso in patients with zzso is associated with different clinical data and/or examination zzso 

A retrospective study was made of two groups of 13 and 12 patients with zzso who presented with and without zzso zzso The following variables were zzso zzso age, a previous history of zzso triggering factors, duration and repetition of the episodes, associated neurological symptoms and findings obtained by zzso zzso of the zzso trunks and zzso zzso The data were subjected to statistical analysis by zzso analysis with zzso exact probability zzso 

The statistical studies showed no significant differences between the variables obtained in the two groups of zzso 

zzso global zzso has been particularly related to zzso zzso and cerebral vascular pathology, although its zzso has not been fully zzso In this study we compare clinical data between the two groups of patients with and without zzso who have had zzso The lack of significant differences between them tends to rule out a vascular zzso as the sole cause of this zzso Recently zzso zzso depression has been suggested as the zzso mechanism zzso According to this theory, the vascular pathology might act as the trigger but probably not as the zzso zzso The findings of our study may support this zzso
