It was still rare for the quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso research of regional changes in zzso sclerosis zzso in Chinese patients with zzso This study aimed to study the zzso volumes zzso with quantitative zzso measurement in Chinese patients with zzso 

zzso Chinese patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25) and 25 normal controls were collected between July 2007 and March zzso All of the subjects underwent a zzso high-resolution zzso with zzso zzso thin sections oriented perpendicular to the zzso long zzso zzso structures were assessed by visual zzso and zzso were zzso studied with a Picture zzso and Communication System zzso 

Our study suggested that there was no significant difference in gender zzso zzso zzso while the right zzso head volume zzso zzso body volume zzso and the whole zzso volume zzso were greater than the left one zzso zzso zzso but no significant difference was found in bilateral zzso tail volume zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso That zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significant in zzso and zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso especially zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso had more significant zzso than the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso in patients with zzso 

By assessing the volumes of the regional zzso with zzso zzso we could better define the range and distribution of zzso since regional or subtle changes in zzso could be detected earlier with zzso zzso
