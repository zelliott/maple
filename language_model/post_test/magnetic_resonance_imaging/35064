We zzso evaluate the potential protective influence of patent zzso vein zzso zzso against portal vein zzso zzso and reduced zzso diameter in candidates for zzso liver transplant zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso at zzso was obtained in 309 patients with zzso without evidence of zzso All MR studies were reviewed by one reader for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by Fisher exact tests; 50 selected studies were reviewed independently by two additional readers to determine zzso agreement via zzso correlation zzso zzso 

Patent zzso was noted in 119 of 309 patients zzso Mean zzso diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso Main zzso zzso was present in 13 of 309 patients zzso and significantly more frequent in those without zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso indicated almost perfect agreement among three readers for presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that patients with patent zzso appear less likely to develop main zzso zzso or small zzso diameter, suggesting a protective effect of zzso on zzso zzso
