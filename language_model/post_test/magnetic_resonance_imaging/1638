zzso body surface mapping is used clinically to guide zzso zzso of cardiac zzso by providing an estimate of the site of origin of an zzso The zzso methods used in our group produce results in zzso cylinder zzso zzso which are zzso but hard to interpret during zzso in the zzso zzso It is preferable to provide these results as three-dimensional zzso zzso which can be presented as projections in the zzso zzso views that are used routinely to monitor the zzso zzso zzso were carried out into how well zzso can be converted into zzso projections with the limited anatomical data available in contemporary clinical zzso zzso surfaces from magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of 24 healthy volunteers were used to create an appropriate model of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of model parameters from zzso zzso images were evaluated using simulated zzso data created from these zzso In addition, the conversion method was zzso using 107 zzso positions obtained from eight patients, by computing zzso from zzso zzso images and reconstructing the zzso positions using the zzso The median zzso distance between reconstructed positions and measured positions was zzso
