To examine the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso angles, calculate the offset of the zzso angle with respect to the zzso angle, calculate the sensitivity and specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve of the zzso angle, and examine the relationship of zzso by each approach with zzso zzso tissue pathology in the mechanically stressed compartment using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso with knee zzso underwent zzso and knee zzso and knee zzso Linear zzso was used to determine if the 2 angles differed systematically and to identify the zzso zzso means for zzso grades were compared using zzso zzso 

In the 146 participants zzso women, mean age 70 years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso and zzso angles correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On average, the zzso angle was zzso degrees more zzso zzso degrees in women and zzso degrees in zzso after zzso its sensitivity and specificity (to predict the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for identifying zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso severity worsened comparably with each alignment measure as zzso zzso score on zzso zzso zzso as zzso score worsened, comparably worse zzso was seen with either assessment zzso 

In knee zzso the knee zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso angles were zzso The zzso angle, corrected for mean zzso was sensitive, specific, and had excellent zzso ability for identifying zzso and zzso alignment evidenced by area under the zzso zzso The relationship between alignment and specific zzso zzso features was comparable with the 2 zzso Use of the zzso angle, corrected for zzso should be considered in research and clinical zzso
