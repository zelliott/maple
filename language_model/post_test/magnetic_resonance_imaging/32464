There is clinical and experimental evidence involving the zzso in the control of the zzso system and cardiac function, with differential participation of right and left brain zzso and these differences could influence mortality in the acute phase of brain zzso zzso zzso 

We have analyzed zzso the mortality during initial hospitalization in a series of 504 zzso zzso patients with middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso to detect potential differences between right zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso 

zzso associated with a higher mortality were the zzso size, the occurrence of zzso respiratory infection, age and a history of diabetes zzso or chronic zzso pulmonary zzso 

The zzso of the zzso did not have a significant influence on stroke mortality during the admission period for the acute zzso
