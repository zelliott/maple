Conventional MR imaging for zzso of brain damage in monitoring the evolution of zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso transfer zzso MR imaging is overcoming these zzso Using zzso MR imaging, we sought to zzso in zzso the extent of brain and zzso damage in patients with zzso with the zzso goal to investigate the magnitude of the correlation between zzso MR imaging findings and clinical zzso 

Conventional and zzso MR images of the brain were obtained in nine patients with zzso and in 10 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso ratio zzso were derived of the whole brain, brain zzso white matter zzso brain zzso gray matter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Clinical disability was measured by using the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Average zzso ratio and peak heights of the whole brain, brain zzso and brain zzso zzso in patients with zzso were significantly lower than the corresponding quantities in the control zzso All zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso metrics and average zzso ratio of the zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso were also significantly lower than the corresponding quantities in the control zzso Strong correlations were found between the zzso score and a composite zzso zzso ratio zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso and a composite brain white matter zzso ratio zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso A strong correlation was also found between the zzso functional system score and a composite zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

The quantitative assessment of brain damage in patients with zzso with use of zzso MR imaging can provide powerful measures of disease zzso
