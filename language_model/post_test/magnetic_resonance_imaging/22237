Using a new method of xenon zzso that permits the generation of liter quantities of zzso zzso gas, the first zzso imaging results from the human chest and the first zzso zzso results from the human chest and head have been zzso With polarization levels of approximately zzso zzso images of the lung zzso with a zzso volume of zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were acquired and three zzso zzso in zzso from the chest were zzso In zzso from the head, one prominent zzso zzso presumably from brain zzso was zzso With anticipated improvements in the zzso polarization system, pulse zzso zzso zzso and breathing zzso these results suggest the possibility for zzso zzso imaging of the lungs with a resolution approaching that of current conventional zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the results suggest the feasibility of zzso imaging of both the chest and brain with a resolution similar to that obtained with the zzso zzso
