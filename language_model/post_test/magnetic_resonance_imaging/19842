Memory decline and zzso zzso are two major aspects of Alzheimer's zzso Using a zzso zzso design, we investigated the relationship between successful verbal retrieval and concurrent cerebral zzso in elderly subjects in different stages of cognitive zzso We chose a zzso over the more traditional zzso approach to increase the power of detecting relevant zzso 

Eleven subjects with Alzheimer's disease, 21 elderly subjects with mild cognitive zzso and 29 zzso cognitively zzso subjects learned 180 zzso While measuring brain zzso with zzso the subjects had to zzso these 180 learned plus 180 new zzso words as known or zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify cerebral zzso by correctly remembered words zzso that correlated with retrieval success in the whole zzso 

zzso verbal retrieval was significantly correlated with concurrent zzso of the left zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The study confirms the importance of adequate zzso function for successful verbal retrieval in the zzso In addition, our study supports connectivity studies indicating a functional relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso during successful verbal retrieval in the elderly in different stages of cognitive zzso
