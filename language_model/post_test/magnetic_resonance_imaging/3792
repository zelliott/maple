Individual differences in a person's ability to control fear have been linked to zzso in the zzso anterior zzso cortex, the zzso prefrontal cortex, and the zzso This study investigated whether functional zzso in this network can be predicted by resting metabolism in these same zzso 

The authors measured resting brain metabolism in healthy volunteers with zzso zzso zzso using zzso This was followed by a zzso fear conditioning and extinction training paradigm using functional zzso to measure brain zzso during fear extinction and zzso The authors used skin zzso response to index zzso zzso and they used resting metabolism in the amygdala, the zzso anterior zzso cortex, and the zzso prefrontal zzso to predict responses during fear extinction and extinction zzso 

During extinction training, resting zzso metabolism positively predicted zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso predicted zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso In contrast, during extinction recall, resting zzso metabolism zzso predicted zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and positively predicted zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso In addition, resting metabolism in the zzso anterior zzso zzso predicted fear expression (as measured by skin zzso zzso during extinction zzso 

zzso brain metabolism predicted zzso zzso and skin zzso changes associated with the recall of the fear extinction zzso
