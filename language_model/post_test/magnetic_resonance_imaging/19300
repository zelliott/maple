The purpose of this work was to understand how zzso dimension of two-dimensional zzso zzso bone projection images could be related to three-dimensional zzso zzso bone properties such as zzso or zzso Two zzso processes were applied to zzso bone images obtained by magnetic resonance zzso a zzso zzso process and a zzso removal zzso The zzso zzso process was applied from the zzso skeleton graph to the zzso initial structure with constant zzso The zzso removal process was applied from the initial structure to an altered structure having zzso of zzso in which both zzso and connectivity were modified during this second zzso zzso projection images of each of the altered structures were simply obtained by zzso of zzso and zzso dimension zzso was zzso zzso zzso and connectivity per unit volume zzso were calculated from the zzso zzso zzso relationships were found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso values increased when zzso increased zzso and removal zzso and when connectivity decreased zzso removal zzso These variations were in accordance with all previous clinical studies, suggesting that zzso evaluation of zzso bone projection has real meaning in terms of zzso and connectivity of the zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a statistically significant linear dependence between zzso and zzso when zzso remained zzso zzso is directly related to bone mineral density and zzso dimension can be easily evaluated in clinical zzso These two parameters could be associated to evaluate the connectivity of the zzso
