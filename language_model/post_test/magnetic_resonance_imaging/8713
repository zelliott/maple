The role of the zzso zzso zzso in the representation of zzso magnitude is well zzso Recently, there has also been speculation that the zzso is involved in the representation of zzso information as zzso These claims, however, overlook the fact that all zzso zzso in which participants make judgments about either magnitude and/or order result in a behavioral distance effect zzso the comparison is easier when the stimuli span a greater zzso This leaves open two zzso It may be that zzso of the zzso is due to the mechanism that yields distance effects, or it may be that the zzso is involved in the representation of information about both magnitude and zzso The current study used zzso to compare a magnitude task in which participants show distance effects to an zzso task that yields zzso zzso The results reveal zzso of the zzso for both the magnitude and order tasks that is based on zzso strategies as opposed to the actual distance between the zzso This leads to the conclusion that the zzso represents a mental number line, and that zzso this line can lead to distance effects when participants compare zzso and to zzso effects when participants check for zzso
