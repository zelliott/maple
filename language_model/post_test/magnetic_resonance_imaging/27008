zzso resonance imaging zzso is considered the clinical reference standard for measuring the right zzso zzso volume and ejection zzso although real-time zzso zzso zzso would be a preferred method zzso to its convenience and availability for repetitive zzso However, the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso have not been fully zzso The present study sought to validate the correlation of zzso with a zzso zzso method compared to zzso for assessing the function of the right zzso and to evaluate the RV function in patients with pulmonary hypertension zzso Thirty patients with zzso underwent both zzso and zzso The right zzso was reconstructed with zzso using a zzso zzso method to analyze the zzso zzso The RV zzso volume, RV zzso volume, and RV ejection fraction were zzso Fifteen normal subjects underwent the same zzso protocol for zzso The RV zzso volume index, RV zzso volume index, and RV ejection fraction measured using zzso correlated well with those measured using zzso (R zzso zzso p zzso R zzso zzso p zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso All zzso and zzso zzso values for the RV zzso volume, RV zzso volume, and RV ejection fraction were zzso Both the RV zzso volume index and the RV zzso volume index were significantly enlarged in those with zzso compared to those in the normal subjects zzso 123 zzso 42 zzso vs 74 zzso 12 zzso zzso 86 zzso 33 zzso vs 26 zzso 5 zzso in those with zzso and the normal subjects, respectively, p zzso In contrast, the RV ejection fraction was significantly reduced in the patients with zzso compared to that in the normal subjects (30 zzso zzso vs 65 zzso zzso respectively, p zzso Thus, zzso with a zzso zzso method might provide comparable and feasible zzso of the RV volume in patients with zzso compared to zzso
