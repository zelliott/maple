zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso resolve structure, water zzso and copper transport and fate in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to resolve considerable structural zzso ranging from classical zzso approximately 500 zzso thick to structures with no apparent zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso resolved water diffusion zzso which exhibited relatively little or no zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was then reacted with a zzso zzso zzso solution, and zzso relaxation time zzso maps zzso used to zzso and temporally map copper zzso within the zzso zzso a zzso protocol similar to that used in biomedical research successfully zzso copper zzso throughout the zzso Variations in zzso zzso were controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was most rapid zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso over the first 20 to 30 h and then much slower for the remaining 60 h of the zzso The transport of metal within the zzso is controlled by both diffusion and zzso This was explored using a zzso and Gardner model which examined both diffusion and zzso through a hypothetical film exhibiting properties similar to those of the zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso resulted in longer lag times until the onset of zzso at depth but higher actual zzso zzso zzso and reaction transport models are versatile tools which can significantly improve our understanding of heavy metal zzso in naturally occurring zzso
