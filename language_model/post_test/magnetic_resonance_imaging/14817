The zzso ability to zzso movements with external cues is used daily, yet zzso is far from a full understanding of the brain mechanisms that facilitate and set behavioral limits on these sequential zzso This functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was designed to help understand the neural basis of behavioral performance differences on a zzso movement task during increasing zzso and decreasing zzso metronome zzso In the zzso zzso subjects were instructed to tap their right index finger on a response box in zzso to visual cues presented on a display zzso The tapping rate varied either continuously or in discrete steps ranging from zzso zzso to 3 zzso zzso were able to zzso better during continuously accelerating rhythms than in continuously or zzso decelerating zzso The zzso data revealed that the zzso was activated more during continuous zzso than during acceleration with the zzso effect significant at rhythm rates above 1 zzso From the behavioral data, two performance measures, tapping rate and zzso index, were derived to further analyze the relative brain activity during acceleration and zzso of zzso zzso rate was associated with a greater brain activity during zzso in the zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso index was associated with a greater activity during the continuous acceleration phase than during the continuous zzso or discrete acceleration zzso in a distributed network of regions including the prefrontal zzso and zzso These results indicate that the zzso inertia for movement is different for acceleration and zzso which may have implications in understanding the origin of our zzso and behavioral zzso
