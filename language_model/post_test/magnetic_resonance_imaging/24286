To describe the patterns of cortical and zzso changes in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso zzso for the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso gray and white matter magnetic resonance zzso imaging study was undertaken with 30 zzso patients with zzso 9 patients with ALS carrying the zzso zzso repeat expansion, and 44 healthy zzso zzso spatial statistics of multiple white matter diffusion zzso cortical thickness zzso and zzso zzso analyses were carried zzso All patients underwent comprehensive genetic and zzso zzso 

A zzso pattern of cortical and zzso involvement was identified in those with the zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions and the zzso zzso White matter abnormalities in the zzso group were relatively confined to zzso and zzso pathways with limited zzso zzso The body of the corpus zzso and superior motor tracts were affected in both ALS zzso 

zzso cortical and zzso zzso involvement was identified in association with the zzso zzso compared to the relatively limited zzso pathology in patients with zzso zzso The distinctive, zzso zzso patterns are consistent with the zzso profile of the 2 ALS zzso Our findings suggest that previously described zzso changes in ALS could be largely driven by those with the zzso zzso
