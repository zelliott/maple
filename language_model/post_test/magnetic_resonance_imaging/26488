To evaluate zzso zzso zzso for dynamic and delayed magnetic resonance zzso imaging of focal liver zzso 

In 126 of 214 patients, MR imaging was performed before zzso administration, immediately after zzso administration of a zzso zzso dose of zzso and zzso minutes after an additional zzso infused zzso zzso In 88 patients, imaging was performed before and zzso minutes after a single, zzso infused zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were zzso zzso and blinded off-site zzso zzso evaluated all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso and/or CT with zzso oil served as the reference methods in 110 zzso 

zzso more zzso were detected on combined zzso and zzso images compared with on zzso images alone zzso zzso zzso All zzso reported a decreased mean size of the smallest detected zzso and improved zzso zzso on zzso zzso All on-site zzso and two off-site zzso reported increased overall diagnostic confidence zzso zzso Additional zzso characterization information was provided on up to 109 zzso of 184 delayed images and for up to 50 zzso of 118 patients in whom dynamic images were zzso zzso would have helped change the diagnosis in 99 zzso of 209 cases and affected patient treatment in zzso zzso of 209 zzso 

zzso increases liver zzso zzso and zzso and aids in the characterization of zzso
