The zzso prefrontal zzso zzso is a brain region that has figured prominently in studies of schizophrenia and working memory, yet the exact zzso zzso of this brain region remains to be zzso zzso primarily involves the superior frontal zzso and middle frontal zzso zzso The latter, however is not a single zzso entity but instead is comprised of zzso zzso middle, and zzso and zzso zzso In this study we used structural zzso to develop a method for zzso zzso into its component zzso We focused on this region of zzso because it includes zzso a region involved in working zzso We evaluated volume differences in zzso in 20 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 20 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso was delineated within the zzso zzso using anterior and zzso zzso landmarks derived from zzso definitions of zzso Gray matter volumes of zzso were then compared between groups, and a significant reduction in gray matter volume was observed zzso but not in other areas of zzso zzso anterior or zzso zzso zzso or zzso regions of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso in zzso gray matter are localized exclusively to zzso zzso reconstructions of the cortical surface made it possible to follow zzso into its anterior part, where other approaches have zzso This method of zzso offers a more precise way of measuring zzso that will likely be important in further documentation of zzso anomalies in zzso
