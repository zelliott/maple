The heart is an organ which pumps blood around the body by contraction of muscular zzso There is a coupled system in the heart containing the motion of wall and the motion of blood zzso both motions must be zzso zzso which make biological zzso fluid dynamics zzso zzso The wall of the heart is not rigid and hence proper boundary conditions are essential for zzso zzso zzso interaction is very important for real zzso zzso There are many assumptions for zzso simulation of the heart that make it far from a real zzso A realistic zzso interaction zzso the structure by the finite element method and the fluid flow by zzso use more realistic zzso zzso This type of method is very powerful to solve the complex properties of the cardiac structure and the sensitive interaction of fluid and zzso The final goal of heart zzso is to simulate the total heart function by zzso cardiac zzso electrical zzso mechanics, metabolism and fluid mechanics together, as in the zzso zzso
