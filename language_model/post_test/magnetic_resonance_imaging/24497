zzso used contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging zzso suffer by the lack of zzso short circulation time; and insufficient zzso Here, a zzso zzso approach is described for the synthesis of magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso iron oxide particles zzso and decorated with zzso zzso The zzso comprise a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core, containing up to zzso zzso zzso stabilized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are directly zzso to the external zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso are presented including zzso zzso only zzso zzso only zzso and the combination zzso zzso All three zzso exhibit a zzso diameter of about 150 zzso The zzso present a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso about four times larger than conventional zzso contrast agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is three to four times larger than most conventional systems zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso In melanoma bearing mice, zzso analysis for zzso shows about zzso of the injected zzso accumulating in the tumor and zzso still circulating in the blood, at 24 h zzso In a clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso provide significant contrast confirming the observed tumor zzso This approach can also accommodate the zzso of zzso therapeutic compounds in the zzso core, paving the way for zzso zzso
