Despite the report of recent experiences of insular surgery in the past decade, there has been no series specifically dedicated to studying functional outcome following zzso of insular WHO Grade II zzso involving the dominant hemisphere, in patients with no or only mild zzso language zzso In this article, the authors analyze the contribution of awake mapping for preservation of brain function, especially language, in a homogeneous series of 24 patients who underwent surgery for insular Grade II zzso within the dominant insular zzso 

zzso patients underwent surgery for an insular Grade II zzso involving the dominant zzso zzso left, 2 zzso revealed by zzso in all but 1 zzso The zzso neurological examination result was normal in 17 patients zzso whereas 7 patients presented with language disorders detected using an accurate language assessment performed by a speech zzso All surgeries were performed on awake patients utilizing zzso language mapping involving cortical and zzso zzso 

There were no zzso complications or zzso zzso zzso Despite an immediate zzso language worsening in 12 cases zzso all patients recovered to a normal status within 3 months, and 6 cases even improved in comparison with their zzso examination zzso The 24 patients returned to normal social and professional zzso Moreover, the surgery had a favorable impact on zzso in all but 4 cases zzso On control MR imaging, zzso of zzso were total or zzso Three patients underwent a second or third awake surgery, with no additional zzso All but 2 patients zzso are alive after a mean follow-up of 3 years zzso zzso zzso 

Although insular surgery was long believed to be too zzso the present results show that the rate of permanent deficit, especially zzso following zzso of Grade II zzso involving the dominant zzso has been dramatically reduced zzso in this patient zzso thanks to the systematic use of zzso awake zzso even in cases of repeated zzso Furthermore, patient quality of life may be improved due to a decrease of zzso after zzso Thus, the authors suggest systematically considering zzso when an insular Grade II zzso is diagnosed after zzso in a patient with no or mild deficit, even a zzso invading the dominant zzso
