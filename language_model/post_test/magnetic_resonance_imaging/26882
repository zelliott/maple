To compare image quality and zzso detection in zzso liver magnetic resonance imaging zzso between zzso zzso zzso examination zzso sequences that achieve fat suppression via chemically selective fat zzso zzso and a 2-point Dixon zzso separation method zzso 

Thirty patients underwent zzso liver zzso at zzso T in which zzso was performed immediately after a delayed zzso Two zzso in consensus reviewed the sequences for a variety of qualitative and quantitative image quality measures and for zzso zzso 

zzso received nearly perfect scores for strength and zzso of fat suppression that were significantly better than scores for zzso with an associated significant improvement in zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso also received significantly better scores for sharpness of zzso vessels zzso zzso zzso and overall image quality zzso zzso zzso Despite a slightly longer acquisition time for zzso there was no significant difference in motion artifact zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference for sensitivity, positive zzso value, or contrast relative to background liver for focal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso 

For zzso liver zzso zzso demonstrated significantly improved fat zzso Various assessments of zzso detection showed no significant difference between zzso
