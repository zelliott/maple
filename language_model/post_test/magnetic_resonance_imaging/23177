Changes in zzso zzso bone are central to zzso zzso zzso Using zzso knee zzso bone is typically assessed in the zzso plane, however partial volume artifacts limit the utility of MR methods for zzso compartment zzso bone zzso zzso acquisitions may enable direct zzso and zzso of the expected increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

MR acquisition parameters were first zzso at 3 zzso zzso five volunteers underwent zzso and zzso exams of their right zzso Each image series was evaluated visually and zzso An zzso standardized zzso was placed on both the zzso and lateral zzso zzso of all zzso slices containing zzso zzso Mean and maximum zzso signal was measured, and zzso zzso was zzso 

The MR acquisition had spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and acquisition time zzso zzso The two zzso knees exhibited prominent horizontal zzso in the zzso zzso bone, while the one confirmed zzso knee had zzso zzso bone and absent horizontal zzso The zzso bone signal was zzso higher in both compartments of the zzso knee than the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso bone can be directly zzso and changes zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and quantitative assessments can be performed using the zzso images and may provide a method to discriminate between the healthy and zzso zzso These methods should enable a quantitative evaluation of the role of zzso zzso bone in the natural history of knee zzso to be zzso
