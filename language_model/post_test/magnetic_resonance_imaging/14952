zzso multitasking requires subjects to zzso activate task goals important to accomplish the task at zzso However, the neural mechanisms underlying goal zzso in multitasking are zzso Based on zzso models of action selection, we expected that the extent to which zzso are processed with some overlap that strongly depends on zzso zzso zzso we applied a zzso paradigm to examine multitasking using zzso and manipulated the delay between the stop stimulus and the subsequently following change signal towards a new GO response zzso zzso zzso The manipulation of the zzso was introduced to achieve varying amounts of overlap of the two zzso zzso goal, change zzso This manipulation allowed the calculation of a zzso zzso time function zzso zzso with the slope of this function, reflecting on the degree of overlap between the stop and the change zzso Data analysis revealed that change trials, independent of their zzso showed an zzso pattern encompassing frontal and zzso cortical zzso zzso the two main zzso zzso zzso short zzso conditions with each other showed a stronger zzso zzso zzso level zzso signal zzso of the zzso and the right inferior frontal zzso in trials with a long zzso compared to trials with a short zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso differences of the zzso between the two zzso drive the zzso zzso the zzso data with the slope of the zzso function indicated that the degree of overlap of stop and change processes is determined by the degree of zzso zzso on a zzso zzso In conclusion, the findings acknowledge the role of the zzso zzso as an important structure determining action selection processes via a network of zzso and zzso structures, in terms of an extended multiple demand zzso
