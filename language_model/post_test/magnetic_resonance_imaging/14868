There is no clear zzso or zzso agreement on the differences between zzso and conventional zzso which has huge therapeutic zzso zzso an zzso is composed of zzso of zzso zzso cartilage surrounded by zzso zzso and a zzso a zzso zzso replacement zzso of the zzso which leads to complete zzso of host zzso bone zzso The zzso around islands of cartilage should be zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso may be the precursor of zzso benign zzso islands are often seen microscopically at the periphery of zzso We attempted to detect these islands at the periphery of zzso on MR and correlate them zzso 

We examined our database for all patients with a zzso of the long and flat bones between 1990 and zzso Only those with a zzso MR who underwent an en bloc zzso were included, yielding 32 zzso We looked for zzso islands surrounded by high zzso signal on zzso images, and zzso islands surrounded by low signal on zzso fat saturated images at the periphery of the main zzso zzso zzso correlation was performed in all zzso 

On zzso there were 23 conventional zzso nine zzso zzso islands surrounded by fat were detected on MR in 19 cases, corresponding to benign cartilage in 18 cases and to the benign zzso of a needle biopsy tract in zzso There were no peripheral islands detected zzso or microscopically in 13 zzso 

zzso islands microscopically detected at the periphery of some zzso are easily and reliably diagnosed on zzso
