The existence of a specialized mechanism supporting auditory motion processing in humans is a matter of debate in the zzso zzso Recent functional zzso data appear to have resolved the debate in favor of a specialized motion system in that several studies have found cortical regions that seem to be motion zzso While all these studies contrast some form of moving auditory stimulation with a stationary zzso none have adequately controlled for the possibility that these areas are simply computing zzso location and not motion per zzso a moving stimulus varies in spatial location as well as motion, and so a system computing spatial location (and not zzso would be activated in response to both a moving and stationary sound zzso To control for this possibility, ten subjects were scanned while listening to moving stimuli and while listening to stationary stimuli that varied randomly in spatial zzso zzso with previous imaging studies, we found that a motion stimulus when contrasted with rest zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso However, stationary stimuli presented at varying locations activated these regions equally well, arguing against the existence of specialized zzso areas in human zzso
