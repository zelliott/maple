zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to the primary motor zzso zzso may induce functional zzso of motor performance and sensory zzso To address the underlying zzso zzso following 10 zzso zzso applied over zzso we examined cortical zzso using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as the associated motor and sensory behavioral zzso The motor performance measure involved a sequential finger motor task that was also used as an zzso task during zzso For sensory assessment, current perception threshold was measured before and after zzso outside the MR zzso and noxious mechanical stimulation was used as an zzso task during zzso We found that significant zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso left superior frontal zzso bilateral zzso right zzso zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso and right zzso zzso correlated with enhanced motor performance in subjects that received real zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso significant zzso in the right superior and middle frontal zzso bilateral zzso and bilateral zzso zzso left zzso right zzso right zzso zzso and right zzso zzso were associated with an increase in the sensory zzso Our findings reveal that zzso induced rapid changes in the zzso networks associated with sensory perception and motor performance and demonstrate the complexity of such zzso
