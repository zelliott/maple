zzso evaluation using zzso is the primary means to routinely assess children with diffuse intrinsic zzso zzso zzso However, no standard MR sequence has correlated with outcome in these zzso In this study, patients with zzso were assessed to determine the combined zzso value via dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had clinical and zzso findings consistent with a zzso Imaging studies were acquired on a zzso zzso at various time points during each patient's zzso Data were evaluated using a Cox zzso hazard model, a zzso zzso Cox model, a zzso test, and a zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on 34 zzso median age zzso zzso Median survival from diagnosis was zzso zzso At baseline imaging only, increased ratio of zzso to zzso zzso on zzso and increased zzso on zzso each predicted shorter survival zzso risk zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso When analyzing all subsequent time points, increased maximum zzso on MRS zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso increased zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the presence of enhancement zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso each predicted shorter zzso zzso analysis showed shorter survival associated with increased zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso at any time point predicts a significantly shorter survival in children with zzso In addition, enhancement, increased zzso on zzso and increased maximum zzso on chemical shift imaging are zzso of shorter survival over zzso zzso baseline and subsequent imaging for children with zzso should, at zzso incorporate zzso and zzso
