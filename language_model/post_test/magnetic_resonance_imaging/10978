zzso operating characteristic zzso methods are useful tools for evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of various zzso zzso used in zzso data zzso New zzso methods using real zzso data are proposed that improve a previously introduced method by Le and Hu zzso and Hu, zzso zzso zzso The proposed methods provide more accurate means of zzso the true zzso curve from real data and thereby aid in the comparative evaluation of a wide range of zzso tools in zzso The mathematical relationships between different zzso zzso are explored for a comparison of different zzso zzso Examples using real and simulated data are provided to illustrate the ideas zzso
