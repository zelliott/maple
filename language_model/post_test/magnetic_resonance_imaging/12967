Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease zzso do not appear until the majority of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are lost, suggesting significant zzso or compensation in the motor systems affected by zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined whether compensation in zzso is zzso by changes in zzso and/or spatial extent of activity within normal networks zzso motor zzso and/or newly recruited regions zzso area recruitment zzso Ten zzso subjects off and on medication and 10 zzso controls performed a visually guided zzso force task at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the combination of regions where zzso zzso scaled zzso with movement speed in zzso We then determined the zzso of zzso subjects in this network, as well as the corresponding zzso zzso To measure the spatial zzso of zzso we used an zzso spatial feature zzso Control subjects zzso increased activity within zzso and zzso regions with increasing movement zzso In zzso subjects, the activity of this network at low speeds was similar to that in controls at higher zzso Additionally, zzso subjects off medication demonstrated zzso of the bilateral zzso and primary motor cortex, which were incompletely zzso by zzso Our results suggest that zzso subjects tap into motor reserve, increase the spatial extent of zzso and demonstrate zzso to maintain zzso motor zzso
