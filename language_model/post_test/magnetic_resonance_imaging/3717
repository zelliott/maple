Separate zzso experiments have examined two properties of neural coding for zzso zzso zzso studies seek a graded recovery from neural adaptation with ever greater zzso between pairs of zzso Studies of zzso effects test for a larger absolute response to a stimulus which is distant from the center of a stimulus zzso While intellectually zzso these effects are zzso in measurement in standard zzso zzso and can be mistaken for one zzso zzso which are more distinctive are less subject to adaptation from zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso effect may simply result from greater adaptation of zzso stimuli by other stimuli in the zzso zzso stimulus pairs which are the most zzso distant from one another, and therefore expected to show the greatest recovery from adaptation, disproportionately draw from the extremes of the stimulus zzso Thus, an apparent neural similarity effect may be created by an underlying zzso zzso We simulate zzso zzso results driven by each possible effect and demonstrate zzso results in support of the complementary zzso We then present an example zzso experiment that demonstrates the confound and how it may be zzso Finally, we discuss the implications of this intrinsic confound for studies of zzso zzso neural coding, and category zzso
