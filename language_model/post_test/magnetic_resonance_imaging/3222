We evaluated zzso A zzso zzso acute zzso injury in rats using an empirical mathematical model zzso and dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 

We allocated 18 rats into 3 groups of six each and zzso injected them with either 10 zzso body weight zzso of Con A zzso A zzso group), 20 zzso zzso of Con A zzso A zzso group), or a single dose of of saline (4 zzso zzso normal control zzso We performed the zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the contrast agent 24 hours after injection of Con A or zzso We then sampled blood, measured serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and calculated the rate of contrast zzso zzso rate of contrast zzso zzso area under the curve zzso time to maximum relative enhancement zzso zzso and elimination zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso intensity zzso using the zzso 

zzso values were significantly smaller in the Con A (10) and Con A zzso groups than the control group, but zzso did not differ significantly among the 3 zzso The zzso value was significantly greater in the Con A (10) group than controls, and the zzso and zzso values were significantly greater in the Con A zzso group than zzso The zzso zzso and zzso values correlated significantly with zzso and zzso 

In conclusion, the zzso is useful for evaluating Con zzso acute zzso injury using zzso with zzso
