The purpose of this study was to identify the proportion of adult patients at our institution who require sedation to tolerate MR zzso We also wished to identify whether the type of study and patient age or sex was associated with a variation in the use of zzso A total of zzso patients, 18 years of age or older, underwent MR imaging at a large university hospital during a randomly selected zzso zzso Age, sex, type of study, number of prior zzso and use of sedation were identified in this zzso Patients requiring sedation were compared by these criteria to all zzso members over 18 years of age in the cohort who acted as a zzso Of the zzso patients zzso zzso required oral zzso zzso zzso or general zzso to tolerate zzso This group was zzso male, zzso female zzso group zzso male, zzso zzso Of those requiring zzso 89 patients zzso were having brain zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 or zzso female zzso zzso 60 or zzso In the control group 461 patients zzso were having brain zzso zzso zzso zzso 209 or zzso female zzso zzso 252 or zzso The mean age of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso The zzso group had a mean age of zzso zzso zzso The zzso group had undergone a mean of zzso prior MR studies zzso zzso the control group had a mean of zzso prior studies zzso zzso zzso was more commonly zzso in women than men, in patients having brain zzso and in patients who had undergone prior zzso zzso The identification of a population having the greatest need for sedation may aid in the development and selection of methods of stress reduction which will result in greater patient zzso reduction in motion artifact, and fewer prematurely terminated zzso
