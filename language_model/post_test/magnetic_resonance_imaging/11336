zzso acquisitions are used in fast cardiac imaging because they traverse zzso efficiently and minimize flow zzso A variable pitch zzso spiral trajectory is designed to critically sample the zzso region in zzso and gradually zzso the zzso zzso An approximate zzso expression for the trajectory provides a fast means to calculate the zzso zzso and the sampled data zzso A zzso method is introduced based on the trajectory zzso and the rate of change in the zzso magnitude with time for the composite zzso zzso The pulse sequence is implemented and images are acquired on zzso and human zzso The images show improved image resolution and some improvement in image quality as a result of increased extent in zzso and reduction in zzso artifacts, zzso
