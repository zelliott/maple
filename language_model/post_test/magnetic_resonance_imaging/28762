zzso zzso iron oxide zzso contrast agents for use in magnetic resonance imaging zzso are currently undergoing clinical zzso However, the images observed and the kinetic profiles obtained differ from one agent to zzso In this study, BD IX rats received an intravenous zzso injection of the zzso contrast agents zzso and zzso A zzso study of the liver was performed, and the data obtained were compared with those of zzso Images acquired in light zzso transmission electron zzso zzso and electron zzso provided data on the cell categories involved in the processing of these contrast agents, the importance and zzso of each category relative to this processing, and the zzso of agent zzso zzso was rapidly removed from the zzso by zzso cells and zzso and then eliminated through zzso zzso zzso remained much longer in the blood compartment since it was processed very slowly by zzso and zzso cells in the near absence of zzso participation and thus of elimination by the zzso zzso These results allowed us to base our interpretation of zzso sequences on zzso zzso
