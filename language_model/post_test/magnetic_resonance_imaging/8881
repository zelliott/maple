The main objective of this study was to investigate the relation between brain zzso zzso zzso levels within the first 96 hours after zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso and the development of left zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso patients with first zzso zzso within 12 hours of symptom zzso were zzso zzso Plasma zzso was determined on admission and at zzso and zzso zzso zzso significant zzso zzso defined as a zzso increase in zzso zzso volume at zzso zzso was assessed using zzso and cardiac magnetic zzso zzso percent of patients developed clinically significant zzso zzso zzso values on admission and at follow-up were significantly higher in patients who developed clinically significant zzso zzso at 6 months zzso zzso 117 vs 106 zzso 91 zzso After adjusting for age, zzso size, zzso zzso time, and the zzso ejection zzso zzso on admission was an independent predictor of zzso zzso whether assessed by zzso (B zzso zzso p zzso zzso or cardiac magnetic resonance (B zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, high zzso levels on admission and at follow-up predict zzso zzso after zzso The early determination of plasma zzso upon admission for zzso could be helpful in identifying patients at higher risk for zzso zzso in whom aggressive management is zzso
