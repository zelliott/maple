Spinal zzso development occurs through three consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by conversion of the embryonic disk from a zzso to a zzso arrangement and establishment of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces the uppermost nine zzso of the spinal zzso Secondary zzso and zzso differentiation zzso zzso result in formation of the zzso tip and zzso zzso zzso in these early embryonic stages produce spinal zzso which are characterized by anomalous differentiation and fusion of zzso zzso zzso Spinal zzso may be zzso clinically into two zzso In open spinal zzso the zzso zzso neural zzso is exposed to the zzso These disorders include zzso zzso zzso and zzso and are always associated with a zzso II zzso Closed spinal zzso are covered by intact skin, although zzso zzso usually indicate their zzso Two zzso may be identified based on whether a subcutaneous mass is present in the low zzso Closed spinal zzso with mass comprise zzso zzso zzso and zzso Closed spinal zzso without mass comprise complex zzso states zzso from complete zzso enteric zzso to zzso zzso split zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regression, and spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tight zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and persistent terminal zzso zzso resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice for investigation of this complex group of zzso
