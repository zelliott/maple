Our goal is to understand how a mural zzso may influence the pressure transmitted to and the zzso experienced by the abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso zzso 

Two intact zzso with mural zzso were removed from patients and zzso to 100 zzso The pressure was measured using a zzso needle zzso inserted in the aneurysm wall and advanced through the zzso In 1 patient with zzso similar zzso were made in zzso Also, in zzso in the two zzso the zzso as a function of pressure was measured using the markers on the surface before and after the zzso was zzso 

Both, in zzso and in zzso in the presence of the zzso the pressure transmitted to the aneurysm wall was zzso of zzso pressure and at 6 zzso from the wall it was zzso The aneurysm zzso more in the pressure range of zzso zzso zzso than in the range of zzso zzso zzso Upon removal of the zzso these zzso increased significantly to zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the strains zzso in the zzso and zzso directions were similar before the zzso was zzso 

Even though the zzso allows the transmission of zzso pressure to the aneurysm wall, it may prevent the aneurysm from zzso by diminishing the strain on the zzso zzso with this, a mechanical model of the zzso proposed is zzso zzso as a zzso network adherent to the aneurysm zzso
