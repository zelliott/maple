Interpreting volume of zzso maps of brain tumor patients remains difficult using blood zzso dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso A zzso zzso may offer an zzso strategy for investigating the possibility of functional reorganization by zzso zzso variations in the zzso of cortical structures zzso The aim of this study is to use zzso zzso to investigate potential zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso response function within the supplementary motor area zzso and primary motor zzso zzso in the presence of an adjacent brain zzso relative to normal control zzso 

Fifteen patients and eight healthy volunteers were zzso By utilizing a brief motor paradigm that exerts a differential effect on the zzso of these structures, zzso differences in the zzso responses of such areas may be sensitively zzso The present study determines the utility of this approach in brain tumor patients by examining the time to peak of the zzso zzso response within the zzso and zzso 

In patients with zzso tumors involving the zzso the zzso of the zzso was delayed and approached that of the zzso with zzso difference between the zzso and zzso averaging zzso zzso This delay in zzso zzso was seen in all patients with zzso tumors involving the zzso 

The results suggest that in patients with high-grade brain tumors invading the zzso , the zzso may assume a greater role in the execution of primary motor activities, in addition to its role in executive motor zzso
