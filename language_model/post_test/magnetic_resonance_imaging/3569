zzso stress disorder zzso has been associated with executive or zzso dysfunction and problems in emotion zzso However, it is unclear whether these two zzso of dysfunction are related to common or distinct zzso zzso 

To examine the hypothesis that greater zzso impairment in zzso relates to greater disruption in zzso networks during emotional zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

General community and hospital and community psychiatric zzso 

Volunteer sample of 37 women with zzso related to intimate partner violence and 34 zzso healthy control zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine neural responses during anticipation of negative and positive emotional zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize zzso symptom zzso The zzso Adult Intelligence zzso Third Edition, zzso zzso zzso zzso Executive zzso System zzso zzso zzso and Wisconsin zzso zzso Test were used to characterize zzso zzso 

Women with zzso performed worse on complex zzso processing speed zzso zzso zzso and executive function zzso zzso zzso zzso measures compared with control zzso zzso stress disorder was associated with greater anterior zzso and attenuated lateral prefrontal zzso zzso zzso during emotional zzso Greater zzso zzso zzso zzso of negative images minus anticipation of positive zzso was associated with lower zzso symptom severity and better zzso processing speed and executive zzso Greater zzso zzso and zzso zzso related to slower zzso processing zzso 

During emotional zzso women with zzso show exaggerated zzso in the anterior zzso a region important for monitoring internal bodily zzso Greater zzso zzso response in zzso patients during emotional anticipation may reflect engagement of cognitive control networks that are beneficial for emotional and cognitive zzso Novel treatments could be aimed at strengthening the balance between cognitive control zzso zzso and affective processing zzso zzso and zzso networks to improve overall functioning for zzso zzso
