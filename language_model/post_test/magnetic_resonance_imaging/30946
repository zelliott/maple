To assess and evaluate zzso zzso of the zzso tissue of the zzso joint zzso that may be seen in chronic trauma of the zzso zzso through magnetic resonance zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

The study included 40 patients, 6 male and 34 female, age range zzso years, mean age zzso zzso According to the Wilkes zzso zzso of patients were graded as zzso 10 grade 1 zzso 28 grade 2, 16 grade 3, and 26 grade zzso zzso were obtained with a zzso T zzso unit, and a dedicated surface zzso using zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso TE zzso 2 acquisitions, zzso zzso zzso section zzso with a zzso zzso and zzso duration for a single zzso zzso were obtained both during opening and during closure of the mouth, on 3 zzso zzso zzso perpendicular to the zzso long zzso zzso zzso perpendicular to the zzso axis of the zzso and zzso perpendicular to zzso zzso zzso used were the zzso presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in scans taken during mouth opening in the four grades of the Wilkes zzso dimensions of the zzso zzso in scans taken during mouth zzso in the four grades of the Wilkes zzso in an zzso direction, measuring the longest distance on zzso planes on a horizontal line touching the outer edge of the disc and the zzso point of fibrosis, and in a vertical direction, measuring the distance between the highest and lowest points of zzso signal intensity features within the zzso zzso 

In all zzso zzso it was possible to confirm the presence of zzso tissue fibrosis, which was more or less evident according to the grading of the zzso to the extent of mouth zzso and to displacement with or without reduction of the zzso zzso In grade 1 zzso zzso looked like a truncated zzso in grade 2, zzso looked like a zzso in grade 3, it was either shaped like a mushroom placed zzso with the stalk towards the disc, or else zzso in grade 4, it had an zzso irregular ribbon zzso 

MR studies of zzso dysfunction through zzso zzso sequences allowed us to evidence in all cases the sclerotic zzso of the zzso zzso and to assess their form and zzso Furthermore, it was possible to evidence both the zzso features of zzso tissue zzso resembling a zzso and the characteristic zzso the upper and lower layers take on during mouth opening in zzso with a disc displacement with zzso
