To assess the value of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the detection of zzso complications after composite valve graft zzso 

zzso and zzso MR imaging was performed in 52 patients 1/2 to 200 months after composite graft replacement of the ascending zzso zzso for zzso 30 for zzso The prosthetic zzso segment, zzso and zzso zzso general zzso zzso and diameter of the zzso coronary arteries were zzso In patients with abnormal zzso zzso additional zzso imaging was performed after injection of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 10 zzso was observed in 42 zzso Ten patients had abnormal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging demonstrated leakage in five of those 10 zzso The lack of enhancement excluded the presence of bleeding in the remaining five patients (three with chronic zzso one with infection, and one with zzso zzso These findings were confirmed at surgery or with subsequent follow-up MR zzso 

MR imaging was an optimal imaging zzso for evaluating the zzso characteristics of composite zzso and zzso coronary zzso zzso MR imaging is a simple, accurate, and zzso method for detecting a zzso which zzso urgent repeat zzso
