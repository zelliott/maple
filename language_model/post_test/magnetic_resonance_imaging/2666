Long acquisition times have long been a major drawback of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and have limited its use for all those organ systems with various types of movement, such as zzso zzso and zzso Recent advances in scanner zzso and software, most notably improvements in zzso and radio frequency zzso design, in amplifier technology as well as in pulse sequence development, have created new fields of application for zzso In this review article we give an overview of the development of pulse sequences from the spin echo technique through zzso echo techniques to the fastest imaging technique thus far developed, echo zzso imaging zzso A variety of clinical applications for the different pulse sequences is included, along with a discussion on the advantages and drawbacks of each zzso The review ends with a discussion of possible future advances in the field of high-speed MR zzso
