The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso growth factor zzso are implicated in the zzso progression of zzso In zzso detection of zzso expression may be helpful in the diagnosis of zzso zzso The zzso rat zzso model is a widely used zzso brain zzso model used to study zzso zzso We used a magnetic resonance imaging zzso molecular targeting agent to specifically tag the cell surface zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso to detect zzso of this zzso in zzso The zzso probe zzso was administered zzso and as determined by an increase in zzso signal intensity and a corresponding decrease in regional zzso relaxation values, this probe was found to detect increased expression of zzso protein levels in zzso zzso In addition, specificity for the binding of the zzso contrast agent was determined by using zzso microscopic imaging of the zzso portion of the targeting agent within zzso and zzso zzso following in zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso with no zzso or with a normal rat zzso attached to the contrast agent component indicated no zzso binding to zzso zzso This is the first successful zzso of in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
