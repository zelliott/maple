In order to investigate the merit of high field strength for zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso experiments during motor zzso zzso were performed on zzso and zzso scanners with equivalent hardware, on the same zzso In these studies, zzso vascular enhancement related to inflow effects was zzso and large brain areas were covered by using a zzso scan zzso zzso signal stability was zzso by using spiral zzso zzso The sensitivity for detection of activated regions was assessed by measuring the number of zzso zzso and their average zzso score in zzso regions of zzso When comparing zzso experiments with the same total scan time, performed on six subjects, and with acquisition parameters zzso for each field strength zzso the zzso scanner proved to give superior results, with a zzso greater number of activated zzso and a zzso higher average zzso score for the activated zzso
