One hundred patients with recently acquired, zzso visible zzso zzso and no history of previous zzso zzso fracture were selected for retrospective zzso All had been investigated clinically and with zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging to determine the presence or absence and extent of zzso joint zzso zzso joint zzso was found in either one or both zzso of each patient zzso zzso zzso was always toward the smaller zzso zzso or more diseased joint, and many patients either complained of or exhibited zzso often zzso by unstable or fluctuating zzso zzso Three zzso distinct forms of degenerative vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso avascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso bone were identified in zzso most often exhibiting zzso zzso zzso and avascular necrosis of the zzso zzso and zzso bone were generally associated with pain, mechanical joint symptoms, and zzso zzso zzso zzso was less frequently associated with zzso zzso despite zzso of the facial zzso and appears to result from regional zzso Forty patients zzso zzso underwent open zzso procedures, including either zzso or zzso zzso repair, at which time major zzso diagnoses were zzso zzso and zzso findings included zzso zzso disk zzso zzso joint zzso zzso cartilage zzso cartilage zzso cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso localized or extensive avascular zzso and decreased zzso zzso mass and vertical zzso We conclude that zzso joint zzso is the principal cause of both acquired facial skeleton zzso and unstable zzso in patients with intact zzso and without previous zzso zzso
