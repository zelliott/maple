The right zzso zzso tract zzso is the most common site of origin of zzso zzso zzso in patients with idiopathic zzso A left bundle branch block, inferior axis zzso zzso is the hallmark of zzso zzso zzso from other sites of origin can mimic zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso typically fails for these zzso 

To analyze reasons for failed zzso of zzso zzso 

Among a consecutive series of 197 patients with an zzso zzso zzso zzso who were referred for zzso 38 patients (13 zzso age 46 zzso 14 years; left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso in whom a prior procedure failed within the zzso underwent a second zzso zzso zzso characteristics of the VA were compared to a consecutive series of 50 patients with zzso zzso 

The origin of the VA was identified in zzso of the zzso In 28 of 38 zzso patients, the zzso origin was not in the zzso The VA originated from zzso sites zzso zzso 8, zzso the pulmonary arteries zzso zzso 7, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso The origin was within the zzso in 10 zzso zzso In 2 zzso patients, the origin could not be identified despite zzso zzso and zzso zzso The VA was eliminated in 34 of 38 zzso patients with repeat zzso The zzso features of patients with failed zzso zzso were different from the characteristics of zzso zzso 

In patients in whom zzso of a VA with an zzso appearance fails, mapping of the pulmonary artery, the zzso zzso the zzso the left zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso will help identify the correct site of zzso The zzso zzso is helpful in zzso these zzso from zzso zzso
