The aim of this study was to determine the main cortical regions related to zzso zzso activity of sleep stage 2 in healthy individual subjects during a brief morning nap using zzso zzso Eight volunteers zzso age: zzso zzso zzso six zzso all right zzso free of any medical psychiatric or sleep disorders were zzso zzso zzso zzso and a conventional zzso montage zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scalp zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used for data zzso Sleep zzso zzso were visually identified during 15 zzso of stage 2 sleep for each zzso The distribution of brain activity corresponding to each zzso was calculated using a combination of independent component analysis and a current source density technique superimposed upon individual zzso The absolute maximum of zzso zzso was localized to zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the most common cortical regions for zzso source zzso activity were zzso and/or zzso areas across all zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso activity localized to these two regions may represent a single event for two types of zzso zzso slow (at 12 zzso and fast (at 14 zzso within global zzso zzso
