zzso a zzso system with a rigid zzso and three zzso was developed for less invasive and zzso zzso This system can be used to perform sophisticated surgical procedures through a small, zzso zzso The present study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of using zzso in zzso Four different zzso zzso procedures were simulated in three fixed zzso heads using zzso zzso zzso of the floor of the third zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso biopsy of the zzso and zzso biopsy of the zzso zzso of the lateral zzso Each procedure required less than 2 zzso and all procedures were performed zzso After these surgical simulations, a third zzso was carried out safely and adequately in a patient with zzso zzso due to a zzso zzso zzso Our results confirmed that zzso is zzso to zzso in which conventional zzso neurosurgery is zzso Furthermore, zzso can perform more complex surgical procedures than a conventional zzso because of its zzso and zzso zzso will become a useful zzso tool for dealing with zzso that are difficult to treat by conventional zzso zzso
