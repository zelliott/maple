To evaluate different zzso temperature levels for a zzso prediction of the zzso zone in magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso of liver zzso 

zzso zzso were acquired during zzso zzso of 24 patients with primary zzso and secondary liver zzso zzso using a zzso zzso T MR zzso and compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso resonance frequency shift method were performed directly subsequent to energy zzso The temperature maps were registered on the zzso follow-up MR images acquired 4 weeks after zzso Areas with temperatures above zzso zzso and zzso were segmented and compared with the zzso zzso zzso and positive zzso value were zzso 

No major complications occurred and all zzso were completely zzso No zzso recurrence was observed at the follow-up examination after 4 zzso Two patients with secondary liver zzso showed local zzso recurrence after 4 and 7 zzso The zzso threshold level achieved the highest positive zzso value zzso and the best prediction of the zzso zzso 

For a zzso prediction of the zzso zone, the zzso zzso level achieved the best prediction of the zzso zone among the tested zzso 

zzso zzso monitoring can be used to survey zzso zzso zzso zzso The developing zzso zone can be estimated based on zzso temperature zzso zzso A zzso threshold level can be used to predict the zzso zone zzso The zzso and zzso temperature zones tend to overestimate the zzso zzso
