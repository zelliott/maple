Previous studies have suggested neural disruption and reorganization in young and older adults with alcohol use disorders zzso However, it remains unclear at what age and when in the progression of zzso changes in brain functioning might zzso 

Alcohol use zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso boys and girls aged 15 to 17 were recruited from local high zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging data were collected after a minimum of 5 days' zzso as participants performed spatial working memory and simple motor zzso 

zzso with zzso showed greater brain response to the spatial working memory task in bilateral zzso zzso and diminished response in other regions, including the left zzso zzso and bilateral zzso areas zzso zzso or zzso zzso p zzso zzso although groups did not differ on behavioral measures of task zzso No brain response differences were observed during a simple zzso zzso The degree of zzso was greater for teens who reported experiencing more withdrawal or hangover symptoms and who consumed more zzso 

zzso with zzso show abnormalities in brain response to a spatial working memory task, despite adequate performance, suggesting that subtle zzso reorganization may occur early in the course of zzso
