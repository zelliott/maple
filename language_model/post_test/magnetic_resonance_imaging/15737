Recent brain imaging studies have shown that the neural zzso underlying the ability to zzso and share the feeling of pain of other individuals overlap with the pain zzso that mediates the process of one's own zzso While there has been evidence that the neural activity zzso pain experience is influenced by zzso attention, it remains unclear whether the neural zzso of empathy for pain are modulated by zzso controlled zzso The current work investigated whether the neural zzso of zzso processes of pain are altered by task demand and prior knowledge of stimulus zzso zzso were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while watching pictures or cartoons of hands that were in painful or neutral zzso zzso were asked either to evaluate pain intensity supposedly felt by the model or to count the number of hands in the stimulus zzso Relative to counting neutral zzso rating pain intensity of painful pictures and cartoons induced increased zzso in zzso and the right middle frontal zzso zzso pain intensity also activated the inferior frontal zzso zzso and the right zzso for pictures but activated the left zzso cortex, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso However, the neural activities related to pain rating were eliminated when subjects counted the number of hands in the painful zzso In addition, the zzso activity associated with empathy for pain was stronger for the pictures than for the zzso Our findings indicate that the involvement of the neural zzso underlying zzso empathy is constrained by zzso attention and contextual reality of zzso
