zzso zzso of the liver volume may be important for the diagnosis of several pathological processes in patients and for the study of new therapies in experimental zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been used for this purpose in patients, the lack of spatial resolution and tissue differentiation is a source of measurement errors which, at present, makes it impossible to accept zzso and CT widely for the determination of the liver zzso In the present study, the liver volumes of seven rats were measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and an automated image analysis system before and after the animals were zzso Volume zzso was carried out by adding up the individual volumes in the sequential MR zzso zzso MR images with high contrast between the liver and surrounding structures were obtained with spin echo pulse sequence and retarded phase zzso while no contrast material was zzso The mean volumes of the zzso measured by MR in zzso and in zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When compared with the actual liver volumes measured in zzso after zzso the errors of zzso in zzso and in zzso were as small as zzso and zzso zzso These data indicate that MR imaging is an accurate means to determine the liver volume in zzso and that it may be potentially useful to measure small zzso zzso in zzso
