To assess the signal pattern in zzso images zzso and determine its relation to persistent zzso obstruction zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso model with zzso acute zzso zzso Left anterior descending artery was zzso (90 or 180 zzso and zzso (90 zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance images zzso were zzso The zzso signal pattern, zzso contrast ratio, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso were zzso The zzso area on zzso was recorded as a homogeneous high-intensity signal or as low- or zzso zzso The contrast ratio of the zzso in the cases with zzso was significantly lower than that in those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and it showed significant inverse correlation with the extent of zzso observed in zzso images zzso zzso P zzso zzso The extent of zzso correlated strongly with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The abnormal signal area in the zzso was larger than the zzso area in the zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso area observed after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We observed variable zzso signal patterns for the zzso zzso Lower zzso contrast ratios significantly correlated with the extent of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in the gross zzso
