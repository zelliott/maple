Iron overload in zzso starts even before patients become zzso cell zzso dependent, because zzso ineffective zzso suppresses zzso production in the liver and thus causes unrestrained iron zzso in the zzso However, the main cause of iron overload is regular zzso therapy, which in zzso is associated with a risk of unclear magnitude for zzso zzso Iron deposition in zzso can now be detected with zzso techniques such as zzso zzso Iron toxicity in zzso may not only depend on the degree of tissue iron zzso but also on the extent of chronic exposure to zzso iron zzso including zzso plasma iron zzso and zzso zzso iron pools, which increase the level of zzso zzso Iron zzso therapy zzso can rapidly lower zzso and zzso and more slowly zzso tissue iron zzso Further studies, including the ongoing zzso controlled trial, will more clearly define the role of zzso in zzso including any effect on specific zzso or mortality in the zzso zzso
