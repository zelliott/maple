To investigate the CT and MR imaging features of zzso zzso in the head and neck zzso 

Our materials of this study consisted of 50 zzso zzso from 50 patients which were all zzso zzso The CT and MR images were zzso zzso The following features were zzso the zzso of the zzso the tumor margin, the border of the zzso the aspect of the zzso the contrast between the zzso and surrounding zzso the signal intensity of the zzso the enhancement of contrast zzso the aspect of the zzso after the injection of contrast zzso the zzso of the zzso and the zzso of bone zzso of the zzso 

The tumor zzso were zzso on zzso plain CT images and zzso on zzso zzso CT images, zzso On CT images, zzso zzso tended to show a zzso margin, a smooth border, an zzso zzso a low or high contrast, and intermediate or high signal zzso After contrast medium administration, zzso zzso tended to show a slightly high enhancement and either an zzso or a periphery enhancement on the zzso CT zzso The capsule could be hardly detected on CT zzso The tumor zzso were zzso on zzso zzso MR images, zzso on zzso zzso MR images, and zzso on zzso zzso zzso MR images, zzso On MR images, zzso zzso tended to show zzso margin, a zzso border, an zzso zzso a high contrast, and intermediate or high signal zzso After contrast medium administration, zzso zzso tended to show a high enhancement and either an zzso or a periphery enhancement on MR zzso The capsule could be detected in many cases on MR zzso 

It was possible to detect the capsule in zzso zzso using MR zzso The zzso zzso in head and neck area should be evaluated with MR zzso
