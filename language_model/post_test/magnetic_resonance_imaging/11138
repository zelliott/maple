zzso resonance zzso imaging blood pool agents offer numerous advantages for vascular and tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to test zzso zzso as a new water soluble zzso blood pool agent for MR zzso 

zzso zzso zzso atoms per zzso molecular weight 165 zzso diameter zzso zzso was zzso Fifteen zzso New Zealand White rabbits with thigh zzso tumors were scanned in a knee zzso at zzso zzso zzso MR zzso sequences were obtained before and at several time points up to 72 hours after the intravenous zzso injection of zzso providing zzso at either zzso zzso zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) or zzso zzso providing zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Time enhancement zzso for zzso zzso and tumor rim were compared by zzso General Linear zzso 

zzso enhancement of zzso and zzso relative to a water phantom were significantly greater at all time points after either dose of zzso than after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rim enhancement was less intense for either dose of zzso at peak than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rim enhancement with both doses of zzso became equivalent to that of zzso at one hour and was greater at 24 hours zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a new zzso MR contrast agent that can be zzso to carry a high density of zzso atoms without zzso zzso It provides significantly greater vascular residence time than a conventional zzso zzso and shows promise for MR blood pool zzso
