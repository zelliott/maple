zzso cancer zzso have a characteristic appearance on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso which might be useful for prostate cancer zzso In this pilot study the ability of zzso zzso to detect prostate cancer zzso zzso in men at risk for a zzso zzso zzso is zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 33 consecutive men with 1 or more prior negative zzso zzso All studies were read by 2 zzso dedicated study zzso in consensus before and after receiving patient clinical zzso Areas of interest on zzso zzso were mapped as low, moderate or high suspicion for zzso on a prostate zzso Directed needle biopsy zzso of the prostate were obtained based on this model, and the zzso findings were compared with zzso zzso 

Carcinoma was detected in 7 of 33 men zzso on zzso zzso including 1 of 18 zzso with low, 1 of 8 zzso with moderate and 5 of 7 zzso with high suspicion zzso The site of positive biopsy correlated correctly with the area of suspicion on zzso in zzso of zzso Overall, zzso zzso had zzso positive zzso value zzso or high zzso zzso negative zzso value zzso zzso and zzso zzso On zzso analysis positive zzso zzso was associated with an zzso risk of positive zzso 

zzso zzso may effectively zzso patients with prior negative zzso biopsy into low, moderate and high risk groups for a zzso zzso zzso and may improve our ability to identify zzso tumor zzso zzso
