Prior studies have focused on patterns of brain zzso with aging and zzso cognitive zzso It is possible that changes in neural tissue properties could provide an important marker of more subtle changes compared to gross zzso However, little is known about how zzso tissue parameters are altered in zzso We created cortical surface models of 148 individuals and mapped regional gray and white matter zzso signal zzso from zzso zzso images to examine patterns of zzso signal zzso Gray matter intensity was decreased with aging with strongest effects in zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and inferior zzso zzso White matter signal intensity decreased with aging in superior and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and lateral zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was altered throughout a large portion of the cortical zzso with strong changes in superior and inferior zzso lateral zzso and superior zzso and zzso regions demonstrating decreased overall zzso zzso effects of contrast changes were stronger than those of cortical zzso These results demonstrate that there are strong regional changes in neural tissue properties with aging and tissue intensity measures may serve as an important zzso of zzso
