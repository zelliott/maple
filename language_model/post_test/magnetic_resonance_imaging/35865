The authors report their experience in the study of zzso transplant recipients by zzso in order to determine its clinical zzso The main purpose of this work is to focus on MR patterns in relation to clinical findings of rejected or normally functioning zzso zzso patients were examined with a zzso T zzso zzso body zzso zzso pulse sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns could be seen in normally functioning zzso and transplant rejections, while variable zzso findings were observed in transplants with acute zzso necrosis zzso In the normally functioning transplanted kidney there is a clear zzso differentiation zzso and the extent of vascular penetration into the zzso zzso is clearly zzso In transplant zzso zzso is either diminished or zzso and there is no vascular penetration into the zzso to differentiate acute from chronic rejections, the zzso in zzso size and the change in zzso shape zzso shape in acute transplant zzso respectively must be zzso zzso proves thus to be useful in the study of zzso transplants, even in case of questionable clinical findings, and in patients in whom zzso biopsy is zzso
