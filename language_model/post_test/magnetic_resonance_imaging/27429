Currently, there are no data on the association between right zzso zzso structure and zzso changes specific for idiopathic pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso zzso we aimed to assess the accuracy of the recommended zzso criteria for predicting RV zzso zzso and zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso were performed in 23 consecutive patients with zzso aged zzso zzso zzso criteria were referred to RV mass index and RV zzso volume index as measured by zzso Only the zzso zzso criteria based on R wave zzso in lead zzso R wave zzso in zzso P wave zzso in II and zzso zzso time in zzso were useful for zzso between patients with and without zzso A zzso zzso time in lead zzso of zzso s excluded zzso whereas R in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso R in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso zzso and P in II zzso zzso confirmed the zzso Only the zzso zzso time in zzso correlated with RV zzso and when zzso confirmed its zzso 

Only a few of the recommended zzso criteria proved to be useful in the diagnosis of zzso or RV zzso in patients with zzso Changes in the zzso values improved their zzso
