To investigate various protocols for magnetic labeling of human cancer cells with zzso with a view to developing an effective and fast technique for potential clinical use in zzso 

zzso methods utilizing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and combination of zzso with zzso were evaluated in this in zzso zzso 

Although zzso was more effective in terms of zzso rates zzso and zzso iron zzso zzso zzso all zzso agents required prolonged zzso By contrast, zzso yielded fast labeling but with a lower efficacy zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso to zzso increased the labeling efficacy zzso zzso zzso and protected cell zzso This combined method also resulted in the best zzso effect in the in zzso cellular zzso 

The combined zzso method provides a fast and efficient protocol for zzso cellular imaging and therapeutic zzso
