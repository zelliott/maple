White matter zzso zzso have frequently been associated with lower executive function zzso Little is known, however, about the effects of zzso zzso on executive control in Alzheimer's disease zzso The present study focused on the association of zzso zzso with executive function in zzso patients and examined whether a threshold effect is present, indicating that a certain amount of brain damage must be present before cognitive function becomes zzso Finally, we examined the combined effect of zzso zzso and zzso on cognitive task zzso 

We zzso collected zzso and zzso data of 94 zzso zzso These patients completed tasks of general cognitive function, executive function, memory, and processing zzso With magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was rated as zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and cerebrovascular disease was rated as zzso using validated visual rating zzso 

zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso was associated with lower executive function, general cognitive function, and episodic memory zzso A threshold effect was present, indicating that severe to very zzso but not moderate, zzso was associated with lower executive zzso zzso were significantly associated with a single executive test only, whereas the interaction between zzso and zzso was not significantly related to any of the cognitive zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso in itself may be responsible for executive zzso Potential explanations for these findings are discussed, focusing on the role of the zzso in executive function tests and reduced zzso connectivity in this patient zzso
