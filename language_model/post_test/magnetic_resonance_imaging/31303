The zzso zzso zzso size zzso at 1 week after acute zzso zzso zzso predicts remote left zzso zzso volumes and zzso ejection fraction zzso The present study examined whether zzso volumes and zzso 6 months after zzso may be better predicted by the combination of zzso volumes and zzso just after zzso and zzso at 1 week, after zzso in patients with zzso In zzso zzso zzso grade III zzso by zzso coronary zzso 

In 48 patients with zzso and zzso grade III zzso quantitative gated zzso zzso was performed just after zzso and at 1 week and 6 months after zzso zzso zzso volume index decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso to zzso zzso 6 months after zzso In addition, they were better predicted by a combination of zzso volumes and zzso just after zzso and zzso at 1 week after zzso 

In zzso with zzso grade III zzso zzso volumes and zzso at 6 months after zzso correlate with the values obtained just after zzso zzso zzso imaging combined with zzso at zzso may predict these zzso zzso
