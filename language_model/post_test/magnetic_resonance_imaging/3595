zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of persons with multiple sclerosis zzso reveal distinct patterns of zzso during task zzso We were interested in determining whether distinct patterns of effective connectivity would be revealed with zzso causality analysis zzso 

To characterize directed neural connections in persons with zzso during a processing speed task between brain regions known to be activated in healthy zzso 

zzso and zzso were used to examine effective connectivity underlying performance of a processing speed task in persons with zzso In total, 16 individuals with zzso and 17 healthy controls zzso performed a modified version of the zzso zzso zzso Task zzso in the zzso zzso Eight seed regions were selected on the basis of a zzso data showing areas involved in zzso performance of zzso 

zzso the zzso group attained a level of accuracy equivalent to the HC group, although they were significantly zzso While there was a great deal of overlap in the connections relied upon by both groups, the zzso group showed significant differences in connectivity between critical brain zzso Specifically, the zzso group had more connections from multiple regions to frontal zzso zzso relative to zzso 

Greater neural recruitment by the zzso group relative to HC is consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, and lends further support to the notion that more connections must be recruited to maintain performance in the presence of brain zzso
