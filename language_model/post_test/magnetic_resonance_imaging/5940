The sensitivity of both nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance imaging is very low because the detected signal strength depends on the small population difference between spin states even in high magnetic zzso zzso methods can be used to increase this difference and thereby enhance signal zzso This has been achieved previously by incorporating the molecular spin zzso zzso into zzso reaction zzso We show here that a metal complex can facilitate the zzso interaction of zzso with a suitable organic zzso such that up to an zzso increase in zzso zzso and nitrogen signal strengths are seen for the zzso without its zzso These polarized signals can be selectively detected when combined with methods that suppress background zzso
