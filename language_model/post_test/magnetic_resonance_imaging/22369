zzso zzso is aimed at zzso cortical activity to understand the role of specific cortical regions, providing insight into the zzso zzso of brain zzso Scientists developing zzso methodology seek to improve detection of subtle zzso and to zzso zzso these zzso more zzso Except for applications in the clinical environment, such as functional mapping in patients prior to zzso intervention, most basic zzso studies involve group level zzso zzso Prior to grouping data, the data from each individual are typically zzso A wide range of motivations for smoothing have been given including to match the spatial scale of zzso responses, to zzso the error distribution (by the Central zzso zzso to improve the zzso of zzso based on zzso tests, and, in the context of zzso averaging smoothing has been shown necessary to project the data down to a scale where zzso in functional anatomy are expressed across zzso This work demonstrates that, for zzso studies, if smoothing is to be zzso the data should be acquired at lower resolutions to maximize zzso The benefits of a zzso acquisition are limited by partial volume effects and by the weak impact of zzso noise on the overall group level zzso Given that zzso noise dominates across a range of tasks, improvements in zzso noise, through changes in acquisition strategy or even moving to higher field strength, may do little to improve group zzso Such improvements however may greatly impact zzso studies such as those used in zzso zzso
