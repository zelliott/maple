zzso is being increasingly used in zzso for staging, assessing zzso response and also for treatment planning in zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso requires improved means of defining target volumes for treatment planning in order to achieve its intended zzso zzso can add to the zzso treatment planning zzso process by providing excellent and improved characterization of soft zzso compared with zzso Together with its zzso capability and increased imaging zzso these advantages for target volume zzso outweigh its drawbacks of lacking electron density information and potential image zzso zzso MR distortion assessment and correction zzso together with image zzso and fusion programs can overcome these limitations and permit its use for zzso zzso developments using new contrast media, such as zzso zzso iron oxide particles for abnormal zzso zzso zzso techniques such as dynamic contrast enhanced zzso and diffusion zzso to better characterize tissue and zzso regions as well as zzso zzso or zzso MR sequences to define zzso patterns of target and organ at risk zzso and variations in spatial location have all increased the scope and utility of zzso for zzso Information from these MR developments may permit treatment zzso strategies of dose escalation and zzso zzso These developments will be reviewed to assess their current and potential use for zzso and precision high dose zzso
