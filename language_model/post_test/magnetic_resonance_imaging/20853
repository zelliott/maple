We assessed sex differences in zzso and neural responses to zzso pain stimuli in healthy zzso 

In zzso and body mass zzso healthy subjects zzso men, 15 zzso zzso sensory and pain thresholds were assessed with a zzso zzso zzso The blood oxygen zzso response during cued anticipation and painful stimulation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso pain evaluations were accomplished with visual analogue zzso For zzso data, zzso zzso analyses and additional zzso analyses were carried zzso 

There were no sex differences in zzso thresholds or pain zzso zzso analyses revealed comparable zzso zzso of the thalamus, zzso cortex, zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Only in additional zzso analyses did we find increased zzso in women in zzso and middle zzso zzso during pain anticipation and in the zzso and zzso frontal zzso during zzso A significant inverse association between zzso pain threshold and zzso zzso in virtually all zzso was found in zzso In men, pain thresholds and zzso zzso were positively zzso as were pain ratings and anterior zzso zzso zzso 

Healthy men and women do not differ in zzso measures of visceral pain zzso The pattern of neural zzso is comparable in the majority of zzso brain regions, although women may differ in the zzso of zzso which could reflect sex differences in zzso pain zzso Women with lower pain thresholds showed greater neural responses, which may be relevant in the zzso of visceral zzso
