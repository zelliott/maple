Until now, limited data are available about the potential effect of zzso small vessel disease zzso on the long-term outcome of stroke patients with zzso large artery zzso zzso 

A prospective study was performed on zzso patients with symptomatic zzso who were divided into 4 groups zzso I, single zzso large artery zzso zzso without zzso group II, multiple zzso large arteries zzso zzso without zzso group III, zzso with zzso group IV, zzso with zzso and followed up for zzso stroke or zzso 

The zzso cumulative risks of zzso stroke were zzso for zzso without zzso 38% for zzso without zzso zzso for zzso with zzso and zzso for zzso with zzso The zzso cumulative risks of death were 6, 7, 20 and zzso zzso Compared with zzso without zzso more zzso stroke occurred in zzso without zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the higher risk of death zzso zzso p zzso zzso was found in group zzso with zzso A Cox zzso zzso model showed that zzso with zzso may be a predictor of zzso stroke zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a borderline predictor for death zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is very common and may predict poor outcome in stroke patients with symptomatic zzso
