Animal and human zzso studies have consistently shown that damage to the prefrontal lobe zzso performance on tasks requiring memory for zzso zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to explore the brain regions associated with zzso of relative zzso in healthy zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso area zzso 9) was more active during a verbal zzso judgment task than during a zzso control zzso zzso related to zzso context recognition was also observed in zzso supplementary motor area zzso 6) and left zzso zzso zzso This study provides further evidence that memory for zzso context requires the prefrontal zzso and is the first to demonstrate this association in healthy zzso The current findings also suggest the possibility that recognition of context and recognition of episodic content may involve similar brain zzso
