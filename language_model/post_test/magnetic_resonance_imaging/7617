To report the observation of brown zzso tissue zzso with low fat content in zzso with zzso zzso zzso after they have undergone zzso zzso 

The local ethics committee approved the imaging zzso Ten zzso zzso (3 zzso 7 zzso age zzso zzso were studied on a zzso zzso system using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso BAT and adjacent subcutaneous white zzso zzso zzso were compared to those from five zzso zzso two recruited for the present investigation and three from a previous zzso 

In zzso zzso the zzso range for the zzso zzso and subcutaneous regions was zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On an individual basis, zzso BAT zzso was consistently the zzso zzso BAT values were higher, and subcutaneous zzso values were the highest zzso 

We speculate that zzso therapy in zzso zzso likely promotes zzso zzso zzso which subsequently leads to a depletion of the zzso zzso fat zzso We believe that this is consequently reflected in lower zzso values, particularly in the zzso BAT zzso in contrast to zzso zzso
