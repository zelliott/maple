By using a zzso rat zzso zzso model, we studied the relationship between zzso zzso by zzso imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso at an early time zzso irreversible zzso zzso We also evaluated the optimal apparent diffusion zzso zzso threshold that provides the best correlation with irreversible zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rats underwent right common carotid artery zzso and zzso MR imaging was performed 1-2 hours zzso by using zzso and zzso and at day 4 zzso by using zzso zzso volumes relative to whole brain zzso were measured on zzso maps by using different relative zzso thresholds zzso of mean zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlation and multiple linear zzso analysis were used to study the relationships between zzso at MR imaging and zzso at zzso 

At 1-2 hours zzso all zzso volume zzso on zzso were significantly correlated with the zzso volume on zzso with the best correlation attained at the zzso zzso threshold zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The estimated zzso formula was zzso on zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso volume at 1-2 hours zzso tended to underestimate the final zzso zzso 

Early zzso MR imaging by using zzso zzso moderately well with the size of irreversible zzso especially when measured by using a relative zzso threshold of zzso mean zzso zzso
