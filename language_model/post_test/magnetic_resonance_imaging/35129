The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of combined zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging zzso and quantitative dynamic zzso zzso zzso of human prostate cancer at 3 zzso using a pelvic zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso scanner were performed in 30 patients with zzso prostate cancer before radical zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso images were evaluated for zzso of the peripheral zone, central zzso visibility of the cancer zzso zzso capsule zzso and overall image quality according to a zzso zzso Relative levels of the prostate zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in cancer and in the normal peripheral zone zzso and central zzso zzso zzso were also evaluated for the separation of the signal of zzso zzso and zzso and suppression of zzso and water zzso zzso zzso were obtained for zzso cancer and healthy zzso and zzso from zzso Finally, time of zzso time to peak, maximum enhancement and zzso rate in cancer, normal zzso and zzso were zzso 

The high zzso ratio zzso at 3 zzso provided zzso zzso images with excellent anatomical detail zzso zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso and good zzso zzso The increased spectral resolution was sufficient to separate the zzso and zzso zzso and allow zzso of the four zzso of zzso zzso The zzso + zzso ratio was elevated in cancer in comparison with zzso and zzso zzso Dynamic zzso images showed good zzso zzso All parameters obtained from zzso showed a statistically significant zzso difference between cancer tissue and normal zzso and zzso zzso rate and zzso ratio were significantly correlated zzso zzso in zzso cancer, whereas the correlation was not significant zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

It is possible to perform zzso of prostate cancer at 3 zzso using a pelvic zzso zzso with high zzso zzso and spectral zzso The combination of vascular information from zzso and zzso data from zzso has excellent potential for improved accuracy in zzso and staging prostate zzso These results suggest that high magnetic field strengths offer the possibility of studying prostate cancer without use of an zzso zzso
