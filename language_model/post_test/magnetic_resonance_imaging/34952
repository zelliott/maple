There is a need to develop and validate a method for establishing cup orientation that is patient specific and independent of the anterior pelvic zzso It is our hypothesis that the zzso zzso ligament and zzso zzso can be used to do zzso The objective of this study is to define the orientation of the plane formed by the zzso zzso ligament and zzso zzso and to examine whether these local landmarks lie within the limits of acceptance for cup zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive patients, who were being investigated for zzso tears with a zzso zzso of the hip, were enrolled in this prospective zzso The orientation of the zzso zzso zzso plane was determined by manually selecting points on the zzso zzso ligament and zzso The zzso plane through these points was determined and its operative orientation expressed with respect to a constructed pelvic coordinate zzso 

The operative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso plane ranged from zzso zzso exclamation mark zzso zzso zzso exclamation mark + or - zzso zzso exclamation mark standard zzso The inclination ranged from zzso zzso exclamation mark zzso zzso zzso exclamation mark + or - zzso zzso exclamation mark standard zzso 

The zzso zzso ligament and zzso zzso offer a possible solution to the many difficulties involved in cup placement during total hip zzso This paper highlights the variation in the orientation of these local zzso landmarks and questions the logic of a set target for cup zzso
