Major depression in adolescents is a significant public health concern because of its frequency and zzso To examine the zzso basis of depression in this population, the authors studied functional zzso characteristics of the brain before and after zzso treatment in zzso depressed adolescents and healthy comparison zzso 

zzso zzso and healthy zzso zzso ages 11 to 18 years, underwent functional zzso assessment while viewing fearful and neutral facial expressions at baseline and again 8 weeks zzso The depressed adolescents received 8 weeks of zzso zzso treatment after their baseline zzso 

zzso whole brain analyses showed that depressed youths have exaggerated brain zzso compared with healthy comparison subjects in multiple regions, including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The 8 weeks of zzso treatment zzso most of these regions of zzso in the depressed zzso zzso analyses of the areas involved in emotion processing indicated that before treatment, depressed youths had significantly greater zzso to fearful relative to neutral facial expressions than did healthy comparison subjects in the amygdala, zzso cortex, and zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso in all three regions, as compared with the repeat scans of healthy comparison zzso 

While effective treatments are available, the impact of depression and its treatment on the brain in adolescents is zzso This study confirms increases in brain zzso in zzso depressed adolescents and demonstrates reductions in these zzso zzso with zzso
