To investigate brain involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis zzso 

zzso patients with zzso fulfilling the American College of zzso and/or Leroy and zzso criteria were zzso zzso including 30 zzso with limited zzso and 27 zzso with diffuse zzso zzso zzso patients underwent zzso zzso zzso scan and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain, 11 patients only CT zzso and the remaining 11 patients only zzso zzso zzso on zzso and CT scan was defined as absent or mild zzso zzso 1), moderate (1 zzso score zzso zzso or severe zzso zzso 2) on a 4-point scale zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso was identified on CT scan in 22 patients zzso in 12 and severe in 10) and on zzso in 38 patients zzso in 28 and severe in zzso Patients with severe cerebral zzso seen on zzso were more likely to have pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso p zzso zzso and showed a tendency to have zzso zzso crisis zzso p zzso zzso test for trend p zzso zzso A similar association was found between severe cerebral zzso seen on CT scan and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjusting for age and hypertension, severe cerebral zzso was still associated with increased risk of severe vascular manifestations zzso ratio zzso 32, zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for CT zzso OR 26, zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for zzso 

Severe cerebral zzso is associated with severe vascular manifestations in zzso zzso zzso patients with severe vascular complications should undergo zzso imaging assessment of brain zzso
