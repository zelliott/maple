To describe the presence of zzso tissue in zzso patients with the classical form of zzso adrenal zzso zzso to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of zzso specific zzso zzso measured in zzso adrenal zzso patients with regard to the detection of zzso tissue in pelvic zzso 

We studied 52 children and zzso 32 with the classical form of zzso adrenal zzso 10 boys and 10 girls without zzso zzso zzso was performed in all patients to detect zzso zzso zzso specific zzso testosterone and zzso were measured in all zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso discrimination zzso 

Five girls with zzso adrenal zzso showed image of zzso tissue on pelvic zzso zzso specific zzso showed sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, taking zzso zzso as the zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso tissue in zzso patients with the classical form of zzso adrenal zzso was zzso zzso demonstrated to be a good marker of zzso tissue in these patients and should be used to screen patients to be submitted to image zzso
