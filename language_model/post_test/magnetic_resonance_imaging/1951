The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso syndrome zzso undergoing zzso A series of 67 patients with zzso due to benign adrenal disease was zzso There were 11 zzso men and 56 zzso women, with an overall median age of 44 years zzso zzso zzso Prior to surgery all patients underwent both CT and zzso and 58 zzso underwent adrenal zzso Thirty-five zzso of the patients zzso zzso had zzso confirmed unilateral adrenal involvement zzso patients with a solitary zzso zzso and two with unilateral zzso cortical zzso while 32 zzso of the patients zzso zzso had zzso caused by bilateral adrenal involvement, including two patients with zzso adrenal zzso The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of adrenal imaging in group A were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for CT zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso In group B the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for CT zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso represents the most sensitive and specific adrenal imaging study and should be used in all patients with confirmed zzso diagnosis of zzso undergoing zzso The sensitivity and specificity of CT scan and zzso are similar, but the latter shows a lower zzso especially in patients with bilateral adrenal zzso
