zzso stroke mainly caused by middle cerebral artery zzso zzso is a major type of stroke, but there are currently very limited therapeutic options for its zzso zzso stem cells zzso or neural precursor cells zzso derived from various sources are known to survive and improve neurological functions when they are zzso in animal models of zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso generated from zzso cells of patients are novel cells that promise the zzso cell therapy for zzso In this study, we successfully differentiated zzso derived from human zzso into zzso and found their robust therapeutic potential in a zzso zzso stroke zzso We observed the significant zzso behavioral recovery, as well as extensive neural tissue zzso Animal zzso results indicated that the majority of zzso transplanted zzso zzso migrated to the zzso area, showing a zzso critical for tissue zzso The transplanted animals exhibited the significant reduction of zzso inflammatory response, zzso and zzso and the contribution to the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso are effective cells for the treatment of zzso
