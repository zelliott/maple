A zzso zzso for zzso imaging was applied in neurosurgery for the first time in 52 patients with a broad variety of zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a diameter of zzso zzso zzso was used and introduced into the working canal of an zzso The image produced by the probe is a 360 degrees scan zzso zzso displayed on a zzso on which some parameters can be varied to get the best view of the different anatomical zzso 

In 39 patients zzso imaging was the main reason for investigation and in 13 patients zzso was the focus of zzso In 18 cases of tumor zzso control targeting a zzso remnant was zzso There are limitations and artifacts, which should reveal themselves in laboratory and clinical zzso 

In this small series, zzso proved to make zzso safer and easier by online and real-time imaging with high zzso
