The premise of zzso zzso Analysis zzso of functional zzso zzso Image zzso data is that mental zzso or states give rise to patterns of neural zzso which in turn, give rise to patterns of zzso level dependent zzso responses distributed across sets of zzso zzso learning zzso can then be used to detect relationships between mental zzso and zzso responses, typically through pattern zzso zzso many other applications, this technique has been used to evidence abstract category representation in an assortment of brain areas and across a range of cognitive zzso In this commentary, we address a critical zzso zzso to zzso abstract category representation from zzso that has been partly overlooked in the recent zzso specifically, the distinction between representing specific zzso within categories, and representing the abstract categories zzso Using a zzso we demonstrate that certain forms of zzso training and testing do not constitute sufficient evidence of category zzso and illustrate prospective and novel retrospective resolutions for this zzso
