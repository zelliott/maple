For stress zzso the inversion stress test can be performed during zzso examination and widening of the lateral joint space can be measured quite zzso However, there is no general agreement on the meaning of various degrees of zzso zzso Today zzso allows evaluation of the integrity of injured ankle zzso The major difficulty in zzso is inconsistency in zzso by inadequate appreciation of the three-dimensional orientation of each ankle zzso The appropriate combination of foot position and imaging plane is very important to achieve the best zzso of each zzso Using this technique, 52 patients with sprained zzso underwent zzso The integrity of zzso of the collateral lateral ligaments was obtained in all 52 zzso zzso zzso is essential for evaluation of the ankle ligaments with zzso In these 52 patients the ankle of tilt on the stress X-ray was compared with the rate of zzso findings showing an injury affecting two ligaments We found that none of the patients in whom the angle of lateral tilt was less than 5 degrees had zzso of two lateral ligaments, while zzso of patients with angles of tilt of zzso degrees and zzso of those with angles of tilt over 15 degrees on stress X-ray had two zzso lateral zzso When a stress X-ray with a zzso degrees angle of tilt suggests only slight zzso injury, zzso could be indicated in specific cases to allow identification of the zzso with zzso of two zzso The only practical means of imaging zzso is zzso ultrasound and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
