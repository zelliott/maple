The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of respiratory phase on signal intensity of the zzso Lung images were obtained from zzso healthy human volunteers using a multiple inversion recovery segmented zzso spin echo sequence zzso zzso exploits the difference in zzso between different zzso to effectively zzso signal contributions from fat and muscle for improved zzso of the zzso The volunteers were asked to perform zzso on end inspiration or end zzso There was a significant decrease in signal intensity of the lung with average zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso images acquired during end inspiration compared with end zzso It is concluded that zzso of the lungs should be performed during end expiration in order to zzso image zzso
