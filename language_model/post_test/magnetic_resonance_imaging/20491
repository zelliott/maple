To map the disease locus and to identify a gene zzso in a Japanese family with zzso dominant zzso zzso 

A zzso linkage analysis was performed using the zzso zzso human zzso zzso array containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a candidate gene was zzso 

zzso University Graduate School of Medicine and Tokyo University Graduate School of zzso zzso Four affected and 6 healthy individuals in a family with zzso dominant zzso zzso 

One locus on zzso zzso had a zzso zzso of odds score of zzso the theoretical zzso This locus was flanked by markers zzso and zzso and includes zzso zzso zzso 2, regulatory zzso B, beta zzso the zzso gene of zzso dominant zzso zzso 12 zzso However, unlike zzso no zzso repeat expansions in the promoter region and no zzso substitution or zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso gene were zzso 

zzso dominant zzso zzso mapping to zzso has no zzso repeat expansion or other zzso of the zzso zzso
