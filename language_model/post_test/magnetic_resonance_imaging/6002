Much work indicates that zzso zzso mediates the transformation of visual information into the motor commands necessary for successful performance of many zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso also mediates the coordination of zzso movements, during which the natural tendency is to couple the limbs zzso However, the extent to which zzso zzso and/or visual processes contribute to zzso zzso of the limbs during zzso task performance is zzso In the current study, we monitored the eye movements of a patient with a left zzso zzso as she performed a series of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the impact of an zzso zzso orientation bias on her ability to zzso the onset of zzso limb zzso the movements were performed in serial fashion, zzso left limb before right, when the patient was permitted to freely shift zzso and the visual target zzso the left zzso limb movement was presented at greater zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as such was not, however, evident when the patient was required to fixate or when visual targets were presented at lesser zzso zzso Additionally, despite the disruptive influence of zzso and visual factors on zzso zzso the patient appeared capable of using visual feedback to straighten the right zzso limb zzso thus improving the spatial component of task zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso plays an important role in the coordination of limb movements during performance of zzso zzso zzso This role appears to involve zzso gaze or attention to the goals of each limb so that the nervous system can zzso the activity of both limbs and thereby ensure successful task zzso
