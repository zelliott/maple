In the human brain, functional activity occurs at multiple spatial zzso Current studies on functional brain networks and their zzso in brain diseases via zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso are generally either at local scale zzso confined analysis and zzso functional connectivity zzso or at global scale zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso functional interaction at zzso zzso scale has not been adequately explored zzso Here our hypothesis is that functional interaction measured at zzso zzso scale can provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of neurological and psychological conditions, thus offering complementary information for healthy and diseased population zzso In this paper, we derived zzso functional interaction zzso signatures in subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by diffusion zzso imaging zzso and zzso and used zzso zzso experiments to evaluate the distinctiveness of the derived zzso zzso Our experimental results have shown that the zzso features alone can achieve comparable zzso performance compared with the commonly used zzso connectivity zzso However, the zzso performance can be substantially improved when zzso features and zzso connectivity features are zzso suggesting the complementary information achieved from the zzso zzso
