zzso calculations using the Bloch zzso were performed to assess the dependence on zzso of the echo zzso for the zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso in a zzso T MR imaging unit were performed to zzso the zzso zzso Especially for low zzso values, the echo zzso were zzso with an increasing contribution from zzso echo components with increasing zzso Apart from affecting zzso estimates, zzso echoes generated a zzso signal zzso of the echo zzso The results confirmed previous simulation studies as regards the dependence on zzso of zzso estimates from zzso
