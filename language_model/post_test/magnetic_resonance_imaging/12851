zzso cuff tears are very common, but little is known about the outcome of zzso treatment of symptomatic tears in terms of progression and the need for surgical zzso 

zzso shoulders in zzso patients zzso women and a mean age of zzso zzso with rotator cuff tears on initial magnetic resonance imaging who had been managed zzso were studied zzso All had magnetic resonance imaging scans acquired six months or more after the initial zzso The progression of the rotator cuff tears was associated with age, anatomical and associated zzso follow-up time, and structural and other magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated zzso zzso tears, zzso zzso tears, and four combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tears involved the zzso tendon, and ten involved multiple zzso zzso in tear size occurred more often among the patients who were followed more than zzso months zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared with those who were followed for less than zzso months (six zzso of zzso zzso Five tears (one zzso zzso decreased in zzso More than half zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tears increased in size compared with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tears zzso zzso zzso Only zzso zzso of the zzso tears in patients who were sixty years old or less deteriorated compared with zzso zzso of the zzso tears in patients who were more than sixty years old zzso zzso zzso No shoulder in a patient with a zzso tear demonstrated zzso zzso whereas zzso of those with a zzso tear demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso The proportion with an increase in tear size was significantly larger for shoulders with fatty zzso than for those without it zzso zzso zzso 

zzso that are associated with progression of a rotator cuff tear are an age of more than sixty years, a zzso zzso and fatty zzso of the rotator cuff zzso In the long-term follow-up of zzso treated rotator cuff tears, magnetic resonance imaging can be used to monitor rotator cuff changes and guide patient zzso
