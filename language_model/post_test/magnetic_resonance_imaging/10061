zzso zzso is a common site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is seldom done because of its deep location and complex zzso structure, therefore, early differential diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso is very zzso This study was designed to investigate the characteristics of zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso on dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso for differential zzso 

A total of 38 zzso patients, treated in Cancer Center and the Second zzso Hospital of Sun zzso University with follow-up of zzso years, were divided into 2 groups: 22 in zzso group and 16 in zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso After conventional plain zzso scan of zzso zzso and conventional contrast enhanced zzso imaging zzso were zzso zzso contrast enhancement ratio zzso time to zzso zzso and contrast enhancement ratio at the 40th second of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso process, and zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso and zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso were lower, and the zzso was longer than those of zzso at the zzso zzso When zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the combination of these 2 indexes were respectively set as the zzso diagnostic criteria of zzso at the zzso zzso the diagnostic sensitivity of the second criterion was the highest zzso and the diagnostic specificity of the third criterion was also the highest zzso 

zzso is helpful for differential diagnosis of zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso is highly suggested when it meet the criteria of both zzso zzso or zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso When the 2 criteria are zzso the latter is more accurate, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso should be took into zzso
