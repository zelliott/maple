The zzso zzso has recently been shown to enhance eye gaze and emotion recognition in healthy zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso zzso trial that examined the neural and behavioral effects of a single dose of zzso zzso on emotion recognition in individuals with zzso syndrome zzso a clinical condition characterized by impaired eye gaze and facial emotion zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined whether zzso would enhance emotion recognition from facial sections of the eye vs the mouth region and zzso regional activity in brain areas associated with face perception in both adults with zzso and a zzso control zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso improved performance in a facial emotion recognition task in individuals with zzso This was linked to increased left zzso zzso in response to facial stimuli and increased activity in the neural network involved in social zzso Our data suggest that the amygdala, together with functionally associated cortical areas mediate the positive effect of zzso on social cognitive functioning in zzso
