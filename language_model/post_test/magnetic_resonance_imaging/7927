Recent clinical and zzso studies have revealed that the human zzso plays a role in visual motion perception, but the nature of its contribution to this function is not zzso Some reports suggest that the zzso might facilitate motion perception by aiding attentive tracking of visual zzso Others have identified a particular role for the zzso in discriminating motion signals in zzso uncertain zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the degree to which zzso involvement in visual motion perception can be explained by a role in sustained attentive tracking of moving stimuli in contrast to a role in visual motion zzso While holding the visual displays constant, we manipulated attention by having participants attend covertly to a field of zzso motion or a colored spot at zzso zzso uncertainty was manipulated by varying the percentage of signal dots contained within the zzso zzso We found that attention to motion under high zzso uncertainty was associated with strong activity in left zzso zzso VI and zzso By contrast, attending to motion under low zzso uncertainty did not cause differential zzso in the zzso We found no evidence to support the suggestion that the zzso is involved in simple attentive tracking of salient moving zzso Instead, our results indicate that specific zzso of the zzso are involved in zzso the detection and discrimination of zzso moving objects under conditions of high zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso aids motion perception under conditions of high zzso zzso
