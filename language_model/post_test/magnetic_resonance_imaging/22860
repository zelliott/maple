zzso zzso in lung tissue using zzso spin labeling zzso techniques are hampered by strong microscopic field zzso induced by zzso differences between the zzso air and the lung zzso A true fast imaging with steady zzso zzso sequence was adapted for applications in zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso lung zzso imaging at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of microscopic zzso field distribution were assessed in four healthy volunteers at both field strengths using zzso zzso zzso The full zzso at half maximum zzso values of the frequency distribution for zzso zzso at zzso zzso were more than zzso higher compared to zzso zzso at zzso zzso The influence of microscopic field zzso on the zzso signal yield was simulated zzso zzso allowed for the development of a FAIR zzso sequence for lung zzso measurement at zzso zzso whereas at zzso zzso microscopic field zzso appeared too zzso zzso zzso of lung tissue were performed on eight healthy volunteers and two patients at zzso zzso using the zzso FAIR zzso zzso The average zzso rates in peripheral lung regions in zzso zzso and zzso slices of the zzso lung were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This work suggests that FAIR zzso sequences can be considered appropriate for zzso lung zzso examinations at low field zzso
