zzso fat mass is a strong and independent predictor of zzso zzso To date, little is known about the genetic zzso of regional body fat distribution in zzso As candidates of regional fat distribution, we investigated the fat zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso We studied whether genetic variation within these genes contributes to the development of disproportionate visceral obesity and zzso traits, such as insulin resistance and zzso zzso We zzso 337 subjects with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes zzso for tagging single zzso zzso zzso in the 3 genes and performed association analyses with zzso data and parameters of insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso All subjects underwent an oral zzso tolerance zzso a subset was additionally characterized by a zzso zzso Body fat distribution was assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The fat zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso associated with body mass index zzso zzso zzso but not with body fat distribution, after appropriate zzso zzso resonance zzso visceral fat mass was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), with carriers of the minor zzso displaying lower visceral zzso tissue zzso Besides, the minor zzso of zzso zzso was zzso associated with a lower zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso In obese subjects, these associations were not zzso No associations were found between the zzso zzso zzso gene and measures of zzso zzso and of body fat zzso All zzso were associated neither with insulin sensitivity nor with insulin zzso Common genetic variation within zzso is associated with increased visceral fat mass in zzso zzso In generalized zzso this genetic effect may be masked by the close association between zzso obesity and visceral fat zzso
