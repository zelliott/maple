To determine whether dynamic traditional zzso MR imaging, with the use of routine zzso parameters during contrast infusion, is superior to standard MR imaging after contrast administration for detecting zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso 3 to 10 zzso in diameter were examined with a dynamic traditional zzso zzso that is, a typical zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso field of view, 256 zzso 128 zzso and a scan time ranging from 2 minutes to 2 minutes 40 seconds during contrast zzso In addition, standard imaging with zzso and zzso zzso sequences were zzso The three sequences were evaluated zzso and graded for zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

The dynamic sequence was judged to be better than the standard enhanced sequence for depicting zzso in zzso to zzso of zzso zzso were identified only on the dynamic study in an additional zzso to zzso of zzso zzso were seen equally well on the standard and dynamic sequences only in zzso to zzso of zzso The standard zzso sequence was judged better in zzso to zzso of cases, with zzso identified only on the standard sequence in an additional zzso to zzso 

Dynamic traditional zzso MR imaging improved zzso detection and provided increased clarity over standard sequences after contrast zzso Both sequences are important, since zzso were detected only on the dynamic sequence in zzso to zzso of patients and only on the standard sequence in zzso to zzso of zzso
