zzso evidence suggests that iron deposition is present in the later stages of zzso In this study we examined abnormal phase values, indicative of increased iron content on zzso phase images of the zzso in zzso patients and zzso We also examined the association of abnormal phase with conventional MR imaging outcomes at first clinical zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso female, 11 zzso and 65 age and zzso HC (41 female, 24 zzso were scanned on a zzso zzso Mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso years in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso years in zzso while mean disease duration was zzso years zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso were derived for all zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparisons were performed, and associations were determined with other MR imaging zzso 

Patients with zzso had significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus of the zzso compared with zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed significant increases in zzso volume, while zzso was also significantly increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso No global or regional zzso MR imaging differences were found between the study zzso zzso correlations were observed between increased zzso volumes of total zzso zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso zzso with white matter zzso and increased zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso showed significantly increased content and volume of iron, as determined by abnormal zzso zzso in the various zzso structures, suggesting that iron deposition may zzso zzso zzso
