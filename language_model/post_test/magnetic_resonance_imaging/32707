A zzso zzso zzso sequence was implemented to obtain enhanced zzso contrast in actively stained zzso with zzso and contrast zzso mouse brains at zzso zzso Short zzso spacing was used to minimize diffusion and zzso zzso The sequence produced 16 zzso volumes with an zzso spacing of 7 zzso for zzso zzso images of the mouse brains in a scan time of 4 zzso To enhance the zzso ratio zzso and contrast, the zzso frequency domain image contrast zzso method was applied, resulting in a composite image with zzso zzso The high zzso and contrast thus achieved revealed aspects of mouse brain zzso such as multiple cortical zzso groups of zzso zzso layers of the inferior and superior zzso and molecular and zzso layers of the zzso with a high degree of definition and contrast that was not previously achieved in zzso acquisitions at high zzso
