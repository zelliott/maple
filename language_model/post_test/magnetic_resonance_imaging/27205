Increased activity of the zzso has been implicated in the zzso of major depressive disorder zzso in which reductions in zzso volume are present after zzso We conducted the first magnetic resonance imaging analysis of zzso volume in zzso and bipolar disorder zzso 

zzso images zzso approximately zzso zzso were acquired with a zzso zzso and a pulse sequence was zzso for tissue contrast zzso The zzso was manually segmented by one zzso blind to zzso zzso healthy control subjects zzso were compared with both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso depressed BD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depressed zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso BD patients displayed significantly smaller absolute zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes than the HC zzso In post hoc assessments analyzing men and women zzso the zzso women with zzso had smaller absolute zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes than the HC zzso None of the other psychiatric groups differed significantly from the HC zzso 

We provide further evidence for the involvement of the zzso in affective illness but suggest that a reduction in volume might be more pronounced in zzso depressed BD subjects and female currently depressed zzso zzso The zzso plays major roles in the long-term modification of zzso transmission and behavioral responses to stress and in the suppression of zzso cell activity after the absence of an expected zzso A reduction in zzso volume might thus have functional consequences that contribute to the risk for developing affective zzso
