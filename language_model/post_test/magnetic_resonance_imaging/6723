zzso white matter zzso are frequently observed on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans in elderly people and are associated with stroke and zzso zzso blood pressure is presumed one of the main risk factors, although data are almost exclusively derived from zzso zzso We assessed in 10 European zzso the relation between zzso and previously measured blood pressure levels, hypertension, its treatment, and severe cerebral white matter zzso In total, zzso zzso subjects aged 65 to 75 years were sampled from ongoing community-based studies that were initiated 5 to 20 years before the zzso White matter zzso in the zzso and zzso region were rated separately using zzso zzso We performed zzso zzso analyses adjusted for potential zzso in zzso people with complete zzso zzso and formerly assessed zzso and zzso blood pressure levels were positively associated with severe white matter zzso Both increases and decreases in zzso blood pressure were associated with more severe zzso white matter zzso zzso in zzso blood pressure levels was associated with more severe zzso and zzso white matter zzso People with poorly controlled hypertension had a higher risk of severe white matter zzso than those without hypertension, or those with controlled or zzso zzso Higher blood pressure was associated with an increased risk of severe white matter zzso zzso treatment of hypertension may reduce this zzso however, a potential negative effect of decreasing zzso blood pressure level on the occurrence of severe zzso white matter zzso should be taken into zzso
