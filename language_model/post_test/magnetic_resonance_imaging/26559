Our purpose in this study was to develop an automated method for zzso of white matter zzso and gray matter zzso regions with multiple sclerosis zzso zzso in magnetic resonance zzso zzso The brain zzso zzso region was derived from a zzso analysis for a zzso zzso The zzso regions were segmented by addition of zzso candidate regions, which were detected by our zzso detection system for the zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso and zzso template from zzso zzso zzso The zzso regions were obtained by zzso of the zzso regions from the zzso zzso We applied our proposed method to zzso zzso and zzso zzso images acquired from 7 zzso patients and 7 control subjects on a zzso T zzso zzso The average similarity zzso between the specific regions obtained by our method and by zzso for the zzso and zzso regions were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso Moreover, they were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, for the control zzso The proposed method might be feasible for zzso of zzso and zzso regions in zzso zzso
