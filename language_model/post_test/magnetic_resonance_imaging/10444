During the 12-month period zzso we performed an zzso zzso zzso operation for a variety of zzso zzso on 72 consecutive zzso Among these, 15 patients zzso required the implant of the collagen zzso Nine patients zzso presented an zzso zzso leak (3 small weeping of zzso and 6 larger zzso in these cases, the zzso was used against the zzso zzso followed by the other materials used for the zzso In 7 other subjects without any evidence of zzso escape, the collagen foil was used to protect and enforce the zzso membrane descent into the zzso cavity to prevent its possible zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso glue was used in all zzso A zzso zzso leak with meningitis occurred in only 1 zzso of the 15 zzso The patient required a zzso for zzso zzso repair and intravenous zzso
