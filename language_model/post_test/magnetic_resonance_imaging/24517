The study advances the idea of using zzso fluid dynamics in the process of planning surgical treatment zzso for patients with zzso airway zzso It is hypothesized that the a zzso knowledge of the functional outcome of surgical intervention on the flow and airway resistance can guide the surgeon in choosing an effective surgical zzso zzso zzso images spanning the respiratory tract of an adult patient with a combined zzso and zzso zzso are used to reconstruct three-dimensional geometrical models of the zzso zzso fluid dynamics is used to obtain airway flow patterns during inspiration and expiration in these zzso zzso predictions about flow zzso pressure distribution on the airway zzso wall zzso stress, and airway resistance are obtained so that the relevance of each individual zzso level is zzso Four different virtual surgeries in different combinations are assessed in order to remedy the zzso zzso The virtual surgery based airway models are evaluated by comparisons with the zzso flow modeling zzso The predicted zzso data revealed that the removal of the zzso at the level of the vocal folds will have the most significant effect on the airway zzso The flow simulations offer a quantitative method of evaluating the airway resistance in patients with combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso of airway zzso and other zzso calculations from different virtual surgeries give additional zzso for the surgeon, in deciding the most appropriate surgery on a case-by-case zzso
