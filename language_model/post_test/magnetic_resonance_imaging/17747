Blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso technique for evaluating kidney tissue zzso that requires no contrast exposure, with the potential to allow functional assessment in patients with zzso zzso artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are preserved in many patients treated for several years with medical zzso therapy without restoring zzso blood zzso The current review is of particular interest as new methods have been applied to the analyses of zzso zzso opening the perspective of its wider zzso in clinical zzso 

Recent findings show that more severe vascular compromise ultimately overwhelms zzso zzso changes, leading to overt cortical zzso and expansion of zzso hypoxic zzso zzso kidney zzso method of analysis, developed as an alternative method of zzso zzso analysis, avoids the assumption of discrete cortical and zzso values and decreases the bias related to operator selection of regions of zzso 

We believe that thoughtful application and analysis of zzso zzso can provide critical insights into changes in zzso function prior to the onset of irreversible zzso injury and may identify patients most likely to gain from measures to reverse or repair disorders of tissue zzso
