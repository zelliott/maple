The objective of this study was to establish internal standards on zzso zzso zzso zzso pathology from zzso zzso The zzso images of 74 patients zzso zzso 23 clinical zzso were reviewed zzso The relative signal intensity of bone zzso was compared to adjacent skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso disk zzso zzso zzso Twenty zzso were zzso compared to muscle, of which 17 zzso cases represented normal red zzso zzso zzso zzso 45 were zzso or zzso compared to muscle, of which 44 zzso represented zzso zzso processes zzso zzso zzso Twelve were zzso compared to zzso of which 12 zzso represented normal red zzso zzso zzso zzso 41 were zzso or zzso compared to zzso of which 40 zzso represented zzso zzso processes zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle and zzso disk may serve as internal standards for zzso zzso pathology from normal zzso zzso zzso zzso that are relatively zzso or zzso to muscle and/or disk should not be considered normal zzso zzso
