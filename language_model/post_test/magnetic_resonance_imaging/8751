The high zzso ratio and zzso ratio of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging can be used to obtain high-resolution zzso images in a short acquisition zzso These advantages are associated with an increased specific zzso rate zzso and more artifacts zzso to zzso zzso and increased zzso and chemical zzso Potential advantages of zzso imaging in children include acquisition of zzso images even with a small field of view zzso The shorter overall acquisition time of zzso imaging is useful in children, who may not be able to cooperate for zzso zzso acquisition times also improve safety by reducing patient monitoring time within the enclosed bore of an MR imaging zzso zzso issues and zzso artifacts are less problematic with a small zzso Parallel imaging helps reduce zzso zzso artifacts, and blurring of zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso images by reducing the echo train zzso
