The zzso mouse is a well-established model of zzso Previous reports have documented zzso dysfunction zzso zzso in these animals, although the extant literature provides limited insights into cardiac structure and function as they change over zzso To better zzso the natural history of zzso in zzso mice, we performed cardiac magnetic resonance zzso scans on these zzso zzso imaging was conducted with a zzso magnet on female zzso mice and control zzso zzso at 5, 9, 13, 17, and 22 zzso of zzso zzso zzso echo sequences were used to obtain zzso zzso slices from zzso to zzso From these images left zzso zzso mass zzso wall zzso zzso volume zzso and ejection fraction zzso were zzso Additionally, cardiac zzso zzso PET zzso zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso on zzso zzso were zzso Relative to control, zzso mice developed significant increases in zzso and wall thickness as early as 9 zzso of zzso zzso zzso slightly later, at 13 zzso Interestingly, compared with the baseline level, zzso in the zzso group did not decrease significantly until 22 zzso Additionally, zzso zzso imaging showed a zzso decrease in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso dysfunction was observed in zzso zzso mice undergoing zzso zzso Finally, real-time quantitative zzso revealed an zzso zzso of the fetal gene program, consistent with a zzso zzso In zzso as assessed by zzso zzso mice develop characteristic structural and functional changes consistent with zzso
