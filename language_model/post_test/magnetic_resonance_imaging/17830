The distribution of blood flow in fetuses with zzso heart disease zzso is likely to influence fetal growth, organ development, and zzso outcome, but has previously been difficult to zzso We present the first zzso of the distribution of the fetal circulation in zzso zzso made using phase contrast cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

Twenty-two fetuses with suspected zzso zzso and twelve normal controls underwent fetal zzso and zzso at a mean of 35 weeks gestation zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso had a mean combined zzso output zzso lower than normal controls zzso zzso zzso In fetuses with zzso zzso with pulmonary zzso zzso pulmonary blood flow was significantly lower than in those with zzso zzso without pulmonary zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso All three fetuses with pulmonary zzso obstruction had pulmonary zzso by fetal zzso and zzso zzso zzso with small but zzso forming left zzso with left zzso zzso tract or zzso arch obstruction had reduced ascending zzso and zzso zzso flow compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso had more variable superior zzso zzso flows than normal controls zzso zzso zzso Six fetuses with zzso had brain weights at or below the 5th zzso for zzso age, while none of the fetuses in the normal control group had brain weights below the 25th zzso 

zzso of the distribution of the fetal circulation in late gestation zzso zzso is feasible with zzso We demonstrated links between fetal blood flow distribution and zzso course, and examined the relationship between fetal zzso and lung and brain zzso zzso enhances our understanding of zzso of the fetal circulation and, with more experience, may help with the planning of zzso management and fetal zzso
