We studied two zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) characterized by an unremitting and severe course and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) characterized by a zzso course and some periods of zzso Patients were assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso A group of 32 zzso and zzso normal volunteers served as comparison zzso During the zzso zzso zzso period, patients performed a serial verbal learning zzso MR images were segmented into gray, white and zzso fluid regions, and warped to average normal zzso PET images were zzso to the MR images and similarly zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were characterized by lower zzso rates in the zzso lobe and zzso and lower zzso ratios than zzso zzso zzso zzso statistical probability mapping zzso lower zzso rates in the right zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso These differences zzso be attributed to differences in age, symptom severity, task performance during zzso zzso or severity of zzso zzso Factor analysis of the cortical surface identified significantly lower zzso lobe zzso rates in zzso patients than zzso zzso A combined zzso deficit or greater cortical change may be associated with poorer zzso zzso
