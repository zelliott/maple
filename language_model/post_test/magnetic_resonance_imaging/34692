The authors investigated the clinical usefulness of recording motor evoked zzso after zzso magnetic stimulation in zzso peripheral nerve and cervical zzso zzso 

To show that the measurement of central motor zzso time from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso can be used as a good screening method for double zzso involving peripheral nerves and the cervical zzso 

zzso magnetic stimulation has been used in the diagnosis of zzso cervical zzso This technique could be useful in the assessment of patients with an zzso zzso and cervical zzso 

Motor evoked zzso after zzso magnetic zzso compound muscle action zzso and F waves after zzso peripheral nerve stimulation were recorded from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The central motor zzso time was calculated by zzso the peripheral zzso time from the motor evoked zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso peripheral nerve and cervical zzso zzso were zzso Two patients did not show satisfactory improvement after the zzso of the zzso zzso and six patients had zzso of lower zzso In seven of these patients, the central motor zzso time was prolonged an average of zzso standard zzso of the normal zzso The remaining two patients had spinal zzso zzso due to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The spinal zzso zzso was demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, but the central motor zzso time was zzso zzso symptoms improved in these two patients after zzso surgery at the zzso site zzso 

zzso of the central motor zzso time using motor evoked zzso is an ideal diagnostic approach for patients with zzso zzso zzso and cervical zzso zzso
