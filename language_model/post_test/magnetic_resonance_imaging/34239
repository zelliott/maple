A multiple zzso zzso high resolution imaging method is proposed to better zzso different sources of zzso in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Eight echoes are collected from 30 zzso to 205 zzso with an echo spacing of 25 zzso All echoes show significant zzso but each echo reveals its own pattern of zzso From this zzso it appears that large vessel contributions can be separated from small vessel contributions using a fuzzy cluster analysis across echo zzso The results demonstrate the importance of a multiple zzso echo data acquisition approach in zzso various vascular contributions to brain zzso in zzso
