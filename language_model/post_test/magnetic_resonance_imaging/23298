The zzso plays a key role in brain processing of noxious and innocuous zzso zzso The anterior and the zzso portions of the insular zzso are involved in different ways in zzso and zzso zzso zzso their zzso functional connectivity may also zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the activity and functional connectivity of insular zzso zzso during noxious and innocuous zzso zzso In 11 healthy subjects, zzso controlled noxious and innocuous warm and cold stimuli were applied to the left zzso To differentiate between the zzso of the insular zzso involved in pain processing and those involved in temperature processing, a zzso zzso zzso analysis was zzso zzso processing insular areas zzso effect of zzso were detected in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso processing insular areas zzso effect of zzso were also found in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso The individual signal time courses from the zzso and temperature processing insular zzso clusters were used for calculation and comparison of zzso functional connectivity of zzso and zzso by means of a correlation zzso As expected, both zzso and zzso were functionally connected to a large brain network - which predominantly includes areas involved in zzso and zzso primary zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso association zzso zzso When statistically zzso during both noxious and innocuous zzso zzso was more strongly connected to zzso and to zzso than was zzso zzso meanwhile was more strongly connected to zzso and to the primary motor zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was more strongly connected to zzso than to zzso during painful stimulation but not during innocuous zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is more strongly functionally connected to areas known for affective and cognitive processing, whereas zzso is more strongly connected with areas known for zzso processing of noxious and zzso zzso
