zzso in diagnostic performance of breast dynamic zzso zzso has highlighted the need for improved zzso While guidance exists on some aspects of the technique, zzso there is no standardized method for selecting repetition time and flip angle, which are important zzso of image zzso This study develops a theoretical framework for quantitative zzso of zzso aspects of dynamic zzso zzso based on area under the receiver operating zzso zzso in simulation demonstrate the potential for increases in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by up to zzso and specificity at a sensitivity of zzso by up to zzso depending on the zzso These results suggest that careful selection of repetition time and flip angle can improve diagnostic performance and identify these quantities as potentially important parameters for future zzso
