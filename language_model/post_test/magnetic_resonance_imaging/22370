The goal of the present work was to develop minimally invasive imaging techniques to monitor local zzso of peripheral nerves and to determine the extent of return to function of brain cortical regions associated with that zzso The zzso nerve crush model was applied to zzso rats and conventional zzso zzso for zzso zzso and cell architecture was carried out, as well as traditional behavioral testing, to verify that nerve zzso was zzso The rate of zzso nerve zzso was measured by determining the distance a zzso zzso probe zzso would move along the zzso membrane following a direct injection into the zzso zzso This movement was monitored using a zzso based, zzso zzso zzso Two to five days after the zzso the dye moved zzso + zzso zzso as compared to a distance of zzso + zzso zzso in the normal zzso Between 9 and 13 days following the zzso the distance the dye moved increases to zzso + zzso zzso similar to the control, and by 15 days following the zzso the distance increased to zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso were performed on zzso zzso rats to monitor the return of zzso cortical functions, which were activated by the stimulation of the zzso peripheral zzso zzso results showed the return of cortical zzso around 15 days following the crush zzso However, the zzso cortical region activated by stimulating the crushed zzso was significantly smaller in extent than the intact zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso imaging and zzso can integrate local and system level zzso of nerve zzso in a zzso manner, thus enabling serial imaging of individual zzso
