We created a spatial probability zzso of schizophrenia to provide information about the zzso zzso of brain regions of patients with the zzso zzso maps of 16 regions of interest zzso were constructed by taking manually zzso zzso from subjects' magnetic resonance images zzso and zzso transforming them into zzso space using the Montreal Neurological Institute zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso zzso with a principal focus on zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso ranged from 11 to 28 for the different zzso Our global measure of the spatial distribution of the transformed zzso was the sum of zzso with 50% overlap among zzso The superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had lower values for schizophrenic subjects than for normal controls, suggestive of greater spatial zzso for these zzso in schizophrenic zzso For the zzso of statistical significance of group differences in portions of the zzso we used zzso comparisons and zzso exact zzso zzso schizophrenic patients compared with controls showed lower probability zzso zzso zzso at zzso areas of zzso zzso and zzso zzso lateral and anterior regions in the left zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso most zzso of schizophrenic subjects showed a significantly lower spatial overlap than controls, even after zzso spatial zzso suggesting a greater zzso in the spatial distribution of zzso There is consequently a need for caution in zzso studies where data from schizophrenic subjects are zzso to a particular zzso coordinate system based on healthy zzso zzso group differences in zzso may simply reflect a greater zzso of spatial distribution in zzso
