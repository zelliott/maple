A promising approach in zzso studies aimed at understanding effects of single genetic zzso on behavior is the study of zzso zzso Variation in the zzso gene zzso is associated with the regulation of zzso levels in the prefrontal zzso and with cognitive zzso Given the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso behavior, a trait characterized by zzso and zzso especially in men, zzso (as a zzso may index a set of zzso zzso and neural characteristics pertinent to understanding zzso effects of genetic variation in the zzso zzso In the current study, we used a zzso approach to investigate effects of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso on brain activity during moments involving low or high demands on cognitive zzso In 104 male participants, zzso zzso depended zzso on zzso and zzso stronger zzso in the zzso anterior zzso and lateral prefrontal zzso was found for zzso individuals with high trait zzso while stronger zzso in zzso motor areas and zzso zzso was found for zzso individuals with low zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso coupled with high levels of trait zzso lowers the efficiency of stimulus conflict resolution, whereas the zzso zzso coupled with low levels of zzso lowers the efficiency of response zzso
