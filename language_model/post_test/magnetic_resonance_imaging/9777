While the zzso system theory continues to be part of common scientific zzso its zzso has been questioned on multiple zzso Nonetheless, the issue of whether or not there exists a set of brain areas zzso dedicated to emotional processing remains central within affective zzso Recently, a widespread neural reference space for emotion which includes zzso as well as other regions was characterized in a large zzso As zzso zzso studies go into such zzso showing in an individual study in which all parameters are kept constant, the involvement of overlapping areas for various emotion conditions in keeping with the neural reference space for emotion, would serve as valuable zzso zzso Here, using zzso 20 young adult men were scanned while viewing validated neutral and effective zzso short film excerpts shown to quickly and specifically elicit zzso amusement, or sexual zzso Each zzso run included, in random order, multiple neutral and emotion condition zzso A stringent conjunction analysis revealed a large overlap across emotion conditions that fit remarkably well with the neural reference space for zzso This overlap included symmetrical bilateral zzso of the zzso prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso the amygdala, the zzso the thalamus, the zzso nucleus, the zzso zzso the zzso as well as the frontal zzso extending towards the anterior zzso This study clearly confirms for the visual zzso that processing emotional stimuli leads to widespread increases in zzso that cluster within relatively confined areas, regardless of zzso
