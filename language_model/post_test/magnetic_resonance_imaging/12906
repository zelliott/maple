We hypothesized that physical activity zzso which is often associated with reduced risk of zzso stroke, may also be associated with reduced risk of zzso cerebral zzso 

We studied the zzso association between PA and zzso cerebral zzso among African-Americans in the zzso zzso in Communities zzso zzso 

PA zzso at baseline and images from cerebral zzso examination obtained 6 years later were evaluated for presence and location of zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso in zzso After zzso zzso participants were eligible for zzso 

The results suggested an inverse relationship between odds of having a zzso cerebral zzso and level of PA on several measures, although the multivariable adjusted odds ratios zzso were statistically significant only for the sport zzso A zzso increase in the sport score, indicating more leisure zzso was associated with an adjusted OR for having a zzso cerebral zzso of zzso zzso with a statistically significant zzso trend across zzso of the score zzso zzso zzso There was no association of work scores with zzso zzso 

In African-Americans, sport PA was zzso related to zzso zzso cerebral zzso assessed six years zzso
