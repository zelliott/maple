zzso treatment of stroke carries the risk of zzso zzso zzso the potential of zzso for prediction of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso bleeding is explored to identify patients in whom zzso treatment may provoke such zzso 

zzso zzso rats zzso zzso were submitted to middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso followed 3 hours later by zzso infusion of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were infused with zzso zzso imaging was performed before treatment and included apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso mapping and contrast enhancement with zzso The distribution of zzso zzso was studied 3 days later by zzso zzso 

zzso embolism led to the rapid decline of zzso in the territory of the zzso zzso zzso zzso volume derived from zzso imaging increased by zzso in the zzso animals and by zzso in the treated animals zzso determined on the zzso sections after 3 zzso This same zzso growth in both groups indicated absence of therapeutic effect after zzso treatment zzso zzso transformations were significantly more frequent in treated zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso were found in the border zone of the zzso zzso in treated animals, zzso transformations occurred in the zzso core zzso zzso zzso were predicted by a zzso of the zzso barrier in 3 of 4 animals before treatment by zzso contrast enhancement but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The region of contrast enhancement zzso with subsequent bleeding in these zzso 

The zzso of zzso barrier but not of other MR parameters allows risk assessment for zzso transformation induced by subsequent zzso zzso
