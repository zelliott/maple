zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso fat are associated with insulin resistance and vary by sex and zzso Recently, pancreatic fat fraction zzso has also been linked with increasing zzso Our aim was to assess ethnic and sex differences in zzso and its relationship to other fat zzso circulating free fatty acids zzso insulin zzso and sensitivity, and inflammation in obese adolescents and young zzso 

We examined 138 (40 zzso 98 zzso obese Hispanics and African Americans zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso volumes, zzso fat fraction zzso and zzso were determined by magnetic resonance zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso function were assessed during an intravenous zzso tolerance zzso 

Hispanics had higher zzso than African Americans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso this ethnic difference was higher in young adults compared with children and adolescents zzso zzso age: P zzso zzso Males had higher zzso than females zzso zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with inflammatory markers but lost significance when adjusted for zzso In multiple zzso zzso analysis, zzso and zzso were the best zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant correlations between zzso and markers of insulin sensitivity or zzso zzso 

zzso is higher in Hispanics than African Americans, and this difference increases with zzso In young obese individuals, zzso is related to zzso zzso and circulating zzso thus possibly contributing to their increased risk for type 2 diabetes and related zzso zzso
