zzso demonstrates zzso properties in adult models of cerebral zzso acting as a potent zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso in a zzso rat model of zzso leading to both cortical zzso and injury in the underlying white matter observed using zzso and zzso zzso was given zzso as either a single dose before zzso or a zzso regimen, combining one before zzso and one 24 h after zzso At 48 h after injury, neither a significant reduction in cortical zzso volume nor a variation in the number of zzso and zzso cells within the zzso zzso was observed in zzso animals compared with zzso However, a decrease in the density of tomato zzso cells after zzso treatment was found in the white matter underlying cortical zzso Furthermore, we showed a marked increase in the zzso basic zzso in the zzso and in the density of mature zzso zzso in both the zzso zzso and external zzso These results suggest that zzso is not able to reduce cortical zzso volume in a zzso stroke model but strongly reduces inflammation and promotes subsequent zzso in the white zzso
