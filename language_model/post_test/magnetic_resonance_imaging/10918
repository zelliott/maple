The integration of auditory and visual spatial information is an important prerequisite for accurate orientation in the zzso However, while visual spatial information is based on retinal zzso the auditory system receives information on sound location in relation to the zzso Thus, any zzso of the eyes from a central position results in a divergence between the retinal visual and the zzso auditory zzso It has been suggested that this divergence is compensated for by a neural coordinate zzso using a signal of zzso zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated which cortical areas of the human brain participate in such zzso coordinate zzso Sounds were produced with different zzso level differences, leading to left, right or central zzso zzso while subjects directed their gaze to visual targets presented to the left, to the right or straight zzso When gaze was to the left or right, we found the primary visual zzso zzso activated in both zzso The zzso zzso did not occur with sound zzso per se, but was found exclusively in combination with eccentric eye zzso This result suggests a relation of neural processing in the visual zzso and the transformation of auditory spatial coordinates responsible for maintaining the zzso alignment of audition and vision with changes in gaze zzso
