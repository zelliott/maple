We used functional brain imaging to zzso zzso zzso and to elaborate the neural zzso underlying performance of complex motor zzso 

The zzso organization and zzso functioning of the normal human motor system have great significance for understanding motor dysfunction and zzso in zzso Working with victims of penetrating head injuries, noted Russian neuropsychologist Aleksandr zzso zzso designed several tests of fine motor control to understand their difficulties with complex voluntary zzso This led to his zzso that such function involves the zzso zzso and their interaction with the zzso zzso 

Six healthy young adults performed the hand zzso zzso and piano key tasks during blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 zzso 

All 3 tasks revealed zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, while hand zzso relied more on the zzso zzso area and right zzso zzso zzso and piano key relied more on the supplementary motor zzso 

We zzso that differences in zzso zzso across these tasks relate to degrees of sequential movement, zzso and zzso These results zzso zzso original zzso and extend that work by providing a further characterization of the motor areas involved in complex motor zzso
