zzso cooling has been proposed as an effective strategy to limit the deleterious effects of zzso muscle damage on zzso zzso However, the literature reports conflicting zzso 

This zzso controlled trial aimed to determine the effects of a new treatment, localized zzso zzso zzso on the recovery zzso of zzso function following a zzso eccentric zzso 

Controlled laboratory zzso 

A total of 24 participants were included in either a control group zzso or a zzso group zzso Immediately after 3 sets of 20 zzso zzso eccentric zzso of elbow zzso and then 1, 2, and 3 days after exercise, the zzso group received a zzso treatment (3 zzso 4 minutes at zzso separated by 1 zzso The day before and 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after exercise, several parameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso and its associated zzso zzso activity recorded by a zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso biceps zzso zzso relaxation time zzso measured using magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso decreased similarly for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso No intergroup differences were found for zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso activity, and zzso level averaged across the whole biceps zzso zzso protein significantly increased for zzso zzso at 72 hours, P zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso delayed the significant increase of zzso and the decrease of zzso activity level for zzso compared with zzso (between day 1 and day 3) in the zzso part of the biceps zzso 

Although some indicators of muscle damage after severe eccentric exercise were delayed zzso local formation of zzso and decrease of muscle zzso by repeated zzso zzso we provide evidence that this cooling procedure failed to improve long-term recovery of muscle zzso 

Four applications of zzso zzso in the 3 days after a zzso eccentric exercise are ineffective overall in promoting long-term muscle zzso Further studies taking into account the amount of zzso muscle damage would allow investigators to make stronger conclusions regarding the inefficiency of this recovery zzso
