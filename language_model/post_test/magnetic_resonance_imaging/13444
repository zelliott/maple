This study evaluated the relationship of skeletal muscle energy metabolism to zzso blood flow and muscle mass in the dominant zzso and zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso resonance zzso was used to determine zzso pH and the ratio of zzso zzso to zzso zzso an index of energy zzso zzso blood flow and muscle mass were measured by zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso zzso and flow were determined at rest and during zzso exercise in both zzso After a zzso period, six normal right-handed male subjects performed zzso zzso of wrist zzso exercise in the magnet (1 contraction every 5 zzso first with the zzso zzso and then with the D zzso at 23, 46, and 69 zzso At rest, there were no differences between zzso in zzso or zzso However, at each work load the D zzso demonstrated significantly lower zzso and higher pH than the zzso zzso Blood flow was not significantly different between the zzso at rest or during zzso Because these subjects were not engaged in unilateral arm training, we conclude that 1) zzso is lower and pH is higher in the D compared with the zzso zzso in normal subjects during zzso exercise, 2) these differences are independent of muscle mass and blood flow, and 3) the cumulative effect of zzso low-level daily activity provides an adequate training stimulus for muscular zzso zzso
