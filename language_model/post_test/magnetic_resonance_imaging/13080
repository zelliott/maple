The maintenance of a zzso of zzso and sodium zzso across the cell zzso is essential for the zzso function of the zzso zzso The measurement of the spatial distribution of zzso changing zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising approach in clinical zzso to measure tissue zzso zzso studies were focused mainly on zzso imaging as well as zzso with only one zzso study for zzso zzso In this paper a triple resonant zzso zzso setup for the rat head at zzso is presented for imaging of both zzso zzso and zzso and the acquisition of anatomical zzso images in the same experiment without moving the subject or the zzso zzso In zzso MR images of zzso and zzso in the rat brain were acquired as well as anatomical zzso images in the same scanning zzso
