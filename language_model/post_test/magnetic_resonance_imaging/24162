zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso brain areas active during manipulation of complex zzso In one experiment subjects were required to manipulate complex objects for exploring their zzso features as compared to manipulation of a simple smooth object (a zzso In a second experiment subjects were asked to manipulate complex objects and to silently name them upon recognition as compared to manipulation of complex not recognizable objects without covert zzso zzso of complex objects resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso of a region in the zzso zzso (most probably corresponding to the anterior zzso area in the zzso of area zzso and of a sector of the superior zzso zzso When the objects were covertly named additional zzso were found in the zzso part of BA 44 and in the zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso We suggest that a zzso circuit for manipulation of objects exists in humans and involves basically the same areas as in the zzso It is proposed that area zzso analyses the intrinsic object characteristics whilst the superior zzso zzso is related to zzso
