We show, for the first time, that in cortical areas, for example the insular, zzso and lateral prefrontal cortex, there is zzso noise in the zzso zzso level dependent zzso time series, with the zzso of the noise increasing approximately zzso with the square of the zzso Classical zzso zzso models are based on zzso models with time zzso zzso structure, and thus do not take this zzso noise into zzso To address this zzso here we describe a zzso zzso model with zzso noise, and a novel, likelihood ratio test for zzso zzso We apply this approach to the data from an zzso study to investigate the source of the zzso zzso control of taste intensity and taste zzso zzso The zzso causality with zzso noise analysis reveals effects not identified by classical zzso zzso zzso In particular, there is a zzso effect from the zzso lateral prefrontal zzso to the insular taste zzso during attention to intensity but not to zzso and there is a zzso effect from the anterior and zzso lateral prefrontal zzso to the zzso zzso during attention to zzso but not to zzso In addition, there is stronger forward effective connectivity from the insular taste zzso to the zzso zzso during attention to zzso than during attention to zzso These findings indicate the importance of explicitly modeling zzso noise in functional zzso and reveal some of the processes involved in a biased zzso theory of selective zzso
