The purpose of this study is zzso to zzso the zzso area by intrinsic optical method detecting the changes in regional cerebral blood flow zzso and cortical temperature following zzso activity during median nerve zzso In 18 patients with brain tumors located around the zzso cortex, cortical recording of zzso evoked zzso zzso was performed and localized changes in zzso during median nerve stimulation were measured by a zzso zzso on the locations of zzso and around the zzso area obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In two patients, cortical zzso was also performed during median nerve zzso In zzso study, the significant zzso area of zzso could be obtained in 17 of 18 zzso In cortical recording of zzso the polarity reversal of zzso and zzso was observed in 14 of the 18 zzso In 9 of the 14 patients in whom zzso could be recorded, the localized changes in zzso corresponding to the zzso were detected in the zzso zzso In 2 of the 4 patients in whom zzso could not be recorded zzso the localized changes in zzso could be zzso The increase in zzso during the stimulation was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could demonstrate the localized area, where the increase in zzso was also zzso by observation of the changes in cortical temperature during the zzso The zzso intrinsic optical method detecting zzso and cortical temperature in combination with recording of zzso may be considered useful for brain functional zzso related to zzso zzso
