zzso zzso zzso in zzso disease zzso is not fully zzso Our aim was to determine whether regional zzso due to zzso is associated with abnormalities in regional zzso blood volume zzso and regional zzso transit time zzso as measured by quantitative zzso zzso zzso with zzso time zzso 

zzso patients with zzso (9 men and 10 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 22 cognitively healthy control subjects (11 men and 11 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by using a quantitative zzso method with zzso time zzso From the zzso data, maps of regional cerebral blood flow zzso zzso and zzso were zzso A region of zzso due to zzso was determined by statistical zzso mapping zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso and zzso values within the zzso region were compared between the zzso and control zzso 

Despite the significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no significant difference in zzso was observed between the control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was lower in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso than in the control group zzso zzso zzso though the difference did not reach the level of statistical zzso 

Our results revealed that regional zzso in zzso is not associated with zzso zzso suggesting that the mechanism of zzso is distinct from that in cerebrovascular zzso
