The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of zzso artifacts on zzso MR and to illustrate the zzso among zzso artifacts, variable acquisition zzso and field zzso zzso of zzso artifacts were performed on scans obtained from a volunteer zzso in a zzso General Electric system at zzso of 8, 16, and 32 zzso using a zzso field of view and an zzso bandwidth with a zzso field of zzso zzso zzso at 8 zzso were zzso and zzso zzso at the respective fields of zzso zzso review was also performed in 77 cases of zzso MR performed on a zzso zzso unit for the presence and source of zzso artifact on zzso and zzso zzso Most data reviewed showed no significant interference of zzso artifacts on zzso zzso An zzso zzso fluid collection was a common artifact zzso zzso zzso When present, this was due to shift of fat signal from subcutaneous zzso onto the brain in patients younger than 10 years old zzso zzso zzso and correlated with the distance between brain and subcutaneous fat of less than the linear value of the chemical zzso When this artifact was present in adults zzso zzso zzso it was due to shift of the zzso fat signal across the inner table of the zzso The latter also occurred in one child under zzso zzso location shifts, consistent with the displacement expected from the zzso artifact, were noted in five of five cases of zzso zzso In one of these, the zzso artifact disguised the presence of a large associated zzso The method of calculating the linear displacement of zzso artifact is zzso and the zzso of machine parameters and zzso artifact is zzso zzso artifact increases zzso with field strength and field of zzso zzso the bandwidth to decrease zzso artifact has a zzso penalty in signal to noise but allows a lower time to zzso A lower time to echo can also be accomplished without increasing the bandwidth if zzso sampling is zzso Awareness of the relationships among zzso artifacts, acquisition zzso and field strengths can result in a more tailored examination when the zzso artifact is going to be a significant zzso In addition, interpreter error can be avoided by awareness of these relationships when reviewing images from outside zzso
