Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso impairment and zzso symptoms are frequent in Parkinson's disease, with a zzso cumulative zzso of zzso The aim of this zzso study was to establish the pattern of cerebral zzso on zzso in Parkinson's disease patients with zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to provide an unbiased means of investigating brain volume zzso Whole brain structural zzso zzso scans from Parkinson's disease patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 26), Parkinson's disease patients without zzso zzso zzso 31), Alzheimer's disease patients zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso with zzso bodies zzso zzso zzso 17) and control subjects zzso zzso zzso were zzso Images were zzso using zzso and the zzso method of zzso zzso zzso matter volume in zzso patients compared with controls was observed zzso in the zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso the right frontal lobe and the left zzso zzso as well as some zzso zzso Parkinson's disease patients without zzso showed reduced zzso matter volume in the frontal lobe compared with control zzso There was significant zzso matter zzso zzso in the zzso lobe of zzso patients compared with Parkinson's disease zzso In addition, significant zzso lobe zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso was detected in Alzheimer's disease relative to zzso No significant zzso differences were observed in zzso compared with zzso Thus, Parkinson's disease involves zzso matter loss in frontal zzso In zzso this extends to zzso zzso and zzso areas, with zzso zzso in zzso being the only difference between the two zzso This provides important information about the pattern of cerebral zzso in Parkinson's disease and zzso
