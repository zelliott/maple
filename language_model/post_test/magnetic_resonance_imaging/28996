zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso has appeared as a new tool which is very powerful for cognitive zzso offering the potential to look at the dynamics of cerebral processes underlying zzso zzso and on an individual zzso Work remains to be done to zzso the technique and to better understand its basic mechanisms, but one may expect to build in a few years a functional list of the brain cortical networks of regions implicated in zzso or cognitive zzso Still, the real understanding of brain function requires direct access to the functional unit made of the zzso so that one may look at the transient zzso relationships that exist between largely distributed groups of hundreds or thousands of zzso Furthermore, communication pathways between networks must be identified to establish connectivity maps at the individual scale, taking into account individual zzso resulting from genetic factors and cerebral zzso In this respect, zzso of molecular diffusion is very sensitive to water molecular motion and, thus, to tissue dynamic zzso such as cell zzso zzso data suggest that diffusion zzso zzso dynamic tissue changes associated with large zzso zzso and space orientation of large zzso of zzso zzso in the white zzso
