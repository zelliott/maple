zzso of the functional role of the frontal zzso in zzso auditory change detection include attention zzso response zzso contrast enhancement, and zzso of a zzso zzso These accounts assume different sequential zzso patterns between the zzso and frontal zzso Change detection in the auditory areas of the superior zzso zzso zzso followed by inferior frontal zzso (IFC) zzso for attention switching and response zzso zzso preceded by IFC zzso for contrast zzso and an zzso zzso sequence for the zzso zzso We used the zzso optical signal zzso which provides a zzso resolution of milliseconds and a spatial resolution of 5 to zzso combined with lagged correlation path modeling to examine the response of the right frontal and zzso zzso to auditory duration zzso of varying zzso zzso zzso zzso were also recorded, as was the slow optical zzso brain zzso The data analyses revealed zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns when the zzso represented relatively large, zzso and small changes from the standard zzso zzso These results indicate that the degree of zzso zzso zzso dynamics within the zzso auditory change detection zzso
