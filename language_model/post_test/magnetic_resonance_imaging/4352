To develop appropriate methods of eye muscle surgery in highly zzso patients with zzso and zzso with respect to the pathological findings in high resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

35 patients with unilateral or bilateral high zzso and zzso is, zzso length of the globe averaged zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso and zzso zzso image planes were obtained using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 15 patients with a pathological plane of zzso zzso muscles found by zzso and confirmed zzso a new technique of eye muscle surgery was performed to re-establish the zzso muscle zzso This was checked zzso in addition to the measurement of alignment and zzso by zzso 

The new zzso finding of a dislocation of the lateral zzso zzso into the zzso zzso by zzso zzso requires new surgical zzso Only fixing the zzso in the zzso zzso at the zzso with a silicone loop zzso zzso or a zzso zzso is a zzso zzso This yields alignment and improves abduction and zzso 

If the described zzso of the zzso is detected by zzso a common high dosage zzso procedure for zzso may even aggravate the zzso The most important aim of eye muscle surgery is to zzso the pathological path of the zzso The restoration of the zzso function of the zzso zzso is zzso
