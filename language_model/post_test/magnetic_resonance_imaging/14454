The zzso effects of rapid (10 zzso versus slow (1 zzso IV injection of zzso were compared in normal, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso saline were used as zzso and zzso zzso Two dose levels of zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to dose volumes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The rapid injection of a high dose zzso zzso produced a transient decrease in zzso blood pressure (21 zzso zzso p less than zzso which returned to control values within 1 zzso after the zzso Slow IV infusion at this high dose had no statistically significant zzso zzso There were no statistically significant effects of the lower dose zzso zzso administered as a zzso or by infusion, nor of the saline or zzso control zzso These results suggest that acute zzso effects of zzso are not observed at clinically relevant doses and the zzso observed at a higher dose may result from a direct action of the contrast zzso
