We introduce a zzso approach that combines zzso with zzso to detect abnormal brain structures in medical imagery, and demonstrate its utility in automatically detecting multiple sclerosis zzso zzso in 3-D zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso Our method uses zzso to obtain a zzso decomposition of a zzso zzso MR zzso It then produces a rich set of features describing the segments in terms of intensity, shape, location, neighborhood relations, and anatomical zzso These features are then fed into a decision forest zzso trained with data labeled by experts, enabling the detection of zzso at all zzso Unlike common approaches that use zzso analysis, our system can zzso regional properties that are often important for characterizing abnormal brain zzso We provide experiments on two types of real MR zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 25 zzso patients and a single-channel fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso zzso of 16 zzso zzso Comparing our results with zzso zzso by a human expert and with previously extensively validated results shows the promise of the zzso
