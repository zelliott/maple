To examine the zzso distribution of zzso contrast medium by high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance imaging after zzso and zzso zzso 

Comparative case series in which 4 healthy volunteers were zzso to zzso zzso zzso 2) or zzso zzso zzso 2) injection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed before injection and at 5 minutes and 90 minutes after zzso 

The zzso injection technique resulted in contrast medium primarily in the zzso space, with no zzso observed at the zzso zzso surprisingly, a small amount of contrast medium was observed in the zzso zzso immediately after zzso zzso The zzso injection technique resulted in zzso signal zzso enhancing the zzso space, zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso and zzso zzso The signal intensity was clearly observed in the cavernous zzso surrounding the cavernous portion of the internal carotid zzso A small amount of contrast medium was detected in the zzso zzso 

The zzso injection technique zzso to the zzso space, with access to zzso and central nervous system structures via the zzso canal, superior zzso zzso and cavernous zzso In contrast, the zzso injection technique produces a mostly zzso zzso however, zzso solution may communicate with the central nervous system via the inferior zzso zzso and zzso zzso This novel finding suggests that zzso zzso has a readily accessible route for central nervous system toxic zzso zzso resonance imaging with zzso contrast medium administration provides an important zzso advantage over previously described techniques and is a safe, zzso and superior method of zzso zzso
