A new zzso imaging technique that does not place extreme demands on the speed of the zzso system is zzso When used with comparable zzso systems, the rotating zzso imaging sequence zzso can acquire images 4 to 5 times faster than zzso zzso zzso and more than twice as fast as zzso zzso or zzso zzso Because the technique uses free induction zzso instead of zzso it can be made particularly insensitive to effects of motion, flow, and zzso zzso images of turbulent flow are presented to demonstrate this zzso However, with appropriate zzso flow effects may be zzso
