The exact prevalence of zzso signal abnormalities in healthy relatives of zzso patients and their impact on disease development has not been fully zzso The purpose of this study was to compare zzso signal zzso characteristics and the prevalence of zzso isolated syndrome in healthy control subjects selected randomly from the population with the healthy relatives of patients with zzso 

Healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso underwent physical and zzso MR imaging zzso Healthy control subjects were classified as zzso healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso if they had no family history of zzso or as healthy relatives of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso if they had zzso relative affected with zzso The presence of zzso isolated syndrome was evaluated according to the zzso zzso dissemination in space on MR imaging and fulfillment of zzso isolated syndrome criteria were also evaluated according to zzso zzso 

There was a significantly higher total volume of zzso signal zzso in the healthy relatives of patients with zzso compared with the zzso healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso for signal zzso zzso zzso in size and P zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso in all groups zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso were significantly higher in the healthy relatives of patients with zzso zzso of the healthy relatives of patients with zzso and zzso of zzso healthy control subjects showed zzso zzso signal zzso zzso of subjects in the healthy relatives of patients with zzso group and zzso of zzso healthy control subjects fulfilled zzso isolated syndrome according to the zzso criteria, whereas zzso and zzso of subjects fulfilled zzso isolated syndrome according to the zzso zzso In the healthy relatives of patients with zzso smoking was associated with the presence of zzso signal zzso whereas obesity was related to the presence of zzso zzso signal abnormalities and to fulfillment of zzso isolated syndrome according to the zzso zzso 

The frequency of zzso signal abnormalities and zzso isolated syndrome is higher in the healthy relatives of patients with multiple sclerosis patients compared with zzso healthy control zzso
