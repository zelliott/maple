zzso insular functional topography is essential for assessing zzso consequences of neural zzso We examined that topography in the five major insular zzso zzso to three zzso challenges, the zzso hand zzso and foot cold zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso healthy subjects (age zzso zzso 47 zzso 9 zzso performed four 18 s zzso maneuvers (30 zzso zzso load zzso four hand grip challenges (16 s at zzso zzso and a foot cold zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso scans recorded every 2 zzso Signal trends were compared across zzso using repeated measures zzso zzso zzso higher signals in left anterior versus zzso zzso appeared during zzso strain, and in the first 4 s of zzso The right anterior zzso showed sustained higher signals up to 2 s zzso relative to zzso zzso with zzso zzso Left anterior zzso signals were higher than zzso areas during the hand grip zzso All right anterior zzso showed increased signals over zzso up to 12 s zzso with decline in the zzso zzso from 10 to 24 s during zzso The left three anterior zzso showed relatively lower signals only during the 90 s recovery of the cold zzso while the two zzso right zzso signals increased only during the zzso zzso representation of zzso signals appear in the anterior right zzso for the zzso zzso a zzso zzso signal representation for hand zzso and zzso zzso zzso representation for the cold zzso The functional organization of the insular zzso is zzso to unique zzso zzso
