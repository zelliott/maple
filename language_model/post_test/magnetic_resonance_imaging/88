The brain is widely assumed to be a zzso example of a complex, zzso zzso As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of zzso zzso and zzso zzso coherent zzso Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of zzso zzso there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most zzso and zzso zzso for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and zzso zzso By studying the zzso fluctuations of power in human zzso zzso we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some zzso zzso there is strong evidence for zzso and zzso in key brain zzso zzso is manifest as zzso bursting between zzso and zzso modes in the alpha zzso zzso is expressed through the irregular appearance of high zzso zzso events in beta rhythm power zzso The statistical zzso of these observations was confirmed through comparison with zzso zzso surrogate zzso Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding zzso in cortical zzso the implications of the zzso events challenge existing zzso for understanding large-scale brain zzso
