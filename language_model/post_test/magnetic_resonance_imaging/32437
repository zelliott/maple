To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in depicting in zzso recruitment of iron zzso zzso in zzso induced zzso zzso 

The study was performed according to the guidelines of the zzso National Institutes of Health and recommendations of the committee on animal zzso The protocol was approved by the local institutional review committee on animal zzso Experimental zzso infection in 12 mice was induced by zzso with a 5 zzso zzso zzso units of zzso zzso into the left zzso zzso zzso were harvested from zzso mice, zzso and labeled with iron oxide in zzso The iron zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso 6) or iron oxide solution zzso group, zzso zzso 6) was administered through the tail zzso The left calf of the mice was zzso on days 2 and 3 with a zzso MR zzso Changes in relative signal intensity zzso and pattern of contrast material enhancement zzso zzso were analyzed and compared with zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed with the zzso zzso signed rank zzso 

On MR images obtained 24 hours after administration of zzso labeled with iron oxide, a zzso lower zzso zone was noted in the zzso wall, which corresponded to the distribution of the iron zzso zzso at zzso zzso The relative zzso of the zzso wall significantly decreased after injection of iron zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that before injection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the control group, the zzso change after administration of iron oxide solution was not significant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso administered iron zzso zzso can be monitored with MR imaging and may provide a tool to investigate interactions between zzso and the invading zzso
