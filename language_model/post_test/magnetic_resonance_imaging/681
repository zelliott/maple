In this paper, we propose an approach to modeling functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data that combines zzso zzso models, zzso zzso and zzso A cubic zzso is used to fit the zzso time courses of zzso design zzso The zzso of the zzso are estimated by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso model, which allows us to borrow strength from all zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso are then transformed to the times and zzso of the minimum and maximum points on the zzso response curve, which are in turn used to zzso the zzso as being activated or zzso The procedure is demonstrated on real data from an zzso design experiment of visually guided zzso and shown to be an effective alternative to existing zzso
