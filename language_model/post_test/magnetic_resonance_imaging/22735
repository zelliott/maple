This article presents results obtained from applying various tools from zzso zzso Software zzso to data from the repetition zzso experiment used for the zzso zzso Image Analysis zzso We present analyses from the zzso General Linear Model zzso tool zzso and from the zzso independent component analysis tool zzso We also discuss the application of tools for the correction of image zzso prior to the statistical analysis and the utility of recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso time series modeling and zzso such as the use of optimal constrained zzso basis function modeling and mixture modeling zzso The combination of zzso response function zzso and mixture zzso in particular, revealed that both sentence content and speaker voice zzso effects occurred zzso along the length of the superior zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that both are processed in a single underlying system without any significant zzso for content zzso voice zzso
