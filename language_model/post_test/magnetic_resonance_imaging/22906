To evaluate the association of dynamic enhancement parameters of benign and zzso breast zzso at magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso distribution and zzso zzso tumor zzso 

Regional review board approval and informed consent were zzso zzso zzso specimens of breast zzso (32 benign, 86 zzso in 118 patients (age range, zzso years; mean, 58 zzso who had undergone dynamic zzso MR imaging of both breasts were included in the zzso Different MR enhancement parameters and zzso density zzso distribution were zzso In zzso zzso zzso stage, tumor grade, zzso activity, and hormone zzso expression were zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso Fisher zzso zzso zzso and zzso tests; and zzso zzso analysis were used for zzso 

zzso zzso exhibited a higher ratio of zzso in tumor periphery versus tumor center than did benign zzso zzso zzso zzso High vessel ratios zzso zzso zzso and low central vessel numbers zzso zzso zzso were associated with high tumor zzso In zzso zzso initial enhancement ratios of periphery to center of zzso correlated with the corresponding zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso Yet, a high peripheral zzso was not associated with strong peripheral enhancement zzso zzso zzso High enhancement ratios, zzso rates, and early enhancement zzso were associated with zzso albeit not zzso zzso zzso Visible rim enhancement was the most accurate zzso enhancement criterion for zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso tumor grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso was the best discriminating criterion for zzso zzso 

The different enhancement behaviors of zzso and benign breast zzso cannot be explained by zzso alone; however, a low zzso in the center of zzso is reflected zzso by a high enhancement ratio and zzso by rim enhancement, with an implication of adverse zzso
