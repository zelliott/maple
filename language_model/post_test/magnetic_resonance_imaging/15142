In the zzso experience, the appearance of a cervical high-intensity zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso images in the absence of local spinal zzso zzso is frequently observed in patients with zzso although it has been mentioned only sporadically in the zzso zzso the authors conducted a retrospective study in a consecutive zzso series of patients with zzso to determine the prevalence and imaging features of this zzso They also reviewed the zzso 

zzso MR imaging studies obtained to establish diagnoses in 25 adult patients with zzso and assessed at the zzso University Medical Center after zzso zzso developed were evaluated for the presence of a zzso zzso Imaging features of the zzso were zzso and a literature search was zzso The zzso zzso was demonstrated in 16 of 25 adult patients with zzso zzso in the absence of local spinal zzso zzso All zzso were located at the zzso level and appeared to be confined to the gray zzso The zzso zzso was associated with local spinal zzso zzso most likely representing focal zzso In their literature search the authors found no description of the zzso zzso in adults, although its presence has been mentioned as a zzso in the pediatric zzso zzso 

In this large series of adults with zzso and symptomatic zzso zzso a zzso zzso was frequently depicted on imaging studies, but it remains a fully explored imaging zzso Its cause and clinical relevance require investigation, as does its prevalence in the general zzso zzso
