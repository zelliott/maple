To investigate whether the expansion of zzso repeats of the zzso protein zzso gene is involved in the zzso of neurodegenerative diseases, we have screened 118 patients with various forms of neurological disease and identified a zzso patient with unique zzso symptoms consisting of zzso and intellectual deterioration associated with de zzso expansion of the zzso repeat of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso with an expanded zzso stretch zzso zzso was demonstrated to be expressed in zzso cell lines at a level comparable with that of zzso zzso The zzso repeat of the zzso gene consists of zzso zzso repeat and the de zzso expansion involves partial zzso of the zzso zzso The present study provides new insights into zzso zzso repeat diseases that involve de zzso zzso repeat zzso
