A multilayered surface zzso array for magnetic resonance imaging with an improved zzso ratio zzso performance is introduced and investigated by a simulation zzso By using an effective decoupling method, the strong mutual zzso effect between the zzso layers can be accurately removed, leading to a coherent combination of the signals of the individual zzso This results in a much stronger received signal power which increases with the number of zzso layers in the zzso This, together with a smaller rate of increase of noise power with the number of zzso zzso leads to a net increase in the zzso of array output with the number of zzso layers in the zzso zzso zzso simulation examples have been carried out to confirm and verify the performance of the new zzso
