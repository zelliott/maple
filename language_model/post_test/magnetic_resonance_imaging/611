We explored the relationship between structural zzso zzso of cerebral integrity and executive control function zzso in two groups of healthy zzso A maturing group zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso group zzso adults; zzso zzso zzso was assessed using the Executive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cerebral integrity included zzso zzso zzso span, and zzso span, each measured for five cortical regions per zzso zzso zzso included fractional zzso zzso measured using zzso zzso and the volume of zzso zzso zzso In the maturing group, no significant relationships between zzso changes and zzso were zzso however, there were hints that zzso maturation of cerebral zzso influenced zzso in zzso In the zzso group, the decline in zzso corresponded to zzso changes in cerebral zzso zzso and zzso zzso primarily in the superior frontal and anterior zzso zzso A large fraction of the zzso in zzso zzso can be explained by zzso in the structural zzso from these two zzso
