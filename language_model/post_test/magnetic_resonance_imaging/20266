Identification of abnormalities in the zzso zzso in patients with zzso is critical in their zzso In this report, we present a zzso zzso with zzso who demonstrated an enlarged zzso cerebral zzso and diffuse volume loss in the zzso zzso on conventional MR imaging zzso The zzso frontal white matter demonstrated relatively increased zzso fractional zzso and cerebral blood volume values compared to published zzso zzso In addition, the white matter of the zzso zzso demonstrated elevated zzso and increased mean zzso compared to published zzso data, supporting the abnormal conventional MR zzso Advanced MR zzso techniques may help further confirm and characterize abnormalities in the smaller zzso zzso in zzso zzso
