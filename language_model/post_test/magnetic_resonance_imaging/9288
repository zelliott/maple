This study aimed at combining an zzso zzso vessel size index magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso approach, and a zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso approach zzso zzso to characterize zzso zzso zzso bearing an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso and combined zzso and zzso zzso 4 h later, at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso per zzso and zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso of iron per zzso were used for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were equally permeable to zzso but presented different blood volume zzso and zzso in good agreement with zzso zzso The presence of zzso yielded reduced zzso zzso The zzso values obtained with zzso in the absence and in the presence of zzso were well correlated for the zzso zzso but not for the zzso zzso It was also observed that, within the time frame of zzso zzso zzso remained zzso in the zzso zzso whereas it zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso zzso can be combined provided that zzso does not zzso with the time frame of the zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms at the origin of zzso zzso remain to be zzso
