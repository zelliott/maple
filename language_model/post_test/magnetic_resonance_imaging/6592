zzso language tasks reliably identify language areas in zzso zzso patients, but zzso using single zzso may disagree with the zzso zzso test zzso 

To determine whether a panel of zzso tasks targeting different aspects of language processing increases accuracy in determining zzso language zzso 

Twenty-six patients age 12 to 56 years, predominantly with zzso lobe zzso were studied using zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso imaging, blood zzso zzso with three task categories using a block zzso verbal zzso reading zzso and auditory zzso zzso zzso maps were visually rated at three zzso All patients had assessment of language zzso by zzso 

zzso showed left dominance in 21 patients, right dominance in 2, and bilateral zzso in 2; zzso disagreed over a left vs right bilateral rating in 1 zzso There was full agreement between zzso and zzso in 21 of 25 patients zzso failed in zzso In three instances of partial disparity with zzso the zzso panel showed consistent findings across zzso zzso between zzso was excellent zzso disagreement in only one zzso the panel of tasks was superior to any single task for zzso agreement zzso V zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

A panel of zzso language zzso may be more accurate for evaluating partial zzso patients than a single zzso A panel of tasks reduces the likelihood of zzso findings, improves zzso zzso and helps confirm language zzso
