Our objective was to evaluate the preliminary results of 25 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Case zzso 

All 25 shoulders had longer than 3 months zzso with an average of zzso months zzso 3 to 48 zzso The average age was zzso years zzso 41 to 78 zzso The average time from onset of symptoms to surgery was zzso months zzso 1 to 72 zzso The shoulders were evaluated using a modified zzso score, Napoleon test, zzso test, zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for surgery included clinical and/or zzso evidence of a rotator cuff zzso An zzso zzso anchor technique devised by the senior author zzso was used for zzso 

zzso scores increased from a zzso average of zzso to a zzso average of zzso zzso zzso By zzso criteria, excellent and good results were obtained in zzso of patients, with 1 fair and 1 poor zzso Forward zzso increased from an average zzso degrees preoperatively to an average zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso Eight of 9 patients with a positive Napoleon test had complete tears of the zzso All 7 patients with a negative Napoleon test had a tear of the upper half zzso The zzso test could not be performed reliably due to pain or restricted motion in 19 of the 25 zzso Eight patients had isolated tears of the zzso The remaining 17 patients had associated rotator cuff tears with an average total tear size of 5 zzso 8 zzso Ten patients had zzso migration of the zzso zzso Eight of these 10 patients had durable reversal of zzso zzso migration following zzso These 8 patients improved their overhead function from a zzso zzso zzso with attempted zzso of the arm to functional overhead use of the arm zzso 

zzso The senior author has been able to consistently perform zzso repair of torn zzso zzso with good and excellent results, in zzso of zzso zzso The Napoleon test is useful in predicting not only the presence of a zzso zzso but also its general zzso zzso Combined tears of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are frequently associated with zzso zzso migration and loss of overhead zzso zzso repair of these massive tears can produce durable reversal of zzso zzso migration and restoration of overhead zzso
