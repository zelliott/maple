To investigate the feasibility of applying magnetic resonance zzso imaging with use of an zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso zzso for measuring zzso concentration in human cartilage in clinical zzso 

zzso of zzso into cartilage was monitored through sequential zzso images obtained after zzso zzso zzso 2) or intravenous zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso and zzso image series were then obtained in seven volunteers zzso knees) after penetration of zzso into zzso If zzso was zzso on zzso images, images were also obtained after penetration of the cartilage with the zzso contrast agent, zzso 

zzso penetrated cartilage from the zzso surface after zzso injection and from both the zzso surface and the zzso bone after intravenous zzso The latter resulted in shorter overall penetration zzso zzso values on zzso images were homogeneous in four knees, but in five knees zzso differences of up to zzso were zzso These zzso differences were not seen in the presence of zzso These variations in zzso reflected about 50% variations in zzso 

The data suggest that zzso MR imaging has potential for monitoring zzso content of cartilage in zzso
