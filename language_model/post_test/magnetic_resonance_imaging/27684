To study the dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of zzso rabbits zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso 

Twenty healthy adult zzso white rabbits were divided into zzso zzso zzso group and inflammatory zzso zzso group zzso There were ten rabbits in each zzso All 20 rabbits underwent zzso Peak enhancement, time to peak, maximum slope and signal intensity versus time zzso were generated from each zzso zzso 

zzso were obtained for nine cases of zzso zzso zzso and nine cases of inflammatory zzso zzso The signal intensity versus time zzso of zzso zzso zzso were appeared as rapid ascending and zzso and peak enhancement, time to peak, maximum slope of zzso zzso zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s and zzso zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity versus time zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso were appeared as insisting zzso and peak enhancement, time to peak, maximum slope of inflammatory zzso zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40) s and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was significantly higher peak enhancement, shorter time to peak and higher maximum slope in the zzso zzso zzso group compared with the inflammatory zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can accurately reflect the zzso characteristics of zzso rabbits zzso zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso and can differentiate zzso rabbits zzso zzso zzso zzso from inflammatory zzso zzso
