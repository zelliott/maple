zzso the relationship between zzso signal changes and activated zzso is paramount to successful mapping of zzso zzso To this end, the relative zzso and zzso contribution to zzso signal change from zzso zzso zzso (less zzso and zzso zzso draining zzso must be zzso In this work, the authors assessed both the zzso and zzso contribution to blood zzso zzso zzso echo signal change at zzso T by using a zzso Carlo model for zzso contrast in conjunction with a zzso model for zzso zzso changes in zzso and vascular volume zzso The authors compared our Model results with experimental zzso signal changes with and without zzso zzso via bipolar zzso to zzso the zzso zzso The model and experimental results are in agreement and suggest that the zzso spins account for the majority of zzso signal change on zzso images at zzso zzso
