We have recently described an extension of zzso zzso which we term zzso (for zzso zzso zzso providing absolute zzso of resting zzso metabolism zzso and oxygen extraction fraction zzso By combining zzso zzso spin labeling zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and combined zzso zzso and the same zzso zzso during a task, a comprehensive set of vascular and zzso zzso can be obtained using a generalized zzso model zzso These include the baseline absolute zzso in units of zzso cerebrovascular zzso zzso in units of zzso zzso zzso M in units of percent, zzso and zzso at rest in units of zzso percent evoked zzso during the task and zzso the value for zzso zzso associated with the zzso The M zzso is a zzso constant corresponding to the zzso zzso signal that would occur upon removal of all zzso We have previously shown that the zzso provides estimates of the above resting parameters in zzso matter that are in excellent agreement with zzso Here we demonstrate the method using zzso zzso in the context of an zzso zzso We applied the method under high and low zzso conditions, corresponding respectively to a robust visual stimulus and a modified zzso zzso The estimates fall within the zzso range of literature values, showing the general zzso of the zzso approach to yield zzso an extensive array of relevant vascular and zzso zzso
