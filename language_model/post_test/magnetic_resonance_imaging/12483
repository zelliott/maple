The type and extent of zzso zzso encountered clinically is primarily determined by the severity of the initial zzso zzso The purpose of the study was to differentiate zzso fluctuations in zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso following different zzso insult zzso Animals (N zzso 8) were subjected to coronary balloon zzso for either 90 or 45 zzso followed by zzso Imaging was performed on a 3 T zzso scanner between zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso function by zzso zzso zzso and zzso obstruction by zzso zzso The zzso model produced large zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso while the 45 zzso produced small zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso of zzso reduced cardiac function, persistence of zzso and prolonged zzso dysfunction were all indicative of adverse zzso in contrast, the zzso group showed no signs of adverse zzso The zzso and zzso zzso models seem to be ideal for representing the low- and high-risk patient groups, respectively, commonly encountered in the zzso Such in zzso characterization will be a key in predicting functional recovery and may potentially allow evaluation of novel therapies targeted to alleviate zzso injury and prevent zzso zzso
