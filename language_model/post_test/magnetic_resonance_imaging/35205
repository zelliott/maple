To study the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso depth, zzso and percent of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso radius using both magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans and plain zzso The correlation between plain zzso and zzso scans for these zzso will also be zzso 

Twenty zzso scans and 17 sets of zzso of zzso volunteers were zzso zzso surface landmarks were digitized and measured in both the zzso and zzso zzso The parameters of interest were calculated from the digitized data using specialized zzso 

Using zzso data, we determined the radius of zzso of the zzso to be only 37% zzso 10 of the zzso zzso of the zzso radius on the zzso zzso view and to be 57% zzso 10 on the zzso zzso zzso In both planes, the zzso zzso had a significantly larger diameter and radius of zzso than did the zzso The ratio of the radius of zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso on the zzso projection ranged from zzso to zzso and on the zzso projection the values ranged from zzso to zzso Plain zzso were not sufficiently accurate to determine the radius of zzso ratio of the zzso to the zzso or to the zzso zzso of the zzso radius on the zzso view based on a comparison with zzso zzso Plain zzso did not correlate with zzso for most clinically relevant zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso does not closely zzso with that of the zzso zzso when compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on observed variations in zzso zzso and the potential for associated zzso in joint contact forces after zzso row zzso zzso zzso may facilitate the selection of patients with more favorable zzso zzso
