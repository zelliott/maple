Analysis of zzso zzso data is usually performed within the general linear model zzso and conclusions are based on the probability zzso of a zzso zzso In its simplest form, this process assumes that zzso noise in the zzso is random zzso if it is not, then an error in the zzso of p will zzso Various methods for correcting the problem have been developed, but they are not always zzso Analysis packages vary in their ability to deal with this problem, and there is a lack of consistent advice to zzso concerning whether this issue is serious or is small enough to be zzso The zzso of expert opinion partly reflects the fact that the magnitude of the error that occurs when zzso p in zzso data is largely zzso In this discussion, aimed more at zzso zzso than methods experts, we try to clarify the position by documenting the scale of the error in a simple zzso zzso Based on a zzso group analysis of zzso zzso (8 participants scanned while at zzso we show that the magnitude of the problem can be very zzso Without zzso it was necessary to set a nominal probability threshold of about zzso in order to achieve an actual probability of a false positive of zzso This means that if zzso zzso were present in such a zzso only if they reached the former, very low nominal p value could they be relied zzso With the use of standard correction methods, the error was largely zzso Our results suggest that some form of zzso or correction for effects of zzso noise is essential in zzso zzso analyses and zzso group analyses of zzso zzso It is less important but probably prudent to apply a correction at the first level of zzso group zzso We also evaluate the effect of zzso zzso We find that the number of false zzso in a zzso analysis increases markedly as the filter zzso frequency is zzso The sensitivity benefits derived from zzso filtering may thus be partially offset by a significant increase in the number of false zzso
