To investigate the fine vascular structures in the spinal and zzso region, the authors performed three-dimensional zzso scanning after the administration of contrast zzso The scan sequence was zzso volume zzso zzso zzso with a flip angle of 45 zzso zzso zzso moment zzso was zzso Four normal volunteers and 31 patients were zzso Using this technique, zzso anterior zzso veins and zzso arteries were clearly zzso zzso fine vessels of slow to moderate flow, including zzso anterior spinal artery, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated in pathological zzso In addition, with processing of the volume data set, zzso projection images of the zzso anterior zzso zzso system could be zzso This method provided more detailed information on zzso and zzso vessels than conventional MR zzso
