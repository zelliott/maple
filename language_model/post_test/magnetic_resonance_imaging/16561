zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to assess neural zzso in the human auditory zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a function of bandwidth zzso We recorded brain zzso of 22 normal hearing listeners induced by band pass filtered pink noise stimuli with equal sound pressure level of 70 zzso zzso Tested zzso were 50, 500, zzso 3,000, zzso and 8,000 zzso The center frequency was 4,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso had been performed in a silent booth with all of these zzso zzso as a function of bandwidth followed a zzso curve which reflected the influence of spectral zzso zzso zzso for higher zzso and the influence of large zzso fluctuations for very low zzso which itself could be explained by zzso While neural zzso of the zzso as measured by the percent signal change from baseline zzso was tuned to the physical zzso of the stimuli in a straight linear fashion, the trend of perceived zzso as a function of zzso was reflected in several aspects by corresponding neural zzso in the primary auditory zzso zzso Finally, from the absolute differences of the zzso between zzso and zzso gains in perceived zzso associated with zzso and the effect of large zzso fluctuations could be predicted with an accuracy of 1-2 zzso for the whole group of zzso
