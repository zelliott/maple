We describe a rare case of zzso zzso zzso leading to communication between the left zzso and coronary zzso which eventually led to a zzso zzso The observation was made in an elderly woman with zzso zzso zzso zzso Diagnosis was initially made by zzso zzso zzso by the finding of high-velocity flow within a zzso coronary zzso and was confirmed in greater detail at cardiac magnetic zzso This description adds to the list of known zzso mechanical zzso The finding of high-velocity flow within the coronary zzso after zzso zzso suggests the possibility of zzso zzso leading to left zzso to coronary zzso zzso an unusual but potentially zzso zzso
