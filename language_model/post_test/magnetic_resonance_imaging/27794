Rapid deformation of brain tissue in response to head impact or acceleration can lead to numerous pathological changes, both immediate and zzso Modeling and simulation hold promise for illuminating the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury zzso and for developing preventive devices and zzso However, mathematical models have zzso value only if they satisfy two zzso First, they must capture the zzso of the brain as both a material and a structure, including the mechanics of brain tissue and its interactions with the zzso Second, they must be validated by direct comparison with experimental zzso Emerging imaging technologies and recent imaging studies provide important data for these zzso This review describes these techniques and data, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging zzso In zzso these imaging tools promise to extend our understanding of brain zzso and improve our ability to study zzso in zzso
