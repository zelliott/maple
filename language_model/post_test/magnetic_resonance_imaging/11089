Although it is well known that executive processes supported by the frontal lobe develop during childhood and adolescence, only one functional imaging study has used the zzso task to investigate the relationship between frontal lobe function and zzso from a zzso point of zzso zzso we measured brain zzso in the lateral prefrontal zzso of children with functional zzso imaging during an zzso zzso matching zzso task and compared results with a previous study, conducted with the same paradigm in zzso In children, the zzso task zzso significant brain zzso in the left lateral prefrontal zzso comparable to zzso However, the zzso response occurred later in children than zzso Individual brain zzso due to zzso interference varied much more in children than adults, which was paralleled by a higher behavioral zzso in zzso Data suggest that children differed in their individual cognitive development independent of their zzso age more than zzso Brain zzso due to zzso interference increased with age in the zzso prefrontal zzso in correlation with an improvement of behavioral zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso processes regarding resolution of zzso interference may depend on increased ability to recruit frontal neural zzso
