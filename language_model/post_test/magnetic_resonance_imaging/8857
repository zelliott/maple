zzso intervention for chronic zzso or zzso zzso in zzso individuals is recommended on the basis of zzso severity and the zzso consequences on the left zzso zzso zzso is the standard tool in clinical practice for evaluation of adults with chronic zzso zzso volume zzso and fraction zzso can be determined as the difference between stroke volumes measured at two zzso sites: zzso flow across the zzso valve compared to zzso flow across a normal zzso zzso these severity measures can be determined by imaging the zzso flow zzso zzso orifice area also can be zzso However, limitations do exist with zzso due to poor image quality, zzso in measuring flow diameters and zzso views of the zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging is a promising zzso which can also measure zzso severity and may provide additional information about zzso size and zzso zzso methods allow measurement of flow zzso and instantaneous volume flow rates in the zzso or pulmonary zzso this data can be integrated over the cardiac cycle to determine RV and zzso zzso also allows accurate measurement of left and right zzso zzso the difference in stroke volume between the two zzso is zzso zzso The role of zzso in clinical management of adults with valve zzso merits further zzso Currently, we find zzso helpful when zzso severity is zzso on zzso zzso if zzso dysfunction is zzso when more accurate measures of zzso function are needed and when zzso zzso is zzso
