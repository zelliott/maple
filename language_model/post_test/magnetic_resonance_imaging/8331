Progressive brain abnormalities in schizophrenia remain zzso Evidence of interrelated progressive functional impairment would buttress the case for structural zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced in chronic but not zzso schizophrenia and may index progressive structural zzso 

To determine whether zzso shows associations with underlying auditory zzso gray matter at first hospitalization and progressive reduction zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

A private psychiatric zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging at first hospitalization in 20 subjects with zzso 21 subjects with bipolar disorder with zzso and 32 control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 16 subjects with zzso 17 subjects with bipolar disorder, and 20 control zzso zzso zzso testing and magnetic resonance zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging in 11 subjects with zzso 13 subjects with bipolar disorder, and 13 control zzso At each time point, reported samples were group matched for age, zzso and parental socioeconomic zzso

Initially, groups did not differ in zzso zzso zzso with schizophrenia showed associations between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso not present in the other zzso At zzso zzso testing, schizophrenia showed zzso reduction zzso Only schizophrenia zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso highly correlated with zzso reduction zzso zzso 

At first hospitalization for zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso gray matter volume, consistent with variable progression of zzso cortical zzso zzso the interrelated progressive reduction of functional and structural measures suggests progressive zzso processes early in zzso An active process of progressive cortical reduction presents a potential therapeutic zzso zzso zzso may be a simple, sensitive, and inexpensive index not only of this progressive zzso process but also of successful zzso
