The zzso acquisition zzso sequence is a zzso zzso imaging technique that does not involve rapid zzso zzso A zzso zzso pulse train is followed by a 90 degrees hard pulse and, after a mixing time, by a 90 degrees zzso zzso A read zzso zzso a set of zzso zzso which can be zzso to form an zzso By repeating the selective pulse N times, each time with the carrier frequency offset differently, it is possible to sample N slices in a zzso A comparison is made of the sequence with other three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso implementing the technique on a 3 T zzso imaging system and a 2 zzso zzso bore animal zzso are zzso Both phantom and brain images are zzso The principal advantages of the new sequence are its speed, the absence of rapid zzso switching and corresponding freedom from artifacts, its zzso to zzso magnetic field zzso and its low acoustic zzso The main disadvantages are the low zzso ratio of the images produced and the zzso limitation in zzso
