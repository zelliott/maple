Our purpose in this study was to assess the zzso zzso content in various zzso in rats with or without zzso stimulation in zzso and in zzso by using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and polarized zzso atomic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed in 12 rats using a zzso zzso zzso The rats were injected zzso with saline (6 zzso zzso group, zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso Ten minutes after saline or zzso administration, zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso followed by 6 zzso studies at zzso zzso After the last zzso study, rats were killed, and the zzso zzso in various zzso were measured using zzso There was a zzso between in zzso and in zzso zzso which appeared to be due to the partial volume effect and/or the contribution of zzso zzso The zzso concentration in the zzso zzso to that in the liver in the zzso group, increased significantly compared to that in the zzso group, suggesting that the influx of zzso into zzso cells in the zzso increased in response to zzso zzso This study suggested that the measurement of the change in the zzso concentration due to zzso stimulation using zzso was effective for evaluating zzso function in the zzso
