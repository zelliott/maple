zzso of long term clinical outcome in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso using imaging has important clinical zzso but remains zzso We aimed to determine whether spatial location of zzso and zzso brain zzso predicts clinical progression during a 10-year follow-up in zzso 

zzso probability maps of the zzso and zzso brain zzso were generated using the baseline scans of 80 patients with zzso who were clinically assessed at baseline and then after 1, 2, 5 and 10 zzso For each patient, the time (in zzso taken before bilateral support was required to walk zzso to event zzso was used as a measure of progression zzso The probability of each zzso being zzso was correlated with zzso adjusting for age, zzso disease zzso zzso and spinal zzso cross zzso area, using a multiple linear zzso zzso To identify the best, independent predictor of zzso a Cox zzso model was zzso 

A significant correlation between a shorter zzso and a higher probability of a zzso being zzso on zzso scans was found in the bilateral zzso tract and superior zzso zzso and in the right inferior zzso zzso zzso The best predictor of progression rate was the zzso zzso load measured along the right inferior zzso zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Our results suggest that the location of zzso brain zzso in the motor and zzso tracts is an important contributor to the progression of disability in zzso and is independent of spinal zzso zzso
