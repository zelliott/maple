The study reviews some of the advances made as regards the zzso assessment and the zzso management of zzso in children with zzso results from the surgical series regarding the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso factors are commented on; some zzso zzso that are distinctive in children with zzso and their surgical management are zzso and current challenges and the future of the surgical treatment of zzso in zzso are also briefly zzso 

The advances being made in the methods of zzso diagnosis and surgical procedures are making it possible to offer successful treatment at earlier ages in patients with zzso who were previously considered zzso and in patients with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The identification of zzso zzso of zzso makes it possible to establish surgical approaches and zzso zzso expectations that are well suited to each situation, which are better in the zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso which are mostly zzso zzso
