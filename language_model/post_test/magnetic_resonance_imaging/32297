What may be special about faces, compared to zzso objects, is that their neural representation may be fundamentally zzso zzso zzso zzso matched a sequence of two filtered images, each containing every other combination of spatial frequency and orientation, of faces or zzso zzso zzso judging whether the person or blob was the same or zzso On a match trial, the images were either identical or complementary zzso the remaining spatial frequency and orientation zzso Relative to an identical pair of images, a complementary pair of faces, but not zzso reduced matching accuracy and released zzso adaptation in the zzso face zzso
