To investigate the utility of MR and X-ray imaging for characterizing zzso zzso and flow, and guiding the zzso zzso to place a zzso to repair the zzso 

The descending zzso in eight dogs was zzso with elastic band and tightened zzso to the zzso zzso Balanced fast field echo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were used for device tracking and measuring zzso zzso A zzso zzso echo sequence zzso was used to zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso were guided by a zzso zzso and placed under MR zzso 

zzso zzso was visible on MR and X-ray zzso The procedure success rate was zzso zzso zzso measured the changes in zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso placement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant reduction in zzso blood pressure was measured after zzso but it was reversed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was visible on X-ray zzso but not on zzso 

zzso deployment to repair zzso zzso is feasible under MR zzso The combined use of MR and X-ray imaging is effective for zzso and functional evaluation of zzso zzso zzso which may be crucial for optimal zzso
