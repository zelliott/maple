The aim of this study was to compare a new zzso method for detecting the existence of zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso with CT zzso In a prospective study, 30 patients with post-traumatic zzso zzso were zzso The MR examinations were performed with a zzso zzso MR system, using two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso constructive interference zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso and CT zzso were compared with the surgical zzso The sensitivity in detecting zzso zzso with MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than with CT zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of CT zzso at detecting zzso zzso in patients with a size of zzso zzso less than 2 zzso or in patients with multiple zzso zzso is significantly lower compared with the MR zzso Although the zzso of zzso zzso always proved possible with MR zzso this could only be accomplished zzso CT in 70 % of zzso The MR zzso technique is a new examination method with a higher sensitivity for the detection of zzso zzso than CT zzso The zzso technique is superior compared with zzso and should be used in patients with zzso zzso zzso
