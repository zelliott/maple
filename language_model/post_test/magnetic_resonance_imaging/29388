The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between rotator cuff zzso tear and the orientation of the zzso zzso shoulders zzso zzso that underwent open zzso repair were grouped according to the type of zzso We measured on zzso the zzso angle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso angle on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had a smaller AG angle zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees ) and a larger zzso angle zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees ) compared to controls zzso We also found a highly significant difference zzso in zzso version measured by zzso between anterior cuff tears zzso degrees ) and zzso cuff tears zzso degrees zzso Furthermore, we identified an association between zzso tear and the orientation of the zzso relative to the axis of the zzso zzso Greater zzso is zzso of an anterior cuff injury and greater zzso is zzso of a zzso cuff zzso
