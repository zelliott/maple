To describe novel neurological manifestations associated with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective study zzso describes 62 patients zzso found to have a serum zzso that bound selectively to zzso central nervous system zzso The zzso pattern was determined to be zzso by zzso zzso These cases were identified among samples submitted for zzso zzso evaluation using indirect zzso In no case had zzso or any other zzso cell zzso testing been zzso 

In most cases, the patients' presentations were initially considered neurodegenerative or inflammatory (multiple sclerosis or zzso Median age at onset was 50 years, and zzso were zzso Of the 44 patients seen at the Mayo zzso zzso were African zzso in contrast, less than zzso of Mayo zzso neurology patients are African zzso Median follow-up was 24 zzso The zzso zzso values for zzso zzso were extremely high zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso and correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso Neurological manifestations were zzso in 41 patients and included zzso zzso zzso zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso zzso phenomena zzso zzso signs zzso and zzso zzso One third of the patients had type 1 diabetes zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso had zzso Eleven of 20 patients identified as African American had zzso zzso Some patients appeared to benefit from short-term zzso zzso received long-term zzso 

The neurological spectrum of zzso zzso includes zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso In our experience, African American patients were disproportionately zzso A patient with a presumed neurodegenerative disorder of new zzso with high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso merits consideration of zzso
