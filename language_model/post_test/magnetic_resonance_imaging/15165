Alzheimer's disease and zzso zzso zzso can be difficult to differentiate clinically because of overlapping zzso zzso the two zzso based on zzso zzso of brain zzso with zzso has been only partially zzso Whether zzso zzso of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease and zzso is zzso In this study, we measured cortical thickness using a set of automated tools zzso to reconstruct the zzso cortical surface from zzso structural zzso data in 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 19 patients with zzso and 23 cognitively normal zzso The goals were to detect the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in these two types of zzso to test the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive zzso to determine if measurement of cortical thickness is better than that of cortical volume for zzso between these zzso and normal zzso and improving the zzso of Alzheimer's disease and zzso based on zzso scores zzso Compared to cognitively normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner zzso primarily in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso patients had a thinner zzso in zzso frontal and zzso regions and some thinning in inferior zzso regions and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso patients, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner zzso zzso zzso zzso in parts of bilateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso impairment was zzso correlated with cortical thickness of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease, while similar correlations were not significant in zzso zzso of cortical thickness was similar to that of cortical volume in zzso between normal zzso Alzheimer's disease and zzso Furthermore, cortical thickness zzso significantly improved the zzso between Alzheimer's disease and zzso based on zzso scores alone, including the zzso State zzso and a modified version of the zzso zzso In conclusion, the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease and zzso suggest that cortical thickness may be a useful surrogate marker for these types of zzso
