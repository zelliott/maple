A substantial number of clinical zzso examinations zzso assess language zzso or zzso usually due to patient movement and zzso zzso We hypothesized that a zzso interview of the patient by the zzso would reduce the fraction of zzso zzso 

A single noise score for each acquisition was produced from zzso data on the basis of a weighted sum of 22 zzso Scores were recorded as the following zzso zzso zzso excellent, zzso zzso adequate, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This measure was evaluated for 202 consecutive zzso zzso 96 without and 106 with a physician zzso zzso The data were analyzed to zzso the fraction of all zzso sequences and entire studies and were compared between the 2 zzso zzso characteristics included the zzso of linear and angular zzso of the head and the number of zzso zzso caused by focal zzso 

Of 999 sequences acquired, zzso had a zzso zzso The mean noise score significantly decreased for both individual sequence (from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso The fraction of sequences or studies scored as unacceptable decreased for zzso (from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso of head motion decreased for linear (by zzso P zzso zzso and angular displacement (by zzso P zzso zzso The number of zzso spikes decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We report that a zzso zzso interview modestly but significantly reduces zzso noise zzso These results support the newly added zzso costs of professional intervention before zzso zzso
