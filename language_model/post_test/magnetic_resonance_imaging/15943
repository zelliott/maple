To date, several zzso brain regions have been identified that play a role in the visual perception of other people and their zzso The aim of the present study is to understand how these areas may be involved in relating body movements to their visual zzso We used zzso to examine the zzso body area zzso the zzso body area zzso and an area in the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso that responds to patterns of human biological zzso Each area was localized in individual participants with independent zzso In the main experiment, participants performed and/or viewed simple, zzso hand actions while in the zzso An zzso camera with a zzso view of the zzso hand was used to manipulate the relationship between motor output and the visual zzso zzso only view of their hands was via this zzso In the zzso condition, participants viewed their own live hand movements projected onto the zzso In the zzso condition, participants viewed actions that were different from the actions they were zzso In zzso the zzso response in the zzso condition was significantly higher than in the zzso zzso Further, the response in the zzso condition was below zzso and no greater than that found in a control condition in which hand actions were performed without any visual zzso This indicates a strong suppression in zzso of the response to the visual stimulus that arises from one's own zzso In contrast, in zzso and zzso we found a large but equivalent response to the zzso and zzso conditions, and this response was the same as that zzso in a control condition in which hand actions were viewed zzso with no concurrent motor zzso These findings indicate that, in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso are zzso from motor zzso Instead we propose that their role is limited to zzso analysis of zzso visual zzso
