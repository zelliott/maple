zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso disorder with zzso gastrointestinal involvement, presenting with variable degrees of gut zzso up to frank chronic zzso zzso Despite major advances in understanding its basic molecular zzso in recent years, the distinct mechanisms and zzso zzso underlying zzso gastrointestinal zzso are still widely zzso As yet, though their critical role in proper gastrointestinal transit in terms of spontaneous zzso activity and enteric zzso is well established, the population of the zzso cells of zzso zzso has not been investigated in zzso zzso we examined small zzso samples of a zzso zzso patient by using conventional zzso and zzso zzso The zzso network was studied by zzso for the zzso zzso Kit zzso known to reliably detect zzso while zzso mast cells served as an internal and normal small zzso zzso as external zzso At a light microscopic level, no gross structural zzso of the zzso wall composition and its zzso elements was zzso However, a complete absence of Kit zzso cells could be demonstrated in regions where zzso are normally abundant, while internal and external controls retained strong Kit zzso In conclusion, our preliminary results provide a first evidence for an zzso of the zzso network in zzso and support the notion that zzso loss might be an early zzso event in zzso gut motor dysfunction before significant zzso and/or zzso structural changes zzso
