The objective of the study was to characterize the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso irregular zzso cycles, regular zzso cycles and zzso 

zzso zzso biological activity of zzso (after zzso zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso testosterone zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso were measured in all zzso patients and control group zzso zzso zzso between active zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso is characterized by high serum zzso levels and its high biological zzso zzso patients with irregular cycles were characterized by high biological activity of zzso Patients with zzso and regular cycles had low biological activity of zzso 

Diagnosis of zzso should be associated with zzso of zzso biological activity because it is important for type of zzso zzso Low biological activity of zzso does not impair zzso and zzso zzso and does not cause zzso
