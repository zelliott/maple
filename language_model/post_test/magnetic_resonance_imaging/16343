The different brain anatomy of men and women is both a classic and continuing topic of major zzso Among the most zzso and robust sex differences are larger overall brain dimensions in men, and relative increases of global and regional gray matter zzso in zzso However, the question remains whether zzso differences in brain size zzso larger male and smaller female zzso or biological sex itself account for the observed sex effects on tissue amount and zzso zzso cerebral structures in men and women with similar brain size may clarify the true contribution of biological zzso We thus examined a sample of 24 male and 24 female subjects with brains identical in size, in addition to 24 male and 24 female subjects with considerable brain size zzso Using this large set of brains zzso zzso zzso we applied a well validated and automated zzso approach to examine regional volumes of zzso While we revealed significant main effects of sex, there were no significant effects of brain size (and no significant interactions between sex and brain zzso When conducting post hoc tests, we revealed a number of regions where women had larger zzso volumes than zzso zzso these sex effects remained evident when comparing men and women with the same brain zzso Altogether, our findings suggest that the observed increased regional zzso volumes in female brains constitute zzso zzso of tissue volume, rather than individual adjustments attributable to brain zzso
