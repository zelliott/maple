Alcohol use disorders zzso as zzso alcohol dependence or zzso are prevalent and serious problems among zzso As adolescence is marked by progressive zzso development, this brain region may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of adolescent alcohol use zzso This study compared the zzso volumes of adolescents and young adults with zzso alcohol use disorders to those of healthy matched comparison zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was used to measure the zzso volumes and volumes of comparison brain regions in 12 subjects with alcohol use disorders and 24 comparison subjects matched on age, sex, and zzso 

Both left and right zzso volumes were significantly smaller in subjects with alcohol use disorders than in comparison zzso Total zzso volume correlated positively with the age at onset and zzso with the duration of the alcohol use zzso zzso zzso and cortical gray and white matter volumes and measures of the zzso area of the corpus zzso did not differ between zzso 

In the mature brain, chronic alcohol use disorders are associated with graded global brain zzso Although the zzso zzso consequences, and zzso of these zzso findings need to be further zzso these findings suggest that, during adolescence, the zzso may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of zzso
