zzso zzso has revolutionized the field of human brain zzso zzso can zzso map the spatial architecture of brain function via localized increases in blood flow after sensory or cognitive zzso Recent advances in zzso have led to enhanced sensitivity and spatial accuracy of the measured signals, indicating the possibility of detecting small zzso ensembles that constitute fundamental zzso units in the brain, such as cortical zzso Orientation columns in visual zzso are perhaps the best known example of such a functional organization in the zzso They cannot be discerned via anatomical zzso as with zzso dominance zzso Instead, the zzso of their organization requires functional imaging zzso However, because of insufficient sensitivity, spatial zzso and image resolution of the available mapping techniques, thus far, they have not been detected in zzso Here, we zzso by using zzso zzso zzso the existence and spatial features of zzso selective columns in zzso zzso similarities were found with the known spatial features of these columns in zzso In addition, we found that a larger number of orientation columns are devoted to processing zzso around 90 degrees zzso stimuli with horizontal zzso whereas relatively similar zzso signal changes were observed across any given active zzso With the current proliferation of zzso zzso systems and constant evolution of zzso techniques, this study zzso the exciting prospect of exploring zzso and/or unknown zzso level functional organizations in the human zzso
