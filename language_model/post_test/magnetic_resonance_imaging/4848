To determine whether zzso zzso zzso offer any advantage over zzso zzso zzso in terms of zzso rates and to identify indications for zzso artery zzso zzso based on the current zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed for patients who underwent zzso zzso for symptomatic zzso Patients were divided into two groups based on zzso use zzso and zzso 

A total of 28 zzso were implanted in 24 zzso Of these, 13 were DE and 15 zzso Technical success was achieved in all zzso There were zzso complications of zzso zzso in some patients zzso The median clinical and imaging follow-up times were 26 and 21 months, respectively, for the zzso arm and 13 and 12 months, respectively, for the DE zzso The mean zzso percentage was zzso for the zzso group and zzso for the DE zzso The mean zzso diameter was zzso for the zzso group and zzso for the DE group zzso There was no statistical difference in the zzso rates among the two groups, zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for DE zzso 

zzso zzso is a relatively safe zzso No differences could be zzso in the zzso rates between zzso and DE zzso While zzso has been reported for symptomatic and zzso disease, a benefit of zzso has only been demonstrated for patients with symptoms clearly attributable to the diseased zzso The benefit of zzso in zzso disease or zzso to improve zzso to the anterior circulation is zzso
