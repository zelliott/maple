To evaluate tools for the fusion of images generated by zzso and structural and functional magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso resonance and functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed while a volunteer who had previously undergone zzso zzso performed motor and zzso tasks in a zzso zzso Image data were analyzed with different programs, and the results were zzso 

We constructed a flow chart of zzso processes that allowed measurement of the spatial zzso between the zzso There was no single zzso tool that contained the entire set of functions necessary to achieve the zzso 

The fusion of the images from the three methods proved to be feasible with the use of four zzso software programs zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results may serve as a basis for building software that will be useful as a virtual tool prior to zzso
