Literature indicates that loss of disc tissue from zzso and/or surgery can accelerate zzso of the zzso The associated loss of disc height may zzso with zzso back and/or leg zzso A novel zzso has been developed to replace lost nucleus zzso and potentially restore normal disc zzso following zzso and zzso A zzso zzso prospective feasibility study was undertaken to investigate the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shelton, CT, zzso as a replacement for nuclear tissue lost to zzso and zzso Fourteen patients were enrolled at the zzso hospital as the initial site in a worldwide zzso pilot zzso zzso who were entered into the study suffered from zzso pain due to single-level zzso nucleus zzso and were zzso to conservative zzso Following a standard zzso zzso the zzso material was injected into the nuclear void to replace what tissue had been lost to the zzso and zzso zzso and back pain, function and disability scores were monitored zzso and zzso through 2 zzso zzso and physical evaluations, blood and serum zzso and zzso evaluations of disc height and implant stability were also zzso zzso showed significant improvement for leg and back pain, as well as function zzso No complications or device related adverse events were zzso MR controls confirmed stable position of the implants with no zzso zzso zzso indicated better maintenance of disc height compared to literature data on zzso zzso The zzso material appears to protect the disc from early collapse following zzso and therefore, may have the potential to slow the degenerative cascade of the spinal segment over zzso
