People suffering from zzso zzso encounter difficulties in automatically zzso zzso zzso zzso For example, when instructed to attend to the physical size of a number while ignoring its zzso value, zzso subjects, unlike healthy participants, fail to process the irrelevant dimension automatically and subsequently show a smaller zzso effect zzso in reaction time between zzso zzso a physically large 2 and a physically small zzso and zzso zzso a physically small 2 and a physically large zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso a physically small 2 and a physically large zzso versus zzso zzso Previous imaging studies determined the zzso zzso zzso as a central area for zzso processing zzso A few studies tried to identify the brain dysfunction underlying zzso zzso but yielded mixed results regarding the involvement of the left zzso or the right zzso zzso Here we applied zzso zzso zzso to disrupt zzso or zzso zzso clusters in order to induce zzso behavioral deficits in healthy zzso Automatic magnitude processing was impaired only during disruption of zzso zzso When using the identical paradigm with zzso participants, we reproduced a result pattern similar to that obtained with zzso volunteers during zzso zzso These findings provide direct evidence for the functional role of right zzso in automatic magnitude zzso
