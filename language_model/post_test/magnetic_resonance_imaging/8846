zzso spin labeling zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a powerful zzso technique to investigate the zzso status of brain tissue by measuring cerebral blood flow zzso zzso zzso the inflow of zzso labeled zzso blood into an imaging zzso In the last 2 decades, various zzso sequences have been proposed which differ in their ease of zzso and their sensitivity to zzso In addition, several zzso methods have been developed to determine the absolute value of zzso from zzso zzso difference zzso In this study, we evaluated three zzso zzso sequences and three absolute zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso of zzso yields zzso higher zzso ratio zzso and zzso higher zzso as compared with zzso (with zzso zzso and zzso (with zzso zzso In addition, zzso schemes employed can give rise to up to a zzso difference in zzso zzso We conclude that, although all quantitative zzso sequences and zzso zzso methods should in principle result in the similar zzso values and image quality, substantial differences in zzso values and zzso were zzso Thus, comparing studies using different zzso sequences and analysis zzso is likely to result in erroneous zzso and intergroup zzso zzso zzso the same zzso schemes should consistently be used, and zzso zzso using local tissue zzso density should yield the most accurate zzso values because, although still requiring definitive demonstration in future studies, the zzso density of blood is assumed to be very similar to the value of gray zzso
