The aim of this study was to correlate the zzso in cerebral blood volume zzso measured by dynamic zzso zzso zzso with that in cerebral blood flow zzso estimated by zzso zzso CT with zzso in patients with acute zzso zzso 

Nine patients with unilateral zzso of either the middle cerebral artery or the internal carotid artery (4 men and 5 zzso zzso age, zzso zzso were studied within 6 hours after stroke zzso The relative zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso were defined relative to the zzso mirror zzso 

In the brain regions with mild zzso zzso moderate zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso the mean zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was significantly elevated in the brain areas with mild zzso zzso and significantly reduced in the brain areas with severe zzso zzso The zzso was significantly better than the zzso in predicting the evolution of zzso zzso The probability of evolving zzso for the zzso zzso zzso regions was significantly lower than that for zzso zzso zzso regions in the zzso range between zzso and zzso zzso 

In acute zzso stroke within 6 hours of onset the zzso can be either increased, normal, or zzso depending on the severity of zzso The increased zzso has a protective effect on evolving zzso Although the zzso is a better predictor of tissue outcome, the zzso measurement may help detect potentially zzso brain tissue in the zzso with compromised blood zzso
