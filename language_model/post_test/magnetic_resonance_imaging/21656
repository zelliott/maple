zzso of the canal secondary to poor consolidation of fractures of the zzso zzso zzso is one of the causes of zzso on the median nerve of the zzso Other post-traumatic zzso zzso of the median nerve when there are no significant skeletal modifications caused by probable involvement of the soft zzso surrounding and within the canal are also zzso MR was used to study 23 patients affected with the zzso of fracture of the zzso zzso zzso who presented with clinical and zzso signs of zzso tunnel syndrome, and were submitted to zzso zzso MR showed indirect signs of zzso such as zzso changes of the median zzso as well as post-traumatic changes in the zzso zzso MR allows for a complete anatomical view of the canal structures implicated in causing post-traumatic zzso tunnel zzso
