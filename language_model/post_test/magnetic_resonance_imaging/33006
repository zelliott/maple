The prevalence of zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso is higher in children with zzso cell disease zzso as compared with the general pediatric zzso It has been speculated that overgrowth of the zzso and zzso is an important zzso 

The current study used zzso to evaluate such an zzso We studied 36 subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 36 control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with control subjects, children with zzso had a significantly smaller upper airway zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and significantly larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and deep cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso of zzso of children with zzso had zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso of control subjects zzso zzso zzso and that in children with zzso the zzso index correlated positively with upper airway zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, children with zzso had lower zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso increased peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Children with zzso have reduced upper airway size due to overgrowth of the surrounding zzso zzso which may explain their predisposition to zzso
