To determine the best combination of magnetic resonance imaging zzso parameters for the detection of locally zzso prostate cancer after external beam radiation zzso 

Our Institutional Review Board approved this study with a waiver of informed zzso Twenty-six patients with suspected recurrence due to zzso failure were part of this zzso The MR protocol included zzso MR zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy was the standard of zzso We used zzso zzso to model the probability of a positive outcome and generalized zzso equations to account for zzso The diagnostic performance of imaging was described using receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

The area under the zzso curve of MR zzso imaging zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso The combination of all MR techniques did not significantly improve the performance of imaging beyond the accuracy of zzso alone, but a trend toward improved discrimination was noted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso to zzso and/or zzso zzso significantly improves the assessment of patients with suspected recurrence after zzso and a combined approach with all three zzso may have the best diagnostic zzso
