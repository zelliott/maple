zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging or magnetic resonance zzso imaging may require brief periods of zzso for image zzso In adults, this may be done by voluntary breath zzso In infants and children, such studies are generally performed under general zzso using a zzso mask airway with maintenance of spontaneous zzso 

We report a technique using the zzso synthetic zzso zzso as part of an zzso technique to provide brief periods of zzso and the rapid resumption of spontaneous zzso 

The study cohort included 12 patients (8 for high-resolution CT imaging and 4 for abdominal MR zzso who ranged in age from 6 to 16 zzso General zzso with spontaneous ventilation was induced with zzso in air and zzso When zzso was required, zzso (3 zzso was zzso zzso occurred within zzso seconds following the zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso The duration of zzso varied from 3 to 8 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso Following the administration of zzso there was a decrease in heart rate zzso from zzso zzso 7 to a low of 108 zzso 9 beats per minute zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso decreased from 84 zzso 6 zzso zzso to 78 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One patient received a fluid zzso (10 zzso for a zzso of 56 zzso zzso No other adverse effects were zzso 

This technique facilitated zzso care by allowing the use of a zzso mask airway zzso for both the zzso imaging as well as zzso which was performed after the zzso zzso The use of a zzso dose of zzso provided a brief period of zzso for the acquisition of the zzso zzso
