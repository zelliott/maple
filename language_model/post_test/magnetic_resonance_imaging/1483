To compare and evaluate two novel zzso zzso based either on fast zzso zzso or zzso zzso imaging zzso methods, as potential tools for investing spinal zzso zzso 

Following recent improvements, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques could be alternative approaches for rapid zzso imaging zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence with local zzso capabilities were zzso Both methods were compared in a consecutive series of five healthy volunteers and five patients with suspected zzso zzso The sequences were graded zzso as either superior, inferior, or equal in quality, and also zzso by measuring the amount of zzso artifacts in the zzso zzso zzso of the diffusion zzso within the spine were zzso 

The overall image quality of zzso was superior to zzso Two out of five zzso scans were rated with poor image quality, whereas all zzso scans were of sufficient zzso The zzso levels ranged from approximately zzso to zzso for zzso and from approximately zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso measured in healthy volunteers were similar for both zzso and zzso but showed higher fluctuations with the zzso zzso 

Despite potential advantages of zzso the zzso technique is preferable for zzso applications in the spinal zzso
