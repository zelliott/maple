In the zzso type 1 zzso mouse model, zzso used clinically for zzso improves cognitive zzso While such impairment has been studied in zzso the neural zzso remain zzso The aim of this imaging zzso to a Phase 1 zzso trial was to examine the effect of zzso on zzso Network zzso resting state functional connectivity zzso Seven children with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were treated with zzso once daily for 12 zzso A zzso zzso zzso scan was collected one day before beginning treatment zzso and the last day of treatment zzso while performing a zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso we used the residual time series as zzso zzso zzso for zzso analyses using 11 zzso regions of zzso For qualitative zzso we included a group of 19 typically developing children zzso collected zzso In the zzso condition, zzso increased long-range positive zzso within zzso core regions zzso anterior zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso cortex, zzso In addition, zzso produced less diffuse local zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso The pattern of zzso observed in the zzso participants when zzso closely resembled the zzso patterns exhibited by the zzso zzso administration in this open trial regulated zzso long-range and local zzso within the zzso These preliminary results are consistent with a role for zzso in zzso of zzso processes and with apparent benefits in a mouse zzso zzso
