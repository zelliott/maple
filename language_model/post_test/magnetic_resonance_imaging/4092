We studied two zzso patients with zzso brain zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso analyses of surgical zzso zzso fluid, and zzso fluid were performed in one of the zzso In both patients, greatly increased levels of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso were present in the zzso fluid, while there was only a moderate increase of zzso in the zzso brain tissue adjacent to the zzso in one of the zzso In non zzso brain regions, no zzso of the zzso were zzso Since zzso are involved in induction and maintenance of zzso their extremely high zzso in the zzso fluid may explain zzso in some patients with such brain zzso Our findings may have zzso consequences for patients with drug resistant zzso in whom elevated zzso of zzso in the zzso can be zzso Surgery with the aim to create a communication between the zzso and the zzso space may prevent an zzso of the zzso and thus result in a relief of zzso
