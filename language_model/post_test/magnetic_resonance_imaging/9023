The goal of this study was to investigate clinical findings, zzso zzso and results of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with startle zzso and normal brain zzso 

Four patients zzso age zzso zzso with startle zzso were investigated with zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso diagnosis was established in childhood, and all had spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso zzso were triggered by sudden, unexpected sounds and tactile zzso The neurological examinations and zzso were zzso zzso recordings showed focal zzso zzso An zzso zzso was obtained in one zzso zzso modeling yielded zzso sources in right central frontal zzso 

The present study demonstrates that the origin of zzso activity in startle zzso can be localized in brain areas associated with supplementary motor seizures, even in patients with normal brain zzso zzso adds complementary information to the zzso of zzso activity and can be useful in planning invasive studies in cases evaluated for zzso zzso
