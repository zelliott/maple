To construct the functional networks of human brains by zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and examine whether or not the zzso property of functional brain networks changes in patients with zzso disease zzso 

A total of 33 zzso patients and 20 healthy old volunteers were zzso Their cognitive functions were evaluated by the zzso state examination zzso and zzso zzso rating scale zzso The zzso zzso data were acquired and zzso Then the correlation zzso of every pair of 90 regions was calculated and correlation zzso Z zzso N zzso zzso generated by Fisher Z zzso The zzso property of functional brain networks was tested for zzso patients and normal elders according to the definition of zzso The changes of relevant parameters in zzso patients were examined by two sample zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso scores of zzso group and normal controls zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso scores of zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso scores were statistically different between two zzso zzso of zzso zzso Within the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both groups satisfied the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso and the average shortest path zzso of zzso group were significantly higher than those of zzso group at each threshold zzso zzso zzso 

The functional brain networks in zzso patients still have the property of zzso But the levels of zzso and zzso are higher in zzso patients than those in normal zzso It suggests that the capacity of information transmission in functional brain networks and the ability of information integration in different brain regions in zzso patients are zzso This finding is of great importance in zzso the pathological mechanisms of zzso from the viewpoint of zzso
