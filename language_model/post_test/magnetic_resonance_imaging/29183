To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting primary zzso zzso zzso zzso and regional zzso to the zzso zzso and to correlate magnetic resonance signal intensity to zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images in 14 patients with zzso (9 with primary disease, 5 with zzso disease) were reviewed for signal zzso tumor zzso zzso and tumor invasion with zzso zzso images zzso zzso images zzso and zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis was used to examine the correlation between zzso signal intensity and zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated based on signal and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging detected tumors in 9 zzso of the 10 patients who had zzso in the zzso zzso zzso spread of the tumors was correctly predicted using this zzso Most tumors were zzso or markedly zzso on zzso zzso signal intensity of the tumor was associated with increased zzso deposition and high tumor zzso and low level of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in 38 zzso of zzso surgically dissected zzso The combined use of 4 criteria zzso size, a zzso diameter ratio of zzso or greater, marked zzso on zzso and necrosis in the zzso yielded a high detection accuracy zzso for zzso zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is useful for detecting primary and zzso zzso and its signal intensity reflects the underlying zzso zzso
