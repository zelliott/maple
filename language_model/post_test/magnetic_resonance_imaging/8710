As literate adults, we appreciate zzso values as abstract entities that can be represented by a zzso a word, a number of lines on a zzso or a sequence of zzso from a zzso This abstract, zzso appreciation of numbers develops gradually over the first several years of zzso Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examine the brain mechanisms that 6- and 7-year-old children and adults recruit to solve zzso comparisons across different notation zzso The data reveal that when young children compare zzso values in symbolic and zzso zzso they invoke the same network of brain regions as adults including zzso and zzso zzso However, children also recruit inferior frontal zzso during these zzso tasks to a much greater degree than zzso Our data lend additional support to an emerging consensus from adult zzso nonhuman zzso zzso and zzso modeling studies that a core neural system zzso zzso zzso representations throughout development but, early in development, zzso brain mechanisms mediate this zzso
