We assessed the relationship between cartilage MR relaxation times and zzso response of zzso zzso cartilage to zzso loading in healthy subjects and patients with zzso zzso Female subjects above 40 years of age with zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso were zzso on a zzso MR scanner using a custom made loading zzso MR images were acquired with the knee zzso at zzso with and without a zzso load of 50% of the zzso zzso The subjects were zzso based on the clinical zzso scoring of zzso and lateral cartilage zzso Data were zzso twice into two equal groups zzso and zzso at the median value of zzso and zzso relaxation zzso The change in contact area and cartilage deformation was measured within these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the effect of loading on contact area and zzso The average area of the contact region in the zzso compartment was significantly higher in zzso subjects compared with normal subjects in both unloaded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall relative change of cartilage thickness in the zzso compartment was significantly higher than the lateral compartment zzso zzso zzso zzso When cartilage was divided into deep and superficial zzso superficial layers showed higher changes in relaxation time zzso and zzso than the changes in relaxation time of whole cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The average zzso and zzso times, change in area of contact region, and change in cartilage thickness in subjects with zzso were higher when compared to normal zzso This study provides support for a relationship between the mechanical response of cartilage to zzso loading zzso contact area and cartilage zzso and MR relaxation times zzso and zzso in both zzso patients and normal zzso
