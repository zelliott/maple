The sensitivity of chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso on zzso zzso in human knee cartilage zzso in zzso was evaluated at 3 and 7 T field zzso zzso zzso values without accounting for zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso After zzso zzso zzso calculated zzso values were negligible at 3 T and zzso at 7 zzso These results suggest that accurate zzso correction is a prerequisite for observing reliable zzso zzso obtained with varying zzso pulse zzso and zzso as well as the consistency between zzso simulations and our experimental results indicate that the negligible zzso observed at 3 T is due to direct zzso effects and fast exchange zzso As zzso loss from cartilage is expected to result in a further reduction in zzso zzso method is not expected to be clinically useful at 3 zzso At high fields such as 7 zzso this method holds promise as a viable clinical zzso
