To assess the addition value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT in detecting early zzso deposits in bone zzso zzso 

From January 2009 to December 2010, 198 consecutive patients zzso male, 110 zzso median age: 64 zzso were zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso for disease zzso 65 for lung cancer, 66 for breast cancer, 57 for zzso and 10 for multiple zzso All scans were reviewed by a zzso and a specialist in nuclear medicine for the identification of bone zzso The presence of zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso sequential zzso scan or magnetic resonance imaging when zzso A zzso analysis was zzso 

zzso the presence of skeletal zzso 94 zzso patients had positive and 104 zzso negative CT scan whereas 110 zzso had positive and 88 zzso negative zzso scan zzso The two imaging zzso were zzso in 178 zzso patients for bone zzso on the contrary 20 zzso patients had zzso results zzso In 21 out of 178 zzso patients zzso zzso were identified both in CT and zzso whereas nine out of the 20 zzso patients showed zzso involvement at zzso zzso Overall, zzso was able to identify 30 zzso patients with zzso zzso In these latter patients, the maximum standardized zzso value zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso resulting slightly higher in patients with negative than positive CT scan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resulted more accurate than CT in early detection of zzso zzso The zzso images improve the staging of about zzso of our study zzso zzso detected zzso zzso mainly on the basis of their increased zzso activity rather than on anatomical zzso Moreover, it provided an accurate identification of zzso viability that was useful for treatment planning and zzso
