The aim of the current study was to show if zzso ratio zzso could be improved without loss of diagnostic accuracy if a zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso sequence is used at zzso T instead of zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso zzso were examined on a zzso T magnetic resonance zzso system zzso zzso Medical zzso and at a zzso T MR zzso Imaging delayed contrast enhancement was started 10 minutes after application of contrast zzso A zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso sequence was used at zzso and zzso T and compared with a segmented zzso zzso sequence at zzso zzso which served as the reference zzso zzso volumes and zzso of zzso and normal zzso were compared with the reference zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso technique allows for imaging nine slices during a single zzso without adaptation of the inversion zzso The mean value of zzso between zzso and normal zzso was zzso at zzso T and zzso at zzso T zzso zzso The zzso mean value of the reference method was zzso The zzso mean value at zzso T was significantly zzso zzso zzso higher than the mean value of the reference zzso The correlation zzso of the zzso volumes, determined with the zzso zzso zzso technique at zzso T and at zzso T and compared with the reference method, were r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The use of zzso zzso zzso at zzso T allows for accurate detection and assessment of zzso zzso zzso is significantly higher at zzso T compared with zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique at zzso T provides a higher zzso than the segmented reference technique at zzso zzso
