To further evaluate the relationship between clinical disability and zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso burden, we examined 85 patients with clinically zzso multiple sclerosis (54 zzso and 31 secondary zzso This zzso study reports on the correlations between total and zzso zzso volume on both zzso and zzso weighted images, and overall physical disability measured by Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso index and individual functional zzso Assessment of the zzso zzso load on zzso weighted images rather than the zzso zzso load on zzso weighted images at brain zzso was shown to be useful for zzso zzso from secondary progressive Multiple zzso A weak relationship between disability and total zzso volume on both zzso and zzso weighted images was found in zzso Multiple zzso In secondary progressive Multiple zzso zzso zzso volume on zzso weighted images represents the only marker of zzso Finally, the presence of zzso zzso and mental impairment was significantly associated to a greater total zzso volume on zzso while no relationship was found with other functional zzso
