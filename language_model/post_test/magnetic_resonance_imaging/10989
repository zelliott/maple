In this work, the feasibility of using zzso weighting as an MR contrast mechanism is zzso zzso images of a human brain were acquired using a zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence and compared to analogous zzso images of the same zzso The contrast between white matter and gray matter in zzso images was approximately zzso greater than that from zzso zzso These preliminary data suggest that the novel contrast mechanism of zzso can be used to yield zzso zzso zzso
