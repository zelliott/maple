The diagnosis of zzso dissemination of zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with poor zzso zzso zzso zzso agents used to achieve tumor control and improve survival include methotrexate, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Little information exists about survival following administration of IT zzso The authors report survival data from a series of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso treated for zzso or zzso zzso with IT zzso 

The authors reviewed the records of 14 patients treated between 1991 and 1997 zzso zzso zzso 9; zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients were diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso 8) or zzso zzso zzso 6) dissemination of tumor on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, zzso or zzso contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and/or zzso fluid zzso All 14 patients underwent placement of a zzso zzso system and subsequent zzso of IT zzso on a weekly basis for zzso zzso Response to treatment was evaluated clinically and by zzso at intervals of 1-3 months and 3-6 months from the initiation of IT zzso Data on survival from the time of diagnosis of dissemination was zzso 

The median survival, from the time of diagnosis of zzso or zzso zzso of patients who received IT zzso was 10 months zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso Five of 14 patients had a zzso response to treatment within 6 zzso The median survival of patients with a zzso response was zzso months, compared with 10 months for zzso No significant zzso or zzso was zzso 

Early treatment with IT zzso may result in improved survival with minimal zzso zzso response may predict prolonged zzso
