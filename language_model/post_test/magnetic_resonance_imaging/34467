The skilled use of zzso zzso techniques in combination with spectrum analysis has been proposed here as a practical method for locating zzso zzso in the singing zzso The study addresses the question of the degree of similarity between sung zzso and their zzso zzso with respect to both frequency of the first two zzso as well as posture of the vocal zzso Using magnetic resonance imaging zzso linear zzso coding zzso and spectrum analysis, two types of zzso zzso zzso and vocal zzso are compared with singing zzso to determine the degree of zzso in acoustic and spatial dimensions of the vocal tract when these zzso types are used to approximate the postures of zzso In comparing zzso types, the close similarity in acoustic data in combination with the relative zzso in spatial data indicates that the accurate zzso are not primarily the result of imitating the singing zzso but have instead an zzso zzso
