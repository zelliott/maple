Local field zzso created by zzso entities shorten water zzso relaxation times, particularly zzso This zzso relaxation zzso now known as zzso relaxation, was described zzso years ago by zzso and later extended by others to zzso particles which have a much larger zzso Unfortunately, because of subtle but significant zzso those results are valid only in the strict zzso zzso These errors are corrected in the present article, and new versions of the relaxation equations are zzso The correction is shown to be zzso not only for zzso and zzso relaxation in zzso zzso zzso where the zzso effect is known to be important, but even in some cases for zzso zzso zzso
