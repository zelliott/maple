We attempted to determine the potential cost savings of zzso knee MR imaging zzso 

This prospective study involved 50 consecutive zzso The patients met the zzso criteria for knee zzso and underwent MR imaging of the knee before zzso For all patients, we compared MR imaging and zzso zzso On the basis of a cost of zzso for each MR imaging examination and zzso for each diagnostic zzso we decided that cost-effective MR imaging would require zzso true zzso 

The respective sensitivities and zzso of MR imaging of the knee were zzso and zzso for revealing anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso and zzso for revealing zzso cruciate ligament tears, zzso and zzso for revealing zzso zzso tears, zzso and zzso for revealing lateral zzso tears, and zzso and zzso for revealing composite injury (one or more of these zzso With MR imaging examinations obtained before surgery, we found 21 zzso of 50 zzso to be zzso 

Despite stringent clinical criteria used in selecting patients for zzso zzso of our patients could have been spared surgery on the basis of the anatomy revealed by MR zzso Our study indicates that MR imaging obtained before zzso of the knee can produce a savings of as much as zzso per MR imaging examination performed on the zzso
