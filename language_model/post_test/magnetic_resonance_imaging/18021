This chapter summarizes progress in the evaluation of peripheral nerve zzso zzso and disorders by imaging techniques encompassing magnetic resonance imaging zzso and nerve ultrasound zzso Due to the radiation exposure and limited sensitivity in soft tissue contrast, zzso zzso plays no significant role in the diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso zzso and US are complementary techniques for the evaluation of peripheral nerves, each having particular advantages and zzso Nerve injury zzso intrinsic zzso signal zzso on zzso sequences in zzso or zzso nerve segments as well as in corresponding muscle groups exhibiting zzso which can be exploited zzso Nerve US is based on changes in the nerve zzso due to tumor formation or focal enlargement caused by zzso or zzso Both zzso and US provide zzso information on the precise site and extent of nerve zzso While US has the advantage of easy accessibility, providing images with superior spatial resolution at low cost, zzso shows better soft tissue contrast and better image quality for zzso nerve structures since imaging is not hindered by zzso Recent advances have remarkably increased spatial resolution of both zzso and US making imaging zzso for the zzso of causes of nerve zzso peripheral nerve tumors, and focal inflammatory zzso Both zzso and US further guide zzso exploration and can simplify zzso zzso imaging can reveal zzso conditions even in the absence of gross zzso zzso illustrating its increasing role in clinical zzso In experimental settings, novel molecular and cellular zzso contrast agents allow zzso assessment of nerve zzso as well as monitoring of zzso Depending on further clinical development, zzso zzso has the potential to follow cellular responses over time in zzso and to overcome the current limitations of zzso assessment of nerve zzso Further advances in zzso US has the potential for developing into a tool for the assessment of nerve blood zzso paving the way for better assessments of zzso zzso
