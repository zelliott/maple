There is no zzso zzso study for zzso zzso and very zzso panic disorder zzso Besides, differences of onset age might represent different clinical zzso Therefore we designed this study to investigate gray matter deficits in this zzso of zzso 

30 patients and 21 normal controls were enrolled into our zzso They all received zzso magnetic resonance imaging acquisition for the structural imaging of zzso All the structural images were processed and analyzed to estimate the differences of gray matter volumes between patients and zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso function implemented in the zzso zzso Software zzso with the zzso global brain volume, age, gender and duration of illness as zzso We also performed the zzso linear zzso between clinical rating scale scores and gray matter volumes of brain to confirm results of zzso zzso zzso and significant region for zzso of very zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and very zzso panic disorder patients had lower gray matter volumes in left zzso cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, left superior zzso zzso and right zzso when they were compared to controls zzso zzso multiple zzso cluster zzso 30 zzso A negative correlation between zzso and zzso was observed in right zzso using general linear model zzso analysis with age and gender zzso 

zzso gray matter deficits might represent the structural zzso of zzso zzso and very zzso panic zzso
