To evaluate the association of exercise and zzso activities with magnetic resonance imaging zzso knee cartilage zzso relaxation times and zzso abnormalities in zzso subjects from the zzso Initiative, with or without zzso zzso risk zzso 

We studied 128 subjects with knee zzso risk factors and 33 normal control subjects ages zzso years, with a body mass index of zzso zzso and no knee zzso zzso were zzso according to exercise level, using the leisure activity component of the Physical zzso zzso for the zzso and by zzso frequent zzso zzso Two zzso graded the cartilage of the right knee on MR images, using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso values were zzso zzso between the exercise groups and zzso groups were determined using multiple linear and zzso zzso zzso 

Among subjects with risk factors for knee zzso light zzso had lower zzso values compared with sedentary and zzso zzso When the sexes were analyzed zzso female zzso zzso had higher zzso values compared with sedentary individuals and light zzso zzso without risk factors displayed no significant differences in zzso values according to exercise zzso However, frequent zzso activities were associated with higher zzso values in both subjects with zzso risk factors and those without zzso risk factors and with more severe cartilage zzso in the group with risk zzso 

In subjects at risk of knee zzso light exercise was associated with low zzso values, whereas zzso exercise in women was associated with high zzso zzso Higher zzso values and zzso grades were also observed in frequent zzso suggesting greater cartilage zzso in these zzso
