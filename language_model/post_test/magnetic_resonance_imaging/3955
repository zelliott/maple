The utility of three-dimensional zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging for detecting zzso changes after brain tumor therapy was assessed in a serial study of 58 total examinations of 12 patients with zzso zzso zzso who received zzso Individual zzso zzso from the 3-D array of zzso encompassing the zzso showed dramatic differences in spectral patterns indicative of radiation zzso zzso or residual zzso or normal zzso The zzso imaging data demonstrated significant differences between suspected residual or zzso tumor and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso high zzso zzso levels, consistent with viable zzso were detected beyond the regions of contrast enhancement for all 12 zzso Changes in the serial zzso imaging data were observed, reflecting an altered metabolism following zzso These changes included the significant reduction in zzso levels after therapy, indicating the transformation of tumor to zzso zzso For patients who demonstrated subsequent clinical zzso an increase in zzso levels was observed in regions that previously appeared either normal or zzso Several patients showed regional variations in response to zzso as evaluated by zzso zzso This study demonstrates the potential of zzso 3-D zzso imaging to discriminate between the formation of zzso radiation necrosis and residual or zzso tumor following zzso This zzso may also allow better definition of tumor extent prior to zzso by detecting the presence of zzso zzso levels in zzso regions of solid zzso
