zzso zzso is critical to learning zzso and its disruption may zzso zzso decision making and the generation of psychotic symptoms in zzso However, there is a paucity of evidence directly examining the role of zzso zzso on zzso function in zzso In order to probe the effects of zzso on zzso zzso during learning and to test whether disruptions in learning processes may be related to the zzso of zzso the authors explored the brain representations of reward prediction error and incentive value, two key reinforcement learning zzso before and after methamphetamine zzso 

Healthy volunteers zzso underwent functional zzso zzso scanning while performing a reward learning task on three zzso after zzso after methamphetamine infusion zzso zzso body zzso and after zzso with 400 zzso of zzso and then methamphetamine zzso Brain zzso representations of learning signals, calculated using a reinforcement zzso algorithm, were compared across drug zzso 

In the zzso condition, reward prediction error was coded in the zzso zzso zzso and incentive value in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso prediction error and incentive value signals were disrupted by methamphetamine in the left nucleus zzso and left zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso symptoms were significantly correlated with incentive value disruption in the zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly alter zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that methamphetamine zzso brain representations of zzso parameters that zzso zzso They also demonstrate a significant link between psychosis and abnormal zzso learning signals in the prefrontal and zzso zzso
