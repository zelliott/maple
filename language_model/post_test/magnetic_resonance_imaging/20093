The purpose of this study was to evaluate a routine protocol for combined MR and zzso imaging of the prostate for staging zzso 

Fifty patients with zzso prostate zzso were examined with our sequence zzso which consisted of zzso fast zzso sequences and a pelvic zzso zzso zzso For zzso we used a zzso chemical shift imaging zzso zzso zzso Image interpretation was performed by two zzso The total number of tumor zzso and tumor zzso per slice were counted to estimate the tumor volume in every zzso The potential of MR zzso to differentiate between zzso and zzso tumors, based on the estimated tumor volumes, was compared with the staging performance of zzso 

The MR measurement time was zzso minutes, and the total procedure time averaged 35 zzso zzso percent of the zzso examinations were zzso zzso significant differences in the number of tumor zzso per slice and tumor volumes were found between zzso and zzso zzso The descriptive parameters of zzso and MR zzso did not differ zzso sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, for MR zzso The combination of both methods resulted in only a slight improvement in staging performance and was not statistically zzso 

Combined zzso and MR zzso of the prostate has no diagnostic advantage in staging performance over zzso zzso The mean tumor volumes, estimated by MR zzso differ statistically significantly between zzso and zzso zzso
