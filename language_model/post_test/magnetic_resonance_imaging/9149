zzso asymmetry reduction in older adults zzso has been frequently reported in studies of functional brain zzso It is commonly considered to be a plastic brain reorganization that provides compensation for declining unilateral neural zzso However, plastic functional zzso may also be associated with neural connectivity zzso Using zzso and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as diffusion zzso imaging zzso we examined whether functional and structural connectivity related to prefrontal working memory function is zzso reduced in the two zzso of the aging zzso and if yes, whether these zzso connectivity declines are correlated with asymmetry reduction in functional zzso With regions of interests defined by verbal working memory zzso it is revealed that although neural connectivity is generally reduced in the aging brain, zzso resting functional connectivity is better preserved in the left zzso while prefrontal zzso fiber pathways are better preserved in the right zzso In addition, the zzso change of the functional zzso is zzso correlated with that of the resting connectivity and positively correlated with that of the structural zzso These results reveal additional aspects of the zzso zzso of aging and suggest a link between zzso connectivity reduction and zzso
