To zzso zzso zzso in intact bovine zzso cartilage using the zzso zzso ratio imaging zzso This approach exploits zzso relaxation time in the rotating frame zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso 

All the magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments were performed on a zzso zzso GE zzso scanner zzso Milwaukee, zzso and zzso experiments of zzso zzso zzso zzso were done on a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was tuned to a zzso frequency of 170 zzso was employed for the imaging zzso zzso zzso were made using a fast spin echo zzso sequence zzso with a zzso cluster consisting of two 90 degrees hard zzso separated by a zzso rectangle pulse for zzso 

The methodology is first validated on zzso zzso and then used to zzso zzso content in intact bovine cartilage (N zzso zzso There is a good agreement between the zzso map calculated from the zzso ratio imaging method (71 zzso zzso and zzso measured from zzso zzso (75 zzso zzso in intact bovine zzso 

We have demonstrated a zzso zzso ratio imaging method to zzso absolute zzso distribution in the cartilage in a zzso and zzso zzso
