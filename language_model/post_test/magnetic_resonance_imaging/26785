In zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso at zzso and ex zzso high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso at 500 zzso were used to study the composition of zzso zzso in zzso obese and zzso lean zzso zzso composition was characterized by zzso and zzso indexes and mean chain zzso In zzso experiments were conducted in known zzso of zzso and oils in order to validate the zzso To avoid zzso due to partial peak overlapping in zzso peak zzso was performed after fitting of spectral zzso by using the zzso zzso The intensity of different spectral lines was also corrected for zzso zzso zzso with different sensitivity and zzso both techniques revealed that white zzso tissue is characterized by lower zzso and zzso indexes in obese rats compared with zzso zzso revealed similar differences in brown zzso zzso The present findings confirm the hypothesis that obese and lean zzso rats have different zzso tissue zzso
