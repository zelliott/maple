zzso To develop a successful treatment zzso for zzso an appropriate animal model is zzso We have proposed a new zzso model that shows the total amount of necrosis and in which we observed new bone formation after zzso zzso cultured zzso 

The zzso zzso of the right knees of New Zealand white rabbits were exposed after zzso the ligaments surrounding the zzso zzso After which, the zzso junction was cut using a saw, and the entire zzso zzso was zzso After three liquid nitrogen treatments, the isolated zzso zzso was internally fixated to the zzso zzso using two or three zzso zzso Bone zzso isolated from the zzso crest was cultivated to differentiate it into zzso and the cultured cells were then injected into the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso were not present in the zzso areas at any stage of the development of the zzso model within 24 zzso after zzso zzso However, new bone formation with zzso and blood vessels was observed in the zzso bone 12 zzso after zzso the zzso cultured zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of the rabbit is an appropriate model for demonstrating zzso and treatment evaluation zzso to its easy zzso and treatment zzso zzso zzso cultured zzso treatment would seem to be a potentially successful treatment zzso for zzso
