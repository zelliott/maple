zzso To determine the effects of the level of spinal zzso injury zzso on skeletal muscle, intramuscular fat zzso zzso areas zzso and relative zzso zzso to determine the zzso if any, of zzso to each of these variables after incomplete zzso 

zzso study at the Shepherd Center, Atlanta, zzso zzso 

Thirteen individuals with incomplete zzso were classified according to their level of injury into a high level of injury group zzso zzso zzso and a low level of injury group zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined for thigh muscles using a modified zzso scale at 6 weeks zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images were taken 6 weeks zzso to measure thigh skeletal muscle and zzso zzso 

zzso was significantly evident in the zzso group compared to the zzso group zzso Six weeks zzso muscle zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso Relative zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso accounted for zzso of the zzso in muscle zzso for all subjects zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be an important factor in defending skeletal muscle size and indirectly preventing zzso zzso early after incomplete zzso
