zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a zzso technique that allows repeated assessments of functional connectivity in resting zzso While zzso zzso is limited to indirectly measured drug effects in areas affected by the task, resting state can show direct zzso effects across all brain zzso zzso zzso could be an objective measure for compounds affecting the zzso Several studies on the effects of zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso have been zzso However, no studies on the effects of cannabinoids on resting state networks using zzso have been zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on functional brain connectivity using zzso Twelve healthy volunteers (9 male, 3 zzso zzso 2, 6 and 6 zzso zzso or zzso with 90-minute intervals in a randomized, double blind, zzso zzso Eight zzso scans of 8 zzso were obtained per zzso zzso rated zzso psychedelic effects on a visual analog scale after each zzso as zzso effect zzso zzso effects on functional connectivity were examined using dual zzso with zzso software zzso Analysis Group, zzso Eight maps of zzso connectivity throughout the entire brain were provided per zzso series with eight zzso zzso networks of zzso These maps were used in a mixed effects model group analysis to determine brain regions with a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso images were zzso and results were zzso across multiple zzso zzso administration increased functional connectivity in the zzso network, and was associated with zzso zzso connectivity changes in the right and left zzso visual stream zzso The brain regions showing connectivity changes included the zzso and zzso frontal cortical zzso Clear increases were found for feeling high, external perception, heart rate and zzso whereas zzso zzso This study shows that zzso zzso both increases and (to a lesser zzso decreases in functional brain zzso mainly in brain regions with high zzso of zzso Some of the involved regions could be functionally related to robust zzso zzso that have been found in previous studies zzso et zzso zzso such as zzso stability, feeling high and altered time zzso
