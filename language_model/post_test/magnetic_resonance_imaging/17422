A powerful zzso pulse sequence programming tool has been designed for creating magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso It allows rapid development of pulse sequences in zzso mode zzso for the zzso of zzso and consists of three zzso which include a zzso sequence editor, a zzso management module and a sequence zzso Its key features are ease to use, flexibility and hardware zzso When graphic elements are combined with a certain text expressions, the zzso pulse sequence programming is as flexible as text-based programming zzso In addition, a zzso design is implemented by using the strategy of two step zzso To demonstrate the flexibility and the capability of this zzso sequence programming zzso a zzso fast spin echo experiment is performed on our zzso zzso T permanent magnet zzso zzso
