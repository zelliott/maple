In this work, we aimed at zzso focal zzso in zzso structures with cognitive function, in the spectrum from healthy subjects to severe zzso disease: 28 subjects with normal zzso and 84 patients presenting various degrees of cognitive impairment were included in the zzso The cognitive level of each subject was assessed with the zzso State zzso zzso zzso in zzso structures was zzso by modeling and analyzing local shape variations of brain zzso for a given subject, we distinguished between the severity of zzso estimated as local enlargement (in zzso of the zzso surface relative to an average normal subject, and the extent of zzso defined as the percentage of the zzso surface zzso or per anatomical zzso significantly different from an average zzso Linear zzso across subjects was performed to evaluate the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso The severity of zzso showed good correlation with zzso score in the left thalamus, the left zzso horn, the left zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso The extent of zzso showed no significant zzso In conclusion, the zzso scores correlate with localized depth of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
