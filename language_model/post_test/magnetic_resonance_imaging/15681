zzso zzso injury zzso is thought to be a major contributor to cognitive dysfunction following traumatic brain injury zzso however zzso is difficult to diagnose or characterize zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso has shown promise in detecting zzso but direct comparison to zzso zzso injury has not been zzso In the current study, mice were zzso with zzso subjected to a moderate cortical controlled impact injury, and zzso 4-6 h and 24 h zzso zzso injury was detected by zzso beta precursor protein zzso and zzso zzso in zzso white matter zzso The severity of zzso injury was zzso using zzso methods from zzso stained zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and relative zzso significantly reduced in the injured, zzso corpus zzso and external zzso while no significant changes were seen with conventional zzso in these zzso The zzso was easily zzso on all zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between changes in relative zzso and the density of zzso stained zzso across mice and across zzso spanning the spatial zzso of zzso The zzso value of zzso was tested using a region with zzso changes zzso zzso and a region without zzso changes zzso zzso zzso with zzso predictions, there was zzso detection of zzso injury in the zzso zzso and none in the anterior zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is able to detect zzso injury, and support the hypothesis that zzso may be more sensitive than conventional imaging methods for this zzso
