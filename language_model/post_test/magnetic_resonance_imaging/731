The cognitive impairment revealed in some zzso zzso zzso lateral sclerosis zzso patients is characterized by executive dysfunction with widely repeated deficits on tests of verbal zzso zzso However, conflicting evidence exists of an impairment on other word retrieval tasks, such as confrontation naming, which do not place heavy demands on executive zzso Previous research has demonstrated intact confrontation naming in the presence of verbal zzso deficits, although naming deficits have been described in other zzso In this investigation, functional zzso zzso techniques were employed to explore whether word retrieval deficits and underlying cerebral abnormalities were specific to letter zzso which are more likely to indicate executive dysfunction, or were also present in confrontation naming, indicating language zzso zzso zzso ALS patients were compared with 18 healthy zzso The two groups were matched for age, intelligence quotient, years of education, and anxiety and depression zzso Two zzso overt zzso zzso zzso were zzso letter zzso and confrontation naming, which were developed for use with an older and potentially impaired zzso In ALS patients relative to controls, the letter zzso zzso task revealed significantly impaired zzso in the middle and inferior frontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso in addition to regions of the zzso and zzso zzso The confrontation naming zzso task also revealed impaired zzso in less extensive prefrontal regions, including the inferior frontal zzso and regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These changes were present despite matched performance between patients and controls during each zzso zzso The pattern of dysfunction corresponded to the presence of cognitive deficits on both letter zzso and confrontation naming in the ALS zzso This study provides evidence of cerebral abnormalities in ALS in the network of regions involved in language and executive zzso Moreover, the findings further illustrate the zzso of cognitive and cerebral change in zzso
