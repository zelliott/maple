This study compares the results of zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso in tumor volume definition of brain zzso Furthermore, it evaluates the influences of the information provided from zzso for three-dimensional zzso zzso treatment zzso 

In 30 patients with zzso zzso proven brain zzso zzso patients, zzso Grade zzso patients, zzso Grade zzso patients, zzso Grade zzso patient, zzso Grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed zzso in the same zzso A special software system allowed the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The gross tumor volume zzso defined on the zzso fusion images zzso was compared with the zzso defined on the zzso zzso On the zzso zzso the volume of the zzso tumor zzso zzso was compared with the volume of the zzso zzso enhancement zzso The initial planning target volume zzso and the boost volume zzso outlined on the zzso zzso were analyzed comparatively to the zzso and zzso delineated using the zzso zzso 

In all 30 patients a higher zzso zzso of tumor areas, compared to the normal brain tissue was zzso Mean zzso mean zzso and mean zzso were 43, 82, and 16 zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso outside the contrast enhancement regions was observed in all zzso Mean relative increase of tumor volume defined on the fusion images, zzso versus zzso alone was zzso zzso tumor zzso areas outside the zzso were registered in 7 patients zzso In these patients, the mean increase zzso was zzso higher than zzso defined according to the zzso data zzso The additional information provided by zzso modified minimally the initial zzso zzso relative increase zzso versus zzso zzso but significantly the zzso zzso relative increase zzso versus zzso zzso 

In a significant number of patients, the zzso investigation improves tumor detection and zzso in the planning zzso This has important consequences in the zzso zzso treatment planning, especially in the zzso of zzso and in dose escalation zzso
