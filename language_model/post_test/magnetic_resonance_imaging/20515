The role of evoked potential zzso in evaluating multiple sclerosis zzso has changed with the advent of magnetic resonance zzso zzso Given the possibly varied nature and distribution of zzso zzso in Asian zzso this study compared the diagnostic usefulness of zzso to that of MR imaging among Chinese zzso 

This was a retrospective study of zzso patients treated at the zzso zzso Hospital, Hong Kong, between June 2004 and June zzso The visual zzso zzso auditory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared with MR imaging for correlation and usefulness using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

The results showed that abnormalities were detected in the three zzso of zzso among the 17 patients studied zzso 82 percent, median and zzso zzso 65 percent, zzso 47 zzso Compared with MR imaging, zzso was far more useful at detecting zzso nerve zzso while zzso was less sensitive at detecting zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso along the auditory pathways at a rate that was almost similar to that of MR imaging zzso Both zzso and MR imaging for zzso nerves were negative in the two patients with zzso zzso In some instances, zzso yielded abnormalities that were zzso by conventional MR imaging, and the sensitivity increased with the number of zzso zzso 

zzso may be considered in clinical situations in which MR imaging is negative or cannot be zzso They may also be performed when evaluating treatment response, long-term prognosis and zzso changes on MR zzso
