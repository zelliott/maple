This study examined the relationship between four zzso parameters zzso ratio, zzso diameter, spinal zzso area, and spinal canal zzso in patients with a traumatic cervical spine injury, as well as the correlation between these parameters and the neurological zzso 

A total of 212 cervical spinal levels in 53 patients with a zzso injury were zzso The following four parameters were zzso zzso ratio on the plain lateral zzso the zzso diameter, the spinal zzso area, and the spinal canal area on the zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso between the parameters at each level and between the levels of each zzso were zzso The correlation between the zzso parameters and the spinal zzso injury status classified into four categories, A zzso B zzso C zzso and D zzso was zzso 

The mean zzso ratio, zzso diameter, spinal zzso area and spinal canal area was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An examination of the correlation between the zzso spinal zzso and clinical spinal zzso injury revealed an increase in the values of the four zzso parameters from zzso A to zzso zzso ratio was the only zzso showing statistically significant correlation with the clinical status zzso zzso zzso 

There was a correlation between the underlying spinal zzso and the development of neurological impairment after a traumatic cervical spine zzso In addition, it is believed that zzso ratio can be used to help determine and predict the neurological zzso
