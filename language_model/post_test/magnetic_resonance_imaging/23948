zzso development of new selective zzso contrast agents zzso requires a detailed understanding of their interactions with biological zzso This report shows how some of these interactions can be studied with electron zzso resonance zzso through examples of zzso complexes interactions with model zzso zzso It is shown that the spin label zzso method can be used to zzso zzso presence and possible location of zzso contrast agents in the model zzso zzso changes and zzso in membrane organization upon interaction with the zzso and zzso changes in the local polarity of the zzso and its phase behavior due to addition of zzso zzso This work demonstrates that interaction of zzso complexes with zzso zzso can be observed directly from changes in their continuous wave zzso zzso zzso obtained at zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso where signals arising from zzso and zzso zzso complexes become zzso Analysis of frequency dependence of the effective zzso of the zzso signal provides estimates of zzso splitting zzso zzso for these complexes at zzso conditions and information on how this zzso is affected by interaction with zzso zzso zzso experiments at high magnetic fields are also useful in providing data on the frequency zzso of electronic relaxation caused mainly by a zzso of the zzso zzso interaction zzso of these high spin zzso
