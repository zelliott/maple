Brain zzso is a hallmark of human zzso brain tumors and contributes to the clinical course and outcome of brain tumor zzso The so-called zzso zzso or brain swelling zzso in zzso MR scans as high intensity areas surrounding the bulk tumor zzso The mechanisms of this increased fluid attraction and the cellular composition of the zzso are only partially zzso In this study, we focus on imaging zzso zzso in zzso implanted zzso in zzso and correlate zzso zzso with zzso zzso We identified that areas of zzso zzso not only include the tumor invasion zone, but also are associated with increased zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso expression surrounding the bulk tumor zzso Moreover, a high number of activated zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso migration zzso factor zzso accumulate at the tumor zzso Thus, the area of zzso zzso is mainly dominated by zzso changes of vital brain zzso These data corroborate that zzso zzso identified in zzso MR scans are characterized with zzso in zzso cell distribution and marker expression forming an inflammatory tumor zzso
