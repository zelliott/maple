zzso cued movement is thought to zzso involve zzso and zzso circuits whereas internally generated movement recruits zzso zzso zzso motor zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso and drawing are zzso zzso and internally guided actions and Parkinson's patients and zzso patients show deficits in tracking and drawing, zzso In this study we aimed to examine this zzso distinction in healthy subjects using functional zzso Ten healthy subjects performed tracing and drawing of simple geometric shapes using pencil and paper while in a zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that compared to zzso drawing generated greater zzso in the right zzso zzso I, bilateral zzso right zzso zzso zzso and right frontal eye zzso zzso did not recruit any additional zzso compared to drawing except in zzso and zzso visual zzso zzso drawing recruited areas more frequently associated with cognitively challenging tasks, attention and memory, but zzso zzso and zzso activity did not differentiate tracing from drawing in the zzso zzso As our paradigm was of a simple, repetitive and zzso design, these results suggest that the task familiarity and the zzso nature of visual feedback in tracking tasks, compared to zzso may be important contributing factors towards the degree of zzso zzso Future studies comparing dynamic with zzso external cues and visual feedback may clarify the role of the zzso and zzso zzso in the visual guidance of drawing zzso
