zzso spend much of their time learning, zzso and listening to complex vocal sequences we call zzso Songs are learned via cultural transmission, and singing, usually by zzso has a strong impact on the behavioral state of the zzso often promoting zzso pair zzso or zzso What is it in the acoustic structure of birdsong that makes it such a potent zzso We suggest that birdsong potency might be driven by principles similar to those that make music so effective in inducing emotional responses in zzso a combination of rhythms and zzso the transitions between acoustic zzso emotions through creating expectations, zzso tension, tension release, or zzso Here we propose a framework for investigating how zzso like human music, employs the above zzso features to affect the emotions of avian zzso First we analyze songs of zzso zzso zzso zzso by examining their zzso in terms of transitions in rhythm and zzso These transitions show gradual zzso and graceful zzso which are comparable to some aspects of human zzso We then explore the feasibility of stripping such putative musical features from the songs and testing how this might affect patterns of auditory responses, focusing on zzso data in zzso that demonstrate the feasibility of such zzso Finally, we explore ideas for investigating whether musical features of birdsong activate avian brains and affect avian behavior in manners comparable to music's effects on zzso In conclusion, we suggest that birdsong research would benefit from current advances in music theory by attempting to identify structures that are designed to elicit zzso emotions and then testing for such effects zzso zzso research that takes into account the striking complexity of song structure in light of its more immediate function - to affect behavioral state in listeners - could provide a useful animal model for studying basic principles of music zzso in a system that is very accessible for investigation, and where zzso auditory and social experience can be tightly zzso
