zzso memory impairment is considered to be a core cognitive deficit of Major zzso Disorder zzso and has motivated a line of research investigating the role of the zzso and the zzso in zzso While functional zzso studies have focused on memory for emotional but not for neutral zzso in order to probe zzso function, structural imaging studies have tied episodic memory to zzso zzso We therefore investigated the neural zzso of episodic memory formation for neutral stimuli in 20 patients with a first depressive episode, 20 patients recovered from a first episode and 20 healthy zzso Because there is evidence that the zzso exhibits zzso responses even to neutral stimuli in depressed subjects, we specifically explored the potential role of the zzso in forming episodic memories with neutral zzso Both patient groups showed stronger subsequent memory effects in the zzso when compared to controls, in the absence of any differences in zzso activity between zzso Patients with a first episode of zzso showed increased activity related to episodic memory formation in a zzso zzso These zzso zzso may be related to a zzso zzso which is supported by the absence of any differences in memory performance between zzso These findings represent initial evidence for a zzso trait or vulnerability marker of zzso involvement in episodic memory formation of neutral zzso
