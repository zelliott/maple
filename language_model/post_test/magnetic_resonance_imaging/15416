Several studies have examined the zzso and mortality of stroke in relation to zzso However, the evidence is conflicting partly due to variation in the populations zzso zzso zzso and in zzso conditions between zzso Moreover, they may not have been able to take into account the age, sex and stroke type of the study zzso We hypothesized that the age, sex and type of stroke are major zzso of the presence or absence of winter excess in morbidity and mortality associated with zzso 

We analyzed a zzso stroke register from Norfolk, UK to examine our prior zzso Using zzso method, we performed zzso zzso analyses by zzso seasonal year and zzso zzso of patients' age and stroke zzso and calculated the winter excess for the number of admissions, in-patient deaths and length of acute hospital zzso 

There were zzso patients zzso Their ages ranged from 17 to 105 years zzso zzso There appeared to be winter excess in hospital admissions, deaths and length of acute hospital stay overall accounting for zzso extra admissions zzso excess index of zzso in men and zzso in zzso and zzso deaths zzso excess index of zzso and zzso in zzso due to stroke in winter compared to zzso zzso Older patients with zzso stroke mainly contribute to this zzso If our findings are zzso throughout England and Wales, it is estimated that there are 1,700 excess admissions, 600 excess in-patient deaths and zzso extra acute hospital bed days each winter, related to stroke within the current population of approximately 60 zzso 

Further research should be focused on the zzso of winter excess in morbidity and mortality associated with zzso This may subsequently reduce the morbidity and mortality by providing effective preventive strategies in zzso
