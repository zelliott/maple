To assess the zzso of single zzso labeled zzso stem cells zzso zzso on a clinical zzso MR scanner using a small animal volume zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso labeled with zzso iron oxide particles zzso while applying different zzso of iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cellular iron content was determined with atomic zzso zzso zzso Single labeled zzso were displayed in a culture flask using MR imaging and zzso Special cell zzso were designed to examine the detection of labeled zzso with MR imaging in a spatial zzso A zzso zzso zzso echo sequence with zzso spatial resolution of 150 to 500 zzso zzso was used for image zzso The detection of labeled zzso in the cell zzso was zzso evaluated using an automated image zzso zzso analysis was performed with a significance level of p zzso zzso 

The labeling of zzso yielded a mean cellular iron content of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the culture zzso showed single zzso labeled zzso centered in much larger MR signal zzso The detection and zzso of single zzso in cell zzso were feasible for spatial resolutions of 150 zzso and 200 zzso zzso with a lower zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso with a higher cellular zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed significantly higher zzso at both spatial resolutions with zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso Regarding the spatial resolution zzso zzso 200 zzso significantly different detection rates were determined only for zzso with the higher zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of single zzso labeled zzso is feasible on a clinical zzso MR scanner with a small animal volume zzso at zzso spatial resolutions of 150 zzso and 200 zzso The number of detected cells is influenced by the cellular iron content and the spatial zzso
