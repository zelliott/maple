To evaluate the value of zzso in assessing zzso zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso zzso of 63 healthy subjects (2 zzso were zzso examined by ultrasound to determine zzso limits of zzso zzso and the zzso of the joint zzso zzso zzso zzso of 32 patients with chronic arthritis were evaluated by ultrasound and, for comparison, by zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The mean zzso distance of the joint capsule from the bone rim was zzso zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso control subjects and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso control zzso The mean zzso of the joint space was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same control groups, zzso In detecting soft tissue changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso was better than zzso In revealing zzso surface changes, CT was the best method and zzso was least sensitive but quite zzso Our most prominent finding was that ultrasound is able to exclude joint zzso when the zzso distance of the joint capsule from the bone rim was zzso 3 zzso there was no zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso can detect zzso joint changes zzso It is able to exclude joint zzso zzso in the zzso joint may reflect zzso but may also be a sign of zzso
