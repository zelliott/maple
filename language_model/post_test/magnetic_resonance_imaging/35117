Fear and reward learning can occur through direct experience or zzso Both channels can enhance survival or create zzso zzso We used zzso to isolate neural mechanisms of zzso fear and reward learning and investigate whether neural response varied according to individual differences in zzso and zzso Participants learned zzso associations by observing a woman respond with fearful (or zzso and happy (or zzso facial expressions to novel zzso The zzso complex was active when learning the zzso association, and the zzso was active when learning the zzso zzso After learning, objects were presented alone; zzso activity was greater for the fear zzso zzso and happy zzso zzso associated zzso zzso greater zzso activity during fear zzso zzso learning predicted better recognition of learned objects on a subsequent memory zzso Furthermore, personality modulated neural mechanisms of zzso zzso positively correlated with neural activity in the zzso and zzso during fear zzso zzso zzso Low zzso zzso was related to faster behavioral predictions of the fearful and neutral expressions during fear zzso In addition, low zzso zzso was related to greater zzso activity during happy zzso zzso learning, happy zzso zzso object recognition, and faster reaction times for predicting happy and neutral expressions during reward zzso These findings suggest that zzso is associated with an increased sensitivity in the neural mechanism for fear learning which leads to enhanced zzso of fear associations, and that low zzso zzso is related to enhanced zzso for both fear and reward zzso
