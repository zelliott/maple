Numerous studies have demonstrated that brain networks derived from zzso data have zzso zzso features, such as zzso organization, modular structure and highly connected zzso In these studies, the extent of connectivity between pairs of brain regions has often been measured using some form of statistical zzso This article demonstrates that correlation as a measure of connectivity in and of itself gives rise to networks with zzso zzso zzso In particular, networks in which connectivity is measured using correlation are inherently more clustered than random networks, and as such are more likely to be zzso zzso zzso correlation as a measure of connectivity also gives rise to networks with zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation networks are inherently less clustered than random zzso Network measures in correlation networks should be zzso against zzso networks that respect the zzso structure induced by correlation zzso zzso used random zzso zzso do not yield appropriate zzso networks for some network zzso zzso networks are proposed to explicitly zzso for the inherent zzso structure found in correlation networks, resulting in more conservative estimates of zzso zzso A number of steps may be needed to zzso each network measure individually and control for distinct features zzso degree zzso The main conclusion of this article is that correlation can and should be used to measure zzso however appropriate zzso networks should be used to benchmark network measures in correlation zzso
