The object selectivity of nearby cells in inferior zzso zzso zzso is often zzso To zzso the relationship between zzso organization in IT zzso and the zzso among zzso with respect to object zzso we used optical imaging technique to locate zzso regions zzso zzso and systematically compared object selectivity of individual zzso within and across the zzso The object selectivity of a given cell in a spot was similar to that of the averaged cellular activity within the zzso However, there was not such similarity among different spots zzso zzso zzso We suggest that each cell is characterized by 1) a zzso response property that cause zzso zzso in object selectivity and 2) one or potentially a few numbers of response properties common across the cells within a spot, which provide the basis for zzso organization in IT zzso Furthermore, similarity in object selectivity among cells within a randomly chosen site was lower than that for a cell in an activity spot identified by optical imaging zzso We suggest that the zzso may be organized in a region where zzso with similar response properties were densely clustered and a region where zzso with similar response properties were sparsely zzso
