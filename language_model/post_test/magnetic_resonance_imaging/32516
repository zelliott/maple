zzso responses to zzso stimulation applied to the index fingertip were recorded with zzso zzso in zzso healthy young adult zzso zzso trains were produced by a zzso driven membrane zzso at 22 zzso for a trial duration of 1 zzso separated by zzso intervals zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Data analysis was performed in two frequency zzso zzso onset responses in the lower frequency band zzso zzso contained a clearly expressed zzso zzso The higher frequency band zzso zzso revealed a zzso response zzso within the first 200 zzso followed by rhythmic activity at the stimulus frequency that continued throughout the stimulus zzso known as the zzso response zzso zzso associated with the transient responses and zzso were localized in two distinct regions within the primary zzso zzso zzso with transient responses located on average 3 zzso more zzso and inferior than the zzso The transient and zzso peak zzso increased with ISI, whereas the zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso These results may reflect functionally and zzso distinct neural zzso Further investigations are required to assess the implications of these findings for probing the zzso system using other functional zzso methods such as zzso
