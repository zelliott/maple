We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the brain basis of overt and covert forms of attention during search, while employing stringent control of both eye movements and zzso zzso A zzso design compared overt and covert forms of zzso serial search versus zzso zzso To match zzso changes and the number and magnitude of attention shifts across cells in the design, zzso tracking involved zzso zzso of previous zzso eye zzso We found that, in terms of cortical zzso engagement of the zzso zzso network by zzso attention did not depend on zzso requirements, being found similarly for covert attention, in zzso with other zzso However, analyses of effective connectivity (or zzso zzso revealed that information flow within this network changed significantly as a function of both the task zzso or zzso and the overt versus covert form of zzso Additionally, we observed a distinct set of zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso engaged primarily during the covert form of zzso zzso We conclude that dynamics within the zzso zzso zzso system zzso reorganize to integrate task demands and zzso zzso
