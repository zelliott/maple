To present zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of primary zzso zzso zzso at initial presentation zzso and zzso disease zzso 

We studied 15 consecutive female patients (age range, zzso years; mean, zzso zzso with zzso proven zzso who underwent CT and/or zzso between July 2000 and December zzso zzso zzso evaluation and zzso follow-up was done with CT and/or magnetic resonance zzso All CT and zzso studies were evaluated zzso zzso and blindly by 2 zzso for the imaging findings of zzso 

The imaging findings were as zzso zzso 2 of 2 at zzso 9 of 10 at zzso zzso zzso and enhancement, 1 of 2 at zzso 9 of 10 at zzso zzso zzso or bulky mass zzso 1 of 2 at zzso 8 of 10 at zzso zzso zzso involvement, 1 of 2 at zzso 3 of 10 at zzso and distant zzso 1 of 10 at zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and enhancement, and zzso zzso or bulky mass zzso were the most frequent findings of zzso zzso disease revealed similar findings compared with the zzso
