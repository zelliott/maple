Few zzso studies have explored gender differences on mental rotation zzso Most studies have zzso samples with both zzso samples mainly consisting of men, or samples with six or fewer zzso Graduate students in science fields or liberal arts programs (20 zzso 20 zzso completed a mental rotation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso When a pair of cube figures was zzso the participant made a zzso response based on whether the pair is the zzso or zzso Regardless of zzso the bilateral middle frontal zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso were activated when a subject tried to solve the mental rotation zzso Increased zzso in the right inferior frontal zzso frontal zzso the left zzso zzso zzso region, and the left middle zzso zzso was found for men as compared to zzso Better accuracy and shorter response times were correlated with an increased zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso No significant brain activity differences related to mental rotation were found between academic zzso These findings suggest that networks involved in visual attention appear to be more strongly activated in the mental rotation tasks in men as compared to zzso It also suggests that men use a more automatic process when analyzing complex visual reasoning tasks while women use a more zzso zzso
