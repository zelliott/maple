People with zzso 1 zzso have multiple benign zzso and a zzso lifetime risk of developing zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso Most zzso develop from benign zzso zzso so the burden of benign tumors may be a risk factor for developing zzso We studied 13 zzso patients with zzso and 26 zzso and zzso controls zzso patients who did not have zzso with detailed clinical examinations and zzso zzso to characterize their body burden of internal benign zzso Internal zzso zzso were identified in 22 zzso of the 39 zzso patients zzso All six of the zzso patients with zzso under 30 years of age had zzso zzso on zzso zzso compared to only 3 of 11 matched zzso controls under age 30 zzso zzso zzso Both the median number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the median zzso volume zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso were significantly greater among zzso patients younger than 30 years of age than among zzso No significant differences in zzso zzso findings were observed between zzso patients with zzso and controls who were 30 years of age or zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients allows assessment of the burden of internal zzso most of which are not apparent on physical zzso zzso imaging of young zzso patients may allow those at highest risk for developing zzso to be identified early in zzso Close surveillance of these high-risk patients may permit earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of zzso that zzso
