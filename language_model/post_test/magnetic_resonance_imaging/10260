zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a disorder of zzso migration resulting in multiple zzso zzso along the lateral zzso zzso Prior studies have shown that zzso in the zzso A zzso gene can cause zzso through an zzso dominant zzso zzso female patients usually remain zzso until the second or third decade of life, when they may have predominantly focal seizures, whereas zzso male fetuses typically die in zzso Recent studies have also reported zzso in zzso in male patients with zzso who are cognitively zzso We describe zzso in three male siblings with zzso due to zzso severe zzso regression, and West zzso 

The study includes the three affected brothers and their zzso zzso recordings and magnetic resonance image zzso scanning were performed on all zzso zzso for zzso were detected by using zzso chain reaction zzso on zzso DNA followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis or zzso 

Two of the siblings are zzso zzso and all had West syndrome with zzso on zzso zzso of the brain revealed zzso zzso of cerebral zzso intensity, typical for zzso zzso analyses demonstrated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso acid substitution in zzso 9 of the zzso zzso 

The association between zzso and West syndrome, to our knowledge, has not been previously zzso Males with zzso have been known to harbor zzso zzso although zzso they either show early zzso or survive and have a normal zzso The current studies show that zzso zzso can cause zzso zzso zzso regression, and West syndrome in male patients, suggesting that this type of zzso zzso may contribute to severe zzso zzso
