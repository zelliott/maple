This study evaluated the zzso relationship on magnetic resonance image zzso in a group of subjects with silent zzso zzso zzso when tested clinically with those in subjects with discernible zzso zzso Study design Twenty-five completely zzso patients were selected to participate in this zzso The study was based on bilateral zzso of 15 patients (with zzso zzso and 10 zzso volunteers zzso 

It was noted that disc displacement was found in zzso of the zzso with no history of zzso zzso In 6 zzso of control group, a reducing disc displacement was found, and in 3 zzso a permanent displacement was zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso of zzso zzso disc displacement was found in 19 of these zzso whereas permanent displacement was found in 2 zzso In 9 of the zzso of the symptomatic group, a superior disc position was zzso Also verified was a significant association between reducing disc displacement and zzso zzso 

These observations demonstrated that internal zzso can not be associated to clicking zzso or symptoms of zzso disorders in elderly zzso patients, and the presence of displaced discs seems to be associated to altered disc zzso but not to zzso zzso
