A zzso zzso hypothesis of early brain damage is suggested in which regions of the brain with a protracted course of zzso development will be more vulnerable than earlier maturing areas to deleterious effects of early insult and, therefore, may become common sites of zzso across many disorders originating in early zzso zzso investigations of the zzso and frontal zzso are presented using zzso and zzso zzso zzso measures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso frontal lobe measures were obtained from high functioning individuals with zzso zzso survivors of acute zzso leukemia zzso with brain zzso following radiation and chemotherapy, and from rigorously selected healthy controls zzso The zzso results were clustered according to functions commonly related to frontal brain, zzso brain, and left and right zzso The A and ALL groups, as compared to C, yielded modest but consistently reduced zzso measures for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was more marked than zzso Performance on zzso tests for frontal lobe functions was generally depressed in both groups, with more severe deficits in zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso and zzso skills are zzso The zzso and frontal brain deficits that are present in both clinical groups (A and zzso may be common to other zzso and acquired disorders of early zzso Such joint manifestation of zzso and frontal lobe abnormalities is in agreement with the concept of zzso significance for the development of higher cognitive zzso
