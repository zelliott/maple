The purpose of this study was to create and test an in zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso that simulates the geometry of human zzso and allows realistic testing of devices used in zzso zzso 

The models were derived from zzso casts of the main zzso arteries and veins obtained from two zzso human zzso zzso copies of the casts were produced and combined to create complex models simulating various types of zzso zzso zzso zzso were embedded with liquid silicone solidified into transparent blocks zzso after wax zzso hollow reproductions of the original vascular zzso The models were connected to a zzso pump and their zzso with various imaging techniques and zzso treatment materials was zzso 

The models were compatible with digital zzso zzso CT, MR imaging, and zzso zzso zzso They provided a realistic zzso environment for the simulation of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso accurate and zzso in zzso models of zzso zzso provide a valuable method for evaluating new zzso treatment materials and for teaching zzso
