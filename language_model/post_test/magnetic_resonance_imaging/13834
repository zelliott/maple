Although the left and right human cerebral zzso differ both functionally and zzso little is known about the environmental or genetic factors that govern central nervous system zzso Nevertheless, cerebral asymmetry is strongly correlated with zzso and zzso does have a significant genetic zzso To explore the relative contribution of environmental and genetic influences on cerebral zzso we examined the volumes of left and right cerebral zzso in a large cohort of aging identical and fraternal twins and explored their relationship to zzso zzso zzso volumes had a major genetic zzso indicating that genes play a large role in changes in brain volume that occur with zzso Shared environment, which likely represents in zzso events, had about twice the effect on the left zzso as on the right, consistent with less genetic control over the left zzso To test the major genetic models of zzso and cerebral zzso twin pairs were divided into those with two right zzso and those with at least one left zzso zzso zzso zzso factors contributed twice the influence to left and right cerebral zzso volumes in right-handed twin pairs, suggesting a large zzso in genetic control of cerebral volumes in the zzso twin zzso This loss of genetic determination of the left and right cerebral zzso in the zzso twin pairs is consistent with models zzso a zzso genetic influence, a zzso zzso that is lost in zzso zzso resulting in decreased cerebral zzso
