We studied the cortical networks of Morse code reading with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Four expert radio zzso performed two closely matched reading experiments, one in zzso presented high speed Morse code and one in zzso Performance was equal for both zzso Reading single nouns in Morse code resulted in predominantly zzso zzso of the frontal and zzso zzso language areas, prefrontal cortex, and zzso zzso In a zzso comparison between reading Morse code and reading print, the zzso pattern in the left zzso association zzso was similar for both forms of reading, suggesting that reading Morse code shares part of its cortical networks with reading zzso
