zzso zzso tumors zzso are benign, localized zzso that typically cause zzso zzso of childhood zzso Although excellent seizure outcomes are expected following surgical zzso of zzso benign zzso reports in pediatric zzso series suggest that this may not be the case with zzso which may exhibit complex and often zzso zzso We report the characteristics and surgical outcome of an zzso and zzso cohort with this zzso 

zzso cohort of 23 patients seen at two major zzso centers, with zzso zzso associated with zzso demonstrated zzso We assessed clinical, zzso and surgical outcome features in patients with zzso and zzso zzso We were particularly interested in the level of zzso of zzso and zzso data and the need for zzso zzso We evaluated seizure outcomes at last zzso 

The mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso Ten patients had zzso zzso Thirteen patients zzso had simple zzso 21 zzso had complex zzso 16 zzso had zzso generalized zzso and 5 patients had only simple partial zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso on zzso were located in the zzso lobe in 17 patients, the frontal lobe in 3 patients and the zzso region in 2 zzso One patient had a zzso that involved both frontal and zzso zzso zzso scalp zzso and zzso were zzso in 17 patients zzso Eleven patients zzso underwent zzso while the rest required some zzso of zzso zzso as zzso Five patients required zzso zzso There was no association with cortical zzso zzso patients zzso had an Engel class 1 outcome, in a follow-up period that ranging from 5 to 98 zzso 

We found no difference in outcomes between zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso was complex, zzso between zzso and zzso studies was high and allowed good surgical outcomes at 1 year of zzso
