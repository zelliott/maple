Earlier studies have reported that zzso zzso can to some extent predict which patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso will subsequently convert to zzso and that zzso have an enhanced rate of zzso volume zzso 

To further validate the hypothesis that zzso zzso predicts conversion from zzso to zzso to relate baseline zzso volume to different forms of zzso and to investigate the role of zzso side differences and rate of volume loss over zzso 

The subjects zzso include patients with zzso at baseline and progression to zzso at the two-year follow-up zzso stable zzso patients zzso and controls zzso Among the progressing patients, 13 were diagnosed as having zzso 

The zzso zzso study is a clinically based zzso study with zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso was performed manually on the zzso investigations at baseline and at the two-year zzso 

zzso zzso could predict conversion to zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Left zzso volume in particular zzso between converting and stable zzso Cut off points for individual discrimination were shown to be potentially zzso The converting zzso group had a significantly higher rate of zzso volume loss as compared to the stable zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, zzso zzso at baseline gives zzso information about possible development of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to earlier studies, we found that left zzso volume has the best zzso zzso Reliable predictions appear to be possible in many individual zzso
