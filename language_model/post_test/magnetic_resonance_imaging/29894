zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to study the growth and zzso of grape berries for three zzso The results show that this technique allows the zzso of internal characteristics of berries using zzso procedures in order to obtain the volume and degrees zzso distribution within a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso varieties collected over the 2002 season were zzso zzso models were developed to correlate soluble zzso zzso zzso against zzso relaxation time zzso and zzso relaxation time zzso The correlation of degrees zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso In the case of zzso the correlation was significantly zzso Reconstruction techniques for the three-dimensional representation of clusters were developed, allowing an interactive zzso of the zzso The method also provides volume zzso of single berries and their distribution within the cluster with an accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results show the potential of zzso in the wine industry for both monitoring and zzso Not only does it provide quantitative information about the berries such as volume and degrees zzso zzso but it can also be used to support the sampling procedures by providing a better cluster zzso
