The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was to investigate whether and to what extent brain regions involved in zzso recognition zzso versus zzso recognition zzso overlap or separate from each zzso To this end, we performed conjunction analyses involving zzso zzso during zzso hit, zzso hit, and zzso correct rejection zzso The analyses yielded 3 main zzso First, zzso and associated zzso regions were common to zzso and zzso indicating contribution of these regions to both zzso and zzso zzso This finding may help explain why these regions are among the most common in functional zzso studies of episodic zzso Second, zzso zzso lobe zzso and associated zzso regions were associated with zzso possibly reflecting zzso zzso whereas specific prefrontal zzso zzso regions were associated with zzso possibly reflecting executive control zzso This finding is consistent with the notion that the zzso and zzso networks play complementary roles during episodic zzso Finally, within zzso zzso cortex, a zzso region was associated with zzso possibly reflecting zzso zzso zzso whereas a zzso region was associated with zzso possibly reflecting bottom-up zzso zzso This finding may help explain why functional zzso studies have found diverse zzso effects during episodic zzso Taken together, our findings provide strong evidence that zzso versus zzso and by zzso recollection versus familiarity zzso are represented in common as well as specific brain zzso
