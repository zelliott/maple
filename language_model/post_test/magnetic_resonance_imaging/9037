zzso in working memory zzso and executive cognitive control are core features of zzso However, findings regarding functional zzso strengths are heterogeneous, partly due to differences in task demands and behavioral zzso Previous investigators proposed zzso these zzso findings into a comprehensive model of cortical inefficiency assuming the zzso zzso relationship between performance and zzso zzso to be shifted in zzso The present study pursued a novel approach of precise performance balancing potentially resolving a number of discrepancies with regard to performance related cognitive zzso patterns in zzso zzso zzso activity was examined in 55 patients and 55 controls by balancing the mean number of incorrect responses between the groups and analyzing remaining incorrect zzso A modified zzso zzso zzso task zzso allowing for the segregation of zzso executive maintenance and zzso zzso was zzso Relative to healthy controls, patients showed extended zzso in inferior zzso superior zzso inferior, middle and superior frontal as well as zzso regions during zzso of incorrectly remembered zzso During erroneous retrieval of information patients exhibited a significantly decreased zzso in an executive control network zzso inferior and middle frontal areas, zzso and zzso Present data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia zzso of erroneously retrieved items as well as erroneous retrieval itself is associated with extended zzso abnormalities in zzso regions even after balancing zzso Thus, present results clearly indicate that zzso zzso abnormalities become manifest during dysfunctional executive processing even when the zzso effect of performance is largely zzso
