Unlike zzso radiation therapy, zzso zzso surgery zzso is delivered in a single session for the treatment of brain zzso The extent to which zzso can facilitate early tumor control was the focus of this zzso 

The authors reviewed zzso zzso zzso in 82 patients treated with zzso at the University of Virginia who underwent follow-up MR imaging within 30 days or less of zzso For accurate zzso only tumors measuring zzso zzso or greater in volume were zzso zzso review as well as tumor zzso was performed to assess the zzso response to zzso zzso were characterized as either enlarged zzso zzso volume zzso stable zzso volume zzso zzso of the initial zzso or decreased zzso zzso volume zzso A zzso analysis was performed to determine factors related to each volume outcome zzso 

Within the first month following zzso a decrease was observed in zzso of the zzso zzso reduction varied according to zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso cell lung zzso zzso of breast zzso and zzso of zzso showing volume reduction within 30 days after zzso The mean volume decrease was zzso For the remaining tumors, zzso were stable and zzso increased in zzso The overall analysis showed that there was a significant difference in percentage tumor change according to zzso type zzso zzso zzso There was a trend toward increased tumor reduction in those zzso types that are traditionally viewed as radiation sensitive zzso and zzso cell lung zzso 

zzso zzso surgery can offer patients early substantial volume reduction in many brain zzso In instances in which early volume reduction of limited zzso disease is zzso zzso may be used alone or before whole brain radiation zzso
