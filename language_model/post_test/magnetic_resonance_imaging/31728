The purpose of this study was to describe the appearance of the zzso head of normal, young, small breed dogs, and dogs with avascular necrosis using zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso Images of the zzso heads were obtained in the zzso plane, and included zzso zzso zzso fast zzso fast spin zzso recovery, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery pulse zzso MR imaging features of the zzso zzso heads and zzso included uniform high signal intensity compared with muscle on zzso and zzso zzso There was either uniform enhancement or no enhancement on zzso zzso zzso The MR imaging findings of dogs affected with avascular necrosis differed from those of zzso zzso Typically, the affected dogs had zzso intermediate to zzso intensity within the zzso head and neck compared with muscle on zzso images, zzso enhancement of the zzso head and/or neck on zzso zzso images, and zzso low- to zzso signal intensity within the zzso head and neck on zzso zzso
