This study was designed to evaluate the safety, MR imaging zzso and clinical response to zzso zzso zzso zzso administration in human zzso 

Eleven adult patients were included in this prospective zzso Via zzso zzso a single dose of either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso mixed with 5 zzso of previously removed zzso was slowly injected into the zzso zzso zzso Immediate and delayed MR imaging were subsequently carried out using a zzso zzso 

No patient zzso gross behavioral changes, zzso zzso or seizure zzso The zzso zzso MR zzso revealed disk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso mass formation zzso zzso 1), and zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This pilot study shows the relative safety and feasibility of zzso zzso zzso zzso The potential clinical applications include the evaluation of zzso and communications of the zzso space, spontaneous or traumatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional animal and human studies must be performed to further evaluate the long-term safety and to prove the clinical applications of this procedure in a larger number of zzso
