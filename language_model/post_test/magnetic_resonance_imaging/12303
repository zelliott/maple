The objective of this work was to assess the zzso accuracy of targeted zzso and zzso measures for the detection of zzso zzso in individuals with mild cognitive impairment zzso and to examine the potential benefit of combining both classes of zzso zzso zzso measures included zzso volume, cortical zzso and white matter zzso zzso assessment focused on different aspects of episodic memory zzso familiarity, free recall, and zzso zzso and executive control functions zzso working memory, zzso and zzso Global and regional cortical thinning was observed in zzso patients who progressed to zzso compared to those who remained stable, whereas no differences were found between groups for baseline zzso volume and white matter zzso The strongest zzso zzso were baseline cortical thickness in the right anterior zzso and middle frontal zzso For cognitive zzso we found that deficits in both free recall and recognition episodic memory tasks were highly suggestive of progression to zzso zzso thinning in the right anterior zzso zzso combined to controlled and zzso retrieval deficits, achieved a zzso accuracy of zzso a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of zzso This zzso model including both classes of measures provided more accurate predictions than those based on zzso or cognitive measures zzso Overall, our findings suggest that detecting zzso Alzheimer's disease is probably best accomplished by combining complementary information from targeted zzso and cognitive zzso and highlight the importance of taking into account both structural and functional changes associated with the zzso
