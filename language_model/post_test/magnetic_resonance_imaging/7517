zzso studies in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients can provide clues to the zzso for the development of zzso However, little is known about the zzso of the zzso zzso functional connectivity zzso in siblings, although the zzso hypothesis is prevailing in schizophrenia for zzso In the present study, we used a newly validated zzso zzso connectivity zzso method to identify whether zzso zzso zzso was present in unaffected siblings at increased risk of developing schizophrenia at zzso 

zzso unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 50 zzso zzso and zzso healthy controls underwent a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the zzso 

The sibling group had lower zzso than the control group in the angular zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso No region exhibited higher zzso in the sibling group than in the control zzso There was no significant sex difference of the zzso values between male siblings and female siblings or between male controls and female controls, although evidence has been accumulated that size and shape of the corpus zzso and functional zzso differ between men and zzso 

Our results first suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is disrupted in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients, and add a new clue of abnormal zzso zzso zzso to the zzso for the development of zzso
