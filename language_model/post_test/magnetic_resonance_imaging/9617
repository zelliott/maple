This study further investigates the influence of temporarily zzso the zzso barrier zzso on the level of zzso used in zzso zzso other than the recognized function of allowing that substance to enter into the activated brain regions more effectively during the zzso zzso We injected zzso into zzso rats through zzso following the disruption of zzso with zzso in a functional zzso test of the visual zzso Through comparing zzso signal intensity and zzso contents in the visual zzso of rats received visual stimuli of unequal degree after the restoration of zzso we found that the signal in the visual zzso could be further enhanced on zzso given visual stimulation after the restoration of zzso Temporary zzso disruption has an additional advantage in allowing zzso to enter the zzso or brain for later zzso to the activated brain zzso So the dosage of zzso in zzso zzso could be minimized by extending the zzso
