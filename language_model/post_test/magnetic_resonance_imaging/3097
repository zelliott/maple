In clinical treatment of children with zzso heart disease zzso assessment of right zzso zzso function is zzso Available imaging techniques have been of limited value because of technical factors and the complex geometry of the right zzso To validate magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso of RV function in children, zzso echo MR imaging of both zzso and MR flow mapping of great vessel and zzso flow was performed in 20 children with zzso affecting the right zzso and in 22 healthy children ranging in age from 5 to 16 zzso Close correlation between RV versus zzso stroke volumes zzso zzso zzso and RV stroke volume versus great artery zzso zzso zzso or zzso flow zzso zzso zzso was observed with small zzso and zzso zzso zzso of healthy children were zzso zzso 70 zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso 5 zzso and ejection zzso zzso zzso zzso In the patient groups clinically important differences were zzso We conclude that MR imaging provides accurate zzso zzso of RV function in healthy children and patients with zzso zzso
