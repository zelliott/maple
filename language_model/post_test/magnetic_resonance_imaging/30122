The objective of our study was to zzso review one institution's cases of zzso systemic zzso zzso evaluate possible associated factors, determine the prevalence of zzso and search for zzso in skin samples obtained from patients with zzso 

A retrospective review of our zzso database from 1997 to 2007 was performed to search for patients with zzso The records of patients with zzso were reviewed for factors suspected to be associated with zzso such as zzso low zzso levels, low serum calcium levels, inflammatory conditions, serum zzso pharmaceutical erythropoietin, zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast agents zzso zzso failure, and zzso The biopsy samples from zzso patients and from control subjects were examined with zzso X-ray zzso to detect zzso zzso chart reviews of patients evaluated at our local dialysis center and our dermatology clinic were conducted to identify patients who underwent zzso who had zzso managed exclusively by our zzso referral centers, or both from 1997 to zzso 

Seven cases of zzso were found in the zzso zzso Two of the seven patients were also followed up at our zzso dialysis zzso No other cases of zzso were discovered within the dialysis zzso population exclusively followed within our zzso All seven zzso database zzso patients developed symptoms of zzso after receiving zzso during zzso failure and showed zzso zzso zzso No other proposed risk factors were zzso present in these zzso zzso All four zzso patients with chronic zzso failure developed zzso after zzso with one patient zzso 12 hours after receiving a contrast zzso zzso was the only zzso that all seven zzso patients received before symptom zzso zzso onset was from 3 weeks to 18 months after zzso exposure, with cumulative zzso doses ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso was detected in six of seven zzso patients' skin zzso Seven of eight random control specimens obtained from three healthy control subjects, three patients with zzso zzso who had not been exposed to zzso and two patients without zzso disease who had been exposed to zzso were zzso zzso dialysis clinic patients underwent zzso zzso MR examinations from 1997 to zzso zzso patients received zzso none of whom developed zzso zzso patients received zzso two of whom developed zzso zzso of zzso in patients exposed to zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso likelihood ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine patients received both contrast zzso 

An association with zzso in the development of zzso is suggested in the setting of zzso zzso but other factors seem to play a zzso zzso did not prevent the development of zzso zzso was detected in skin samples from zzso zzso
