This study examined the effect of bovine zzso zzso supplementation on the tissue composition of resistance trained zzso and untrained zzso zzso Using a zzso design, subjects were randomly allocated to 60 g zzso of BC ( zzso or zzso protein zzso ( zzso during 8 weeks of resistance training of the elbow zzso zzso of their zzso arm zzso zzso magnetic resonance images of both upper arms, zzso voluntary zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the one repetition maximum zzso for zzso curls were measured zzso and zzso There were no differences in zzso zzso ( zzso or the volume of training completed by T ( zzso between the two zzso T of BC experienced a significantly greater increase in circumference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso due principally to a greater increase in skin and subcutaneous fat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No tissue compartment changed significantly in zzso of either group ( zzso zzso and zzso increased for T and zzso in both groups ( zzso but the increases were not different between groups ( zzso Since the zzso compartment increased in T but not zzso and fat turnover in zzso is under hormonal control and would not be zzso to one arm, we suggest that the increase in zzso zzso in T of BC may have been due to an increase in skin zzso rather than zzso
