This study was undertaken to compare the in zzso and clinical value of two-dimensional zzso zzso MR zzso zzso with a zzso projection technique using a zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We examined 108 patients with zzso diseases, using zzso zzso and a zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso sequence on a zzso MR unit with a body zzso zzso Two data acquisition techniques were zzso zzso acquisition zzso by maximum intensity projection zzso zzso zzso and zzso projection with a thick slice zzso zzso In the zzso technique, nine zzso slices were obtained with a thickness of 5 zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso In the projection technique, a single slice was obtained with a thickness of 30, 50, or 70 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso ratio zzso between the common zzso duct and the liver as well as zzso of normal structures and diseases were compared for these two acquisition zzso In the zzso technique, source images were also zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso images were used as the gold zzso 

Most of the pancreatic duct and common zzso duct was revealed on zzso and zzso of the projection images, respectively, and on zzso and zzso of the zzso images, respectively, zzso was significantly higher with the zzso technique than with the projection technique zzso zzso zzso With the projection technique, zzso decreased as slice thickness zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso tree were equally well revealed by the two imaging zzso However, abnormalities in the zzso region and anomalies in the zzso tree were more clearly seen on projection images than on zzso images zzso zzso zzso Stones in the common zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso duct were best seen on source images acquired by the zzso technique zzso zzso 

Because of the absence of zzso and the speed of image zzso zzso zzso zzso using the projection technique with a slice thickness of 30 or 50 zzso consistently revealed the zzso tree and zzso region with an acceptable zzso Stones in the zzso duct were best seen on the source images acquired by the zzso zzso
