In a series of 15 patients who underwent early and follow up magnetic resonance imaging following spinal zzso injury, those with focal spinal zzso abnormalities such as zzso zzso or zzso had worse neurological zzso and most developed spinal zzso zzso showing as zzso areas of zzso intensity within the zzso on zzso weighted zzso Patients with zzso zzso initially, had better zzso with the development of residual areas of zzso These observations suggest that patients with focal initial spinal zzso abnormalities may have an increased risk of developing zzso spinal zzso zzso which may be associated with the development of delayed neurological zzso
