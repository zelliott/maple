zzso zzso are able to control symptoms and to detect zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso in controlling zzso growth during long-term treatment and, generally, a low efficacy has been reported in studies using multiple daily zzso zzso In the present study a single daily dose of zzso zzso zzso for 1 year was used in the treatment of 10 patients with progressive zzso zzso zzso 

Ten consecutive patients (3 zzso 7 males age range zzso zzso were studied of whom 4 had zzso syndrome (2 with zzso 3 had a zzso syndrome, and 3 had a zzso zzso zzso All patients, zzso months before zzso treatment, showed zzso zzso In all patients, zzso zzso status was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers were also zzso 

At the three-month control, two patients zzso showed an aggressive progression of zzso growth despite treatment and were excluded from the zzso One patient was lost during zzso Of the 7 remaining patients, imaging evaluation studies revealed, after 1 year of treatment, stable disease in 6 patients, whereas a partial zzso response was observed in one patient zzso zzso zzso markers decreased with respect to zzso values of zzso in these seven patients at the end of zzso 

These results suggest that one year of zzso in a single daily dose zzso zzso is effective in the long-term stabilization of zzso progression in zzso zzso zzso zzso
