This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of zzso tumor regions for zzso zzso assessment and planning by using CT and zzso image data zzso The CT and zzso image data of five patients with solid tumors were fused to construct zzso models of the respective tumor zzso The reconstruction time and image fusion accuracy were measured, and the tumor features and spatial relationships were analyzed to enable zzso zzso assessment and planning as guidance for tumor zzso The zzso models of the tumor regions, including skin, fat, bones, zzso muscles, internal zzso nerves and vessels, were created with a mean reconstruction time of 103 minutes and fusion accuracy of zzso The zzso reconstruction clearly delineated the tumor features, and provided a vivid view of spatial relationships within the tumor zzso Based on this zzso information, the zzso zzso assessment and planning were easily accomplished, and all tumor zzso were performed as planned zzso zzso reconstruction using zzso image fusion is feasible for accurate reproduction of the complex anatomy of the tumor region with high efficiency, and can help surgeons improve the zzso assessment and planning for effective removal of zzso
