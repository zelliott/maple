zzso cognitive impairment during zzso therapy zzso can be a reason to zzso zzso in depressed elderly zzso We hypothesized that both white matter zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso contribute to transient cognitive impairment during zzso 

In 81 elderly patients with depression, magnetic resonance images zzso were recorded before zzso We rated white matter zzso zzso with the zzso White Matter Changes scale zzso zzso impairment during zzso was measured weekly with the Mini Mental State zzso zzso 2 days after each zzso 

The mean zzso score at baseline for all patients was zzso points, the lowest zzso score during zzso was zzso points, and the mean zzso score after zzso was zzso zzso zzso for the zzso method showed no significant difference in the lowest zzso scores of patients with or without zzso receiving unilateral zzso zzso points versus zzso zzso There was a difference in the lowest zzso scores in patients who switched from unilateral zzso to bilateral zzso zzso points in patients with zzso versus zzso points in patients without zzso 

zzso elderly patients with zzso who receive bilateral zzso are at increased risk of transient cognitive zzso Our findings show, however, that cognitive impairment improves when zzso is zzso This implies that zzso does not have to be discontinued when patients experience transient cognitive impairment during zzso
