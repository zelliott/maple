To assess the zzso implications of both the absolute spike frequency over the affected zzso lobe and the relative spike distribution between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso spike zzso for zzso seizure control in a series of consecutive patients with medically zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and zzso evidence of unilateral zzso zzso zzso 

In this study we included 55 patients zzso zzso 29 zzso with medically zzso zzso and unilateral zzso on high resolution zzso who underwent a comprehensive zzso zzso evaluation including prolonged zzso zzso Patients were classified both according to absolute zzso spike frequency and to relative spike distribution between the two zzso zzso as zzso first, we distinguished between patients with frequent spikes zzso zzso over the affected zzso zzso and patients with zzso spikes zzso zzso over the affected zzso zzso Second, we zzso patients in a zzso group zzso of spikes over the affected zzso zzso and a zzso group zzso of spikes over the affected zzso zzso In all patients first-time zzso surgery was performed with a minimum zzso follow-up of 1 zzso 

One year following surgery we found that only 4 of 14 patients zzso in the frequent spikes group remained completely seizure free since surgery compared to 33 of 41 patients zzso in the zzso spikes group zzso zzso zzso Relative spike distribution did not show any significant implication for zzso zzso 

This study identified absolute zzso spike frequency as a strong predictor for surgical outcome, while relative spike distribution had no significant influence on zzso seizure zzso
