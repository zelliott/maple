zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used to zzso the zzso extent of zzso zzso with high spatial zzso The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the use of zzso zzso for characterization of zzso zzso injury in comparison to other imaging methods and its relevance in clinical syndromes related to coronary artery zzso zzso zzso appears zzso compared with normal zzso when zzso by a zzso zzso technique with the use of an zzso zzso sequence after injection of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Experimental and clinical studies indicate that the extent of delayed enhancement is zzso and closely zzso with the size of zzso necrosis or zzso zzso as determined by established in zzso and in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso appears to be more sensitive than other imaging methods in detecting small zzso zzso The zzso extent of delayed enhancement potentially predicts functional outcome after zzso in acute zzso zzso and chronic zzso heart disease, indicating that it can accurately discriminate between zzso and dysfunctional but viable zzso Further experience from clinical trials is needed to understand the association of delayed enhancement with clinical zzso
