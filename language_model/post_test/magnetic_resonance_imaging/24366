To compare the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for identifying liver zzso from neuroendocrine tumor zzso to those of zzso fast zzso zzso and three-dimensional dynamic zzso MR imaging, with surgical and zzso findings as the reference zzso 

This retrospective study was approved by institutional review board, and informed consent was zzso zzso patients with zzso (41 patients with 162 liver zzso and 18 control subjects with no liver zzso underwent MR imaging that included zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso MR zzso Images were zzso reviewed by two abdominal zzso zzso for the detection and characterization of liver zzso MR findings were compared with zzso and zzso zzso findings for zzso on a zzso basis to determine the sensitivity of each MR sequence alone and zzso zzso was calculated by using the control zzso zzso agreement for each MR sequence and zzso test were also zzso 

There was excellent agreement between observers 1 and 2 for characterizing liver zzso at zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso MR was more sensitive zzso 1: sensitivity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso observer zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso 1: sensitivity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observer zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso MR zzso 1: sensitivity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observer zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both, zzso zzso The specificity of these sequences ranged from zzso to zzso zzso MR vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso MR vs dynamic zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR vs dynamic zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging was more sensitive for the detection and characterization of liver zzso from zzso than zzso zzso and dynamic zzso MR imaging and should be systematically zzso
