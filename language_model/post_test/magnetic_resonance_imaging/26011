To correlate the location of stroke with zzso depression zzso and emotional zzso zzso 

The authors zzso studied 148 patients zzso men and 54 women, mean age 62 zzso with single, unilateral stroke zzso zzso and 22 zzso at 2 to 4 months zzso with regard to the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria and zzso Depression zzso and zzso The zzso location was analyzed by CT or zzso 

zzso patients zzso had zzso and 50 zzso had zzso The presence of zzso and zzso was not related to the nature, zzso or size of the zzso The frequency of zzso but not of zzso was higher in women than in men and in zzso rather than zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso were related to motor dysfunction and location zzso versus zzso zzso of the zzso location was a stronger zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso in each location was zzso in frontal lobe of anterior cerebral artery territory, zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cerebral artery territory, zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso area, zzso in thalamus, zzso in zzso base, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not associated with zzso or zzso zzso was more closely associated with zzso strokes than was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Development of zzso and zzso is strongly influenced by zzso location, probably associated with the chemical zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso distribution is similar, zzso is more closely related to zzso strokes than is zzso
