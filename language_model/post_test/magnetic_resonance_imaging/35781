zzso of demonstrated clinical efficacy of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the central nervous zzso 

Information synthesis of studies before January zzso 

Reports were classified by the level of clinical efficacy studied zzso capacity, diagnostic impacts, and therapeutic or patient outcome zzso and were judged by the zzso of their methods, especially avoidance of diagnosis review, test review, and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging probably is superior to zzso zzso for detection and characterization of zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso imaging in multiple zzso detecting zzso in patients with zzso partial seizures, and detailed display for guiding complex therapy, as for brain zzso In other diseases, the efficacy of MR imaging is similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging is less invasive than zzso or intravenous zzso zzso zzso and costs zzso to zzso more than zzso zzso although avoidance of hospital stays may offset some zzso Generally, the quality of MR images probably exceeds that of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, published evidence does not show that the clinical efficacy of MR imaging is generally superior to that of existing imaging zzso such as zzso zzso Only six studies avoided major zzso zzso and lower zzso rates for MR imaging were reported in these studies than reported in multiply biased zzso Few studies of the potential of MR imaging for zzso diagnosis have been zzso 

Use of standards for quality of evidence leads to more conservative conclusions than those of reports describing the clinical potential of MR zzso Some applications of MR imaging were confirmed by rigorous studies, whereas others were not well supported by reports free of zzso zzso If the diagnostic alternative is invasive (for example, zzso and zzso MR imaging is zzso but adequate diagnosis for many conditions zzso zzso simple stroke, and zzso may not require the detail of an MR imaging zzso In general, more rigorous clinical research studies are needed for new technologies such as MR zzso Because the field of MR imaging is changing, review of its clinical efficacy will need to be revised zzso
