The aim of this study was to determine whether rapidly acquired zzso zzso taking less than 5 zzso imaging time, can accurately zzso zzso zzso All patients found to have a zzso zzso zzso on CT or asked to participate in a prospective study using rapidly acquired zzso The zzso technique was performed on a GE zzso zzso Electric, Milwaukee, zzso zzso T magnet using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition into steady state, zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso zzso The results were zzso by two zzso unaware of the CT or ultrasound zzso The zzso was independently viewed by a third zzso zzso were zzso as simple zzso indeterminate or zzso The MR and zzso results were correlated and the sensitivity and specificity of MR for the zzso of simple zzso and solid zzso masses zzso A total of 144 zzso zzso zzso 29 women 39 men, age range zzso years, average age 60 zzso were zzso 111 simple zzso 3 zzso zzso 26 zzso cell zzso and 4 indeterminate zzso on zzso There was agreement between the zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso All zzso cell zzso were correctly zzso on zzso Of simple zzso zzso were correctly identified using this zzso zzso zzso performed in less than 5 zzso can accurately zzso the majority of zzso zzso It is zzso sensitive in the zzso of zzso zzso and it correctly identified approximately zzso of simple zzso If used at the time a zzso mass is detected on zzso it would reduce the need for further investigation of the majority of zzso detected zzso which are simple zzso
