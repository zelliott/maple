Several studies have found zzso of the corpus zzso zzso in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso However, it remains unclear whether zzso zzso is already present in the early stages of zzso and to what extent it may be associated with other structural changes in the brain, such as age-related white matter changes zzso and progression of the zzso 

zzso patients in the early stages of zzso and 50 zzso elderly subjects with varying degrees of zzso were investigated using zzso The zzso was assessed zzso and zzso were rated according to the zzso zzso 

A significant difference in zzso zzso size could be detected between zzso elderly subjects and early stage zzso zzso The sizes of the total zzso zzso body and zzso at baseline were correlated with change from baseline zzso score after a zzso follow-up in zzso zzso There was no association between zzso size and zzso 

The present findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso is present in mild zzso independently of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso may be associated with cognitive zzso
