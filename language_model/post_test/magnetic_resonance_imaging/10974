zzso acquisition of complementary functional zzso zzso reflecting different aspects of brain activity would be a valuable tool for functional zzso studies offering enhanced detection power and improved data zzso As such, a new zzso technique is presented that is able to achieve concurrent acquisition of three zzso images based primarily on the changes of cerebral blood volume, blood flow, and blood zzso respectively, associated with brain zzso Specifically, an inversion recovery pulse sequence has been designed to measure zzso zzso space zzso zzso zzso spin zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals in a single zzso The MR signal characteristics in this sequence were zzso and image parameters were zzso for the simultaneous acquisition of these functional zzso The feasibility and efficacy of the new technique were assessed by brain zzso experiments with visual stimulation zzso zzso on healthy volunteers showed that this technique provided efficient image zzso and thus higher zzso ratio per unit time, compared with conventional techniques collecting these functional images zzso In addition, it was demonstrated that the proposed technique was able to be zzso in zzso functional zzso experiments, with potential advantages of obtaining accurate transient information of the zzso zzso zzso
