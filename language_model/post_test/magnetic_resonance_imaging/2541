zzso speculation in humans zzso zzso zzso 16 (1991) zzso and empirical findings in animals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 (1991) zzso suggest that testosterone zzso may play a significant role in the development of the corpus zzso zzso However, there are currently no empirical studies directly relating T zzso to zzso zzso in zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between free T zzso as determined by zzso and the zzso area of the corpus zzso as determined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were 68 young adult zzso zzso zzso normal, right-handed zzso All subjects underwent zzso and provided two samples of saliva for zzso of T and zzso zzso regions of interest included total brain volume, left and right zzso volume and regional areas of the zzso zzso regions were defined using two different measurement techniques, each dividing the zzso into six zzso zzso zzso were performed blind with respect to the hormone levels of zzso A significant positive correlation between T concentration and zzso area of the zzso body of the zzso was zzso This finding was consistent across the two measurement techniques and was not attributable to individual differences in total brain zzso All correlations between cortisol and zzso zzso were zzso The results of this study are consistent with the notion that zzso at an earlier stage in development, may play a significant role in modulating zzso architecture in zzso
