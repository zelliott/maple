We designed and zzso a novel contrast agent zzso to image the activity of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso We exploited the concept of zzso zzso in the design of a zzso CA zzso referred to as zzso This zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was attached to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso sequence via a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the CA depends on the presence of a zzso zzso chain zzso on the zzso of the zzso Upon zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso the zzso chain is detached from the CA, which becomes less water zzso This compound and control compounds were successfully tested in an animal model bearing two tumors with different levels of zzso zzso
