zzso a rich and continuous visual experience requires computing specific details across views as well as zzso similarities across zzso In this paper, we report functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso evidence that these distinct zzso may occur in two zzso regions in the brain, the zzso place area zzso and zzso zzso zzso Participants saw different snapshot views from panoramic scenes, which represented clearly different views, but appeared to come from the same zzso Using zzso adaptation, we tested whether the zzso and zzso treated these panoramic views as the same or zzso In the panoramic condition, three different views from a single panoramic scene were zzso We did not find any zzso for panoramic repeats in the zzso showing zzso In contrast, zzso showed significant zzso for the panoramic condition, showing zzso However, when the panoramic views were not presented in a continuous way, both the specificity in the zzso and the integration in zzso were zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso and zzso zzso different properties of zzso the zzso focuses on selective discrimination of different views while zzso focuses on the integration of scenes under the same visual zzso These complementary functions of the zzso and zzso enable both specific and zzso representations of scenes across several zzso
