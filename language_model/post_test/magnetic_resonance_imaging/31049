Using zzso zzso we evaluated the cerebral regions relating to second pain perception ascending through zzso and investigated the effect of distraction on each zzso 

Thirteen normal subjects participated in this zzso CO2 laser zzso were delivered to the zzso of the left hand to selectively activate zzso The zzso responses were analyzed using a zzso zzso 

zzso primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso were the main generators for the primary zzso zzso whose mean peak zzso was zzso zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso area zzso were also activated for the subsequent zzso zzso whose mean peak zzso was zzso zzso During a mental calculation task zzso all 6 sources were significantly reduced in zzso but the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more sensitive than the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We confirmed that zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in bilateral zzso play a major role in second pain perception, and all sites were much affected by a change of attention, indicating that these regions are related to the cognitive aspect of second pain zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were activated during the zzso zzso response, and responses in these regions were significantly diminished during mental zzso
