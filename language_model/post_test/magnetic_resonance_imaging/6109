zzso impulse control has been implicated in the shaping of habitual alcohol use and eventual alcohol zzso We sought to identify the neural zzso of altered impulse control in 24 zzso patients with alcohol dependence zzso as compared to 24 demographics matched healthy control subjects zzso In particular, we examined the processes of risk taking and cognitive control as the neural zzso of alcohol zzso 

To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was conducted during a stop signal task zzso in which a procedure was used to elicit errors in the zzso The paradigm allowed zzso evaluation of response zzso error processing, and zzso behavioral zzso Furthermore, by imposing on the subjects to be both fast and accurate, the zzso also introduced a distinct element of risk, which participants may or may not avert during the zzso Brain imaging data were analyzed with zzso zzso zzso in zzso analyses accounting for group disparity in general zzso 

The results showed that, compared to zzso zzso demonstrated longer go trial reaction time zzso and higher stop success rate zzso HC and zzso were indistinguishable in stop signal reaction time zzso and zzso slowing zzso In a zzso analysis accounting for go trial zzso and zzso HC showed greater activity in the left zzso prefrontal zzso than zzso when subjects with short and long zzso were zzso By comparing zzso and HC directly during stop errors zzso as contrasted with zzso we observed greater activity in zzso in bilateral visual and frontal zzso Compared to zzso zzso showed less zzso of the right zzso prefrontal zzso during zzso an index of zzso behavioral zzso Furthermore, zzso who showed higher alcohol urge at the time of the zzso were particularly impaired in zzso prefrontal zzso as compared to those with lower alcohol zzso Finally, compared to HC subjects, zzso showed less activity in cortical and zzso structures including zzso zzso and zzso during risk-taking decisions in the zzso 

These preliminary results provided evidence for altered neural processing during impulse control in zzso These findings may provide a useful neural signature in the evaluation of treatment outcomes and development of novel zzso for alcohol zzso
