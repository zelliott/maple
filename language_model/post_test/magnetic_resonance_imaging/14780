The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that jaw zzso zzso zzso and low-level long-lasting zzso zzso zzso of neck muscles in the zzso zzso 

Ten healthy subjects developed various zzso zzso bite forces in different zzso directions in zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscles was zzso For zzso of zzso data, zzso tasks of the neck muscles were zzso 

zzso of the zzso neck muscles varied between zzso and zzso of their maximum voluntary zzso Different bite forces and zzso directions resulted in significant zzso activity differences between the zzso levels of the neck zzso In addition, zzso of specific neck muscles, provoked by the jaw zzso tasks, was zzso 

This study demonstrated for the first time moderate zzso of jaw and neck muscles in the zzso position under controlled zzso jaw zzso zzso zzso of most neck muscles was observed, zzso zzso episodes and indicating an additional zzso interaction between the two muscle zzso
