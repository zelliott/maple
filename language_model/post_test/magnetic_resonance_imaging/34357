To ensure patients' safety, the mechanical strength of zzso zzso zzso techniques and implants zzso titanium zzso and new zzso titanium zzso had to be zzso 

With zzso zzso skulls for each zzso technique, zzso tests were performed by applying an external force until an impression depth of the zzso zzso of 2 zzso was reached and the results were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were revealed to be the strongest fixation devices, although with zzso the plastic deformation started from the beginning of load application, whereas zzso additionally provided a better zzso reserve and a higher zzso of fixation strength not dependent on bone thickness and zzso zzso fixed by zzso were zzso from the zzso 

Although zzso offers distinct advantages over zzso both proved to be definitely superior to zzso which is still used in many zzso zzso whether zzso can still be regarded as a state-of-the-art technique must be zzso
