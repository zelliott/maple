zzso studies have consistently implicated zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso however, recent work also emphasizes more diffuse patterns of brain zzso as occurring in this zzso The goal of this study was to extend such observations by investigating large-scale brain functional network zzso of zzso performance in zzso zzso 

We combined zzso with a validated task of cognitive control and a zzso statistical method to assess multiple functional networks encompassing broad zzso cortical regions in zzso patients and matched zzso zzso networks of interest were targeted a zzso and the groups were compared in terms of the zzso profile of network responses zzso zzso during the task performance in a zzso zzso 

Task performance was equivalent in both groups and each distinct network demonstrated strong overlap in its general response during zzso However, significant differences in functional connectivity were also observed between groups that appeared driven by specific zzso of task zzso Such differences were most pronounced during zzso transitions and mainly involved zzso anterior zzso and insular zzso within the zzso zzso Relative heightened functional connectivity of zzso in patients during task correlated with a measure of patients' state zzso 

Our findings provide a novel functional imaging characterization of brain network zzso associated with zzso in zzso Additionally, these findings raise questions about the role of patients' zzso states on the performance of cognitive imaging tasks that are otherwise assumed to be emotionally zzso
