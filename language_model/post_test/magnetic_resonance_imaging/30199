zzso studies in primates have shown that, in addition to the primary motor zzso zzso zzso areas are a source of zzso zzso The function of these putative zzso zzso tracts in humans is still zzso We found frontal zzso motor areas zzso which react to targeted zzso magnetic zzso and activate peripheral muscles as fast as or even faster than those in zzso Hand muscle movements were observed in all our subjects about 20 zzso after zzso stimulation of the superior frontal zzso zzso areas 6 and zzso zzso of zzso could activate both zzso and zzso upper limb muscles with the same delay as a stimulation of the zzso indicating zzso motor representations with direct functional connections to the zzso We suggest that these zzso cortical motor representations provide additional capacity for the fast execution of zzso Such a capacity may play a role in motor learning and in recovery from motor zzso
