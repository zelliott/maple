The structure and composition of zzso zzso plaques are associated with the risk of future cardiovascular zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging may allow accurate zzso and characterization of zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso MR method, free of motion and blood flow artifacts, for zzso imaging of the zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed on a clinical MR system in 10 patients with zzso plaques identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extent, and size were assessed from zzso zzso zzso and zzso weighted zzso zzso of 25 matched MR and zzso zzso zzso plaque images showed a strong correlation for plaque composition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overall zzso zzso zzso 25) and mean maximum plaque thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25; zzso zzso by MR and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso plaque extent as assessed by zzso and MR was also statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overall zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso MR evaluation of the zzso compares well with zzso imaging for the assessment of zzso plaque zzso extent, and zzso This MR method may prove useful for the in zzso study of zzso zzso
