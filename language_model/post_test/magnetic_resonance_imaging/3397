To evaluate the long-term zzso and clinical results of anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction by comparing the injured knee with the zzso knee in athletes with isolated zzso tear returning to zzso zzso 

zzso patients with isolated zzso tears without zzso injuries at baseline returning to previous sports were zzso zzso reconstruction was performed with zzso or hamstring zzso zzso Conventional zzso and a zzso magnetic resonance imaging study of both knees were obtained at a mean follow-up of 10 years after zzso reconstruction and were compared with each zzso The International zzso Documentation Committee score and zzso activity index were used for clinical evaluation and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for evaluating zzso knee zzso 

The zzso magnetic resonance imaging study showed positive signs of zzso in zzso of operated knees and zzso of zzso knees zzso zzso zzso Conventional zzso showed ongoing signs of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso knees according to zzso and Lawrence, in comparison with zzso of injured knees zzso zzso zzso The functional outcomes between the injured knee and zzso knee did not show any statistical zzso The mean zzso International zzso Documentation Committee score was zzso zzso zzso points, and the total zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The median zzso zzso score was 8 zzso 2, corresponding to 7 zzso 2 at zzso In zzso of patients, the zzso score was unchanged from zzso to zzso 

Athletes with an isolated zzso zzso showed no increased risk of the development of post-traumatic zzso in the long-term after zzso replacement when compared with the zzso zzso zzso Our findings support the evidence to perform zzso replacement in zzso 

Level IV, therapeutic case zzso
