We studied the cardiac zzso and dysfunction in 8 patients with zzso zzso muscular zzso by zzso zzso and zzso gated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso Two of the 8 zzso patients revealed elevated P waves and 3 of these patients revealed zzso zzso premature zzso zzso on zzso as reported zzso On zzso zzso the flattened zzso with zzso shifted zzso restricted the right zzso zzso On the other hand, the right atrium is often zzso It is known that the patients suffering from severe zzso zzso or zzso back zzso often develop similar zzso abnormalities and right zzso dysfunction resulting from restricted right zzso zzso Although a possibility that the abnormal P waves or zzso zzso frequently observed in zzso are caused by zzso zzso selectively occurring in right atrium remains to be zzso the characteristic zzso zzso may play a primary role in the development of cardiac problems in this zzso muscular zzso
