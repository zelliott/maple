zzso zzso of the knee has been reported in the past decade but the zzso remains zzso Some investigators have indicated that bone zzso signal changes evident on magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be early warning signs of zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso rate, location, and magnitude of such changes in bone zzso of the knee after zzso zzso using zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with no bone zzso signal abnormalities on zzso zzso were examined after isolated zzso zzso There were 51 men and 42 women with an age range of 11 to 62 years zzso zzso zzso Of the total, 57 patients underwent partial zzso zzso zzso and 23 zzso and the others total zzso (10 zzso and 26 zzso zzso examinations were performed independently of zzso knee symptoms, 1 to 24 months after zzso Bone zzso changes of the treated knees were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of 93 patients zzso had bone zzso signal changes in zzso or zzso zzso shown on zzso zzso No patients had these changes in the zzso or zzso zzso opposite from the zzso side and, in the majority of cases, the size was less than half that of the zzso Fifteen of the 44 patients who underwent zzso zzso and 17 of the 49 patients who underwent lateral zzso had such zzso The zzso side did not affect the zzso rate, and frequently both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Age, gender and zzso cartilage condition at the surgery were not risk zzso In contrast, the extent of zzso affected the zzso zzso 

This study suggests a positive correlation between zzso zzso and zzso bone zzso signal changes of the zzso
