zzso zzso in 3 genes have been found in familial cases of cerebral cavernous zzso zzso We previously discovered zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso supporting the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso formation in a single zzso The purpose of this study was to screen for zzso zzso zzso in 3 more zzso from different patients and identify the cell zzso in which zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were sought in DNA from 3 surgically zzso zzso zzso zzso by cloning and screening zzso chain reaction products generated from zzso or zzso coding zzso zzso capture zzso was used on isolated zzso and zzso cells to determine whether zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso harbor zzso and zzso zzso zzso on different zzso and are therefore zzso Both zzso are predicted to zzso the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and previously identified 34 zzso zzso in zzso from 2 different patients were found only in the vascular zzso cells lining zzso No obvious zzso zzso were identified in the 2 other zzso however, the results were inconclusive, possibly zzso to the technical limitations or the fact that these specimens had a small proportion of vascular zzso cells lining pristine zzso 

The zzso mechanism occurs in vascular zzso cells lining zzso zzso from 2 patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso detection should focus on vascular zzso cells lining pristine zzso
