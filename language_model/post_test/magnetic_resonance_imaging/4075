Target detection is the process of bringing a salient stimulus into conscious zzso Target detection evokes a prominent zzso potential zzso component zzso in the electroencephalogram zzso We combined the high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with the high zzso resolution of zzso to investigate the neural generators of the zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso averaging of zzso and zzso respectively, recorded using the same paradigm in the same zzso Target detection zzso significantly greater zzso zzso in the zzso cortex, zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso of zzso based on zzso locations derived from the zzso indicated that bilateral sources in the zzso zzso are the main generators of the zzso The findings provide zzso zzso and zzso evidence for significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso after stimulus onset during target zzso The methods developed here provide a novel zzso zzso technique to investigate the zzso aspects of processes underlying brain zzso
