We present a rare case of a probably zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in a young woman with a zzso and zzso zzso We also compare our case with data reported in tables that include all cases of zzso zzso zzso present in zzso 

zzso women presented with zzso We reviewed zzso and clinical literature before zzso It was possible to perform a zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso of the zzso so it was possible to adopt a minimally invasive surgical approach on the zzso The diagnosis of zzso zzso of the zzso was confirmed after the zzso As the patient was zzso we did not operate on the zzso zzso which was stable after 1 zzso 

We draw the conclusion that it is possible to obtain a correct zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso based on magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso this makes it possible to avoid major surgical zzso The reported case is particularly interesting because apart from the zzso zzso zzso a zzso involvement of the same type can be zzso this association has never been reported in zzso
