zzso zzso is one of a large group of human cortical zzso that collectively account for a significant percentage of patients with zzso zzso neurological deficits, and intellectual zzso zzso is characterized by an excess of small zzso and abnormal cortical zzso The most common distribution is zzso symmetrical, and zzso in the region surrounding the zzso zzso and is known as zzso zzso zzso zzso Most cases are zzso although several families have been observed with multiple affected members, usually following an zzso inheritance zzso Here we report the first genetic locus for zzso mapped by linkage analysis in five zzso zzso places the critical region for zzso at zzso zzso score zzso in zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso We suggest that this region contains a gene that is necessary for correct zzso organization and that the identification of this gene will both enhance our understanding of normal cortical development and accelerate the identification of other genes responsible for zzso
