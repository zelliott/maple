zzso assessment of zzso cartilage using magnetic resonance imaging zzso has gained popularity in the diagnosis of zzso zzso a condition that affects 20 million zzso zzso cartilage zzso a zzso found in roughly zzso of the zzso population, currently can only be evaluated with confidence using minimally invasive zzso This article presents a zzso procedure using zzso to zzso focal cartilage zzso and aims to support clinical practices of diagnosis and monitoring of zzso zzso Upon a local zzso search for identifying focal zzso the proposed zzso peak method outlines zzso boundaries and then generates zzso properties, such as zzso volume and zzso zzso The procedure was evaluated using simulated and in zzso zzso First, a simulated zzso was created and zzso and the results were compared with the exact zzso Second, an in zzso evaluation was carried out on seven human knees in which nine focal zzso were identified and zzso Three of the subjects had follow-up zzso at either 1 or 2 zzso Finally, in an attempt to characterize local zzso changes underlying focal zzso zzso zzso values of defective cartilage within the zzso boundaries were examined and compared with the values of adjacent cartilage zzso
