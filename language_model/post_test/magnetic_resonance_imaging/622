The aim of this study was to analyze the type and frequency of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging anomalies in patients with idiopathic growth hormone zzso and also to investigate the possible relationship between zzso images and the presence of isolated growth hormone or multiple zzso hormone zzso 

zzso resonance and zzso zzso images were obtained for 37 patients with idiopathic growth hormone zzso The patients were divided into two groups: patients with isolated growth hormone zzso zzso and patients with multiple zzso hormone deficiencies zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was normal in 25 zzso and abnormal in 12 zzso zzso We observed empty zzso in zzso partially empty zzso in zzso and anterior zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies revealed normal findings in the zzso area in 17 zzso and abnormal in 20 zzso zzso We did not observed differences in the frequency of zzso zzso zzso when groups A and B were compared zzso zzso zzso With magnetic resonance imaging we observed, empty zzso in zzso partially empty zzso in zzso and anterior zzso zzso in zzso zzso Among those patients whose magnetic resonance images were altered, the zzso lobe of the zzso zzso was identified in an abnormal position in zzso and the zzso stalk was thin or interrupted in zzso The patients from group B presented a higher frequency of magnetic resonance imaging anomalies zzso when compared to group A zzso p zzso zzso There was disagreement between the two methods in zzso of cases, but we didn't observe a difference in the frequency of zzso when zzso zzso was compared with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso 

The most frequent defects observed using magnetic resonance imaging are anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso zzso with other magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities can suggest the presence of multiple anterior zzso zzso
