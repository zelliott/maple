zzso transplantation is the generally preferred medical procedure of treatment for patients with zzso organ zzso The zzso reaction of rejection is a major cause of functional failure in transplant zzso The current zzso zzso for detecting or confirming graft rejection following solid organ transplantation requires biopsy samples in order to detect immune cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the graft and other pathological zzso This procedure is not only zzso having associated risks, but is also prone to sampling errors that can yield false negative zzso To circumvent the need for zzso we are developing magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques to monitor the zzso of immune cells at the transplanted organ as a means to detect graft zzso By labeling immune cells with an zzso contrast agent, zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso we can monitor the zzso of these labeled immune cells at the rejecting graft as a zzso method to detect graft zzso zzso can be labeled ex zzso and then infused into the animal, or zzso contrast agents can be introduced directly into the animal in zzso Our results show excellent correlation among the zzso signal intensity due to the zzso zzso at the rejecting zzso zzso for zzso zzso for graft zzso and the iron zzso of tissue zzso In this article, we shall give a summary of our progress from detecting single immune cells in zzso to monitoring the zzso of immune cells in zzso at the transplanted zzso hearts, and lungs in our rat models for organ transplantation by zzso
