To examine diagnostic accuracy of zzso and qualitative magnetic resonance zzso criteria in common zzso nerve zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained with a waiver of informed consent for this Health Insurance zzso and Accountability zzso retrospective zzso A review of 28 knees in 28 subjects (12 males and 16 zzso age range, zzso years; mean zzso age, 42 zzso zzso who had undergone magnetic resonance zzso of the knee was zzso Thirteen patients who had a final diagnosis of zzso were classified as cases, and 15 patients who lacked a final diagnosis of zzso zzso were classified as zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso including nerve zzso signal intensity, nerve size, nerve course, zzso zzso regional muscle zzso and fatty zzso and an overall assessment of the zzso as being normal or abnormal were evaluated by 2 independent zzso blinded to the clinical zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and accuracy compared against our reference standards were expressed as zzso zzso agreements were assessed using linear weighted zzso zzso 

Common zzso nerve zzso signal zzso had the highest sensitivity zzso in identifying zzso zzso Except for zzso signal zzso overall specificity for the nerve zzso parameters and muscle zzso change assessed was fairly high, ranging from zzso to zzso The consensus accuracy ranged from zzso to zzso for the zzso characteristics zzso The zzso zzso was very good zzso zzso zzso to zzso for assessment of regional muscle zzso changes and moderate zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance zzso is a useful zzso in supplementing the diagnosis of zzso Using zzso zzso criteria helps zzso the zzso criteria of zzso zzso zzso
