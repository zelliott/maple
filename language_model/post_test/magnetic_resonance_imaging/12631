zzso variation in zzso 1 zzso gene region zzso by zzso zzso exhibits a linkage with cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia and healthy zzso Language production deficits are core features of schizophrenia with more impairment in semantic than zzso verbal zzso zzso We investigated the link between brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso during semantic verbal zzso task in a German healthy zzso 46 healthy subjects zzso for zzso zzso status were divided in zzso zzso carriers zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of semantic verbal zzso were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso right zzso brain zzso in anterior zzso zzso zzso 24), superior zzso 22, zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the carriers compared to zzso Brain zzso occurred in the absence of task performance zzso No significant correlations were found between personality traits and brain zzso zzso The results point to an influence of genetic variation in zzso gene region zzso by zzso zzso on neural zzso of language zzso zzso may exhibit higher processing efforts to reach the same zzso performance as zzso as reflected in zzso of zzso zzso
