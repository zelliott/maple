To determine the accuracy of several magnetic resonance imaging zzso strategies for assessment of zzso muscle volume zzso and changes in zzso with zzso 

Images were acquired along the length of both zzso from young zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and older zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 24) men and women before and after strength zzso The zzso zzso area zzso of each section was measured before and after zzso zzso was directly assessed using all of the sections (each zzso thick with a zzso zzso Alternative estimates of zzso were calculated using increasingly greater intervals between zzso every zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso The zzso limits of agreement zzso zzso 2 zzso between each alternative measure and the criterion measure zzso were determined with zzso and Altman zzso zzso was used to predict zzso from zzso and to obtain the standard error of the estimate zzso 

Before training, the zzso zzso with zzso for the alternative measures ranged from zzso to zzso of zzso and the prediction of zzso from zzso yielded a SEE zzso 2 of zzso of zzso For change in the alternative measures, the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso of the total change in zzso and the prediction of zzso from zzso yielded a SEE zzso 2 of zzso of the change in zzso 

Increasingly greater intervals between zzso zzso sections result in substantially reduced agreement with a criterion measure of zzso The use of one zzso section results in relatively higher error and thus should be used only when large effect sizes are zzso
