To evaluate the accuracy of zzso ultrasound and MR imaging in rotator cuff zzso 

40 patients suffering from zzso zzso syndrome for at least three months and who were selected for surgery, underwent zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso Patient zzso focused on partial and small complete zzso 

zzso surgically confirmed tears were partial tears zzso surface: 10, zzso surface: 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso ultrasound and MR imaging yield a sensitivity for complete tears of zzso zzso and zzso with a specificity of zzso zzso and zzso For partial tears sensitivity was zzso zzso and zzso with a specificity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso evaluation of zzso extent and correct zzso ultrasound was correct in zzso cases, MR in zzso zzso 

zzso is not helpful in detecting partial zzso zzso and MR imaging yield comparable zzso MR imaging has advantages concerning better evaluation of extent, location and zzso as well as for the detection of associated zzso
