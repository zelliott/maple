The aim of the study was to assess the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or pure oxygen breathing on zzso zzso measured by blood zzso level dependent zzso magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso Seven healthy young volunteers zzso age 25, range zzso zzso participated in the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was implemented on a zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso angle 20 degrees ) with an acquisition time of approximately zzso zzso A total of 100 images were acquired during 22 zzso A block design was applied for gas administration: 4 zzso room air, 4 zzso zzso 4 zzso room air, 4 zzso zzso and 6 zzso room zzso A compartment model was fitted to the data sets accounting for zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as baseline changes of the zzso zzso images showed good image quality without notable zzso or zzso Mean relative signal increase due to zzso breathing was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso in the right kidney and zzso zzso in the left zzso while oxygen breathing led to a signal enhancement of zzso zzso in the right kidney and zzso zzso in the left zzso No statistical difference was found between zzso and oxygen breathing or between the zzso of the right and the left zzso A significant difference was found in the characteristic time constant for the signal increase with a faster zzso taking place for oxygen zzso Renal tissue zzso is clearly influenced by zzso or oxygen zzso The changes can be assessed by zzso zzso at high field zzso The effects are in the expected range for the zzso effect of zzso at zzso zzso The proposed technique might be interesting for the assessment of zzso tissue zzso and its regulation in patients with kidney zzso
