The purpose of this study was to zzso investigate the image quality of zzso zzso recovery zzso coronary wall imaging in healthy subjects and in subjects with known coronary artery disease zzso and to zzso investigate the zzso of zzso at zzso in the assessment of coronary artery zzso in subjects with zzso but variable degrees of zzso 

A total of 37 subjects participated in this institutional review zzso and zzso zzso These included 21 subjects with known zzso as identified on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sixteen healthy subjects without known history of zzso were zzso All subjects were scanned using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the assessment of coronary wall thickness at zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso and quantitative vessel parameters including zzso area and wall thickness were zzso zzso analyses were zzso 

zzso was successfully completed in zzso of patients and in zzso of the healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso images, significantly improved zzso zzso in healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso and in patients zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in image zzso and zzso between zzso In zzso segments free of zzso coronary wall was thicker in patients in comparison to healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without a change in zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of successfully obtaining vessel wall images at zzso using zzso in zzso patients with known variable degrees of zzso as detected by zzso This was achieved with a fixed zzso planning of blood signal zzso With that limitation zzso zzso coronary wall zzso is capable of detecting zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso at zzso in zzso zzso
