This study had three general zzso First, it examined possible visual consequences of frontal zzso A patient with focal damage to the zzso regions of the left frontal zzso and a small amount of damage near zzso area, was predicted to have impaired brain function in zzso regions that are zzso connected to the damaged zzso Second, it showed the utility of using zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize zzso zzso PET revealed reduced metabolism in zzso cortical zzso that are zzso by fibers from the damaged zzso Some of the affected areas are hypothesized to be involved in visual functions, specifically the zzso of lines and zzso Third, a series of tests was designed to document that the patient had difficulty zzso visual zzso and then to distinguish among alternative possible causes of this zzso The results suggested that the patient zzso shapes as sets of filled locations if possible, which allowed him to use intact processes zzso by brain areas that were not affected by the zzso The data were best explained if the zzso slowed processing in the zzso system (which encodes object zzso allowing the zzso system (which encodes spatial zzso to produce a response more quickly than the zzso zzso
