To compare the value of fast zzso zzso zzso with zzso fast zzso MR imaging in the detection of acquired zzso virus zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso human zzso virus zzso patients were examined with both sequences on either a zzso or a zzso MR zzso The number, size, location, and zzso of the zzso were evaluated by two independent zzso zzso ratios between zzso and normal zzso fluid were determined, and zzso ratios were zzso 

zzso was found to be superior to zzso fast zzso in detection of small zzso and of zzso located in zzso regions and deep white zzso The two techniques were equal in zzso of zzso larger than 2 zzso and for zzso located in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 24 patients, more zzso were detected with the zzso fast zzso zzso zzso fluid contrast ratios and zzso ratios were significantly higher for the zzso fast zzso sequences than for the zzso fast zzso zzso 

zzso allows early detection of small zzso in zzso and cortical locations, especially in zzso zzso Because of its improved zzso detection rate and greater overall zzso zzso we believe zzso is useful in the evaluation of subtle changes in the brains of AIDS patients with central nervous system disease, and could even replace the zzso fast zzso zzso
