zzso signs in zzso spinal disease seems to be rarely zzso To our knowledge, only six cases which caused zzso zzso due to upper zzso zzso have been zzso We zzso reviewed patients with similar signs in our center, and we discussed the zzso of such interesting neurological signs depending on our own and reported zzso 

Between January, 2005 and August, 2010, zzso patients with zzso degenerative disease underwent spinal zzso surgery, 3 of which zzso presented with zzso zzso due to upper zzso zzso in zzso spinal zzso 

As pathological mechanisms, 2 hypotheses are zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level or circulatory zzso at the nerve root zzso If the level of the zzso zzso is situated at the lower zzso level, such as zzso level, a zzso zzso at the zzso level, for example zzso disc zzso can compress the zzso nerve root resulting in zzso nerve zzso However, the affected level below the zzso zzso doesn't seem to compress only the zzso nerve root directly, because the zzso zzso is mobile enough to avoid the zzso Another speculated mechanism is the so-called circulatory zzso When the zzso zzso is remarkably compressed at the upper level, less severe zzso change may cause selective zzso at the lower zzso zzso Based upon the presented zzso we adopt the circulatory mechanism in our cases as the zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso
