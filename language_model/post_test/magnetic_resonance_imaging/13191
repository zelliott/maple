zzso relaxation time is a promising zzso zzso for the early diagnosis and follow-up of zzso Assessing the evolution of zzso needs exact comparison of zzso acquired at different times and knowledge of the zzso zzso The aims of this work were to establish a method for zzso comparison of zzso zzso and to assess zzso zzso zzso in healthy zzso zzso 

A new rigid zzso zzso was zzso The precision of the registration zzso was calculated with zzso simulations and in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was assessed in six volunteers measured at seven different zzso The zzso zzso was characterized with the zzso of variation zzso of zzso and its regional variations were zzso 

The registration zzso showed an average registration precision lower than zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a median zzso of zzso zzso showed significant regional zzso zzso zzso zzso were found near the zzso zzso The central regions showed the lowest zzso zzso and the lateral regions intermediate zzso zzso 

Using a rigid zzso zzso provides zzso zzso zzso errors comparable to former, zzso zzso approaches, thus opening the possibility of zzso monitoring of cartilage degradation in zzso
