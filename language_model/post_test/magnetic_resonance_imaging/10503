zzso zzso zzso to zzso is a key zzso in determining the severity of zzso impairment in patients with major cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can measure the cerebral blood volume zzso as an indicator of zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso was compared with zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Twelve normal subjects and 17 patients with major cerebral artery zzso disease underwent zzso zzso and zzso The images were zzso with zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were generated using the indicator dilution method with zzso input zzso One large cortical region of interest for each unilateral middle cerebral artery territory was determined on each zzso zzso was calculated by measuring cerebral blood flow before and after zzso zzso 

A significant negative correlation was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher than the mean zzso zzso obtained in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso was defined as elevated and zzso lower than the mean zzso zzso obtained in normal subjects zzso was defined as zzso Assuming the zzso as the true zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso provided zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso with zzso positive zzso value for detecting patients with reduced zzso 

The zzso zzso method can simply and accurately identify patients with zzso impairment without exposure to zzso zzso
