A phantom design method suitable for zzso zzso based on the zzso field wave characteristics of sample and experimental zzso at zzso T and zzso T are zzso The zzso field distribution in a phantom with a given zzso zzso system is primarily determined by the sample size relative to the wavelength inside the sample, and the ratio between the displacement and zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the MR image intensity patterns associated with wave behavior in human samples at a given field strength can be reproduced with a phantom at the same or different field strengths once the dimension and penetration constant are scaled by the corresponding wavelength in the sample zzso
