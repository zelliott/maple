In large-scale neural networks in the brain the emergence of global behavioral patterns, zzso by zzso activity, is driven by the zzso of local zzso groups into zzso functioning zzso However, the laws governing such zzso and its zzso in particular zzso seizures, are poorly zzso Here we use a zzso population network model to describe a state of baseline zzso activity and the transition from the baseline state to rhythmic zzso zzso We describe principles which explain how this rhythmic activity arises in the form of zzso uniform zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show how the rate of migration of the leading edge of the zzso zzso can be theoretically predicted, and compare the accuracy of this prediction with that measured zzso using zzso zzso recordings obtained from a human subject experiencing zzso zzso The comparison shows that the zzso measured rate of migration of the leading edge of zzso zzso is within the theoretically predicted range of zzso Computer simulations have been performed to investigate the interactions between different regions of the brain and to show how organization in one spatial region can promote or inhibit organization in zzso Our theoretical predictions are also consistent with the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in particular with observations that zzso zzso zzso rhythms zzso larger areas of the brain than zzso zzso These findings advance the understanding of functional behavior of interconnected populations and might have implications for the analysis of diverse classes of zzso
