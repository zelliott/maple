We have used magnetic resonance imaging in addition to the other imaging techniques for the examination of 31 patients with traumatic upper limb zzso The therapeutic indications of traumatic zzso zzso paralysis depend on the early and precise assessment of the zzso zzso zzso with a contrast injection at a zzso level zzso the zzso spaces provides a zzso study of the canal, spine and nerve roots and of zzso zzso In our experience, the diagnostic reliability for the detection of zzso zzso zzso is zzso A study in all 3 spatial planes is possible with zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso echo zzso The reliability of the technique for the diagnosis of zzso in the detection of nerve root zzso is similar to that of CT zzso The excellent spatial resolution and natural high contrast allow following the nerve roots in their zzso course and determining the site of nerve trunk zzso zzso The use of zzso and zzso sections should yet improve these zzso These first results lead us to proposing magnetic resonance imaging for the exploration of traumatic zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso more precise and more complete assessment of the zzso certainly has a significant influence on therapeutic zzso
