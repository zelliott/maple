We report the preliminary results of a zzso trial aimed at defining methods, reference values and frequency of zzso for an MR quality assurance zzso In particular, we stress the definition of two attention levels zzso and zzso for image uniformity and zzso ratio zzso by means of zzso and long-term zzso 

The short-term protocol consisted of 10 successive zzso zzso 2 zzso acquisitions and was repeated after 24 zzso zzso were made with the same test phantom which was circulated among all the participating zzso Image uniformity and zzso were evaluated using the software available on each MR zzso The long-term zzso consisting of a single zzso acquisition with the same parameters used for the short-term one, was performed once a month for 12 zzso A mid term protocol was also performed twice a week for 5 weeks, and the analysis of the results is still in zzso 

The short-term protocol results allowed absolute comparison of system zzso zzso and zzso were significantly different among centers zzso zzso zzso also in the statistical comparison of two MR units of the same model zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, three zzso T systems provided similar zzso values, while the results obtained for the 1 T system were markedly lower zzso of the zzso This result can be explained by the dependence of the zzso expression of zzso on the magnetic zzso The other zzso T system performed more poorly than the others operating at the same magnetic zzso This difference can be explained by the specific characteristics of the zzso and by technological zzso Because of the small sample size (5 zzso the maximum variation zzso zzso for the first echo and zzso for the second one) were assumed as a reference value for the both parameters zzso and zzso These values were used for the long-term analysis: at every measurement the evaluated zzso was statistically compared with the result of the previous zzso We propose to set an investigation level at p zzso zzso when the newly measured zzso differs from the previous value zzso zzso zzso we should investigate if this is due to a normal long-term variation or to a system zzso The intervention level is then defined as the zzso prediction zzso of the evaluated zzso zzso vs zzso zzso that do not fall within the prediction zzso are not used for future zzso 

Some preliminary results concerning zzso and uniformity were obtained in the investigation performed on 5 MR systems to define methods and references for a Quality Assurance zzso We introduced an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso related to short-term and long-term zzso The investigation levels could be a useful reference value to predict the short-term zzso of an MR system with similar zzso thus avoiding a long and onerous series of zzso zzso the zzso of measurement zzso the preliminary analysis of these results showed that a daily measurement frequency is excessive in stable equipment conditions, while monthly zzso showed that the investigation level was often zzso However, frequency zzso will be investigated after the analysis of the zzso zzso which is still in zzso
