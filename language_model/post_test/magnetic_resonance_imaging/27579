It has been shown that social deficits contribute to zzso in zzso such as the zzso zzso A possible dysfunction in the mirror zzso system may be the reason for these deficits in the zzso We wanted to better characterize the neural networks involved in the perception of social zzso Fifteen healthy participants were presented with video clips of 8 zzso duration depicting either zzso one actor manipulating an object, zzso two actors with only one manipulating an object or zzso two actors cooperating in manipulating an object and 2 other control zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during watching these zzso We found the perception of social cooperation is supported by a neural network zzso the zzso the zzso junction zzso zzso angular zzso BA zzso the middle zzso zzso (including superior zzso zzso and frontal regions zzso frontal zzso inferior frontal zzso These areas form a complex network also being activated during theory of mind and cooperative behavior zzso Its zzso overlap with those of the mirror zzso zzso zzso both theory of mind abilities and mirror mechanisms are relevant in the perception and understanding of social cooperative zzso We outline the consequences of these results for a further understanding of schizophrenic zzso with respect to social deficits and ego zzso
