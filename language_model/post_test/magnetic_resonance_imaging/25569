zzso for zzso zzso zzso is advocated in zzso patients to zzso early detection and zzso However, the zzso is not well zzso Our objective was to perform a zzso analysis from a third-party zzso perspective of no zzso zzso zzso concentration measurement alone, abdominal ultrasound zzso and zzso abdominal zzso CT and zzso and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso 

A zzso model was constructed simulating the natural history of zzso zzso zzso in a cohort of patients age 50 zzso over a time horizon of their remaining life zzso Transition probabilities were obtained from published data and zzso vital zzso zzso represented Medicare reimbursement zzso zzso and health effects were discounted at a zzso annual zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso concentration measurement was associated with an incremental zzso ratio of zzso US dollars per zzso life year, whereas screening with abdominal zzso CT and zzso concentration measurement was associated with an incremental zzso ratio of zzso US dollars per zzso life year compared with no zzso Compared with zzso CT and zzso magnetic resonance and zzso imaging costs zzso US dollars per zzso life zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the results are most sensitive to the annual zzso of zzso proportion of tumors amenable to treatment, and to transplant candidacy, whereas the choice of screening strategy is most sensitive to the test characteristics and zzso 

zzso for zzso with CT is a cost-effective strategy in zzso patients with zzso secondary to chronic zzso C viral zzso infection, comparable with other commonly accepted screening interventions such as zzso and zzso
