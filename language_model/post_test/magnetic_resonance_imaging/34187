Children with zzso reconstruction zzso zzso 34) were monitored for zzso to zzso years by zzso zzso for zzso zzso and 28 had zzso testing by 5 zzso A comparison group consisted of 35 infants who had zzso zzso after zzso Neonatal zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging scans were also zzso 

zzso were successful zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in 26 zzso of 34 children, 3 zzso had zzso zzso and 5 zzso had zzso No significant differences were seen between reconstructed and zzso groups in zzso complications or zzso zzso zzso of marked zzso zzso abnormalities did not differ between zzso zzso on zzso zzso resonance imaging scans (4 of 31 vs 11 of 29, P zzso and cerebral zzso zzso of 34 vs 5 of 35, P zzso were more common in infants with zzso zzso No differences were seen in zzso or zzso scores between the 2 groups, and 4 in each group had cognitive zzso (at least 1 zzso score zzso 

Most zzso reconstructions remained patent, with zzso showing significant zzso or zzso Compared with a historical control group, patients with zzso reconstruction had fewer brain scan abnormalities and tended to be less likely to have cerebral zzso zzso reconstruction after zzso zzso may improve zzso
