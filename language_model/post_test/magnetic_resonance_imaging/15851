The zzso association between fragile X syndrome zzso and zzso is well established, but no studies have directly compared zzso anatomy between the two zzso We performed zzso zzso analyses of magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans on 10 individuals with zzso 10 individuals with zzso and 10 healthy comparison subjects to identify zzso changes in each zzso Regional gray matter volumes within zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso and zzso were larger in the zzso group relative to the zzso zzso In addition, volume increases in zzso were observed in frontal zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso The zzso group exhibited volume increases in frontal and zzso zzso relative to the zzso group, and no volume increases relative to zzso zzso deficits relative to controls were observed in regions of the zzso for both groups, with additional deficits in zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Our zzso zzso and frontal zzso results may zzso dysfunction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso deficits suggest zzso development of the zzso contributing to the zzso of both disorders, but further imply that unique zzso regions contribute to the zzso of each zzso
