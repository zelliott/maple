zzso resonance zzso zzso is used to monitor osteogenesis in zzso zzso zzso of the developing zzso MR relaxation times zzso and zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso and elastic zzso zzso were conducted over a zzso growth period using an zzso T zzso zzso with an imaging probe adapted for MR zzso zzso Both the relaxation times and the zzso show a statistically significant decrease after only one week of tissue development while the tissue zzso increases progressively during the first two weeks of in zzso zzso The measured MR parameters are correlated with zzso monitored zzso tissue zzso This study shows that zzso can provide quantitative data with which to characterize the growth and development of zzso zzso
