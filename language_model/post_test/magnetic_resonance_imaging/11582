For the assessment of zzso zzso with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, different zzso parameters of the first pass signal intensity time zzso can be calculated and zzso zzso reserve zzso can be zzso In this study we evaluated the feasibility of different zzso parameters and their zzso reserve zzso for the detection of significant coronary artery zzso The signal intensity time zzso of the first pass of a zzso zzso injected via a central vein zzso before and after zzso infusion were investigated in 15 patients with single vessel zzso zzso or zzso zzso area zzso and five patients without significant coronary artery zzso For the distinction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso signal intensity, contrast appearance time, time to zzso signal intensity and the zzso of the signal intensity zzso zzso determined by a linear fit, were assessed after correction for the input zzso For each zzso a zzso zzso reserve index was calculated and cut off values for the detection of significant coronary zzso were zzso The diagnostic accuracy of each zzso was then examined zzso in 36 patients with coronary artery disease and compared with coronary zzso Where as a distinction of zzso and normal zzso was possible with zzso zzso reserve zzso zzso parameters at rest or after zzso alone did not allow such a zzso The zzso reserve index calculated from the zzso showed the most significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso segments zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso followed by maximum signal intensity, time to maximum signal intensity and contrast zzso zzso zzso specificity and diagnostic accuracy was 87, 82 and zzso for the detection of zzso induced by significant coronary artery zzso using the zzso reserve index calculated from the zzso The zzso of the first pass signal intensity zzso zzso determined by a linear fit, is a feasible zzso for the detection of significant coronary artery disease with zzso Based on a zzso zzso reserve index of this zzso zzso zzso can be identified with high diagnostic zzso
