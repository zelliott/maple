The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the clinical motor zzso of Parkinson's disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso In total, 53 patients with zzso zzso males and 22 zzso mean age zzso years; 19 zzso & zzso zzso stage 1, 9 stage zzso 15 stage 2 and 10 at stage zzso were examined and subdivided into different clinical forms on the basis of dominance of resting zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus rigidity zzso zzso This status was correlated with the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso An zzso control group of 18 patients was recruited (8 males and 10 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly correlated with disease duration in early zzso zzso and delayed images zzso zzso in zzso patients, while no correlation was found when considering age at examination, zzso III motor examination section score and zzso zzso zzso patients showed a reduced zzso zzso zzso compared to the control group in early zzso and delayed images zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in delayed images in zzso patients compared with ART patients zzso A decrease was detected in the zzso zzso ratio in delayed images compared to that of the early images in zzso patients zzso and in the whole zzso population zzso while no differences were found in ART patients zzso The results of the present study revealed that the cardiac sympathetic system is more severely impaired in zzso than in ART patients and zzso molecular imaging has the potential help in improving therapeutic planning in these zzso
