A prospective study is described of 12 consecutive patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso in whom an Austin zzso without lateral release was zzso All patients had similar zzso care and magnetic resonance images zzso studies of their first zzso The zzso was performed in zzso and zzso images with zzso programmed to image changes in the bone consistent with avascular necrosis of the first zzso zzso One of the 12 patients following Austin zzso without lateral release had changes on zzso consistent with avascular necrosis of the first zzso zzso These results were then compared with the prior study of 20 patients that had the Austin zzso with lateral release using the zzso exact test for small zzso and a value of zzso was found zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso The Austin zzso with lateral release significantly increases the risk of developing avascular necrosis of the first zzso head and should only be performed in instances where the soft tissue zzso is largely contributing to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
