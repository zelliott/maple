zzso zzso an zzso positive contrast media, now zzso was widely used for performing zzso zzso years zzso We identified this agent as the explanation for uncommon magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in a patient with zzso spinal zzso 

Case report and literature zzso 

An 81-year-old man complained of back pain after falling down zzso zzso revealed that he had undergone zzso with an zzso contrast agent about 60 years previously as a part of the diagnostic zzso for back pain and sudden onset of gait zzso Plain zzso of the zzso spine showed a fracture of the zzso zzso vertebra and a zzso oval shadow at the level of the zzso zzso Many small zzso dots with the appearance of a string of pearls were seen from zzso to zzso zzso zzso revealed a sharply demarcated zzso zzso mass, of approximately 5 zzso in diameter on the left side of the zzso in the region of the zzso The mass showed high signal intensity on zzso zzso and low signal intensity on zzso zzso 

Increased awareness of this rare presentation of procedures performed in the past is essential when zzso zzso images are zzso This case illustrates rare zzso of zzso use zzso decades after zzso
