zzso attention to threat is found in both individuals with anxiety symptoms and children with the childhood temperament of behavioral zzso zzso Although zzso zzso function is implicated in biased attention among anxious individuals, no work has examined the neural zzso of attention biases in zzso Work in this area might clarify underlying mechanisms for anxiety in a sample at risk for zzso zzso We examined the relations among early childhood zzso zzso connectivity during an attention bias task in young adulthood, and zzso symptoms, assessed in young zzso 

Children were assessed for zzso at multiple age points from infancy through age zzso On the basis of a composite of zzso and maternal report data, we selected 21 young adults classified as having a history of zzso and 23 classified as zzso for this study zzso zzso zzso Participants completed an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso task involving threat zzso zzso and neutral zzso zzso symptoms were assessed by self-report and diagnostic zzso 

The young adults characterized in childhood with zzso exhibited greater strength in zzso connectivity than zzso inhibited young zzso zzso differences zzso in connections between the zzso and two frontal zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso connectivity also zzso with childhood zzso to predict young adult zzso zzso 

zzso zzso during early childhood predicts differences as young adults in threat and zzso zzso zzso zzso strength, in turn, moderated the relations between early zzso and later zzso
