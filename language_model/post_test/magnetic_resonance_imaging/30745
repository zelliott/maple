To outline the diagnosis and management of zzso zzso and to propose a new zzso system to further define zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso referral center at a university zzso 

zzso patients seen at the institution with zzso zzso between 1996 and 2002 were included in the zzso 

Diagnosis was made with magnetic resonance imaging in all but one zzso Our ability to detect these tumors has been greatly enhanced by the introduction of high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance zzso Treatment options were observation with serial magnetic resonance imaging versus complete surgical removal via a zzso or zzso zzso Surgery was indicated for zzso caused by the tumor or zzso zzso 

Clinical features, audiology, zzso and management outcomes were zzso 

Eight patients have undergone successful surgery with removal of their tumors and resolution of zzso One patient chose to have zzso zzso Of the 20 patients who were managed with observation and serial magnetic resonance imaging, only 1 has shown significant growth requiring surgical zzso 

zzso zzso are uncommon tumors that mimic the clinical features of many other zzso zzso A high index of suspicion and precise imaging are often required to detect these zzso zzso treatment is indicated for specific indications and will be needed in the minority of patients with this zzso The zzso system that we propose is helpful in both the diagnosis and the management of these zzso
