zzso resonance imaging was done on the zzso of 14 volunteer subjects with the zzso in the neutral position, then zzso and extended at 45 zzso Computer enhanced zzso areas were measured on each subject at the level of the hook of the zzso In the neutral position the distance between zzso structures around the median nerve is zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso direction, and the mean zzso area of the zzso tunnel is zzso zzso With the wrist in the extended position the distance available for the median nerve measures zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso area increases to zzso zzso When the wrist is zzso the distance available for the median nerve between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso ligament decreases to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso tunnel area decreases to zzso zzso zzso of the wrist and/or fingers both produces a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso creating potential zzso of the median zzso The nerve responds to these forces by becoming zzso in various positions between the superficial zzso zzso
