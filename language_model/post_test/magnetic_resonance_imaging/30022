Despite improved techniques, the determination of tumor origin in poorly differentiated zzso still remains a challenge for the zzso Here we report the use of protein profiling combined with principal component analysis to improve diagnostic decision-making in tumor samples, in which standard zzso investigations cannot present reliable zzso 

A poorly differentiated zzso of unknown origin located in the zzso zzso the zzso colon as well as the zzso served as a model to evaluate our zzso zzso zzso we characterized the protein expression profiles from eight advanced colon and seven zzso zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso and quantitative patterns were recorded and compared to the tumor of unknown zzso Based on these protein profiles, match sets from the different tumors were zzso Finally, a zzso principal component analysis was applied to the entire zzso data to disclose differences in protein patterns between the different zzso 

Over zzso of the unknown tumor sample spots could be matched with the colon standard zzso whereas only zzso of the spots could be matched with the zzso zzso In addition, principal component analysis impressively displayed the zzso of the unknown case within the colon cancer samples, whereas this case did not cluster at all within the group of zzso zzso 

These results show that zzso protein expression profiling combined with principal component analysis is a sensitive method for diagnosing zzso zzso of unknown zzso The described approach can contribute greatly to diagnostic decision-making and, with further technical improvements and a higher zzso become a powerful tool in the zzso of the zzso
