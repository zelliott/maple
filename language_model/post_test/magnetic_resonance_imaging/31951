Several studies have reported lower focal zzso and inflammatory activity in primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso than in zzso zzso zzso However, very little is known about possible differences in damage and distribution that may occur within zzso visible on magnetic resonance imaging in the 2 forms of the zzso 

To evaluate differences in spatial distribution and structural damage of focal zzso zzso in patients with zzso and zzso 

We acquired conventional magnetic resonance and zzso transfer images in 24 zzso and 36 zzso patients zzso for sex, age, and disease zzso and 23 healthy zzso and zzso zzso In each zzso we measured zzso and zzso zzso volumes and zzso transfer ratios in zzso and zzso brain zzso The spatial distribution of focal zzso was assessed using zzso and zzso zzso probability maps in each patient zzso zzso procedures were zzso 

University zzso 

Patients with zzso had greater disability than those with zzso with zzso of zzso patients and zzso of zzso patients having relevant motor zzso The zzso and zzso zzso volumes were higher in zzso than in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso probability maps showed that the maximum probability for zzso was higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients and was localized in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso transfer ratios gave overlapping zzso 

zzso in cerebral zzso involvement exist between zzso and zzso and contribute to variations in clinical zzso
