Heart failure after zzso zzso zzso is a result of increased zzso zzso adverse left zzso zzso geometric zzso and less efficient zzso fluid zzso In this study we zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate zzso function and flow after placement of a novel directed zzso assist zzso 

Five zzso underwent zzso zzso and were allowed to zzso for 12 zzso An inflatable zzso was positioned centrally within the zzso and secured with zzso The device was connected to an external gas exchange zzso which inflated and zzso in zzso with the cardiac zzso Animals then underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging during active zzso assistance and with no zzso 

Active zzso assistance of the zzso showed immediate improvement in zzso function and zzso zzso zzso fraction significantly improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and stroke volume zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were also improved with zzso zzso volume and zzso fraction did not change with zzso Regional zzso flow improved both zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso regional flow showed highly zzso blood movement with very slow zzso from the zzso zzso Large areas of stagnant flow were also zzso With assistance, zzso wall blood zzso improved significantly during both zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso p zzso zzso 

Directed zzso assistance can improve zzso function and flow in zzso zzso This novel device may provide a valuable alternative to currently available heart failure zzso
