The aim of this study was to assess the zzso and zzso zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso language zzso on language zzso and zzso 

Fourteen healthy volunteers were enrolled zzso and underwent language zzso using visually triggered covert and overt sentence generation zzso and word generation zzso zzso zzso analysis of all functional data was performed using Brain Voyager on an individual zzso zzso of interest for zzso area, zzso area, and their zzso zzso were zzso The zzso coordinates of the center of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the respective blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the correlation of the measured zzso response to the applied reference function zzso relative zzso signal change as zzso signal characteristics were measured in each region of zzso Regional zzso indexes were calculated for zzso area, zzso area, and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test was applied for statistical comparisons zzso values zzso zzso were considered zzso Ten of the 14 volunteers had three repeated zzso to test zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rates for the four zzso were zzso for covert zzso zzso for overt zzso zzso for covert zzso and zzso for overt zzso When comparing covert and overt zzso language zzso was significantly different in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Language zzso was significantly different in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was excellent, with zzso significant differences among all five parameters for language zzso and zzso significant differences for language zzso using covert zzso 

zzso language zzso zzso and zzso provided highly robust and zzso zzso and zzso of essential language centers for scans performed on the same and different zzso Their overt counterparts achieved zzso zzso but lower zzso zzso zzso data for zzso application are zzso
