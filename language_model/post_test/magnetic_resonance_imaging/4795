For 20 years, it has been known that fetal alcohol syndrome zzso is associated with abnormal brain zzso Early autopsy studies point to the corpus zzso as one area affected by heavy alcohol zzso Little is known, however, about the integrity of the brain in zzso children who survive the zzso zzso This study was designed to assess the corpus zzso in living children exposed to high doses of alcohol zzso Thirteen children with histories of significant prenatal alcohol exposure and 12 normal control children were evaluated using magnetic resonance zzso Using the zzso section, images were measured for the area of the corpus zzso using a zzso measurement zzso In addition to the overall area, five zzso regions were determined for each corpus zzso Of the 13 zzso children zzso two had zzso of the corpus zzso The remaining zzso children had significantly smaller overall zzso areas, as well as smaller regional areas of four of the five zzso regions, when compared with the normal control zzso zzso when corrected for brain size, three of the five zzso regions were still smaller in the zzso children, although overall area of the corpus zzso was no longer significantly zzso These results suggest that prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol is associated with abnormalities of the corpus zzso They verify zzso zzso in children with zzso which previously had only been noted in autopsy zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
