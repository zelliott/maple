The optimal diagnostic evaluation for spontaneous zzso zzso zzso remains zzso In this retrospective study, we assessed the utility of early magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso diagnosis and zzso 

zzso zzso of 123 patients with spontaneous zzso underwent a brain CT and zzso within 30 days of zzso zzso zzso patients with a mean age of 62 zzso 15 years were zzso A stroke neurologist and a general zzso each blinded to the final diagnosis, independently reviewed the admission data and the initial head CT and then assigned a presumed zzso cause under 1 of 9 zzso zzso cause was potentially modified after subsequent zzso zzso The final zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined after review of the complete medical record by an independent zzso Change in diagnostic category and confidence and the potential impact on patient management were systematically zzso 

Mean time to zzso was 3 zzso 5 zzso Final zzso diagnosis was hypertension or cerebral zzso zzso zzso in 50% of zzso After zzso review the stroke neurologist changed diagnostic category in zzso diagnostic confidence in an additional zzso and management in zzso and the general neurologist did so in 19, 21 and zzso of patients, zzso zzso yield was highest in zzso secondary to zzso stroke, zzso vascular zzso and zzso and did not differ by age, history of hypertension, zzso location or the presence of zzso zzso 

The results of this study suggest potential additive clinical benefit of early zzso in patients with spontaneous zzso
