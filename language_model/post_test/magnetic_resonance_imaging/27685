To explore the application value of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso 

Brain images of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and video zzso zzso were obtained in 65 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared in zzso zzso And the results of PET and zzso were compared between the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso scans were normal in 26 cases and abnormal in 35 zzso zzso patients had zzso zzso discharge on zzso zzso regions, zzso zzso 12; multiple brain areas, zzso zzso 16; hemisphere, zzso zzso 13; unspecified location, zzso zzso zzso and zzso PET imaging zzso regions, zzso zzso 23; multiple brain areas, zzso zzso zzso hemisphere, zzso zzso zzso unspecified location, zzso zzso zzso And 17 zzso patients underwent operations and 12 of them reached the zzso zzso level zzso Both PET and zzso were compared between the zzso and zzso zzso No significant differences existed between two group zzso zzso zzso A comparison of PET and zzso showed statistical significance in two group zzso zzso zzso 

PET imaging is both sensitive and effective in the detection and zzso of zzso zzso Especially for zzso cases, it is an indispensable tool of zzso zzso zzso
