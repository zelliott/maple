We tested the hypothesis that zzso is associated with abnormalities in semantic processing of linguistic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso and characterize the neural architecture underlying zzso processes in criminal zzso individuals and in a group of matched control zzso Participants performed a zzso decision task in which blocks of linguistic stimuli zzso with a resting baseline zzso In each zzso decision block, the stimuli were either concrete words and zzso or abstract words and zzso zzso with our hypothesis, zzso individuals, relative to controls, showed poorer behavioral performance for processing abstract zzso Analysis of the zzso data for both groups indicated that processing of word zzso compared with the resting baseline condition, was associated with neural zzso in bilateral zzso zzso anterior cingulate, left middle zzso zzso right zzso superior zzso zzso and left and right inferior frontal zzso zzso confirmed our prediction that zzso individuals would fail to show the appropriate neural differentiation between abstract and concrete stimuli in the right anterior zzso zzso and surrounding zzso The results are consistent with other studies of semantic processing in zzso and support the theory that zzso is associated with right zzso abnormalities for processing zzso abstract zzso
