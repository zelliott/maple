zzso patients suffering from zzso were examined with zzso and 22 zzso levels were zzso 1 zzso 6 zzso and 15 zzso As for zzso 4 cases were zzso 3 zzso 3 zzso 1 zzso and 11 of unknown zzso Five patients underwent MR follow-up zzso months after the clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were always performed and 11 patients, with 13 zzso levels, also underwent zzso zzso sequences with zzso zzso zzso No correlation could be made between the signal intensity of the involved zzso bodies and disks and zzso On zzso zzso sequences zzso of the zzso bodies were zzso whereas the zzso disks were zzso in zzso of cases and zzso in zzso On zzso zzso zzso the zzso appeared zzso in zzso of the cases while the disks were zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso After zzso injection signal intensity increased in zzso of cases, both at the body and at the zzso In 6 cases an inflammatory zzso of the zzso structures was found, whose identifications was possible, in 4 cases, only after contrast medium zzso In the follow-up of 5 cases at zzso months the zzso bodies remained zzso in 3 cases on zzso zzso while in 2 cases signal intensity tended to zzso Signal zzso in 4 cases on zzso zzso In 2 follow-up examinations disk structures were never zzso neither on zzso nor on zzso zzso To zzso zzso sequences appear to be more sensitive than zzso sequences to demonstrate inflammatory processes in the zzso bodies, while the two sequences are equivalent to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso sequences were more sensitive than the zzso and zzso ones, especially to assess the extent of inflammatory processes into the spinal canal and to evaluate their zzso The authors suggest the use of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso sequences only at least in the follow-up of zzso
