This study sought to characterize the early features of diabetic zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

The earliest manifestations of diabetic zzso have not been well established, especially under tight zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso would identify zzso zzso zzso in type I diabetics with normal left zzso ejection zzso mass, blood pressure, and aggressive zzso zzso We also sought to characterize the influence of elevated resting heart rates zzso of diabetics on zzso 

Sixteen patients with type I diabetes and 10 control patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso strain, and their rates were zzso To zzso the influence of zzso and zzso stimulation on zzso nine healthy volunteers underwent zzso tagging at rest, after zzso injection, and after zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a higher resting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso higher zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso rate zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso did not significantly change with zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso 

In diabetics under tight zzso control, we observed a surprising increase in zzso and zzso unrelated to zzso influences of zzso We propose that increased zzso and zzso could represent early zzso markers of the propensity to cardiac dysfunction in zzso type I zzso Furthermore, these findings seem fundamental to the diabetic state itself and zzso for by other zzso
