The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso injections zzso of the zzso joint zzso in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso when administered by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon without imaging zzso 

This was a retrospective study of children with zzso seen at a single center, who were selected based on having received zzso of the zzso All subjects received the intervention, which consisted of referral to a single oral and maxillofacial surgeon for zzso zzso with 5 to 10 zzso zzso zzso under general zzso zzso outcomes assessed in all subjects were the safety of the procedure and efficacy as determined by the change in zzso zzso opening zzso In addition, a subset of 31 subjects underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso permitting analysis of the change in the acute and chronic findings of arthritis in those zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso received 137 zzso The mean age for diagnosis of zzso was zzso years, and the mean age at presentation for zzso injections was 10 zzso The injections were well zzso only 1 patient developed the steroid complication of zzso and none developed zzso or zzso In terms of zzso the mean zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition, changing the unit of analysis to individual zzso in patients who underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging examination, 51% of zzso showed magnetic resonance imaging evidence of improvement of zzso changes, of whom zzso had complete resolution of zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso of the zzso can be safely performed by experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeons without a requirement for zzso zzso zzso In addition, these results show that zzso may be effective in the management of zzso arthritis, although further studies are zzso
