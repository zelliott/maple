The purpose of this study is to establish that newborn stroke involving extensive parts of cerebral zzso immediately leads to secondary network injury in zzso Seven term infants with cortical stroke presented with zzso in zzso on zzso Stroke types zzso complete zzso stroke zzso zzso stroke, zzso stroke and multiple artery stroke (1 zzso Age range at scanning was between day 2 and 6 after birth (except for 1 infant scanned within 7 days of acute presentation during zzso zzso values in zzso injured zzso were significantly higher than in the area with primary zzso injury (all patients scanned with identical MR image zzso In the absence of zzso and because zzso is outside of the primary area of zzso we conclude that there are suggestions from imaging for acute secondary injury to zzso following primary damage of their cortical targets and/or connecting zzso Acute secondary injury is probably due to zzso and zzso The relevance of network injury for prognosis and the impact of early treatment on it have yet to be zzso in stroke but also in other acute zzso brain zzso
