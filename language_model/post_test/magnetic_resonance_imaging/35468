Pulmonary deposition of zzso drugs in zzso zzso has not been studied in zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate pulmonary delivery of zzso zzso zzso following zzso in zzso zzso using magnetic resonance zzso Seven zzso zzso (5 zzso 2 d old, weight zzso zzso zzso zzso were scanned in the zzso zzso magnetic resonance scanner using zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso of zzso were generated continuously using the zzso jet zzso zzso zzso images were obtained before and every 10 zzso during zzso zzso for 90 zzso Signal intensity zzso changes over the zzso zzso liver, skeletal muscle, and heart were zzso A significant increase in zzso was observed in the zzso zzso and liver at 10, 20, and 40 zzso respectively after start of zzso At the end of 90 zzso the zzso increased by zzso zzso and zzso over the right zzso left zzso and zzso zzso A much smaller increase in zzso was observed over the zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated effective pulmonary zzso delivery within 10 zzso of contrast zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso within 20 zzso of zzso initiation reflects zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
