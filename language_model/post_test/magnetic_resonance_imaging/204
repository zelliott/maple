The main aim of this study was to provide an overview of the anatomy of the zzso hood zzso based on the dissection of zzso zzso hands, correlated with magnetic resonance zzso and ultrasound zzso A secondary aim was to assess the function of components of the zzso Sixteen embalmed hands were evaluated by zzso and ultrasound before being zzso Each hand was photographed during each stage of zzso zzso we evaluated the role of the different structures of the zzso in the stability of the zzso zzso by zzso of the different components alternatively at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and dissection showed that the zzso zzso zzso is stabilized by the zzso band zzso at the level of the zzso zzso joint and more zzso by the zzso and the zzso bands, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the second finger leads systematically to zzso dislocation of the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso does not lead to instability of the zzso The zzso is the most important structure of the zzso in the stability of the zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the second finger leads systematically to zzso dislocation of the zzso
