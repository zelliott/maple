With the advent of sophisticated acquisition and analysis techniques, decoding the contents of someone's experience has become a zzso We propose a straightforward linear zzso approach, where decoding relies on the inversion of properly zzso zzso models, which can still be solved zzso In order to test our approach we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data under a rapid zzso design in which subjects were presented with handwritten zzso Our approach is shown to yield state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived characters as estimated from zzso zzso This even holds for previously unseen zzso We propose that this framework serves as a baseline with which to compare more sophisticated models for which zzso inversion is zzso
