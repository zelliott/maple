The present study investigated the neural zzso of cognitive fatigue in Multiple zzso zzso looking specifically at the relationship between zzso fatigue and objective measures of cognitive zzso In zzso 1, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to examine where in the brain zzso activity zzso with zzso fatigue, assessed during performance of a task designed to induce cognitive fatigue while in the zzso In zzso 2, diffusion zzso imaging zzso was used to examine where in the brain white matter damage correlated with increased zzso fatigue in individuals with zzso assessed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso completed outside the scanning zzso During the cognitively fatiguing task, the zzso group had increased brain activity associated with fatigue in the zzso as compared with zzso zzso findings revealed that reduced fractional zzso in the anterior internal capsule was associated with increased zzso fatigue on the zzso zzso are discussed in terms of identifying a zzso in zzso
