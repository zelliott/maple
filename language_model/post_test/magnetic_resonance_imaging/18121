Many features of zzso stress disorder zzso can be linked to exaggerated and zzso emotional zzso Central to the zzso regulating emotion are functional interactions between the zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso from human and animal studies suggest that disruption of this circuit predicts individual differences in emotion zzso However, only a few studies have examined zzso connectivity in the context of emotional processing in zzso The aim of the present research was to investigate the hypothesis that zzso is associated with disrupted functional connectivity of the zzso and zzso in response to emotional zzso extending previous findings by demonstrating such links in an zzso highly zzso civilian zzso 40 African-American women with civilian trauma (20 with zzso and 20 zzso zzso were recruited from a large urban zzso Participants viewed fearful and neutral face stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Relative to controls, participants with zzso showed an increased right zzso response to fearful stimuli zzso zzso zzso Right zzso zzso correlated positively with the severity of zzso symptoms in the zzso zzso Participants with zzso showed decreased functional connectivity between the right zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings are consistent with previous findings showing zzso is associated with an exaggerated response of zzso emotional zzso zzso This is the first study to show that the zzso response may be accompanied by disruption of an zzso functional circuit that is hypothesized to be involved in prefrontal cortical regulation of zzso zzso
