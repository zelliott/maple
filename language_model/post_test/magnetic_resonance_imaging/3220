We investigated the feasibility of performing chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso imaging using zzso zzso zzso zzso agents on a clinical magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

We prepared solutions of 3 different zzso zzso agents at zzso of 5, 10, 20, and 50 zzso at a pH of zzso and at a concentration of 50 zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We acquired images with a zzso spin echo technique using a zzso head zzso and a clinical zzso MR system in accordance with the safety limits of the specific zzso rate zzso We acquired zzso images with zzso offset zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to 5,000 zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of 500 zzso zzso zzso for each zzso We repeated each scan 3 times and then calculated the mean and standard zzso of the magnitude of the zzso effect at different zzso and pH values for each zzso We used one-way analysis of zzso and zzso honestly significant difference post hoc test to compare mean values of the magnitude of the zzso effect obtained at different zzso and pH zzso P zzso zzso was considered zzso 

zzso agents showed a strong zzso effect at their specific zzso offset zzso For each agent, the zzso effect showed significant concentration dependency zzso zzso zzso increasing with agent zzso and significant pH dependency zzso zzso zzso with strong effect near zzso zzso 

zzso imaging using zzso zzso agents might be feasible on a clinical MR scanner with further zzso such as adjustments of the zzso zzso pulse and imaging zzso
