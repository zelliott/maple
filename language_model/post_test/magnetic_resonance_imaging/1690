zzso zzso volume is one of the hypothesized pathological features of zzso but it is not known if this zzso is zzso zzso The aim of this study was to measure the zzso volume of the parents of schizophrenic zzso in relationship to the apparent transmission of genetic zzso 

zzso subjects from families consisting of a schizophrenic zzso and two clinically unaffected parents were zzso zzso were compared to six control subjects, matched for age, sex, and educational zzso The six families were selected so that only one parent had an ancestral family history of zzso The volumes of both zzso were measured by magnetic resonance imaging and adjusted for age and whole brain zzso 

The total zzso volumes of the parents with ancestral family history of schizophrenia were significantly larger than those of their schizophrenic zzso 

This study suggests that decreased zzso volume in schizophrenia is not a zzso transmitted zzso Rather, it appears that clinically unaffected parents who transmit apparent genetic risk for schizophrenia may have increased zzso volume, which may be a protective factor against the zzso
