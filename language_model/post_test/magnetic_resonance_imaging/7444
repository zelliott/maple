Task performance for behaviors that engage motor cognitive processes may be particularly sensitive to age-related zzso One well-studied model of cognitive motor function involves engagement of action selection zzso zzso In young adults, task conditions that add AS demands result in increased preparation times and greater engagement of bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The current study investigated the behavioral and neural response to a change in motor cognitive demands in older adults through the addition of AS to a movement zzso Sixteen older adults made a zzso movement under two conditions during functional magnetic resonance zzso In the AS condition, participants moved right or left based on an abstract zzso in the execution only zzso condition, participants moved in the same direction on every zzso Across participants, the AS condition, as compared to the zzso condition, was associated with longer reaction time and increased zzso of left inferior zzso zzso zzso in behavioral response to the AS task between participants related to differences in brain function and zzso Overall, individuals with poorer AS task performance showed greater zzso in left zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso and decreased structural integrity of white matter tracts that connect zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions for AS task zzso Additionally, two distinct patterns of functional connectivity were zzso Participants with a pattern of decreased primary zzso connectivity in response to the AS condition, compared to those with a pattern of increased zzso were older and had poorer behavioral zzso These neural changes in response to increased motor cognitive demands may be a marker for age-related changes in the motor system and have an impact on the learning of novel, complex motor skills in older zzso
