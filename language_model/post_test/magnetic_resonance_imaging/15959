zzso and zzso are traditional for zzso zzso of breast cancer size; magnetic resonance imaging zzso is more recent but not as well zzso We compared zzso zzso and zzso for zzso imaging of primary breast cancer presenting as a mass in patients treated at our center over a zzso zzso Of the 61 breast zzso with all three imaging zzso performed, 52 were zzso zzso cancer, 5 were zzso zzso cancer, 2 were zzso zzso in zzso and 2 were other zzso zzso When zzso size was used to determine the accuracy of imaging zzso the zzso correlation zzso was better for zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean tumor size was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso tumor size was within 1 zzso of zzso size in 44 zzso tumors, zzso 1 zzso above zzso size in 6 zzso tumors, and zzso 1 zzso below zzso size in 11 zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is more accurate than either zzso or zzso for assessment of the size of primary breast cancer presenting as a zzso
