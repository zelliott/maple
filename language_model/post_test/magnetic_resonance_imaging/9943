zzso zzso with largely zzso growth are rare and often incorrectly assigned as zzso tumors zzso zzso evaluation of the precise tumor location is important for total zzso of tumor and improving the surgical zzso The aim of this study was to provide the first identification of the key differences among of zzso MR images of zzso in different locations and to correlate these with pathological zzso The subjects were 26 patients with surgery for spinal zzso in our department, including 6 with an zzso tumor who were complicated with von zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors were present in 22, 3 and 1 cases, zzso zzso MR images showed that zzso and zzso tumors gave zzso zzso high intensity areas zzso spreading toward the zzso sides of the zzso whereas such findings were absent for the zzso zzso All the tumors showed strong contrast on zzso images, with focal enhancement of zzso limited to the zzso region zzso zzso smooth boundary lines between the spinal zzso and the zzso tumor zzso zzso and a zzso sign for zzso tumors, which provided a key characteristic for zzso zzso tumors from those limited to the zzso zzso In pathological findings, the zzso activity was less than zzso for zzso and zzso tumors, but zzso in all cases with an zzso zzso In conclusion, on zzso zzso a change in the zzso zzso spreading the zzso sides of the tumor on zzso zzso weighted image zzso and a zzso sign on contrast zzso zzso may be important for differentiation among spinal zzso in different zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso has high cell zzso activity, which may suggest that enlargement of this tumor occurs faster than that of zzso zzso
