There is a current debate whether zzso zzso represents zzso multiple primary zzso or zzso zzso The purpose of this report is to evaluate the zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso 

Six patients ranging in age from 7 to 29 years were zzso The clinical, zzso and zzso findings are zzso In addition, a review of the literature was zzso 

The clinical courses of our six patients as well as a review of the literature suggest that zzso zzso represent one extreme of a continuous scale of zzso zzso rather than multiple zzso primary zzso The presentation is unusual and the clinical behavior distinctive, but the mechanism of spread remains the same: zzso and zzso 

Our experience with these six patients supports the concept in the recent literature that zzso zzso is one extreme of the spectrum of zzso zzso Its unique features are: zzso multiple zzso zzso that present simultaneously with or without pulmonary zzso zzso a single zzso zzso with multiple smaller zzso and zzso a zzso zzso fatal zzso zzso should be regarded as a zzso disease, even when only a single primary zzso is found at the initial zzso
