zzso investigations reliably describe a zzso network of areas as underlying the representations of knowledge about familiar zzso Among the critical zzso of the network, an area centered within the left zzso zzso zzso is thought to be related to the zzso representations associated with familiar tools and their zzso This area is in the vicinity of an area implicated in the control of zzso grasping zzso the anterior zzso area, zzso The current study aimed to evaluate whether this zzso zzso activity could be accounted for by the zzso nature of tools or whether it was due to additional factors such as the functionality of zzso First, we found that during a naming task zzso within a discrete region of the left anterior zzso zzso was higher for tools than for zzso objects, but did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the peak activity associated with tool naming was found to be largely distinct and consistently zzso to that associated with real object zzso A separate region, anterior to the zzso focus and possibly overlapping with zzso demonstrated weak selectivity for both tools and zzso objects relative to zzso zzso These findings indicate that this zzso area at the anterior end of the left zzso is both zzso from the zzso zzso activity and, consistently, it does not simply reflect the processing of grasping zzso Taken together, these results suggest that object zzso alone cannot account for the left zzso activity driven by the naming of zzso Instead, this activity may relate to learned motor representations associated with the skillful use of familiar zzso
