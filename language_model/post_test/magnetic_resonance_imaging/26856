to evaluate the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso 

earlier work has suggested that the risk of low back injury is higher after overnight zzso or zzso Changes in spinal zzso and zzso in zzso important in stabilizing the spine could be responsible for this, but there are limited data on how the zzso zzso and zzso structures are affected during zzso 

nine male subjects underwent zzso zzso tilt zzso as part of the second Berlin zzso zzso zzso volume, zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso angle, and disc height were measured on zzso plane magnetic resonance zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were used to measure zzso areas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso zzso completed low back pain zzso questionnaires for the first zzso after zzso 

increases in disc volume, spinal length zzso at lower zzso zzso loss of the lower zzso zzso and move to a more zzso position at the upper zzso spine zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of all muscles changed zzso zzso zzso with the rate of zzso greatest at zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and at zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was consistent throughout the muscle zzso zzso zzso but zzso of zzso muscle increased zzso zzso zzso zzso who reported zzso after zzso zzso before zzso greater increases in zzso disc zzso and greater losses of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso than subjects who did not report pain (all P zzso zzso 

these results provide evidence that changes in the zzso discs during zzso and selective zzso of the zzso muscle may be important factors in the occurrence of zzso after prolonged zzso
