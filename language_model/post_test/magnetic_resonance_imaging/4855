A central zzso of motor zzso is that the zzso learns from sensory prediction zzso Surprisingly, zzso studies have not revealed definitive signatures of error processing in the zzso Furthermore, zzso studies suggest an zzso such that the zzso may zzso errors arising from unexpected sensory events, but not errors reflecting the omission of expected zzso We conducted an imaging study to compare the zzso response to these two types of zzso Participants made fast zzso reaching movements, aiming either for an object that delivered a force pulse if intersected or for a gap between two objects, either of which delivered a force pulse if zzso Errors zzso the zzso could therefore be signaled either through the presence or absence of a force zzso In an initial analysis, the zzso zzso response was smaller on trials with errors compared with trials without zzso However, we also observed an zzso decrease in heart zzso After correcting for variation in heart rate, increased zzso during error trials was observed in the hand area of zzso V and zzso This effect was similar for the two error zzso The results provide evidence for the zzso of errors resulting from either the unexpected presence or unexpected absence of sensory stimulation in the human zzso
