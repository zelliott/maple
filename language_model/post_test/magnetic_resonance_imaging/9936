In the present study, we have hypothesized that volume changes of the zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and lateral zzso in zzso male zzso patients without therapy are more pronounced in those with zzso To confirm or reject our hypothesis, we have undertaken an extensive study of zzso zzso zzso 

To confirm or reject our hypothesis, we have undertaken an extensive study of zzso zzso male patients that underwent zzso scanning immediately upon zzso for the zzso Based on headache frequency, they were classified into three groups: group 1 included patients with headaches at least twice a week; group 2 consisted of patients with headaches less than twice a week; and group 3 consisted of patients without zzso All zzso scans underwent software-based volume zzso and statistical zzso 

39 out of 49 patients with zzso suffered from zzso zzso volume decreases were noted in groups 1 and 2 compared to group 3 for the zzso nucleus, zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso among groups appeared to be zzso 

The present study revealed a bilateral volume decrease of the zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso in zzso male subjects without zzso zzso of volume zzso correlated with zzso depression rating zzso zzso analysis uncovered correlated changes in the zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso and an inverse correlation with the volume of the lateral zzso in the zzso zzso
