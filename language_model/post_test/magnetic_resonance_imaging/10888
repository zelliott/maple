The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of zzso recording, electrical zzso and zzso position checking during functional zzso procedures zzso zzso in the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

zzso surgical procedures for zzso implant or zzso zzso were performed in an open zzso T zzso operating zzso zzso implants were performed in 54 patients zzso surgical zzso and unilateral zzso zzso in three for a total of 76 surgeries in 57 zzso zzso studies including zzso and zzso recordings for zzso were obtained in the zzso to 10 zzso fringes of the magnetic field in 51 zzso zzso confirmation of the zzso position during the procedure was performed after zzso zzso 

The magnetic field associated with the zzso scanner did not contribute significant noise to zzso zzso zzso confirmation of zzso position was possible within the zzso artifact from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in two zzso zzso patients during the zzso Image quality of the zzso T zzso scan was zzso for anatomical zzso However, image fusion with zzso scans permitted excellent zzso of the zzso zzso tip in relation to the higher quality zzso T zzso anatomical zzso 

This study shows that conventional zzso zzso zzso recordings, electrical zzso implant of zzso hardware, and zzso zzso placement are possible in the open zzso T zzso zzso The convenience of having an imaging zzso that can zzso the brain during the operation is ideal for zzso zzso
