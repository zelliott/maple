A PET study was performed in six normal volunteers to zzso the functional zzso of the sensory zzso component during finger zzso Brain zzso during the passive movement driven by a zzso was compared with that during an zzso active movement which was controlled zzso in the same way as the passive zzso A newly developed device was used for selectively zzso zzso with a minimal contribution from tactile zzso Active movement was associated with zzso of multiple areas, including the zzso primary zzso cortex, zzso cortex, supplementary motor area zzso bilateral secondary zzso areas and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, only the zzso primary and secondary zzso areas were activated by the passive zzso It is likely that the contribution of zzso input to the zzso of the zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso if any, is zzso However, the present results do not rule out the possibility that the zzso zzso input or the combination of zzso and zzso input zzso in the zzso of those areas during the active zzso
