A progressive zzso decrease in gray matter volume zzso years after first hospitalization in schizophrenia has been shown in superior zzso zzso zzso However, it is still controversial whether progressive volume reduction occurs in chronic schizophrenia in the zzso and zzso complex zzso structures found to be abnormal in chronic zzso These structures were measured at two time points in 16 chronic schizophrenia patients and 20 normal comparison subjects using manual tracing with high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso Average zzso zzso was zzso years for schizophrenia patients and zzso years for healthy comparison zzso zzso comparisons showed smaller relative volumes in schizophrenia compared with controls in zzso zzso and zzso An zzso with zzso zzso as a zzso showed there was no statistically significant progression of volume reduction in either the zzso or zzso in the schizophrenia group compared with normal zzso In the schizophrenia group, volume change in the left anterior zzso significantly correlated with zzso negative zzso These data, and separately reported first episode data from our laboratory, suggest marked progression at the initial stage of zzso but less in chronic zzso
