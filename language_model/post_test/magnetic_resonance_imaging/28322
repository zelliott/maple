The zzso magnetic resonance zzso characteristics of zzso in porous zzso rock exhibit short zzso relaxation times and broad natural line zzso These characteristics severely restrict which MR imaging zzso methodology can be used to obtain high-resolution zzso images of zzso in porous zzso An MR zzso protocol based on zzso zzso using strong imaging zzso was developed to overcome many of these zzso To improve the image quality of zzso systems, zzso zzso using zzso MR to image the brine phase and zzso MR of a fluorinated hydrocarbon to image the oil phase was zzso Resolution as high as 25 zzso per zzso has been obtained for fluid systems in zzso and zzso zzso Separate zzso and zzso images of brine and oil zzso show good agreement with total zzso zzso Software has been developed to perform zzso zzso and to extract the pore size distribution from zzso zzso images of fluid filled zzso zzso from pore size zzso show significant differences in the nature of the pore network in zzso and zzso zzso
