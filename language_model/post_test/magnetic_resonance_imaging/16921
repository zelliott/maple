After obtaining experimental data of zzso zzso formation and zzso in a porous medium using magnetic resonance imaging zzso the purpose of this study was to analyze the different zzso rate of zzso zzso using two heating zzso Images were obtained by using a fast zzso zzso and the field of view was set to zzso zzso The vessel pressure was monitored during zzso formation and zzso which was used to compare with zzso mean zzso The result indicated that the zzso could zzso zzso formation and zzso and the zzso mean intensity of water was in good agreement with the vessel pressure zzso The zzso formation and zzso rates were also zzso using the zzso mean intensity of zzso The experimental results showed that the higher heating rate caused the rapid zzso zzso
