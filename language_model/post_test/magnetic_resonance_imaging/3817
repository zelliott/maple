The brain seeks to combine related zzso from different senses zzso hearing and zzso via zzso zzso zzso information can indicate whether stimuli in different senses are related or zzso A recent human zzso study zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso used auditory and visual trains of beeps and flashes with erratic timing, manipulating whether auditory and visual trains were zzso or unrelated in zzso zzso A region of superior zzso zzso zzso showed higher zzso signal for the zzso zzso But this could not be related to performance, and it remained unclear if the zzso unpredictable nature of the stimulus trains was zzso Here we compared zzso audiovisual trains to zzso trains, while using a behavioral task requiring detection of zzso target events in either zzso We further varied whether the stimulus trains had predictable zzso pattern or zzso zzso zzso zzso between auditory and visual trains enhanced behavioral sensitivity zzso to intensity targets in either zzso regardless of predictable versus unpredictable zzso The analogous contrast in zzso revealed zzso increases in several brain areas, including the left zzso region reported by zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso here correlated with the zzso impact on zzso zzso of zzso pattern did not affect target detection performance or zzso activity, but did lead to an interaction with audiovisual zzso for zzso in inferior zzso zzso
