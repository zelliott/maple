There is a growing interest in how zzso order of episodic memories is represented within the zzso zzso lobe zzso Animal studies suggest that the zzso formation zzso is critical for retrieving the zzso order of past zzso However, human imaging studies that have tested zzso discrimination between pairs of previously zzso items have generally failed to report zzso zzso We hypothesized that recalling a zzso sequence of past events would be particularly sensitive to zzso function, attributable to greater involvement of zzso zzso To test this zzso we let subjects watch a novel movie and later, during functional magnetic resonance imaging, asked them to rearrange and zzso scenes from the movie in correct zzso To identify areas specifically involved in retrieval of zzso order, we used a control condition where subjects logically zzso the order of scenes from the same zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed during sequence zzso zzso within the right zzso was specifically related to retrieval of zzso order and correlated positively with accuracy of sequence zzso Also, the bilateral zzso zzso responded to retrieval of zzso order, but the zzso here was not related to zzso Our study is the first to unequivocally demonstrate that correct sequence recall depends on zzso
