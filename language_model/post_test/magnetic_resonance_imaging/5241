This review zzso zzso studies of 2 zzso of social zzso comprehension and theory of mind zzso patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar zzso The influence of key clinical and method variables on patterns of neural zzso during social cognitive processing is also zzso 

Studies were identified using zzso and zzso (January 1967 to May zzso The search terms were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in combination with zzso depressive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Taken together, zzso studies of social zzso in patients with mood disorders reveal enhanced zzso in zzso and zzso structures and attenuated activity within frontal regions associated with emotion regulation and higher cognitive zzso These results reveal an overall lack of zzso by zzso cognitive structures on zzso and zzso structures during social cognitive processing in patients with mood zzso zzso key zzso including illness burden, symptom severity, zzso medication status and cognitive load may moderate this pattern of neural zzso 

Studies that did not include control tasks or a zzso group were included in this zzso 

Further work is needed to examine the contribution of key zzso variables and to further zzso the neural networks underlying altered social zzso in patients with mood zzso The neural networks under lying zzso social cognitive zzso including empathy, remain unexplored in patients with mood zzso
