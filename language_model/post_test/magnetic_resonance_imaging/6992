The purpose of this study was to perform serial texture analysis of brain zzso of zzso mice for the assessment of regional zzso and zzso zzso mice undergo a brain zzso zzso This process was followed over 56 days by zzso in the zzso bulbs, zzso zzso and brain zzso The texture of zzso images has been analyzed at two zzso zzso with the average intensity as first order zzso and zzso with several higher order parameters for the best differentiation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most pertinent of these zzso called horizontal gray level zzso zzso has been selected by zzso zzso zzso The time evolution of the average value of zzso not only confirmed the overall zzso tendency followed by the average intensity, but also more precisely characterized a zzso zzso on day 41 in the zzso bulbs and zzso in agreement with already published zzso destructive zzso
