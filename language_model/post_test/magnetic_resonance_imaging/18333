zzso transfer contrast zzso imaging of skeletal muscle before and after exercise has been studied in normal volunteers at zzso zzso A zzso pulse was applied over a range of offset zzso immediately before a zzso recall echo zzso zzso signal loss was observed in all zzso After exercise, selective zzso resulted in a significant increase of contrast between active and less active muscle, a phenomenon attributable to an increase in zzso water zzso zzso imaging provides a more sensitive method to detect changes in water distribution in human skeletal zzso
