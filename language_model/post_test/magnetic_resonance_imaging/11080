To study the effect of zzso size on the detection of lateral zzso nucleus zzso zzso during visual stimulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso 

Ten normal subjects were scanned during visual stimulation with flashing goggles, four times, with four different zzso zzso The data were zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified in the standard coordinates in each zzso 

When the statistical analysis was performed without global zzso zzso of zzso was detected in both zzso in all zzso However, when global zzso was used, zzso of zzso was found in only six subjects in whom the zzso could be most frequently detected at the smallest zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso can be observed within the range of spatial resolution commonly used in conventional zzso studies, although zzso may affect the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso These findings may be useful in studying zzso activity in patients with visual zzso
