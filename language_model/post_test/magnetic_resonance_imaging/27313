To describe a method of intrinsic zzso nerve biopsy and its zzso 

zzso case zzso 

We report four cases that required intrinsic zzso nerve biopsy for progressive zzso zzso with uncertain diagnosis after negative systemic zzso In all cases, a zzso zzso approach was zzso There were no complications noted with this technique in the series, specifically there was no reported deterioration in zzso One case of zzso was zzso In the other three cases, the pathology results were zzso but ruled out serious causes such as central nervous system zzso zzso 

zzso zzso intrinsic zzso nerve biopsy is a minimally invasive and safe zzso The technique is suitable for sampling pathology in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso nerve biopsy is indicated when there is significant loss of vision from an isolated zzso nerve disease and all systemic investigations have failed to identify the cause, or where the clinical course of a presumed diagnosis is zzso
