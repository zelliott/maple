zzso therapeutic benefit from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso artery zzso zzso remains zzso This study investigates whether magnetic resonance zzso zzso artery flow zzso relative to zzso zzso volume can predict clinical outcome following zzso 

The data on 23 patients (13 men, 10 zzso age range zzso years, mean age 64 zzso were zzso The indication for treatment was hypertension zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirty-four cases of zzso were zzso bilateral disease was manifest in 11 and unilateral disease in 12 zzso The MR imaging protocol included a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence for zzso flow measurement and a fast zzso zzso zzso sequence for zzso volume zzso MR zzso were performed on the day prior to and the day following zzso Clinical success was defined as zzso a reduction in zzso blood pressure zzso zzso or zzso a reduction in serum zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso as normal volume or low zzso A zzso flow index zzso was calculated by dividing the zzso flow zzso by the zzso volume zzso 

Clinical success was observed in zzso Twelve patients did not benefit from zzso zzso kidney volume was seen in 10 of 11 zzso and in 8 of 12 zzso resulting in a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso a positive zzso value zzso of zzso and a negative zzso value zzso of zzso A zzso below a threshold of zzso zzso predicted successful outcome with zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The combination of normal zzso volume and a zzso below zzso zzso identified zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a greater increase in zzso flow in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A combination of zzso zzso MR zzso flow and zzso volume zzso enables identification of patients benefiting from zzso with a high sensitivity and zzso but only moderate specificity and zzso
