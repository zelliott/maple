Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging can be used to study zzso structure in zzso by monitoring the abundance of an injected zzso contrast agent over zzso The resulting zzso resolved zzso zzso are usually interpreted in terms of kinetic parameters obtained by fitting a zzso model to the observed zzso zzso squares estimates of the highly zzso model zzso however, can exhibit high zzso and can be severely zzso As a zzso we bring to bear spatial prior knowledge by means of a generalized zzso zzso random field zzso By using information from neighboring zzso and computing the maximum a zzso solution for entire zzso maps at once, both bias and zzso of the zzso estimates can be reduced thus leading to smaller root mean square error zzso Since the number of variables gets very big for common image resolutions, sparse zzso have to be zzso To this end, we propose a generalized zzso conditional modes zzso zzso operating on blocks instead of sites which is shown to zzso considerably faster than the conventional ICM zzso zzso on simulated zzso images show a clear reduction of zzso and zzso as well as, in some cases, reduced zzso zzso The mean residual bias zzso is reduced on the simulated data as well as for all 37 patients of a prostate zzso zzso Using the proposed algorithm, average zzso times only increase by a factor of zzso zzso zzso per zzso for a zzso prior and zzso zzso s per zzso for an zzso prior compared to the single zzso approach zzso zzso per zzso
