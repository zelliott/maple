In this experimental study, we wanted to evaluate the zzso value of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging in pelvic floor anatomy during pelvic floor muscle zzso in zzso women and women with urinary zzso zzso 

Eight zzso with stress urinary symptoms and eight zzso women were scanned with a zzso T GE zzso zzso high-speed scanner with real time zzso imaging zzso The zzso and dynamic anatomical status of the zzso zzso muscle was zzso 

In zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso images, the zzso muscle appeared as zzso at zzso The thickness of the zzso part of zzso muscle correlated significantly with zzso values during a zzso zzso The most obvious defects seen in the zzso muscle were asymmetry in thickness and loss of fiber zzso 

zzso and zzso relationships in the pelvic floor can be demonstrated by the combined use of zzso and zzso providing a better understanding of the zzso mechanisms behind stress zzso in zzso
