A number of zzso defects have been described in zzso zzso This study systematically examined the zzso systems of 13 individuals previously diagnosed with zzso zzso Twelve had the characteristic zzso tooth zzso seen on magnetic resonance imaging zzso In all individuals, smooth pursuit gain and zzso zzso cancellation were decreased in the horizontal and vertical directions and zzso zzso when generated, were zzso We believe that these defects arise from a disorder in the zzso zzso zzso All individuals also had partial to complete zzso zzso in which initiation of zzso was prolonged or zzso The zzso zzso in zzso syndrome differs from zzso idiopathic zzso zzso in that both zzso zzso and quick zzso of zzso were impaired both in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the defects did not resolve with zzso We believe that the zzso zzso arises from a disorder involving the projections from the superior zzso to the zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso A subset of individuals also had severe visual loss, zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso and decreased zzso zzso We believe that this is a form of zzso zzso occasionally associated with zzso zzso In zzso key zzso features of zzso syndrome are decreased smooth pursuit and zzso zzso zzso partial to complete zzso zzso both in the horizontal and vertical directions, and zzso zzso if zzso zzso is not zzso
