zzso of cortical development zzso are increasingly recognized as important causes of zzso zzso zzso and other neurological zzso zzso a type of zzso is characterized by many small zzso separated by shallow zzso a slightly thick cortex, zzso zzso and often enlarged zzso The present descriptive study analysis the zzso and zzso findings of patients with zzso and zzso without zzso 

We studied six zzso mean age was 27 years, who had evidence of zzso in zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso model was used to estimate the location of zzso spike zzso zzso Analysis was performed on selected data segments containing zzso zzso zzso results were combined with zzso to create magnetic source images zzso 

In all cases we present results of zzso zzso zzso monitoring, and other functional zzso studies if zzso 

zzso can be used to accurately zzso sources of zzso zzso As such zzso can play a role of directly determining the functional zzso significance of abnormalities depicted in zzso
