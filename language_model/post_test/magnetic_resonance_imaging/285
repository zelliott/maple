Identification of individuals at high risk of developing psychosis has relied on zzso zzso Recently, machine learning zzso have been successfully used for magnetic resonance zzso diagnostic zzso of zzso patient zzso 

To determine whether zzso zzso pattern zzso zzso identification of individuals in different zzso mental states zzso of psychosis and enables the prediction of disease transition at the individual zzso 

zzso zzso pattern zzso was performed on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of individuals in early or late zzso vs healthy controls zzso The zzso power of the method was then evaluated by zzso the baseline imaging data of individuals with transition to psychosis vs those without transition vs zzso after 4 years of clinical zzso zzso zzso was estimated by zzso and by zzso an independent cohort of 45 new zzso 

Departments of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The first zzso analysis included 20 early and 25 late zzso individuals and 25 matched zzso The second analysis consisted of 15 individuals with transition, 18 without transition, and 17 matched zzso 

zzso sensitivity, and accuracy of zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso of the first analysis were zzso zzso vs the zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals vs the zzso and zzso zzso zzso individuals vs the zzso The zzso in the second analysis were zzso zzso vs the zzso zzso zzso with transition vs the zzso and zzso zzso without transition vs the zzso Independent zzso were correctly classified in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

Different zzso and their clinical outcomes may be reliably identified on an individual basis by assessing patterns of zzso zzso zzso These patterns may serve as valuable zzso for the zzso to guide early detection in the zzso phase of zzso
