Fast zzso echo zzso MR imaging during zzso was performed in 73 abdominal MR examinations in order to determine the value of GE technique in the reduction of movement zzso and improvement of image zzso The results were compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images consistently demonstrated normal anatomy and zzso zzso and intermediate GE technique proved to be superior to zzso zzso technique in a considerable number of cases providing not only better zzso of normal structures but also better zzso zzso At this stage GE technique should be considered as an adjunct to zzso zzso zzso If the zzso presently inherent to GE imaging could be reduced or compensated for, this technique of rapid MR imaging during suspended zzso could become an important tool being one of the fastest techniques for abdominal MR zzso
