One of the most commonly reported injuries in children who participate in sports is concussion or mild traumatic brain injury zzso Children and youth involved in organized sports such as competitive hockey are nearly six times more likely to suffer a severe concussion compared to children involved in other leisure physical zzso While the most common cognitive zzso of zzso appear similar for children and adults, the recovery profile and breadth of consequences in children remains largely unknown, as does the influence of zzso characteristics zzso zzso and injury details zzso magnitude and direction of zzso on long-term zzso Competitive sports, such as hockey, allow the rare opportunity to zzso a zzso design to obtain zzso data before concussion occurs on youth characteristics and functioning and to relate this to outcome following zzso Our primary goals are to refine pediatric concussion diagnosis and management based on research evidence that is specific to children and zzso To do this we use new, zzso and zzso approaches that will: zzso Evaluate the immediate effects of head trauma in zzso zzso Monitor the resolution of zzso symptoms zzso and cognitive performance during zzso zzso zzso new methods to verify brain injury and zzso To achieve our goals, we have implemented the Head Impact zzso zzso zzso zzso Lebanon, NH, zzso This system zzso commercially available Easton zzso hockey zzso zzso zzso Van Nuys, CA, zzso with zzso zzso designed to measure real-time head zzso during contact sport zzso By using zzso technology, the magnitude of acceleration and location of all head impacts during sport participation can be zzso detected and zzso We also use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to zzso and assess changes in neural activity specifically in the zzso zzso and frontal zzso during the performance of cognitive tasks, since those are the cerebral regions most sensitive to zzso head zzso Finally, we are acquiring structural imaging data sensitive to damage in brain white zzso
