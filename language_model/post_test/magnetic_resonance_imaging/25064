Water diffusion within the brain is studied zzso for various clinical zzso The zzso procedure used in this work is based on the zzso weighted residual method of zzso zzso A wide range of pertinent parameters such as Lewis number, cell volume, and the zzso ratio are considered in the present zzso Comparisons with previously published work show excellent zzso The results show that the diffusion zzso cell volume, and the zzso ratio play significant roles on the characterization of the mass and heat transfer mechanisms within the zzso Concentration maps are developed for various clinical zzso zzso results for the zzso zzso and the mass and heat transfer rates in terms of the average Sherwood and zzso numbers are presented and discussed for different zzso zzso Experimental tests are also conducted to produce an 8 zzso image which is compared with our zzso zzso The present study provides essential maps for brain disorders classified based on several pertinent clinical zzso
