zzso zzso studies of schizophrenia have yielded a diversity of zzso To help characterize regional gray matter changes in zzso we used an automated region of interest zzso approach that targeted frontal and zzso regions in schizophrenia zzso The sample compromised 43 schizophrenia patients (21 chronic patients, 22 zzso first episode zzso 20 first episode zzso psychosis patients and 47 comparison zzso zzso regional volume measurement was performed in 22 zzso including frontal and zzso cortical zzso and zzso zzso between volume measures, duration of illness and clinical scores were zzso zzso schizophrenia patients showed gray matter volume differences in left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and right supplementary motor area zzso First episode psychosis patients presented smaller right anterior zzso zzso zzso and left zzso than comparison zzso zzso scores and duration of illness correlated zzso with gray matter volume of zzso and zzso in chronic schizophrenia zzso Using an automated zzso method, we found volume reductions in lateral and zzso frontal regions in both first episode and chronic zzso The automated zzso method can be used as a valid and efficient tool for zzso of regional gray matter volume in schizophrenia in multiple zzso across the brains of large numbers of zzso
