We present a case zzso with zzso visual zzso following zzso stroke affecting the right zzso and the left zzso pathways of the visual zzso Despite his inability to identify global zzso letters zzso zzso zzso Forest before zzso The zzso of global features in visual zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso and his dense object zzso zzso showed normal zzso interference when responding to local letters in Navon zzso stimuli and significant zzso identity zzso in a semantic decision task for zzso Since zzso was absent if these features were zzso it stands to reason that these effects were not due to zzso by distinctive zzso The contrast between zzso effects induced by coherent and scrambled stimuli is consistent with implicit but not explicit integration of features into a unified zzso We went on to show that zzso object decisions were facilitated by words in a zzso zzso task, suggesting that zzso could activate zzso integrated images in a backward zzso We conclude that the absence of zzso ability to identify visual objects except through tedious serial construction reflects a deficit in zzso an integrated visual representation through bottom-up visual processing zzso However, zzso generated images can help activate these visual representations through semantic zzso
