We investigated the role of new MR Imaging techniques for the diagnosis, characterization and staging of zzso zzso zzso We examined 21 patients (30 zzso zzso 7 men and 14 women, ranging in age 26 to 74 years, with known zzso zzso MR examinations were carried out on a zzso zzso magnet zzso zzso zzso Philips Medical zzso with the following imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso SE, zzso zzso zzso zzso and fat suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso examinations were performed with zzso Time of Flight sequences zzso zzso 33 zzso TE zzso zzso zzso flip angle zzso 60 zzso slice thickness zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 256 zzso zzso number of slices zzso zzso acquisition time zzso 4 zzso 19 zzso while MR zzso was performed with zzso fat suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 700 zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso time zzso 5 zzso 48 zzso zzso correctly detected all the zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was correct in all the zzso larger than 3 zzso where typical signs consistent with zzso disease were zzso zzso images always showed the inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The portal vessels were demonstrated only up to the first zzso In 3 cases an zzso zzso of the inferior zzso zzso was zzso zzso performed in 7 cases, showed normal main zzso duct caliber in 6 cases, while in another case, where a zzso zzso inside the zzso zzso the communication between the zzso and the zzso ducts was clearly zzso In conclusion, MR Imaging is a valuable tool in the study of liver zzso zzso Moreover, the availability of such new MR techniques as zzso and zzso greatly improves the diagnostic role of MR imaging, especially when studying complications and before zzso
