To analyze zzso features related to zzso volume reduction after treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso in needle biopsy specimens obtained before zzso 

Prospective clinical zzso 

University teaching zzso 

Twenty women with normal zzso cycles and symptomatic zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was administered zzso zzso zzso for at least 16 zzso zzso needle biopsy of the zzso zzso was done before this zzso 

The relation between zzso features zzso of zzso zzso change, and collagen zzso and the percent decrease in the volume of the largest zzso at 16 weeks measured by magnetic resonance zzso 

The correlation between the degree of zzso change and the percent decrease in the zzso volume was zzso as was that with the proportion of zzso tissue in the zzso 

We predicted zzso volume reduction after treatment with a zzso zzso by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso before zzso
