There is a recent focus on zzso of the portal vein by transplanted zzso as a major cause of early graft zzso The zzso zzso causes necrosis or zzso of cells within the zzso Thus, zzso assessment of the liver receiving the zzso transplant is important to evaluate the status zzso zzso 

This study used zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for assessment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso diabetic mice were zzso zzso and zzso liver assessments were performed at 0, 2, and 28 days after zzso zzso assessment of insulin, zzso induced factor zzso and zzso were undertaken at similar time zzso 

zzso regions in the liver were detected by zzso at 2 days but not at 28 days after transplantation and were confirmed zzso Liver injury was zzso from high intensity areas on zzso zzso zzso release peaked 2 days after zzso 

zzso and reversal of liver zzso due to zzso zzso transplantation are zzso using zzso zzso These changes coincide with periods of maximum insulin release likely due to partial zzso zzso We propose that zzso as a zzso monitor of zzso zzso may be useful in assessment of liver and zzso zzso after zzso zzso transplantation in a clinical zzso
