zzso is one of the most disabling symptoms in multiple sclerosis zzso and there is increasing evidence it has a central zzso Our aim was to assess the impact of mental fatigue on motor zzso cerebral zzso Ten zzso zzso patients with fatigue were recruited and compared with seven zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data were acquired while subjects performed a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso Task zzso was administered to induce fatigue and the zzso motor paradigm was then zzso Our results revealed that the zzso altered the zzso patients' zzso patterns on the motor zzso After the mentally fatiguing zzso task, repeating the motor task was associated with patients recruiting significantly more of their brain including bilateral zzso zzso and left primary sensory cortex, while zzso less of the left zzso and supplementary motor zzso The control subjects decreased their level of zzso after the zzso Our current results reveal that a challenging mental task can alter the pattern and increase the volume of cerebral zzso on an unrelated motor task in fatigued zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that a zzso for zzso fatigue could be a generally elevated demand placed on functioning neural zzso
