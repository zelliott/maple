We present for the first time a complete characterization of a zzso for high resolution MR imaging of zzso and zzso samples based on three-dimensional zzso zzso per unit current zzso and zzso zzso The zzso are zzso using a fully zzso systems zzso compatible process in conjunction with an automatic zzso We present 15 zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso maps performed using the phase difference zzso The resulting zzso variation in the range of zzso zzso to zzso zzso around the zzso center, compares favorably with the zzso zzso limit accepted for MR zzso zzso zzso maps of 40 zzso zzso zzso size were acquired according to the extended zzso flip angle zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the characterized zzso provides a high and uniform sensitivity distribution around its center zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is in agreement with the corresponding zzso theoretical data zzso along the zzso zzso The zzso zzso maps reveal a rather uniform signal distribution around the zzso center with a mean value of zzso zzso zzso in good agreement with the zzso zzso data along zzso axis in the zzso zzso Finally, we prove the zzso capabilities for MR zzso by imaging zzso zzso cells with 18 zzso zzso zzso
