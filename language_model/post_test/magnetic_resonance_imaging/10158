To investigate the relationship between the severity of white matter zzso zzso and cortical zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and control subjects zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso density and zzso MR images was scored using a modified version of the zzso rating scale by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Analysis demonstrated significantly lower mean cortical zzso zzso zzso rates in zzso zzso when compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects had higher mean severity of zzso zzso when compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso When zzso severity was entered into the analysis of zzso model, there was no significant zzso effect on cortical zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso presence of mild to moderate zzso in patients with zzso does not have a significant effect on cortical zzso zzso
