zzso of the molecular background of functional magnetic resonance zzso images is required to fully exploit their potential in cancer zzso We explored the zzso impact of dynamic zzso MR imaging zzso parameters in cervical cancer combined with global gene expression data to reveal their underlying molecular zzso and construct a representative gene signature for the relevant zzso On the basis of 78 patients with cervical cancer subjected to zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso analysis of zzso images based on the zzso model, in which tumors with low zzso appeared to be most zzso Gene set analysis of 46 tumors with zzso zzso and gene expression data showed a significant correlation between zzso and the zzso gene sets, whereas gene sets related to other tumor zzso were not zzso zzso gene sets specific for cervical cancer created in cell culture experiments, including both targets of the zzso zzso factor zzso and the unfolded protein response, were the most zzso In the remaining 32 tumors, low zzso was associated with zzso of zzso protein zzso as assessed by zzso consistent with increased zzso On the basis of the zzso gene sets, a signature of 31 genes that were zzso in tumors with low zzso was zzso This zzso zzso gene signature showed zzso impact in an independent validation cohort of 109 zzso Our findings reveal the molecular basis of an aggressive hypoxic zzso and suggest the use of zzso to zzso identify patients with zzso zzso
