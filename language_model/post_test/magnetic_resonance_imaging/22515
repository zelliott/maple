It has been shown that the use of zzso zzso impacted on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The goals of this study were to evaluate zzso the impact of zzso zzso on dose distribution, and zzso the impact of zzso zzso on target volume zzso and dose zzso 

zzso patients with zzso cell zzso of the zzso or zzso were treated with zzso intent by forward planning zzso Prior to treatment and on average after a dose of 46 zzso all patients underwent zzso CT, zzso and zzso After zzso zzso were delineated manually on CT and zzso and automatically on zzso From these volumes, zzso and zzso were derived using consistent zzso Planning was performed using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso zzso were significantly smaller than those based on zzso zzso Such difference in target volumes zzso translated into a significant reduction in the zzso volumes zzso of 13 and zzso of the zzso and zzso respectively), zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and CT based plans, zzso and to zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and CT based plans, zzso TVs based on zzso CT or zzso were also significantly smaller compared to those delineated from zzso zzso Volumes delineated with zzso were significantly smaller than those delineated with zzso Due to zzso zzso zzso automatic zzso of zzso zzso could not be zzso Such reductions in TVs translated into a reduction of the zzso volumes compared to zzso CT planning zzso for zzso of 19 and zzso and for zzso of 22 and zzso for CT and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso were also reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso for CT and of zzso for zzso compared to zzso for zzso zzso 

The use of zzso zzso and zzso CT or zzso significantly impacts on the zzso of TVs in zzso zzso translating into more normal tissue sparing after zzso zzso zzso
