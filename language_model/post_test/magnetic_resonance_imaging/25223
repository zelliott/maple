To compare the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso with dynamic zzso zzso zzso on the basis of zzso results, and to determine the clinical value of these methods as zzso to zzso 

A total of 90 consecutive women with 111 zzso verified breast zzso were enrolled in the zzso Patients underwent zzso and zzso in addition to zzso Each finding was classified on a zzso zzso rating scale describing the degree of suspicion for zzso and all findings were correlated with the zzso zzso 

The overall zzso was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso showed higher sensitivity zzso zzso zzso but its specificity was lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso analysis, significant improvement ( p zzso zzso was found between zzso and the combination of zzso + zzso while zzso + zzso showed no higher diagnostic accuracy than zzso zzso 

If high sensitivity and spatial resolution are needed, zzso is to be preferred in clinical practice as an adjunct to zzso rather than zzso
