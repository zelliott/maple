Over the past decade, examination of functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging has become an important tool to investigate functional changes in patient zzso healthy aging, and recently also child zzso Most prior zzso studies focused on functional connectivity between brain regions important for cognitive or emotional control and the so-called zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso functional connectivity in children zzso years; N zzso zzso and young adults zzso years; N zzso 29), without a zzso restrictions to specific zzso We found similar patterns of functionally connected regions in children and young adults, but there were differences in the size of functionally connected regions zzso the number of zzso as well as in the strength of functional connectivity zzso the correlation zzso between brain zzso This indicates that functional connectivity continues to change during zzso zzso differences were found across the whole brain, but the effects differed for functional connectivity patterns associated with higher cognitive or emotional functions and functional connectivity patterns associated with basic visual and zzso zzso Finally, we showed that the majority of functional connectivity differences could not be explained on the basis of gray matter density zzso
