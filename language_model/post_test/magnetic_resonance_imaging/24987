To evaluate the normal anatomy of the structures supporting the zzso portion of the fifth zzso bone and investigate the zzso of fractures in this zzso 

In two zzso feet, the region of the lateral component of the zzso zzso zzso short zzso muscle zzso tendon, and third zzso muscle zzso zzso was zzso These two foot specimens and four zzso foot specimens were studied at magnetic resonance zzso zzso Two of the six specimens were studied at zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso foot specimens enabled zzso zzso In two additional zzso simulation of the presumed mechanism of fifth zzso bone fracture was zzso The zzso CT, and MR images obtained in 13 patients with fractures of the zzso portion of the fifth zzso bone were zzso 

zzso CT, and MR imaging studies revealed broad zzso of the PAL into the zzso aspect of the zzso portion of the fifth zzso bone in all zzso The zzso zzso was consistently attached more zzso and to the lateral side of the zzso blending with the PAL zzso The zzso zzso was zzso identified inserting zzso to the zzso zzso No fracture was created in the specimens subjected to attempted zzso zzso attachment of the PAL and the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was confirmed in clinical zzso 

The zzso of fractures of the zzso portion of the fifth zzso bone appears to be related to zzso injury of PAL and zzso zzso zzso
