In this paper we develop a novel approach for computing zzso maps between anatomical surfaces with the ability of aligning anatomical features and achieving greatly reduced metric zzso In contrast to conventional approaches that focused on zzso maps to the sphere or plane, our method zzso the zzso map between surfaces in the embedding space formed the zzso defined zzso zzso zzso zzso the power of LB zzso as zzso zzso of global zzso the zzso maps zzso by our method can effectively align anatomical features on cortical zzso By computing such zzso zzso maps to a zzso optimal zzso surface, which is also zzso with metric zzso in the LB embedding space, we develop a fully automated system for cortical labeling with the fusion of labels on a large number of zzso zzso In our experiments, we build our system with 40 labeled surfaces and demonstrate its excellent performance with zzso cross zzso We also applied the automated labeling system to cortical surfaces reconstructed from MR scans of 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso and 50 normal controls zzso to illustrate its zzso and effectiveness in clinical data zzso
