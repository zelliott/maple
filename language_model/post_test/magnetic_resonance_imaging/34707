To determine the usefulness of zzso zzso CT zzso in the diagnosis of acute Japanese encephalitis zzso 

We examined 10 patients (six men and four zzso mean age, 69 zzso with viral zzso We divided the cases into two groups: the zzso group zzso zzso 4) and the zzso group zzso zzso 6; two with zzso zzso encephalitis and four with encephalitis of unknown zzso All cases were investigated with zzso zzso zzso zzso within 15 days after the onset of zzso Two patients in the zzso group were also zzso by zzso at a later zzso In all cases MR imaging was performed after the zzso zzso 

In the acute stage, all patients in the zzso group showed a marked increase of zzso zzso that matched the zzso area observed on MR images in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of two patients with zzso revealed a decrease of zzso deposition in the areas of high zzso None of the patients in the zzso group had an increased zzso of zzso in the zzso or the zzso 

zzso is helpful in zzso zzso from zzso zzso encephalitis and other types of zzso zzso may be useful as a diagnostic tool in the early stages of zzso
