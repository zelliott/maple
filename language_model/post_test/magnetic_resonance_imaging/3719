zzso zzso zzso has contributions from zzso zzso and zzso cerebral blood volume zzso zzso To examine the relative contribution of zzso zzso change zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes zzso to a zzso zzso stimulation in six zzso zzso rats were measured using a zzso zzso zzso technique, while total zzso change zzso was measured with injection of iron oxide zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso from zzso We observed a fast zzso response with a time constant of zzso zzso zzso and a slower zzso response with a time constant of zzso zzso zzso and an onset delay of zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with earlier studies under different zzso and zzso supporting that fast zzso and slow zzso responses are zzso Assuming the observed zzso zzso zzso is at least partly explained by the zzso contribution, the relative contribution of the zzso and zzso components to the zzso response was zzso The relative zzso contribution increases with time during zzso zzso it is zzso during initial zzso and reaches a maximum possible value of zzso relative to the zzso contribution during the zzso period after stimulus zzso Our data indicates that the contribution of zzso zzso change to zzso zzso is dominant for short zzso
