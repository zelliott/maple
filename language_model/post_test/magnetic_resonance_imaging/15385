A conceptual model of lateral muscular tension in patients presenting zzso associated zzso zzso has been recently zzso Clinical improvement has been achieved by using acupuncture on points belonging to the so-called extraordinary zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the anatomical structures related to these acupuncture points by means of zzso zzso image rendering relying on external zzso 

The investigation was carried out the index case patient of the lateral tension zzso A licensed medical acupuncture practitioner located the following acupuncture zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso 6, the zzso zzso 6 (Nan zzso zzso 2) Yang zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 62, zzso 59, zzso 61, and the zzso zzso 62 (Nan zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso Liver 13, zzso zzso 26, zzso zzso 27, zzso zzso 28, and zzso zzso zzso The points were marked by taping a zzso capsule on the zzso Imaging was done on a zzso zzso zzso MR scanner using an array head and body zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso as routinely used for patient zzso were used to obtain zzso zzso The image data were rendered in zzso modus using dedicated software zzso zzso 

Points of the zzso zzso zzso the level of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Points of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso side of the zzso to zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso as well as to muscular structures of the zzso zzso on the foot zzso Points of the Yang zzso zzso zzso the lateral side of the zzso to zzso structures of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the lateral surface of the zzso and close to the foot sole to the zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso investigation has revealed the anatomical relations of acupuncture points belonging to 3 of the so-called extraordinary zzso We conclude that the clinically developed zzso concept of lateral zzso is related to zzso zzso
