Using zzso zzso zzso PET zzso the authors have undertaken a quantitative analysis of all zzso visible on zzso or zzso zzso zzso to determine the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso activity on zzso 

zzso sclerosis complex zzso is an zzso dominant disorder, often associated with cortical zzso and intractable zzso The authors have shown previously that zzso PET scans show high zzso zzso in some zzso zzso and low zzso in the remaining zzso 

zzso children, age 7 months to 16 years, were zzso Patients underwent zzso monitoring, PET scans of zzso and zzso and zzso or zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso values were measured in 258 cortical zzso delineated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso ratios were calculated between the zzso zzso in zzso and those for normal zzso zzso zzso Using the region of zzso activity, the authors performed receiver operator characteristics zzso analysis and determined the optimal zzso ratio for detecting presumed zzso zzso 

zzso zzso ratios ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso ratios in the zzso zzso were higher than those in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All 15 patients with focal seizure activity showed one or more zzso with zzso ratio above zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a zzso zzso ratio of zzso resulted in a specificity of zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso greater than or equal to normal zzso are significantly related to zzso activity in that zzso Together, zzso zzso PET and zzso zzso improve the detection of potentially zzso zzso in patients with zzso being evaluated for zzso zzso
