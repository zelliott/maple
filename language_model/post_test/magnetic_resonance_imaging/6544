To detect structural adaptations of collagen fiber zzso in compressed zzso cartilage in individual zzso zones by microscopic magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 23 zzso in-depth zzso 

Each of the six beagle zzso cartilage specimens was placed in a specially built zzso zzso device inside an zzso rotation device, and was zzso four times at zzso without and during zzso zzso and at two zzso 0 degrees and 55 degrees zzso zzso intensity images and quantitative zzso maps were constructed and zzso 

Upon zzso at 55 degrees (the magic zzso rather than appearing zzso zzso intensity images of cartilage showed a distinct zzso appearance and the zzso profiles exhibited two distinctive zzso At both 0 degrees and 55 degrees zzso lower values of zzso were observed in compressed zzso A significant correlation was established between changes in tissue zzso at 55 degrees and a thickness reduction due to zzso At a mean of zzso strain value, modifications in cartilage structure were studied at each zzso zzso We found that the percentage of superficial zone was significantly doubled, the percentage of zzso zone was significantly decreased by zzso and no significant change in the transitional zzso 

External loading can induce a new kind of zzso appearance at the magic zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to analyze the zzso zzso in collagen zzso organization in zzso cartilage in response to mechanical zzso
