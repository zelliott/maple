Two tests of zzso hearing, namely intensity discrimination of alternating zzso zzso and zzso time difference zzso discrimination of zzso zzso were performed in 28 patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and 12 with an isolated zzso zzso compatible with zzso zzso discrimination defects were found in zzso and zzso defects in zzso of zzso zzso cases, although no overt auditory symptoms were reported and pure tone zzso was zzso zzso figures in the isolated zzso group were zzso and zzso zzso were zzso either by an abnormal zzso in zzso of one ear or by a broadened zzso of responses zzso greater range of zzso zzso auditory evoked zzso zzso were abnormal in zzso of the zzso zzso cases but only in zzso of the isolated zzso zzso zzso abnormalities involving component III on one or both sides were invariably associated with a zzso of zzso zzso This is consistent with disruption of input to the superior zzso complex, the most peripheral structure where zzso responsive units are sensitive to zzso zzso causing zzso of component V alone less frequently resulted in impaired zzso discrimination, possibly because at zzso levels the zzso is zzso by the location rather than the timing of zzso zzso In magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso or zzso were demonstrated in all zzso patients tested and zzso of those with isolated zzso zzso The correlation with zzso abnormalities was plausible in some patients but apparently anomalous in zzso More severe zzso abnormalities than would have been expected on the basis of zzso may have been due to small unresolved zzso while the more frequent finding of normal or mildly abnormal zzso in conjunction with extensive zzso abnormalities may have been due to the fact that areas of abnormal signal reflect an increase in the water content of the tissue rather than zzso per zzso
