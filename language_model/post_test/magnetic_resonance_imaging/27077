zzso is associated with chronic zzso systemic inflammation and increased inflammation in the zzso a key structure in feeding zzso It remains unknown whether inflammation impacts other brain structures that regulate feeding zzso We studied 44 zzso and 19 lean individuals with zzso and plasma zzso levels zzso of zzso We performed zzso zzso of the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gray matter zzso volumes were adjusted for head size zzso We conducted zzso and zzso zzso to assess the association between zzso levels and brain zzso zzso Using diffusion zzso imaging zzso we created apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps and conducted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher among the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso associated together with zzso correctly classified those with excess of weight zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso The lateral zzso volumes of zzso were zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and after accounting for age, hypertension, zzso ratio and zzso and sugar levels, zzso significantly explained an additional zzso of the zzso in the lateral zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Among zzso the associations between zzso zzso and zzso were significantly positive zzso zzso zzso in the left and right zzso and the right zzso zzso Among lean individuals these associations were negative and located in the left zzso the right zzso and the left zzso zzso This is the first study to report that zzso inflammation may reduce the integrity of some of the brain structures involved in reward and feeding zzso
