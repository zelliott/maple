The specific motor control processes supported by the zzso and impaired with zzso damage remain zzso The zzso has been implicated in both planning and updating of accurate zzso Previously, we used a statistical model to parcel aiming performance that was constrained by a zzso paradigm into contributions attributed to a specified plan and zzso zzso Here, we apply this procedure to determine the putative role of the zzso in planning and updating zzso aiming by comparing the performance of subjects with unilateral zzso stroke to zzso zzso rapidly moved to targets in predictable or unpredictable conditions and zzso subjects used the zzso limb to control for zzso motor execution zzso zzso movement zzso was used in the statistical model to determine the effect of planning and updating on zzso Compared to controls, the zzso group demonstrated errors in final position that were primarily determined by planning zzso This finding is manifest in four ways: zzso subjects zzso were less accurate than controls in both predictable and unpredictable zzso zzso they showed minimal benefit from increased preparation time for target zzso zzso zzso with ample time to plan direction, wrong direction response frequency was zzso and zzso final position was minimally determined by the zzso Because these deficits were found zzso to the moving zzso the zzso role in planning is not zzso to one zzso but rather our findings suggest that zzso output affects motor planning for both upper zzso Indeed, a zzso analysis showed that the zzso nucleus, an area implicated in planning motor strategies and the primary zzso output nucleus, was the only common region affected by our patient group with zzso zzso zzso
