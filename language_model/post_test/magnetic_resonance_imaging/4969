To study measurement zzso and zzso zzso on measurement stability for phase contrast zzso zzso zzso of zzso volume changes zzso of brain zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso 

Total cerebral blood flow zzso total internal jugular flow zzso and spinal zzso flow at zzso level and zzso in the aqueduct was measured using five repetitions in 20 healthy zzso After zzso net flow, zzso were integrated to calculate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso The zzso correlation zzso zzso was used to measure zzso zzso errors were investigated by a series of phantom zzso 

For zzso calculated from zzso zzso and both zzso zzso the zzso was zzso zzso from the zzso zzso decreased zzso between repetitions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume being shifted out from the zzso was correlated with zzso calculated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso errors increased at resolutions zzso zzso per zzso 

zzso of zzso calculated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso allows useful zzso The zzso time in the MR system and imaging resolution should be considered when interpreting volume zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume changes was associated with zzso volume zzso
