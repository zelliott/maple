To delineate the frequency, severity, and characteristics of the brain injury occurring in children surviving extremely premature birth, we reviewed brain magnetic resonance images zzso of children with cerebral zzso whose zzso was less than 1000 g and whose zzso age was less than 28 zzso The patients were all enrolled in the state Children's zzso Services clinic, where cerebral zzso is an automatic qualifying zzso We tabulated the zzso findings with respect to the zzso zzso white matter, and corpus zzso The inclusion criteria were met by 157 children; 94 had an zzso The available scans were reviewed by the authors, and the findings were zzso Fifty scans were available for zzso There were 4 totally normal scans, 18 scans had normal zzso imaging, and 8 scans were felt to have normal cerebral zzso The common cerebral abnormalities included decreased zzso volume without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a thin corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were found in zzso The zzso findings included destruction of major portions of the zzso (usually the inferior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal or unilateral loss of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso The high zzso of injury to the zzso has not been previously zzso The most common cerebral injury is decreased volume of white matter in the zzso regions without zzso The pattern of zzso injury suggests a vascular zzso and the deficient white matter without zzso suggests zzso of zzso with limited response to zzso Both zzso are more or less unique to the age at which the insult occurred and represent an emerging, newly recognized type of cerebral zzso
