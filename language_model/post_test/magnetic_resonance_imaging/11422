zzso is the second most common form of degenerative zzso accounting for up to zzso of cases in the zzso It is characterized by fluctuating cognitive zzso spontaneous zzso and zzso visual zzso Consensus clinical criteria have been published and have been shown to have high zzso but they may still lack zzso zzso zzso may be classified as a zzso body zzso disorder and/or as an zzso It is probable that a spectrum of LB disorders exists with the clinical features reflecting the distribution and severity of zzso Although both zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso show a reduction in zzso zzso transmission from the zzso zzso in zzso there are also deficits in zzso transmission from brain stem zzso zzso cortical zzso receptors are more functionally intact in zzso suggesting potential responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso findings indicate a relative preservation of zzso zzso lobe structures in zzso but similar distribution of white matter changes on zzso compared with zzso zzso in zzso zzso pathways in zzso have been demonstrated with functional zzso using zzso highlighting zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies also indicate subtle differences in zzso patterns on zzso with a greater degree of zzso zzso in zzso compared with zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso is clinically important as the management of psychosis and zzso disturbances is complicated by sensitivity to zzso zzso There is accumulating evidence to suggest that zzso may be particularly amenable to zzso zzso The clinical management of zzso is considered using a four step approach: making a zzso identification of problem zzso appropriate zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso
