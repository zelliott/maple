The zzso zzso refers to fluid zzso inversion recovery zzso which are zzso MR pulse sequences with liquor signal zzso by a long zzso They are characterized by long zzso and TE and therefore the acquisition time is very long in the conventional mode, while fast imaging (the zzso zzso reduces acquisition time to less than 2 zzso Our study was aimed at zzso the use of this type of sequence in zzso zzso All the exams were performed with an MR unit with a zzso magnetic zzso We carried out 150 zzso exams with this pulse sequence on patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso This technique is very useful to study zzso or cortical zzso in multiple sclerosis and in other zzso cerebral conditions zzso multiple zzso or zzso zzso but we pointed out the following other zzso better definition of the extent of zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso better differentiation of zzso from zzso cavities and exact characterization of cortical damage in cerebral zzso zzso zzso also for the differential zzso Moreover, zzso pulse sequences could diagnose some globe conditions, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso with no need of contrast agent zzso In contrast, they were useless to study deep zzso areas, solid zzso zzso zzso zzso areas, intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso technique is a major diagnostic tool in zzso MR studies because they overcome such limitations of zzso zzso zzso sequences as blurring zzso moreover, their acquisition time is always very zzso In some cases, zzso images are decisive for the zzso
