zzso blood flow can be studied in a zzso mode with a recently proposed zzso sequence using inversion of water spins as an zzso zzso without zzso transfer zzso The zzso transfer insensitive labeling technique zzso has been used for mapping blood flow changes at a zzso level under motor zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso mapping is achieved by zzso of a zzso image from a control zzso zzso weighting is accomplished by zzso blood labeling using two 90 degrees zzso zzso zzso For control preparation the labeling zzso are modified such that they have no net effect on blood water zzso The percentage of blood flow change, as well as its spatial extent, has been studied in single and zzso modes with varying delays between labeling and zzso The average zzso signal change due to zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso experiments and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The volume of activated brain areas amounted to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso primary motor zzso area, zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso area, zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso areas, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the supplementary motor zzso
