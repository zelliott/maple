zzso zzso imaging zzso has been proposed as a sensitive zzso of traumatic white matter injury, which could potentially serve as a tool for zzso assessment and for studying zzso changes during recovery from traumatic brain injury zzso However, there is a lack of zzso studies on zzso that follow zzso changes over time and correlate findings with long-term clinical zzso We performed a prospective zzso study of 30 adult patients admitted for zzso rehabilitation following severe traumatic brain zzso zzso and conventional zzso were acquired at mean 8 weeks zzso weeks), and repeated in 23 of the patients at mean 12 months zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, zzso parameters were compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and zzso with a similar zzso as that of zzso At the initial zzso fractional zzso was reduced in all the investigated white matter regions in patients compared to controls zzso zzso zzso due to decreased zzso parallel zzso and increased zzso perpendicular zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso correlated with approximately 1 year zzso outcome scale score zzso zzso zzso zzso and in this sample predicted zzso outcome with zzso accuracy when taken alone, and with zzso accuracy in combination with clinical evaluation by functional independence measure at the time of the first zzso At follow-up zzso fractional zzso in patients had increased in the internal capsule and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to an zzso increase of zzso with unchanged zzso In these regions, fractional zzso and zzso zzso reached normal or zzso levels, primarily in patients with zzso zzso In the cerebral zzso and in corpus zzso zzso and zzso both increased during the scan zzso and, particularly in patients with zzso outcome, fractional zzso remained zzso No significant zzso zzso changes over time were found in controls, or in zzso of zzso These findings support that zzso is a clinically relevant zzso in zzso which may have zzso value and also might serve as a tool for revealing changes in the neural tissue during zzso
