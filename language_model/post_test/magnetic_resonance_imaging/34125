Previous studies report that zzso magnetic resonance imaging is limited in the evaluation of the superior zzso zzso From our magnetic resonance imaging database of zzso patients, we zzso identified 104 patients with superior zzso zzso who subsequently went on to zzso zzso zzso resonance images were assessed to identify zzso zzso tears, zzso tears, or displaced zzso of zzso The biceps zzso was also zzso Patients were zzso according to zzso zzso and the findings on the magnetic resonance images were correlated with surgical zzso One hundred of the 104 tears suspected on the images were confirmed at zzso There were four zzso and two zzso the former reflecting one normal zzso two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso With zzso surgery as the standard, magnetic resonance imaging had a sensitivity of zzso zzso of zzso a specificity of zzso zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso of zzso for detection of superior zzso zzso We concluded that high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance imaging can accurately diagnose superior zzso zzso and aid in surgical zzso
