Although patients with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease zzso their zzso could be zzso We aimed to evaluate structural changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Forty-eight zzso patients who underwent Pittsburgh compound B zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso They were classified as zzso zzso zzso (N zzso zzso and zzso zzso (N zzso zzso zzso shape and regional cortical thickness were compared with 41 subjects with normal zzso zzso Relative to NC, zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso in the right zzso zzso 1, whereas zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso in bilateral zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso Relative to NC, zzso zzso showed cortical thinning in the left zzso prefrontal and right anterior zzso regions, whereas zzso zzso exhibited cortical thinning in bilateral zzso zzso regions, zzso junctions and zzso and prefrontal zzso Our findings suggest that structural changes in zzso zzso might be due to several possible zzso changes, whereas structural changes in zzso zzso reflect zzso structural zzso
