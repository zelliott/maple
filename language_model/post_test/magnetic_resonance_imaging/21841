To establish if zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso is an independent surrogate of zzso criteria for the diagnosis of zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso 

zzso evidence of zzso has been shown to correlate with zzso zzso sclerosis zzso zzso evidence of zzso seizure zzso and outcome after zzso zzso The reported rate of zzso between scalp zzso zzso recordings and zzso evidence of unilateral zzso ranges from rare to zzso We examined the surface and depth zzso zzso findings of patients with zzso as detected by zzso zzso to clarify their significance in detecting areas of zzso in this group of zzso 

From a group of patients with zzso zzso we identified 119 patients with zzso zzso with unilateral and 13 with bilateral zzso 9 with zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso studies were used to obtain zzso zzso Absolute volumes were used to detect bilateral zzso Surface and depth zzso recordings were analyzed for zzso of zzso zzso and their distribution was compared for zzso with the location of zzso zzso outcome was zzso 

Of the 110 patients with isolated zzso 63 had zzso zzso of zzso depth zzso zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso surface zzso zzso were zzso Four patients with zzso zzso and zzso failed to achieve seizure control with zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, 3 patients with zzso zzso and zzso had zzso of the zzso zzso with excellent zzso Among the 47 zzso patients, zzso had zzso or zzso zzso depth zzso results and zzso had zzso zzso surface zzso Four of the 9 zzso patients with zzso had excellent outcome after zzso without zzso 

The presence of zzso is not an independent predictor of the site of zzso
