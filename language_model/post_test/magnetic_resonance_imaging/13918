zzso patients presenting with zzso and zzso collapse are a diagnostic zzso Plain X-rays, zzso zzso and zzso bone scans have not always reliably distinguished between benign and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso may be able to do zzso 

Patients who underwent zzso evaluation for zzso collapse were zzso zzso Over a zzso period from January 1995 to September 1996, 47 patients with 58 zzso collapses were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were established by serial imaging, clinical outcome and zzso Imaging was performed with zzso and zzso zzso with contrast enhancement in some zzso zzso zzso were examined for appearance of zzso on zzso and zzso sequences and after contrast administration, signal intensity of adjacent discs, degree of zzso involvement, involvement of zzso zzso presence or absence of zzso mass and zzso zzso zzso between the final and zzso diagnosis was zzso 

There were 36 benign zzso collapses (20 zzso 7 zzso 9 zzso and 22 zzso ones (20 zzso zzso 2 multiple zzso Features which pointed to zzso cause were zzso zzso on zzso images, zzso enhancement after intravenous contrast, greater than 50% zzso involvement and involvement of zzso zzso Of the zzso collapses due to infection, zzso showed zzso zzso 

This study shows that zzso can be used to accurately differentiate between benign and zzso causes of zzso zzso Further differentiation between an zzso traumatic or zzso cause can be done with the help of clinical history and evaluation of zzso zzso
