zzso deficits are usually only interpreted in terms of zzso language zzso However, effective human communication and tests that probe this complex cognitive skill are also dependent on zzso zzso In the clinical context, it is a pragmatic observation that impaired attention and executive functions interfere with the rehabilitation of zzso One system that is important in cognitive control is the zzso network, which includes zzso anterior zzso zzso and adjacent zzso in the superior frontal zzso zzso frontal zzso This functional imaging study assessed zzso activity in the zzso frontal cortex, which was remote from the zzso in relation to performance on a standard test of spoken language in 16 chronic zzso patients both before and after a rehabilitation zzso During zzso participants heard simple sentences, with each listening trial followed immediately by a trial in which they repeated back the previous zzso zzso to sentences in the context of a zzso task was expected to activate regions involved in both zzso processes zzso perception and zzso verbal working memory and zzso zzso and a number of zzso processes (including attention to zzso and attempts to overcome zzso conflict and decision uncertainty during impaired speech zzso To zzso the same system in healthy participants, sentences were presented to them as zzso zzso speech, thereby zzso speech perception and assessing whether this evokes domain general cognitive zzso As expected, contrasting the more difficult task of zzso and preparing to repeat zzso speech with the same task on clear speech demonstrated increased activity in the zzso frontal zzso in the healthy zzso The same region was activated in the zzso patients as they listened to standard zzso zzso Using a region of interest defined from the data on the healthy participants, data from the zzso frontal zzso was obtained from the zzso Across the group and across different scanning sessions, activity correlated significantly with the patients' zzso zzso This correlation was not influenced by the sizes of the zzso or the patients' zzso zzso This is the first study that has directly correlated activity in a domain general system, specifically the zzso network, with residual language performance in zzso zzso It provides direct evidence in support of the clinical zzso that zzso cognitive control is an essential factor contributing to the potential for recovery from zzso zzso
