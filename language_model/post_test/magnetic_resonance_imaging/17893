zzso spectrum disorder zzso affects 1 in 88 children and is characterized by a complex zzso including social, zzso and zzso zzso zzso spectrum disorder has been linked with zzso connectivity across multiple brain systems, yet the nature of these differences in young children with the disorder is not well zzso 

To examine connectivity of large-scale brain networks and determine whether specific networks can distinguish children with zzso from typically developing zzso children and predict symptom severity in children with zzso 

zzso study performed at Stanford University School of Medicine of 20 children 7 to 12 years old with zzso and 20 zzso zzso and zzso TD zzso 

zzso differences in intrinsic functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks, performance of a zzso built to discriminate children with zzso from TD children based on specific brain networks, and correlations between brain networks and core symptoms of zzso 

We observed stronger functional connectivity within several large-scale brain networks in children with zzso compared with TD zzso This zzso in zzso zzso zzso default mode, zzso zzso and visual zzso This zzso result was zzso in an independent cohort obtained from publicly available zzso Using maps of each zzso zzso network, children with zzso could be zzso from TD children with a zzso accuracy of zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso The zzso network showed the highest zzso accuracy among all networks zzso and the blood zzso dependent signal in this network predicted restricted and repetitive behavior zzso The zzso zzso zzso from TD in the independent sample with zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso zzso 

zzso network zzso may be a distinguishing feature in children with zzso zzso of brain network connectivity is a step toward developing zzso for zzso identifying children with zzso
