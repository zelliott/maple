zzso optical zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso address different properties of the sample and operate on different geometrical zzso zzso maps density and mobility of molecules tracking specific molecular zzso zzso imaging profits from the zzso zzso of light in the focus of a zzso laser source stimulating the zzso of zzso As this effect relies on a high light intensity, the accessible field of view is zzso but the resolution is very high (a few hundred zzso Here, we aim to link the different accessible scales and properties addressed in the different techniques to obtain a zzso zzso As model zzso we studied zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso images and images of second harmonic generation are achieved even down to low zzso zzso low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overview images allowed zzso assignments and zzso lifetime imaging provides further information to identify zzso of zzso zzso The second, complementary contribution from high-resolution MR images provides a zzso model and shows the embedding of the zzso in the zzso Images of the zzso density were acquired using a standard zzso zzso imaging pulse zzso Details directly comparable to the low zzso optical data are zzso Eventually, passing from the MR images of the whole grain via low zzso to high resolution zzso data bridges the scale barrier, and might provide the possibility to trace transport and zzso of, zzso nutrients from large structure of the plant to the zzso cellular zzso
