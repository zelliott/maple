The binding to human serum proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso the active component of the magnetic resonance imaging contrast medium zzso zzso injection zzso was studied in zzso zzso zzso from three males and three females were incubated with 86 zzso zzso for 60 zzso at room temperature zzso degrees zzso followed by zzso through filters with a zzso of 30 zzso Analysis of the zzso and the initial incubation zzso for zzso by zzso and for zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by liquid zzso zzso showed a clear difference in protein binding of zzso and the zzso under these zzso Only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) of zzso zzso and zzso were bound to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) of zzso was bound to zzso No binding of zzso zzso or zzso to blood cells was observed when whole blood, containing either zzso or zzso as zzso was spiked with zzso and the zzso fraction and the zzso cell fraction zzso by liquid zzso zzso The extent of protein binding of zzso corresponded well with results from an in zzso metabolism study, in which zzso was added to zzso human whole blood, showing that approximately zzso of zzso zzso or zzso were not bound to zzso The in zzso metabolism study revealed that zzso with zinc was nearly complete within 1 zzso and that zzso is a sequential process going from zzso to the zzso zzso and then to the fully zzso compound zzso
