This study zzso the appearance of the cavernous segment of the carotid artery on MR images with the presence of significant zzso or zzso of the cervical carotid artery as seen on zzso in 100 patients who had brain MR imaging and zzso within a zzso zzso Four patients demonstrated zzso signal within the carotid zzso cavernous zzso two of these findings correlated with complete carotid zzso as seen zzso while partial compromise was seen zzso in the other zzso Four other patients had variable signal intensity and zzso of the zzso outline in the carotid zzso zzso with zzso evidence of zzso disease in three patients and of dissection in one zzso The demonstration of normal signal void within a zzso cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery in the remaining 92 patients correlated with absence of significant zzso within the cervical segment in 86 zzso In the remaining six, significant disease of the internal carotid artery was zzso zzso within the zzso carotid artery can indicate either complete zzso or very slow zzso zzso zzso is still necessary to completely exclude potentially zzso disease that produces very slow flow leading to zzso The presence of normal flow void in the zzso segment does not exclude significant compromise of the cervical segment of the carotid zzso
