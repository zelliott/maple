MR brain image zzso into several tissue classes is of significant interest to zzso and zzso individual anatomical zzso Traditionally, the zzso is performed manually in a clinical environment that is operator dependent and may be difficult to zzso Though several zzso have been investigated in the literature for computerized automatic zzso of MR brain images, they are usually targeted to zzso image into a limited number of classes such as white matter, gray matter, zzso fluid and specific zzso We present a novel zzso method for the automatic zzso and zzso of zzso MR brain images into a larger number of tissue classes of zzso Our model employs 15 brain tissue classes instead of the commonly used set of four classes, which were of clinical interest to zzso for zzso with patients suffering from cerebrovascular zzso zzso and/or zzso The model zzso the spatial distribution of tissue classes by a zzso zzso random field and uses the maximum likelihood method to estimate the class probabilities and transitional probabilities for each zzso of the zzso zzso MR brain images with zzso zzso zzso density, zzso and zzso imaging were used in zzso and zzso In the development of the zzso model, true zzso of measured parameters was determined from manual zzso of a set of normal and zzso brain images by a team of zzso The manual zzso was performed using a zzso interface specifically designed for zzso zzso of brain zzso The registration of corresponding images from different brains was accomplished using an elastic zzso The presented zzso method uses the zzso model in zzso zzso of brain images on a zzso zzso The method was evaluated on a set of zzso MR brain images of a zzso old patient zzso after suffering a zzso The results of zzso as compared to the manual zzso of the same data show the efficacy and accuracy of the presented methods as well as its capability to create and learn new tissue zzso
