We describe a patient zzso with a progressive visual zzso who showed an impairment in identifying larger zzso objects relative to their smaller zzso NJ showed this size effect for line drawings of objects, words and single zzso When presented with large letters comprised of smaller letters and asked to give zzso identification responses to either the large or small letters, NJ was zzso impaired at identifying the large zzso Additionally, when presented with a context meant to bias responding to either the large or small letter, NJ showed faster and more accurate responding in the small direction, but not in the large zzso We interpret these results as indicative of an impaired zzso of attention, which is deployed across the visual zzso and is necessary for providing the selective visual attention responsible for the integration of visual zzso
