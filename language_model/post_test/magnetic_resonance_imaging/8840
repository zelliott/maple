zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso represent brain activity in terms of a reliable anatomical zzso and a detailed zzso evolution of neural zzso zzso zzso recordings offer the possibility to greatly enrich the significance and the interpretation of the single zzso results because the same neural processes are observed from the same brain at the same zzso Nonetheless, the different physical nature of the measured signals by the two techniques renders the zzso not always straightforward, especially in cognitive experiments where zzso localized and distributed effects coexist and evolve temporally at different zzso zzso The purpose of this article is to illustrate the combination of simultaneously recorded zzso and zzso signals exploiting the principles of zzso distributed source zzso We define a common source space for zzso and zzso signal projection and gather a zzso unique framework for the spatial and zzso comparative zzso We illustrate this framework in a zzso zzso simultaneous zzso experiment based on the zzso task where sustained zzso changes in the zzso zzso signals during continuous item zzso zzso with zzso changes in the zzso zzso power induced at each single zzso In line with previous studies, we demonstrate on two zzso cases how the presented approach is capable of zzso in zzso frontal regions two phenomena simultaneously observed at different zzso zzso such as the sustained negative changes in zzso activity and the zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the presented approach in relation to modeling and interpretation issues typically arising in simultaneous zzso zzso
