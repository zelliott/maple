A hybrid two-dimensional zzso zzso sequence was used to simultaneously measure both the zzso zzso and zzso relaxation rates zzso of skeletal muscle in zzso The zzso sequence involved a 180 degrees inversion pulse followed by a variable delay time (30 values from 40 to zzso zzso a projection zzso zzso scheme to zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso sequence zzso even zzso effective echo spacing zzso zzso zzso equilibrium time zzso 12 zzso The zzso data were collected at zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of eight healthy zzso 26 zzso 2 years zzso Analysis was performed with a zzso version of the zzso zzso zzso and a one-way zzso All subjects exhibited at least three zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso designated B, C, and D, with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and fractional volumes of 52, 35, and zzso zzso The zzso values of B and C were similar, zzso zzso zzso but different from that of D zzso zzso zzso which had an zzso of zzso zzso The results suggest that exchange between B and C ranges from zzso zzso while exchange between either of these zzso with D is zzso If the data are interpreted with a compartment model, in which zzso with short and long zzso values are attributed to zzso and zzso fluid, respectively, the exchange of water across the cell membrane in living skeletal muscle is slow or intermediate relative to both zzso and zzso
