The rat electrical zzso kindling model is one of the most widely studied animal models of zzso lobe zzso zzso however, the processes underlying zzso in this model remain incompletely zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is a powerful method to investigate zzso allowing serial imaging of associated structural and functional changes in zzso Here we report on the results of serial zzso acquisitions during zzso in this zzso 

zzso zzso MR images were acquired before, zzso and after the induction of zzso to investigate the development and progression of imaging zzso 

zzso acquisitions demonstrated the development of regions of increased signal in the zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso (five of zzso but not in control rats zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signal demonstrated a significant increase in zzso animals when compared with controls, 2 weeks after kindling zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regions of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was observed in zzso volumes between zzso or control animals at any of the zzso 

The results of this study validate a method for acquiring serial zzso during zzso kindling and demonstrate the induction of zzso signal abnormalities in focal regions of the zzso These regions may be important sites for the zzso changes that contribute to zzso in this zzso
