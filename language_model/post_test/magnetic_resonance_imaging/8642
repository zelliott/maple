Naming and zzso of individual body part words to a high-resolution line drawing of a full human figure was tested in a zzso sample of nine right handed zzso zzso within the superior zzso left zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso was consistent with involvement of the body zzso which is a dynamic zzso zzso coding and combining sensory zzso and motor zzso zzso that is automatic and zzso Additional zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso was consistent with involvement of the neural zzso of the zzso body structural description that encodes semantic and zzso representations to animate objects such as full human zzso The results point to a highly distributed cortical representation for the zzso and manipulation of body part information and highlight the need for the incorporation of more ecologically valid measures of body zzso coding in future functional zzso zzso
