zzso imaging of the brain of animal models demands the detection of increasingly smaller structures by in zzso zzso The purpose of this work was to zzso the spatial resolution and structural contrast that can be obtained for studying the brain of zzso mice by zzso zzso fast zzso zzso at zzso zzso As a prerequisite for high-resolution imaging in zzso motion artifacts were abolished by combining volatile zzso and positive pressure ventilation with a specially designed animal bed for zzso Multiple zzso in the cortex, zzso bulb, zzso and zzso were resolved at 30 to 40 zzso zzso resolution and 200 to 300 zzso section thickness as well as for relatively long echo times of 65 to 82 zzso In particular, the approach resulted in the differentiation of up to five cortical zzso In the zzso bulb the images unraveled the zzso cell layer which has a thickness of mostly single zzso In the zzso at least five zzso could be zzso The molecular layer, zzso layer, and zzso layer of the zzso could be clearly differentiated from the white zzso In conclusion, even without the use of a contrast agent, suitable adjustments of a widely available zzso zzso sequence at high field allow for structural zzso of living mice at near zzso layer zzso
