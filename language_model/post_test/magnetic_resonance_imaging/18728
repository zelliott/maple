When task instructions are given, the human brain establishes a task set before the task is actually zzso By introducing a delay between the instruction and the task, we have identified the neural zzso of task sets using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were instructed to remember a sequence of positions or letters, either in the order presented or in the reverse zzso zzso or verbal processing areas were active during the zzso depending on whether positions or letters were to be remembered, whereas the anterior region of the prefrontal zzso zzso was active regardless of the domain of the zzso Furthermore, the nature of the interaction between the anterior zzso and the zzso zzso prefrontal areas zzso frontal zzso and left inferior frontal zzso depended on whether the items were to be remembered in the forward or backward zzso Thus we have identified zzso interactions that reflect preparation for task zzso
