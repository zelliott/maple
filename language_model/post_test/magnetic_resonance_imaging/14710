To investigate whether cortical superficial zzso zzso on zzso especially if zzso zzso more than 3 zzso increases the risk of future symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso in cerebral zzso zzso zzso 

European zzso cohort study of 118 patients with zzso (104 with baseline symptomatic zzso zzso diagnosed according to the Boston zzso We obtained baseline clinical, zzso and follow-up data on symptomatic zzso zzso Using zzso and Cox zzso zzso we investigated zzso and zzso risk, adjusting for known zzso 

During a median follow-up time of 24 months zzso range zzso zzso 23 of 118 patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso experienced symptomatic zzso zzso Any zzso and zzso zzso were zzso of time until first or zzso zzso zzso test: p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso risk at 4 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso for patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for patients with focal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso test: p zzso zzso In Cox zzso models, any zzso and zzso zzso were both independently associated with increased zzso zzso risk, after adjusting for zzso 2 zzso and age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and hazard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso These results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses including only patients with symptomatic zzso zzso at zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso particularly if zzso is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic zzso zzso in zzso zzso may help zzso future bleeding risk in zzso with implications for prognosis and zzso
