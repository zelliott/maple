To evaluate whether serum zzso zzso 9 zzso levels are associated with zzso manifestations, particularly cognitive dysfunction, as evaluated by zzso testing and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were made in 44 patients with zzso and 43 healthy controls who underwent a clinical zzso and zzso investigation in order to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso scans with zzso zzso of zzso zzso fluid spaces, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed for all zzso zzso activity was assessed by the European Consensus Lupus zzso Measure zzso index, and accumulated zzso zzso was assessed by the zzso Lupus International zzso zzso zzso College of zzso damage zzso 

No significant difference was found in serum zzso levels between the overall group of zzso patients and zzso However, zzso patients who had at least 1 zzso manifestation zzso zzso had significantly higher serum zzso zzso than did zzso patients without zzso syndromes zzso zzso zzso Among patients with zzso those with cognitive deficits had significantly higher zzso of serum zzso than did those with normal cognitive function zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, serum zzso levels had a significant positive correlation with the volumes of zzso and zzso zzso in the brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The concentration of serum zzso correlated significantly with the zzso index but not with the zzso zzso 

zzso levels of serum zzso in patients with zzso may reflect zzso involvement, particularly cognitive zzso The serum zzso concentration may be associated with small- vessel cerebral zzso and increased risk of cerebral zzso events in patients with zzso
