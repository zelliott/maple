The spontaneously zzso rat zzso has been widely used as an animal model for zzso disorder zzso a zzso disorder that affects zzso of school-age zzso zzso high-resolution zzso zzso 180 zzso 1500 zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate regional zzso in zzso rats zzso zzso and control zzso zzso rats zzso zzso in the frontal cortex, motor cortex, sensory cortex, corpus zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso and whole zzso The accuracy of repeated cerebral blood flow zzso zzso within animals in these brain regions ranged from zzso to zzso (7 repeated zzso and across animals ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso respectively, indicating highly accurate and zzso zzso zzso Regional zzso of the zzso were statistically different from those of the zzso rats in all structures analyzed zzso except for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Whole brain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso higher than that of the zzso rats zzso zzso likely due to the zzso nature of the zzso rat zzso Following zzso to eliminate global zzso differences, zzso in the zzso prefrontal cortex, a structure thought to be the equivalent of the human zzso prefrontal zzso and widely implicated in zzso was found to be higher in zzso compared to zzso rats zzso The only other structure that was found to be statistically different after zzso is the corpus zzso zzso Since resting cerebral blood flow is intricately coupled to resting neural activity, these results suggest that there was abnormal resting neural activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso and the corpus zzso between the control and zzso animals, consistent with the hyperactivity, zzso zzso and other zzso behaviors in this animal zzso
