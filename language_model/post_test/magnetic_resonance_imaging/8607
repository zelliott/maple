Human speech articulation is a complex process controlled by a form of zzso implemented in the zzso Analysis of speech articulation using zzso techniques is difficult, however, because motor noise is zzso to the zzso zzso The current zzso study, in which 12 participants were required to imagine zzso a zzso after a visual zzso was designed to zzso the zzso zzso processes corresponding to the motor zzso zzso activity zzso with the preparation for articulation occurred in the insular zzso at about 160 zzso after the visual zzso and had a relative dominance in the right zzso This suggests that motor control of speech proceeds from the insular regions, although the zzso nature of our task might have led to the observed zzso zzso
