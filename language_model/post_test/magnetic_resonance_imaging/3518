The choice of small immediate over large delayed rewards zzso impulsive zzso is a signal marker of motivational style in Attention zzso Disorder zzso The delay zzso model proposes that, in part, this is a zzso delay avoidance zzso Here we test the prediction derived from this model that, in zzso cues predicting inescapable delay zzso activate brain regions shown previously to be responsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso environmental zzso 

Ten adolescents with zzso and 10 age matched controls performed a simple zzso reaction time task under two zzso On zzso zzso trials slow responses only were punished by the imposition of zzso delay zzso On No zzso zzso trials zzso delay occurred on all trials irrespective of response zzso Using functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso responses were acquired to compare anticipatory brain zzso following the two cue zzso zzso analyses found significant zzso zzso following No zzso compared to zzso zzso trial cues in the zzso amygdala, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The results of this pilot study provide further evidence for the role of altered motivational systems in zzso and the most direct evidence for a biological basis of delay zzso
