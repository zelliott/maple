We evaluated whether the addition of delayed phase imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso to dynamic zzso imaging improves the characterization of small zzso zzso zzso and the differentiation between zzso high grade zzso zzso zzso and low grade zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-five zzso patients with 30 zzso (16 zzso 8 zzso and 6 zzso maximum size of 3 zzso were included in this retrospective zzso The diagnostic reference standard was zzso All the patients underwent zzso both prior to and following intravenous administration of zzso zzso The zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso on zzso for qualitative zzso In the quantitative analysis the relative zzso contrast to noise ratio zzso of the zzso on zzso was zzso 

All zzso were zzso on zzso while only 8 zzso of 14 zzso were zzso and only 1 of 6 zzso zzso was zzso There was a statistically significant difference in the zzso on zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the qualitative analysis but not in the zzso values while there was a strong statistically significant difference in the zzso on zzso in the qualitative zzso zzso zzso and quantitative analysis zzso zzso zzso between zzso and the group obtained by unifying zzso and zzso 

zzso is helpful in zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso of zzso on zzso should raise the suspicion of zzso or zzso zzso in the case of zzso with zzso dynamic zzso
