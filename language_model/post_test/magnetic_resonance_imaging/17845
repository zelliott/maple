zzso zzso is helpful when averaging zzso signals across multiple subjects, as it allows different subjects' corresponding brain areas to be pooled together even if they are slightly zzso However, smoothing is usually not applied when performing zzso zzso analyses zzso as it runs the risk of blurring away the information that zzso spatial patterns zzso It would therefore be desirable, if possible, to carry out zzso analyses which take zzso data as their input but which produce smooth images as zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does precisely this, when it is used in zzso zzso zzso We explain why this occurs, and illustrate the effect in real zzso zzso Moreover, we show that analyses using zzso produce results at the zzso level which are statistically zzso zzso zzso and which replicate across two independent data zzso By contrast, zzso zzso applied to the same data do not generate a zzso even if the zzso searchlight maps have smoothing applied to zzso An additional advantage of zzso zzso for searchlight analyses is that they are orders of magnitude faster to zzso than more complex alternatives such as zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a highly zzso choice for zzso zzso zzso zzso
