Cell therapy is an emerging and exciting novel treatment option for cardiovascular disease that relies on the delivery of functional cells to their target zzso Monitoring and tracking cells to ensure tissue delivery and zzso is a critical step in establishing clinical and therapeutic zzso The study aims were zzso to develop a Good Manufacturing zzso method of labeling competent peripheral blood zzso cells with zzso particles of iron oxide zzso and zzso to evaluate its potential for magnetic resonance cell tracking in zzso 

zzso blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso cells had similar in zzso zzso migratory capacity, and pattern of zzso release to zzso zzso After intramuscular administration, up to zzso zzso cells were readily identifiable in zzso for at least 7 days using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Using a zzso study, we demonstrated that systemic delivery of up to zzso zzso cells in humans is safe, and cells accumulating in the zzso system were zzso on clinical magnetic resonance zzso In a healthy volunteer model, a focus of zzso inflammation was induced in the thigh by zzso injection of zzso zzso delivered zzso cells tracked to the inflamed skin and were zzso on magnetic resonance zzso zzso blue zzso of skin zzso confirmed zzso cells in the inflamed zzso 

Human peripheral blood zzso cells can be labeled with zzso without affecting their viability or zzso zzso labeling for magnetic resonance cell tracking is a safe and feasible technique that has major potential for a range of cardiovascular applications including monitoring of cell therapies and tracking of inflammatory zzso Clinical Trial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
