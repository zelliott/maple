Previous zzso studies have demonstrated preferential involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso in tasks of object and spatial memory, zzso Here we investigated whether similar activity would also be present when object and spatial discrimination was assessed in the absence of explicit zzso memory zzso On each trial in the zzso participants were presented simultaneously with two zzso of objects and were asked to indicate whether both zzso were zzso differed with respect to the identity of one object or differed with respect to the spatial arrangement of the zzso It was found that the detection of an object identity change was associated with significant right zzso zzso zzso We suggest that this zzso activity indicates a role of this structure in processes beyond zzso memory, for example, short-term visual working memory or higher order zzso zzso greater zzso activity was not, however, observed during the spatial arrangement condition, perhaps due to the relatively low spatial processing demands of this zzso
