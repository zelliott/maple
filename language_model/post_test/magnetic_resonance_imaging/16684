The best established zzso cerebral function is speech production, with the majority of the population having left zzso zzso An important question is how to best assess the zzso of this zzso zzso techniques such as functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso are increasingly used in clinical settings to replace the invasive zzso We evaluated the usefulness of behavioral visual half field zzso tasks for screening a large sample of healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated on the basis of the zzso in a word and picture naming zzso task were compared to the brain activity measured in a silent word generation task in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the usefulness of the zzso as a screening zzso None of the left-handed participants with clear right visual field zzso advantages in the picture and word naming task showed right zzso dominance in the zzso In contrast, zzso participants with a left visual field zzso advantage in both word and picture naming turned out to have zzso right brain zzso zzso were less clear for participants who failed to show clear zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso advantage and below 60 zzso zzso zzso or who had inconsistent zzso in picture and word zzso These results indicate that the behavioral tasks can mainly provide useful information about the direction of speech dominance when both zzso differences clearly point in the same zzso
