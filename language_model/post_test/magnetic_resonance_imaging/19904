zzso zzso is a widely used zzso zzso spin labeling zzso technique for efficient and accurate zzso of cerebral blood flow zzso Slices are typically acquired inferior to superior from a tagging zzso Superior slices show signal loss greater than the loss expected from blood zzso zzso In order to assess the reasons for this additional signal loss, three zzso acquisition studies were compared to zzso acquisition (six zzso in healthy zzso In Study 1 zzso the tagging plane was fixed in location, and the inversion time zzso was 1500 zzso for each zzso For Study 2 zzso the tagging plane was fixed as in Study 1; however, zzso increased as slices were acquired further from the tagging zzso In Study 3 zzso the tagging plane was kept adjacent to the imaging zzso and zzso was 1500 zzso for every zzso Gray matter zzso and white matter zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso were measured per zzso zzso zzso from zzso acquisitions was significantly higher at slices 4-6 in Study 2 and at slices 2-6 in Study 3 compared to zzso zzso Signal loss in zzso slices of zzso acquisitions can be attributed to the destruction of zzso zzso in addition to blood zzso zzso If limited brain coverage is acceptable, zzso images with greater zzso are achievable with limited slices and placement of the tagging region immediately adjacent to the site of zzso
