Recent research indicates that zzso novel events, zzso from an ongoing auditory environment, elicit a positive zzso potential zzso the novel zzso Although a variety of studies examined the neural network engaged in novelty zzso there is no complete picture of the underlying brain zzso This experiment investigated these neural mechanisms by combining zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso responses were measured in the same subjects using the same experimental zzso The zzso analysis revealed a novel zzso while the zzso responses showed bilateral zzso in the middle part of the superior zzso zzso When subjects attended to the novel stimuli only identifiable novel sounds evoked a zzso zzso zzso showing a strong zzso had additional zzso zzso in right prefrontal zzso zzso as compared to subjects with a weak zzso This pattern of results suggests that novelty processing not only includes the registration of zzso but may also lead to a fast access and retrieval of related semantic zzso The zzso zzso pattern suggests that the superior zzso zzso is involved in novelty zzso whereas zzso and retrieving semantic concepts related to novel sounds additionally engages the zzso
