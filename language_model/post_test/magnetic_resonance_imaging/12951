In zzso tracking cells using zzso contrast agents have the important advantage of providing a positive contrast on zzso images, which is less likely to be confused with artifacts because of zzso local signal voids such as metal, zzso or zzso The aim of this study is to zzso and zzso label zzso with dual agents zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso and track them after transplantation into spinal zzso injury zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso stem cells zzso from zzso rats were incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex for zzso After zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso value and longevity of zzso zzso retention were measured on a zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were implanted with labeled and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Then, serial zzso and zzso zzso locomotor tests were performed and correlated with fluorescent zzso The relative signal intensity zzso of the zzso in relation to normal zzso was measured and the linear mixed model followed by zzso zzso test was used to identify significant differences in zzso as well as zzso zzso 

zzso could be zzso and zzso labeled by the dual zzso The labeling did not influence the cellular zzso zzso and zzso The longevity of zzso retention in labeled zzso was up to 21 zzso The distribution and migration of labeled zzso in zzso zzso could be tracked until 7 days after zzso on zzso The relative signal zzso of zzso rats treated with labeled cells at 1 day and 3 days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than rats treated with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso saline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with labeled zzso or zzso zzso achieved significantly higher zzso scores than controls at 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after injury zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with the dual agents may enable cellular zzso and tracking in experimental spinal zzso zzso
