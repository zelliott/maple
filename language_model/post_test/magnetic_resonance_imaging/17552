In order to study MR features of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso liver, 26 cases of zzso liver with zzso and zzso of which 8 cases accompanied with zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso of 26 cases underwent additional enhanced zzso with administration of zzso on zzso and 10 of the 18 cases did additional zzso zzso enhancement on zzso Clinical data showed normal level of zzso in 18 cases except 8 cases accompanied with zzso The results showed that 12 cases had zzso with zzso measuring zzso 1 zzso The MR appearance of those zzso showed zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso The intensity of those zzso was zzso to the surrounding zzso zzso on enhanced zzso with administration of zzso or zzso Among the 14 cases of zzso 8 cases had zzso measuring 1-3 zzso in size and 6 had zzso zzso measuring zzso 3 zzso In 8 cases with zzso measuring 1-3 zzso in size, 5 cases appeared zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso as well as the enhancement as that of zzso with zzso 1 zzso in size; and the remaining 3 cases appeared zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso and were not zzso to the surrounding zzso zzso on enhanced zzso but zzso on zzso enhanced zzso In 6 cases of zzso zzso measuring zzso 3 zzso in size, 2 cases appeared zzso to the surrounding zzso zzso on zzso zzso and enhanced zzso 4 cases showed zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso and enhanced zzso Sometimes, normal vessels were seen to pass through the surface of zzso zzso It was suggested that zzso of zzso had features on zzso that usually allow distinction from zzso zzso but not always from zzso zzso zzso A helpful distinction between zzso and zzso is that the latter are almost never zzso on zzso Additionally, low grade zzso appear zzso on zzso enhanced zzso
