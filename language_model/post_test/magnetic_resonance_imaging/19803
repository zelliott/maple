As the early form of zzso is characterized by elevated water content in the cartilage zzso the purpose of this study was to verify in zzso if age-related changes in zzso cartilage in healthy volunteers can be detected using quantitative zzso with zzso mapping and volume measurement zzso zzso 

Thirty healthy volunteers of various classes of age (18 to 65 years old) were enrolled in this zzso MR images of the zzso cartilage were acquired at zzso zzso cartilage volume and zzso maps were zzso 

Despite zzso there was a trend in reducing cartilage volume with zzso zzso zzso In contrast global zzso slightly increased with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone volume zzso zzso are well correlated to cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the water content of zzso cartilage can be detected using zzso The proposed zzso method, coupled with other zzso MR cartilage imaging techniques, could aid in the early diagnosis of zzso
