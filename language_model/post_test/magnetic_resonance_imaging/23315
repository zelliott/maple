zzso dominance for language and zzso dominance for spatial processing are distinctive characteristics of the human zzso However, variations of these zzso zzso have been observed, with a minority showing crowding of both functions to the same zzso or even a mirror reversal of the typical zzso zzso Here, we used diffusion zzso imaging and functional magnetic imaging to investigate the role of the corpus zzso in participants with zzso zzso zzso The corpus zzso was segmented according to the projection site of the underlying zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the identified zzso segments revealed that zzso zzso dominance for language was associated with high zzso diffusion through the corpus zzso as a zzso This effect was most evident in participants with crowding of both functions to the zzso The enhanced zzso diffusion in zzso zzso dominance implies that in these individuals the two zzso are more heavily zzso
