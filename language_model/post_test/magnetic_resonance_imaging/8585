We can often understand when actions done by others do or do not reflect their zzso To investigate the neural basis of this capacity we carried out an zzso study in which volunteers were presented with zzso showing actions that did reflect the intention of the agent zzso zzso and actions that did not zzso zzso Observation of both types of actions activated a common set of areas including the inferior zzso zzso the lateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The contrast zzso zzso intended actions showed zzso in the right zzso zzso left zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso The converse contrast did not show any zzso We conclude that our capacity to understand non intended actions is based on the zzso of areas signaling unexpected events in spatial and zzso zzso in addition to the activity of the mirror zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso prefrontal areas, known to be involved in self-referential processing, might reflect how deeply participants are involved in the observed zzso
