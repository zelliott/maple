zzso has been associated with zzso brain activity concurrent with both the anticipation and integration of monetary zzso The extent to which abnormal zzso neural signals can be observed in zzso zzso patients with schizophrenia zzso however, is not zzso In an zzso study involving 17 chronic zzso with zzso and 17 matched controls, we used a monetary incentive delay zzso task, in which zzso shapes predicted gains, losses, or neutral zzso zzso needed to respond to a target within a time window in order to receive the indicated gain or avoid the indicated zzso Group differences in zzso responses to cues and outcomes were assessed through zzso zzso analyses and zzso analyses in the zzso and prefrontal zzso zzso zzso group by outcome zzso interactions were observed in the zzso and lateral zzso lateral zzso cortex, and zzso such that controls, but not patients, showed greater zzso for gains, relative to zzso In the zzso neural activity was modulated by outcome magnitude in both zzso Additionally, we found that ratings of negative symptoms in patients correlated with sensitivity to obtained losses in zzso zzso obtained gains in lateral zzso and anticipated gains in left zzso zzso zzso to obtained gains in lateral zzso also correlated with positive symptom scores in zzso Our findings of systematic relationships between clinical symptoms and neural responses to stimuli associated with rewards and punishments offer promise that zzso neural responses may provide sensitive zzso of the effectiveness of treatments for negative zzso
