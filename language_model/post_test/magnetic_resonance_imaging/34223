Despite substantial differences between species in the organization and zzso of the cortical zzso zzso little is known about the pharmacological response of cortical or zzso sites to antipsychotic medications in nonhuman zzso To examine this issue, zzso monkeys were chronically implanted with guide zzso directed at the principal zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso cortex, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso release in these discrete brain regions were measured in response to administration of zzso or zzso zzso produced significant and long-lasting increases in zzso release in the principal zzso and to a lesser extent, in the zzso zzso zzso did not produce a consistent effect on zzso release in the principal zzso although it increased zzso release in the zzso zzso preferential zzso of zzso release in the zzso prefrontal zzso supports the idea that zzso exerts its therapeutic effects in part by increasing cortical zzso zzso
