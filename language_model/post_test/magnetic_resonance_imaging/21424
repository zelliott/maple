The zzso of attention to internal or zzso representations held in visual working memory zzso has recently become a field of increasing zzso While a number of studies support the hypothesis that attention to selected representations in zzso reduces memory load, conclusive findings are still zzso In this zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, we directly investigated whether zzso zzso to zzso representations reduces activity in zzso zzso areas of the zzso zzso load was manipulated by asking subjects to memorize two, four or six zzso A zzso during the subsequent delay period asked subjects to attend to just one of these items for a subsequent zzso This was compared to trials where subjects were required to continue attending to all items for the subsequent zzso Data show reduction of zzso zzso activity along the right zzso zzso zzso directly linked to zzso zzso While activity in the anterior zzso reflected the number of representations in the focus of attention, the zzso pattern in the zzso zzso suggested residual zzso related to unattended zzso This zzso is in line with a functional subdivision of the right zzso according to zzso and zzso zzso
