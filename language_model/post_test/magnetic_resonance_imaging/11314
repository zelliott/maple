zzso contributes to zzso but assessment in humans is largely restricted to measurement of markers in zzso We determined whether zzso properties of large arteries were associated with markers of inflammation in zzso Double inversion recovery, fast zzso images of the common carotid arteries and zzso zzso were obtained at zzso T both before and after zzso zzso zzso in 52 subjects zzso or zzso years of age, 17 of whom had no risk factors for zzso and thus served as zzso Twenty-two study participants had increases in wall thickness zzso zzso signal intensity zzso and/or contrast enhancement values zzso that were zzso standard zzso zzso from control group mean zzso Ten subjects in this group had evidence of focal plaques in the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Compared with the remaining 30 subjects, these 22 had significantly higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 153 zzso zzso zzso 130 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso 202 zzso 45 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso differences in levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Thus, zzso characteristics of the zzso and carotid arteries were associated with elevated serum markers of zzso frequently in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of large arteries may provide a new approach to investigate the contribution of inflammation to zzso
