Relative to common clinical magnetic field strengths, higher fields benefit functional brain imaging both by providing additional signal for high-resolution applications and by improving the sensitivity of zzso contrast due to the blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso which has limited detection power at low magnetic fields relative to the use of zzso contrast zzso This study evaluates the utility of iron oxide contrast agent for zzso echo functional zzso at zzso T in zzso using cocaine and zzso as zzso Relative to the zzso method, the use of high iron doses and short echo times provided a roughly twofold global increase in functional sensitivity, while also suppressing large vessel signal and reducing zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of the functional percentage change in cerebral blood volume zzso showed excellent agreement with results obtained at much lower magnetic field strengths, demonstrating that zzso estimates of this quantity are roughly independent of magnetic field when appropriate techniques are zzso The derived field zzso for relative sensitivity and zzso estimates of the percentage change in zzso suggest that the benefits provided by zzso agents will persist even at much higher magnetic fields than zzso zzso
