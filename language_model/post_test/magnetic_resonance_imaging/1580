The presence of a residual zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso is typically an indication for prompt return to the operating room to complete zzso because of the risk of early zzso This approach, however, may involve risks of neurological deficits when the residual zzso is in eloquent zzso We present a case of complete zzso of a residual zzso after zzso This residual zzso tissue was located in eloquent zzso Complete spontaneous zzso of residual zzso after surgery has only rarely been zzso This phenomenon raises questions regarding the most appropriate management for residual zzso in eloquent zzso 

The patient was a zzso zzso male patient with an zzso centered in the left zzso zzso The patient presented with medically intractable zzso and progressive right zzso After zzso zzso zzso revealed a residual zzso with early zzso zzso zzso performed 1 week later demonstrated a zzso zzso zzso without early zzso zzso zzso performed 3 months later demonstrated complete zzso of the residual zzso 

The patient has been monitored for more than 1 year, without additional symptoms or zzso 

We continue to advocate prompt return to the operating room when zzso zzso reveals a residual zzso with persistent zzso When the residual zzso is in eloquent zzso and is small, with a single draining zzso however, observation of the patient (with strict blood pressure zzso and repeat zzso after 1 week represent an alternative strategy that is supported by this case zzso As this case zzso it is possible for small residual zzso to zzso This may avert the need for zzso for residual zzso in eloquent cortex, with the potential for neurological zzso
