Recent and future evolutions in zzso apply to zzso techniques and the synergistic use of different imaging zzso in the zzso of neurological zzso The introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso which could pass the intact zzso barrier, together with the zzso of the zzso principle, by making the conventional gamma camera zzso enabled zzso of regional cerebral blood flow and indirectly of local brain zzso In addition at present zzso and zzso zzso allow functional detection of viable tumor zzso without interference from previous surgery or zzso as seen using zzso or zzso In neurology this has led to the recognition of zzso by the American Academy of zzso zzso and technology zzso as an established or promising tool in major neurological disorders such as zzso stroke and zzso while other zzso such as brain zzso are considered zzso With regard to zzso recent evolutions mainly include the development of mostly zzso zzso zzso zzso some of which are already commercially zzso For zzso advances consist zzso of zzso systems equipped with zzso zzso zzso and scatter correction or coincidence zzso Given the present role for nuclear neurology it may be expected that these additional zzso and technical innovations will continue to stimulate the development of zzso of the zzso The synergistic use of several imaging techniques such as CT, zzso zzso source imaging, zzso and PET represents a zzso holistic approach to probe cerebral functions for research and clinical zzso Clinical zzso in which this synergistic use is illustrated include zzso support of the clinical diagnosis of zzso of the zzso type, zzso zzso detection of seizure focus, detection of acute zzso and differential diagnosis between radiation necrosis and brain tumor zzso The synergistic use of imaging zzso zzso applied using image fusion, allows to overcome the intrinsic limitations and to enhance the specific advantages of the different approaches as it leads to increased precision and zzso as well for spatial zzso correlation as for zzso
