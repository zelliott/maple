zzso state networks zzso as zzso by functional zzso are distributed maps of areas believed to be involved in the function of the zzso brain, which appear in both resting and task zzso The current dominant view is that such networks are associated with slow zzso spontaneous fluctuations in the zzso zzso To date, limited work has investigated the frequency characteristics of zzso here we investigate a range of issues relating to their spectral and phase zzso Our results indicate that zzso although dominated by low zzso in the raw zzso zzso are in fact broadband processes that show zzso zzso across a wide frequency zzso In addition, we show that zzso exhibit different levels of phase zzso at different zzso These findings challenge the notion that zzso resting signals are simple zzso zzso spontaneous signal zzso
