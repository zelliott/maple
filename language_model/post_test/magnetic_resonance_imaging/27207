zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of the innate immune zzso One of its actions is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity by the formation of a zzso zzso zzso We studied zzso in human zzso zzso and we examined whether zzso could act as a target for molecular imaging of zzso zzso 

Increased levels of zzso and the zzso complex were associated with high zzso content, high number of zzso high zzso zzso and zzso levels, and low smooth muscle cell content in human zzso zzso obtained during carotid zzso zzso zzso Moreover, plaque levels of zzso tended to be higher when zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was present zzso zzso than without the presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were strongly related to zzso zzso The enhancement on magnetic resonance zzso images of the abdominal zzso of zzso mice was observed at 72 h after injection of zzso zzso The specificity of these results was validated by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

zzso is highly expressed in zzso human plaques and associated with increased zzso zzso zzso can be detected in zzso zzso arteries using targeted high-resolution MR zzso zzso we conclude that zzso might serve as a novel imaging target for the detection of high-risk zzso
