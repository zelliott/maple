Previous studies using zzso zzso approach to analyze zzso zzso data were limited to a few slices or zzso zzso after substantial data zzso 

To develop a framework that can perform zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso data from a group of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were conducted for 86 adult subjects using a zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso After zzso and zzso to a standard template, zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated for all zzso inside the brain and translated into absolute zzso distances after imposing a threshold zzso The group averages of the zzso distances were then used to perform zzso zzso with the developed zzso which zzso gray matter masking and an zzso scheme to analyze the zzso 

With the zzso zzso zzso we identified most of the functional connectivity networks reported previously in the literature, such as the zzso zzso zzso memory, and the zzso functional networks zzso Furthermore, the zzso and visual system were split into their corresponding zzso zzso 

It is feasible to use the proposed zzso zzso scheme for zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso result not only confirmed generally the finding in functional connectivity networks identified previously using other data processing techniques, such as zzso but also revealed directly the zzso structure within the functional connectivity zzso
