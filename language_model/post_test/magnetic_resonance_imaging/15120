Laboratory investigation, ex zzso 

zzso complications are common after spinal zzso procedures, and magnetic resonance imaging zzso would be the ideal zzso to image these zzso Unfortunately, the implants cause artifacts that can render zzso zzso The zzso spin echo zzso sequence has been developed to mitigate artifacts caused by zzso The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the performance of the zzso sequence in canine zzso specimens after zzso with metallic zzso zzso 

zzso field strength, implant type, and zzso acquisition technique all play a role in the severity of zzso zzso The zzso sequence uses increased zzso view angle zzso and zzso zzso metal artifact zzso to correct for zzso zzso The zzso technique has outperformed conventional techniques in patients, after total hip zzso However, published reports of its application in subjects with zzso column implants are zzso 

zzso zzso anterior stabilization of the zzso joint was performed on 6 adult small breed zzso zzso zzso dogs using stainless steel screws and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso was performed using conventional pulse sequences and zzso sequences at 3 zzso Images were assessed zzso and zzso 

Images made with the zzso sequence had smaller zzso artifacts and superior spinal zzso margin zzso zzso sequences reduced the length over which zzso artifacts caused spinal zzso margin depiction interference by zzso to zzso with scan times of approximately 12 to 16 zzso 

The zzso sequence is a viable option for evaluating the zzso column after zzso with stainless steel zzso
