The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fused zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso in breast cancer patients and to compare zzso with zzso 

27 breast cancer patients zzso age zzso zzso underwent zzso and prone zzso Images were fused software-based to zzso zzso zzso served as the reference standard to define the following parameters for both zzso and zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso negative zzso value zzso and accuracy for the detection of breast cancer zzso Furthermore, the number of patients with correctly determined zzso zzso was zzso zzso between both zzso were assessed by zzso test zzso The number of patients in whom zzso would have changed the surgical approach was zzso 

58 breast zzso were zzso The sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and accuracy were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso For zzso they were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was as accurate for zzso detection zzso zzso 1) and determination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso In only 1 patient zzso would have changed the surgical zzso 

zzso is as accurate as zzso for the evaluation of local breast zzso zzso defines the zzso zzso as accurately as zzso and may have an impact on the surgical treatment in only a small portion of zzso Based on these results, zzso cannot be recommended as an adjunct or alternative to zzso
