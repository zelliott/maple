We assessed the change in the therapeutic decision among zzso treatments after adding zzso zzso to zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso 

This study zzso investigated two groups: 33 zzso confirmed zzso patients after liver transplantation in group 1; 34 zzso patients without pathology in group zzso In group 1, we simulated the therapeutic decision-making process by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In group 2, including the 34 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso we investigated the change of therapeutic decision after adding zzso zzso to zzso 

In the simulation from group 1, after adding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of treatment decisions were changed from the decision based on zzso zzso Among 22 patients considered eligible for zzso and 33 patients for zzso zzso the therapeutic decision was changed for 10 patients in the surgical group and 4 patients for the zzso group zzso and zzso In group 2, the rate of change in the therapeutic decision after adding zzso zzso to zzso was zzso zzso zzso In group 1 with zzso pathology, the median diameter of zzso not detected by zzso but detected by zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The median diameter of zzso seen only in the zzso liver was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of them were zzso zzso 

This study suggests that performing zzso zzso before deciding on zzso treatment for zzso zzso may improve the accuracy of treatment decision for zzso zzso
