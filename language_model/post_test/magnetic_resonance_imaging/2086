We present four cases of cerebral cavernous zzso that developed after zzso for brain tumor in three cases and for cavernous zzso in one zzso The time zzso between zzso and the detection of the cavernous zzso varied from three to nine years and the doses from 24 to 60 zzso Brain zzso appeared in two zzso zzso for the formation of cavernous zzso is unclear but is probably related to proliferation and zzso of the vascular zzso with formation of zzso zzso with evolution to cavernous zzso The pediatric brain appears particularly vulnerable to radiation zzso The risk of zzso appears higher than with spontaneous cavernous zzso
