We have previously demonstrated that the fractional zzso has significant correlation with the muscle strength of patients with zzso In this study, we have investigated whether fractional zzso can be used to zzso document stroke patients' functional level zzso zzso zzso 

Sixty motor units were recorded in zzso zzso zzso first zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscles in 18 stroke zzso zzso zzso scores, obtained fractional zzso and serial correlation zzso were analyzed and statistical determination was zzso 

zzso significance was found between fractional parameters and motor items of zzso (except zzso zzso no statistical significant correlation was found between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso could be a useful tool for measuring motor function at a single motor unit zzso
