Assessing zzso zzso zzso during pharmacological induced stress allows detection of zzso deficits and indicates zzso coronary arteries zzso The aim of our study was to demonstrate clinical relevance of zzso stress magnetic resonance imaging zzso by predicting necessity of CA zzso 

zzso patients with scheduled coronary zzso zzso were scanned in a zzso zzso zzso zzso After 3 zzso of zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso kinetic of contrast agent was zzso zzso necrosis was zzso with zzso late enhancement zzso zzso deficits were described as either zzso in viable zzso or zzso relevant zzso in viable zzso or as zzso in chronic zzso zzso zzso based on spatial and zzso extent of zzso and of zzso zzso was performed in all patients within 48 h after zzso and zzso if zzso was zzso zzso were read by two independent and blinded investigators and matched with zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso showed zzso in viable zzso and zzso was performed in zzso patients zzso In 111 patients with zzso relevant zzso in viable zzso zzso was performed in only 5 patients zzso In 88 patients classified as zzso in zzso zzso was performed in 14 patients zzso Positive zzso value of zzso for CA intervention was zzso negative zzso value was zzso sensitivity was zzso and specificity was zzso 

zzso allows clinical useful prediction of relevant CA disease with need for zzso prior to zzso and may be used as zzso test for zzso zzso and viability to guide further zzso
