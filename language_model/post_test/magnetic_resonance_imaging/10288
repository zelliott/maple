The aim of this study was to test our observation that back pain in zzso patients could be caused by premature and extensive zzso degenerative disc disease, when compared to zzso patients with back zzso 

Sixteen zzso patients with their zzso and zzso controls were recruited into the study, 12 with zzso major, and 4 with zzso zzso Both the zzso patients and control subjects suffered from back pain, which was zzso rather than zzso zzso All subjects underwent magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso spine, and 11 of the cases and 8 controls had zzso spine zzso Each zzso disc was scored for zzso appearances and MR features of disc zzso and disc zzso zzso values for these parameters and median scores were derived at each disc level, and were analyzed and zzso 

There was a zzso difference between proportion values of cases and controls for the MR features zzso zzso zzso and the zzso features zzso zzso zzso cases, zzso zzso of disc zzso The median disc level scores for the zzso group were zzso high across all zzso discs, and at all levels except at L zzso The control group zzso demonstrated a zzso for disc zzso at zzso zzso 

The distribution of zzso disc zzso in zzso patients with back pain is more extensive, severe and zzso in nature compared to matched controls, and disc zzso should be considered as a significant cause of back pain in this population zzso
