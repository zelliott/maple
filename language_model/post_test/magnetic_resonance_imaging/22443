The purpose of this paper was to define the general efficacy of and morbidity associated with zzso using modem methods of imaging and to zzso the risks related to specific zzso of the zzso 

All patients admitted to the Montreal Neurological Institute who had undergone either computerized zzso or magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso by one surgeon zzso were zzso The procedure was considered efficient if the obtained information was sufficient to make a decision either in support of or against zzso Two hundred zzso patients underwent 224 zzso with zzso zzso zzso related to each lobe were as zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso frontal zzso one zzso and three zzso zzso and zzso zzso one zzso zzso found 1 week after zzso zzso zzso zzso risk factors associated with zzso were zzso in the frontal lobe zzso zzso zzso and the use of four or more implanted zzso zzso zzso zzso General complications included the zzso 26 patients, psychiatric symptoms during zzso one patient, zzso four patients, scalp zzso and two patients, zzso during zzso in the early zzso One of these latter patients maintained a mild zzso and represents the only case of permanent neurological zzso in the entire zzso Data obtained during recordings supported an indication for surgery in 178 patients zzso excluded a surgical option in 37 patients zzso and were unsatisfactory in nine patients zzso Thus, the overall efficacy as defined previously was zzso 

zzso is an efficient procedure with low associated zzso zzso exploration of the zzso zzso has a morbidity rate of approximately zzso A higher risk of zzso occurs with the zzso of four or more zzso in the frontal zzso
