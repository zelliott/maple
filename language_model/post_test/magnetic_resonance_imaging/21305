Greater expertise for faces in adults than in children may be achieved by a dynamic interplay of functional segregation and integration of brain regions throughout zzso The present study examined zzso changes in face network functional connectivity in children zzso zzso and adults zzso zzso during zzso using a zzso zzso A zzso zzso change involved connectivity of the right zzso face zzso During childhood, this zzso increased in strength and zzso zzso based on positive zzso These changes reflect an important role of the zzso in segregation of function during zzso In addition, strength and diversity of connections within a module that included primary visual areas zzso and right zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso and right inferior zzso zzso increased from childhood to adulthood, reflecting increased zzso zzso This integration was pronounced for faces but also emerged for natural zzso Taken together, the primary zzso zzso changes involved segregation of a zzso visual module during childhood, possibly implicated in early stage zzso face processing, and greater integration of zzso connections from childhood to adulthood, which may reflect processing related to development of zzso expertise for zzso of faces and other visually zzso zzso
