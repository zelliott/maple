Patients with acute brain pathology requiring zzso zzso implants for zzso invasive monitoring are largely excluded from the benefits of zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso of a zzso diffusion cortical blood flow zzso sensor both in zzso zzso gelatin zzso and in zzso environments in a high field strength zzso zzso Two zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso and a single left zzso sensor was implanted zzso to determine any deleterious zzso Using standard zzso zzso zzso size, zzso effects, current generation, movement and reliability of recordings were assessed during zzso The zzso forces were zzso no zzso zzso effects were demonstrated, while wide fluctuations in cerebral blood flow recordings were zzso Mean image zzso size for implanted sensors was 6 times larger than in zzso Patients with an implanted zzso sensor may be safely zzso provided the device is zzso The zzso images obtained are of an acceptable zzso
