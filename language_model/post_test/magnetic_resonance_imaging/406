To report the magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of zzso zzso zzso and compare these features in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen cases of zzso zzso zzso were compared with 18 cases of zzso zzso zzso All patients were examined using zzso and zzso zzso zzso location, zzso size, signal intensity, enhancement zzso and zzso changes were zzso The zzso features were compared between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Most zzso zzso comprised two or more zzso The solid parts of the zzso showed moderate or marked enhancement after the injection of contrast zzso An enhanced zzso wall was found in six out of 14 cases in the zzso zzso group, but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were predominately located in the cerebral zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso were predominantly found in frontal zzso zzso zzso The zzso were larger in the zzso zzso group than in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso was more commonly found in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso Cystic zzso with solid parts located inside the zzso are reported for the first zzso 

Cystic zzso although zzso should be differentiated from other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have distinct zzso zzso The present study provides the first report of two zzso with solid parts located inside the cyst, as well as one zzso with a zzso solid zzso and zzso within the zzso
