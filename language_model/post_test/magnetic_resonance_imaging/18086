In our study, we tried to clarify whether patients with zzso spectrum disorder zzso reveal different moral decision patterns as compared to healthy subjects and whether common social interaction difficulties in zzso are reflected in altered brain zzso during different aspects of moral zzso 28 patients with zzso zzso and 28 healthy subjects matched for zzso age and education took part in an zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Participants were confronted with zzso dilemma situations followed by proposed solutions to which they could agree or zzso On a neural level, moral decision making was associated with zzso in anterior zzso prefrontal regions, the zzso junction and the zzso for both zzso However, while patients and healthy controls did not exhibit significant behavioral differences, zzso patients showed decreased zzso in zzso regions, particularly the amygdala, as well as increased zzso in the anterior and the zzso zzso zzso during moral zzso zzso of brain zzso in patients might thus indicate specific zzso in zzso However, zzso increases in brain regions associated with the zzso mode zzso and self-referential zzso also provide evidence for an altered way of patients' cerebral processing with regard to decision making based on social zzso
