zzso zzso of spinal tumors is often used to reduce blood loss from zzso zzso blood loss, even in patients who undergo zzso is potentially zzso zzso techniques, surgical procedures or tumor characteristics may affect zzso blood zzso 

To zzso analyze factors affecting zzso blood loss in patients who had undergone spinal tumor zzso and to assess the safety of the zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 60 zzso with a tumor involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso spine underwent zzso tumor zzso with zzso Multiple zzso including patient zzso tumor zzso zzso techniques, and surgical procedures, were evaluated with respect to zzso blood loss and zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso procedures were also zzso zzso and zzso analysis were performed to analyze the variables affecting the zzso blood loss and zzso zzso 

Complete or near-complete tumor zzso was achieved in 47 zzso The average estimated blood loss zzso and packed red blood cells units zzso during surgery were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 units zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated tumor volume, surgical approach, and zzso of the spinal surgery to be significant variables affecting zzso zzso zzso and extent, tumor zzso degree of zzso and size of zzso particle did not affect operative blood zzso On zzso analysis, zzso of the surgery was the only variable that influenced zzso Two patients developed irreversible zzso deficits following zzso 

zzso technique or zzso has a limited effect on operative blood loss after zzso spinal tumor zzso zzso blood loss from spinal surgery is dependent primarily on the zzso of the zzso Although zzso zzso is a relatively safe zzso there remains a risk of zzso zzso
