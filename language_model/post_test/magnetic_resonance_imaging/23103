zzso data have shown that attractive faces are better remembered but the neural mechanisms of this effect are largely zzso To investigate this issue, female participants were scanned with zzso functional zzso zzso while rating the attractiveness of male zzso Memory for the faces was tested after zzso scanning and was used to identify successful zzso activity zzso memory zzso As expected, attractive faces were remembered better than other zzso The study yielded three main zzso zzso First, activity in the right zzso zzso increased zzso as a function of attractiveness zzso Second, activity in the left zzso increased as a function of subsequent memory zzso zzso confidence zzso confidence zzso Third, functional connectivity between these zzso and zzso regions was stronger during the zzso of attractive than neutral or unattractive zzso These results suggest that better memory for attractive faces reflects greater interaction between a region associated with zzso the zzso cortex, and a region associated with successful memory zzso the zzso
