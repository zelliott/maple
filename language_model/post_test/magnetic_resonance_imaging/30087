The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of children with lower urinary tract or zzso zzso 

The authors zzso investigated the presence of spinal zzso abnormalities in 176 patients with functional urinary and zzso problems: 88 children with zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 88 zzso zzso zzso Each group included 46 boys and 42 girls (age range zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated zzso zzso zzso during both day and night, urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, zzso intractable zzso and zzso zzso were assessed in all zzso zzso resonance zzso images were obtained in all patients and evaluated for spinal zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated on the basis of plain zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups on any of the clinical zzso The most common sites of zzso on zzso were the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and control groups, respectively, were zzso and zzso (no statistically significant zzso zzso zzso was found in 17 children (7 in the zzso group and 10 in the control group, zzso zzso MR imaging findings were observed in 9 children zzso in the zzso group and 3 zzso in the control zzso zzso included zzso spinal zzso in 5 children, zzso in 4, and zzso zzso in zzso No significant association was found between the presence of zzso and spinal zzso abnormalities identified on MR images zzso paired zzso 

Among children with functional zzso and urinary problems, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of abnormal spinal MR imaging findings in those with zzso zzso and an zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso was not shown to be a reliable indicator of spinal zzso structural zzso Its probable role as a finding associated with spinal zzso dysfunction remains zzso
