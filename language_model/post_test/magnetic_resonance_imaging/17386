zzso Spin zzso zzso is a zzso method to zzso measure zzso without the need of contrast zzso zzso of zzso is derived from the zzso of two zzso acquired scans, with or without radio frequency labeling of the zzso in the feeding zzso So far, almost all zzso methods only allowed labeling the entire feeding artery tree of the brain zzso without separation of the individual zzso zzso In this paper, we describe a newly developed method, Regional zzso Imaging, allowing quantitative measurement of zzso in the watershed of individually labeled arteries zzso and left internal zzso as well as zzso artery and the zzso zzso Unlike conventional digital zzso zzso this new method is completely zzso and allows to selectively measure cerebral zzso and not only to get zzso of the feeding zzso Regional zzso was already measured in more than 70 elderly healthy volunteers and over 30 patients with internal carotid disease zzso zzso and/or after zzso bypass zzso A large variation among zzso territories, even in healthy volunteers, can be zzso This method has the potential to increase our understanding of the relationship between collateral flow and regional zzso in patients with zzso zzso
