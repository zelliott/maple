The goal of dynamic zzso zzso zzso of zzso data is to study zzso induced changes in functional integration among brain zzso This requires zzso zzso plausible and zzso zzso models of zzso network dynamics that can predict distributed brain responses to experimental stimuli and zzso efficient statistical methods for zzso zzso and model zzso These two key components of zzso have been the focus of more than thirty zzso articles since the seminal work of zzso and colleagues published in zzso In this paper, we provide a critical review of the current state-of-the-art of zzso We inspect the properties of zzso in relation to the most common zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the specificity of zzso on neural systems that can be made from these zzso We then discuss both the zzso of the underlying zzso models and the zzso of the statistical inversion zzso Finally, we discuss potential extensions of the current zzso zzso such as zzso zzso plastic zzso and field zzso
