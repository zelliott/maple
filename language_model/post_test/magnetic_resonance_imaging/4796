Previous studies have suggested combining magnetic resonance zzso imaging and biopsy in patients with zzso but association between MR results and clinical symptoms have never been zzso The purpose of this retrospective study was to better delineate patients profiles requiring bone zzso zzso imaging in zzso 

50 MR studies and blind zzso zzso were reviewed in 40 patients with zzso MR results were compared to clinical, zzso and zzso follow-up data to determine potential associations between MR results and these zzso 

zzso of MR studies were abnormal with a normal zzso zzso were normal with an abnormal zzso zzso MR results were significantly associated with subsequent bone zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso zzso MR studies were significantly associated with constitutional symptoms, bone pains zzso zzso zzso and an elevated alkaline zzso level zzso zzso zzso MR imaging excluded zzso in three patients and caused therapy to be modified in zzso 

zzso clinical and zzso data should be used to screen patients with normal zzso for MR imaging, especially in patients with Hodgkin's disease and high grade zzso zzso
