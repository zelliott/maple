To investigate whether the vessel wall zzso of carotid arteries would differentiate zzso soft plaque from solid zzso plaque by identifying liquid components more accurately than color zzso zzso zzso 

This study included 54 carotid arteries in 54 consecutive patients who underwent carotid zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 68 major segments of the 54 carotid plaques were grouped into four MR categories based on signal intensity index zzso MR criteria used for the diagnosis of plaque vulnerability were: zzso soft plaque including a segment of liquid component zzso A or B), solid zzso plaque zzso C or zzso The MR and US findings were compared with zzso findings of zzso zzso 

zzso findings and microscopic examination of zzso specimens revealed 24 zzso soft plaques and 30 solid zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for diagnosing zzso soft plaque are zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for color zzso zzso zzso The zzso MR evaluation of carotid wall also revealed detailed information of plaque segments and correlated well with the features of corresponding zzso zzso 

zzso wall zzso with zzso category could have a potential to more accurately diagnose an zzso soft plaque predominantly composed of liquid components in comparison with color zzso zzso
