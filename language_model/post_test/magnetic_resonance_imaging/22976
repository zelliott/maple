zzso PET has a high accuracy in staging head and neck cancer, but its role in patients with clinically and zzso negative zzso zzso is less zzso In particular, the value of combined zzso has not been determined in this group of zzso 

In a prospective study, 31 patients with oral cancer and no evidence of zzso zzso zzso by clinical examination or zzso underwent zzso zzso before zzso neck zzso zzso findings were recorded by neck side zzso or right) and zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were compared with zzso of dissected zzso which was the standard of zzso 

zzso neck zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso a total of 36 neck zzso involving 142 zzso levels, were zzso Only 13 of zzso dissected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso in 9 of 36 neck sides and 9 of 142 zzso zzso PET was zzso in 6 zzso levels (6 neck zzso zzso in 3 levels (3 neck zzso zzso in zzso levels zzso neck zzso and zzso in 6 levels (4 neck zzso The 3 zzso findings occurred in zzso smaller than 3 zzso or because of inability to distinguish between primary tumor and adjacent zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited similar standardized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso zzso and specificity were zzso and zzso on the basis of neck sides and zzso and zzso on the basis of number of zzso levels, zzso If a decision regarding the need for neck dissection had been based solely on zzso 3 zzso zzso would have been zzso and 4 zzso zzso would have been zzso 

zzso zzso can identify zzso zzso zzso in a segment of patients with oral cancer and zzso zzso A negative test can exclude zzso deposits with high zzso Despite reasonably high overall zzso however, the clinical application of zzso in the zzso neck may be limited by the combination of limited sensitivity for small zzso deposits and a relatively high number of zzso zzso The surgical management of the zzso neck should therefore not be based on zzso findings zzso
