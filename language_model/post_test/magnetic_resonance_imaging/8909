This study evaluated the neural basis of verbal working memory zzso function in a group of 20 children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders zzso and 20 typically developing comparison participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Both groups showed prominent zzso in the zzso network known to be important for verbal zzso Despite equivalent behavioral performance between groups, zzso individuals showed increased zzso relative to typically developing individuals in left zzso frontal and left inferior zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso regions during verbal zzso These effects remained even when group differences on zzso were statistically zzso This pattern of increased zzso coupled with equivalent behavioral performance between groups suggests that individuals with zzso recruit a more extensive network of brain regions during verbal zzso relative to typically developing zzso These findings may suggest that zzso processing during verbal zzso is less efficient in zzso zzso
