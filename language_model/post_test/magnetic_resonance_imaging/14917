We investigated the incremental value of magnetic resonance imaging in addition to clinical variables for predicting pathological outcomes and disease recurrence in patients with clinically high risk prostate zzso 

A total of 922 consecutive patients with clinically high risk prostate cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging before radical zzso We created zzso zzso zzso and Cox zzso hazards models with clinical variables only or combined with magnetic resonance imaging data to predict pathological outcomes and zzso zzso The models were compared using zzso zzso and the Harrell zzso zzso 

The proportion of patients with pathological zzso extension, seminal zzso invasion and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso extension, seminal zzso invasion and zzso zzso zzso detection were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve of the model with clinical variable and magnetic resonance imaging data was greater than that of the model with clinical variables alone to predict zzso extension and seminal zzso invasion zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso recurrence-free survival rate was zzso To predict zzso recurrence the zzso index of the zzso model with clinical variables only and with clinical variables plus magnetic resonance imaging data was zzso and zzso respectively zzso 

zzso resonance imaging findings have incremental value in addition to clinical variables for predicting pathological outcomes and disease zzso
