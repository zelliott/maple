Despite immense importance of auditory verbal hallucinations zzso in the zzso of zzso the zzso and zzso bases of zzso remain zzso On the zzso level, it has been proposed that zzso arise from the zzso monitoring zzso by patients' inability to recognize their inner speech as being their zzso On the zzso level, the zzso have been attributed to the zzso activity in the primary auditory zzso zzso zzso Although interesting, these models cannot account for the very specific and restricted content of zzso in individual zzso The specific content of zzso persists across different psychotic episodes even after extended periods of zzso Furthermore, the zzso are usually triggered by emotionally charged and stressful zzso 

We hypothesized that even during absence of zzso when patients are in zzso the verbal content remains present in the zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso potential cerebral zzso of the dormant zzso content, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 6 schizophrenia patients in total zzso of zzso for at least 12 months, during listening to the words zzso by them in the zzso Specifically, we created the list of previously zzso words for each patient and matched the words in terms of zzso structure, emotional zzso semantic category and frequency of usage with the zzso zzso Moreover, each patient was paired demographically with the control participant who was presented with the same zzso We predicted that exposure to the zzso versus zzso words would result in increased zzso in cerebral areas associated with cognitive and emotional content of previously experienced zzso in patients, whereas the same comparison will not produce any significant changes in blood oxygen zzso zzso signal in control zzso In addition, based on existing zzso data obtained during experience of zzso we hypothesized that previously zzso words may elicit greater zzso in the primary auditory zzso than the zzso words in zzso Each pair of participants was analyzed zzso 

The most consistent finding in patients, absent in all control participants, was significant zzso in the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during listening to previously zzso versus zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are both part of zzso system and play an important role in cognitive control of emotion zzso 

Thus, present results imply that previously zzso words, even in zzso are associated with inappropriate emotional response on zzso level in schizophrenia zzso The relative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in patients may stem from and/or may contribute to anomalous neural plasticity and zzso connectivity in the zzso zzso This in turn could lead to attribution of excessive emotional zzso to normally neutral stimuli and over time via process of zzso could result in zzso Potential zzso of this dysfunction could reduce patients' zzso to experience zzso in stressful zzso In addition to observed zzso in the zzso some schizophrenia patients exhibited anomalous zzso signal in other regions of the zzso system such as anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso These additional anomalies could be related to greater affective sensitivity to the zzso versus zzso words in some zzso 

Finally, in contrast to our initial hypothesis we did not observe any significant differences between processing of the zzso versus zzso words in the primary auditory zzso In retrospect, this result is not surprising because patients did not experience internally generated zzso while in the zzso but instead were exposed exclusively to zzso generated zzso
