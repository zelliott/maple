zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides immediate feedback and quality assurance enabling the zzso to improve the quality of a range of zzso zzso Implementation of zzso is a complex and costly zzso We describe our preliminary 16 months experience with the integration of an zzso zzso ceiling mounted high field zzso zzso zzso setup with two operating zzso 

Aspects of zzso of our zzso and our initial 16 months of clinical experience in 180 consecutive patients were zzso 

The installation of a ceiling mounted zzso zzso between two operating rooms was completed in April 2008 at zzso Hospital in zzso zzso Experience with 180 zzso cases zzso age range zzso years, 71 zzso 57 zzso zzso 9 zzso 11 other tumor cases, 4 zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso and 22 other zzso zzso demonstrated that this device effectively provided high quality real-time zzso zzso In 74 of all 180 cases zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso the surgeon modified the procedure based upon the zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso cases achieved zzso total zzso compared to zzso of non zzso zzso cases in this time zzso 

A zzso high field strength zzso can be safely integrated between two zzso operating zzso This strategy leads to modification of the surgical procedure in a significant number of cases, particularly for zzso zzso zzso follow up is needed to evaluate the clinical and financial impact of this technology in the field of zzso
