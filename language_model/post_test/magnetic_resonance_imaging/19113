zzso back muscle injury was evaluated in rats by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso 

To compare the magnetic resonance imaging manifestation of back muscle injury with the zzso findings in rats and to subsequently clarify the zzso appearance of the high intensity regions on zzso images in human zzso back zzso 

In a previous study, it was found that the signal intensity on zzso images of the zzso back muscles was increased in patients who had zzso zzso muscle zzso especially in those with a prolonged surgery zzso However, the specific zzso changes that cause the high signal intensity on zzso images remain zzso 

zzso were divided into three groups: sham operation group, zzso zzso group, and zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso of the zzso muscles were examined before surgery and at 2, 7, and 21 days after zzso 

zzso imaging was more useful than zzso imaging to estimate back muscle zzso The high signal intensity of the zzso muscles on zzso images remained 21 days after surgery only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso muscles was complete at 21 days after surgery in the zzso zzso group, but the zzso muscle fibers in the zzso zzso group had a small diameter, and the zzso fluid space remained zzso 

The high signal intensity on zzso images of the zzso zzso muscles in the zzso phase may be due to an increased zzso space and incomplete muscle fiber zzso
