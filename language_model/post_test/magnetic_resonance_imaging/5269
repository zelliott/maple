To zzso the relationship between zzso age, zzso findings, and magnetic resonance zzso imaging measures of tissue zzso in deep gray matter areas in very zzso zzso zzso at zzso 

The study was approved by the research ethics zzso Written informed consent was given by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (19 zzso median zzso age, zzso weeks) with zzso gray matter structures at presentation underwent MR imaging within 2 weeks of birth that included zzso and zzso zzso transfer, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were separated into the following groups: those with normal findings zzso zzso 23), those with white matter injury zzso zzso zzso zzso those with grade I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those with grade II zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso was used to determine regional effects of age and zzso findings on zzso transfer ratio zzso and to assess the relationship between zzso and zzso 

zzso increased zzso with age zzso zzso zzso with a similar rate of change of zzso per week zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A lower trend zzso per week; zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in the zzso Higher zzso were seen in the zzso and zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating earlier zzso zzso higher zzso values were observed in the zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso in the zzso were observed in the group of zzso with normal findings at presentation than in the group with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be used to monitor early zzso in the developing brain and to help detect changes in tissue that are not shown on zzso and zzso MR zzso
