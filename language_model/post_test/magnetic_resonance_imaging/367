According to zzso load theory, processing of zzso stimuli is limited by the zzso load of a parallel attended task if both the task and the irrelevant stimuli are presented to the same sensory zzso However, it remains a matter of debate whether the same principles apply to zzso zzso load and, more generally, what form zzso zzso zzso in early zzso areas takes in zzso Here we addressed these questions using functional magnetic resonance zzso Participants undertook an auditory zzso working memory task of low or high zzso load, while zzso viewing zzso images at one of three object visibility zzso The processing of the visual and auditory stimuli was measured in the lateral zzso zzso zzso and auditory zzso zzso zzso zzso interference with sensory processing was observed in both the zzso and zzso in accordance with previous results of zzso zzso load zzso The present zzso results therefore warrant the extension of zzso load theory from a zzso to a zzso zzso a validation of this zzso interference effect through zzso measures would consolidate the zzso
