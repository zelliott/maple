A subset of patients with cerebral zzso zzso zzso present with cognitive symptoms, seizures, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence of zzso vascular zzso 

To analyze the risk factors, diagnostic zzso and long-term course of this zzso 

We assessed 14 consecutive patients with zzso diagnosed zzso zzso 12 with available zzso and follow-up zzso Patients were evaluated for zzso appearance, zzso zzso and clinical course over a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso scans were characterized by zzso zzso zzso extending to the zzso white matter and occasionally the zzso gray matter, with signal properties suggesting zzso zzso zzso could be divided into three groups based on response to zzso zzso zzso improvement zzso initial improvement followed by symptomatic zzso zzso and no evident response to treatment zzso The volume of zzso zzso correlated with the severity of clinical zzso One patient experienced symptomatic zzso zzso within a region of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was strongly associated with zzso zzso present in zzso zzso of subjects vs zzso zzso with symptomatic but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso inflammation represents a zzso zzso zzso and genetically distinct disease zzso with implications for clinical practice and ongoing zzso approaches to zzso zzso
