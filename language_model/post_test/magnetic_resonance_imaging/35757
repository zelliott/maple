The capability of rapid zzso MR imaging to zzso left zzso function was assessed in 13 normal subjects and in 15 patients with zzso heart disease and regional zzso abnormalities proved by zzso and/or by contrast zzso Fifteen to 20 MR zzso cycle were acquired by using partial flip angles, short repetition times, and zzso zzso Regional wall motion was assessed zzso in the equatorial left zzso section by using the zzso display and zzso by measuring zzso thickness at zzso and at zzso in six left zzso segments in this zzso In normal volunteers wall motion was normal in all zzso zzso of zzso wall zzso was observed in normal subjects, ranging from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso segment to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso wall zzso was zzso zzso zzso From the cinematic display of MR images, abnormal wall motion was observed in 40 of 90 segments in patients with zzso heart disease, which correlated well with results of zzso or contrast zzso zzso segments were zzso 15 were zzso and four were zzso In patients with zzso heart disease, percentage zzso wall zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the segments with normal wall motion, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Absolute zzso wall zzso was less than 2 zzso in 31 of 40 abnormal segments and was greater than 2 zzso in only zzso Rapid zzso improved zzso resolution, and the capacity for zzso display make this new MR technique potentially useful not only for qualitative assessment of cardiac wall motion, but also for zzso of regional zzso zzso
