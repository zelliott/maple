There is a clinical need to be able to assess graft loss of transplanted pancreatic zzso zzso zzso with clear-cut zzso of zzso zzso We tracked transplanted zzso in diabetic mice during the early zzso period by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso the zzso loss using automatic zzso zzso 

zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso and zzso were injected into the right liver zzso Animals underwent zzso scanning during 14 days after zzso zzso MR images were processed using custom-made software, which automatically detects zzso regions representing zzso It is based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and automatically detected areas, corresponding to zzso differed by zzso in zzso Signal loss regions due to zzso decreased comparably in all groups during the first week post zzso Throughout the second week zzso the signal loss area continued in a steep decline in case of zzso and zzso whereas the decline in case of zzso slowed zzso 

Automatic zzso allows for the more zzso objective assessment of transplanted zzso zzso confirms the assumption that a significant number of zzso are destroyed in the first week following transplantation irrespective of zzso zzso or zzso
