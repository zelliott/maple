zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso combined to zzso is clinically administered through isolated limb zzso zzso for regionally advanced soft tissue zzso of the zzso In zzso studies, zzso zzso gene is involved in the regulation of zzso action of zzso and loss of zzso function contributes to the resistance of zzso cells to zzso The relationship between zzso status and response to zzso and zzso in patients undergoing zzso is zzso 

We studied 110 cases of zzso limbs zzso treated by zzso zzso was carried out using zzso which zzso with an zzso zzso from the zzso region of both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso and zzso which zzso with the zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso native zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso data were then correlated with various clinical zzso 

zzso was found expressed at high levels in 28 patients, whereas zzso was negative in zzso The zzso with poor zzso response to zzso with zzso and zzso showed significantly higher levels of zzso zzso 

Our results might be a clue to a role of zzso protein status in zzso and zzso response in clinical zzso
