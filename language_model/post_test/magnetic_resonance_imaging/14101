zzso zzso of brain tumor volume are helpful in evaluating the response to therapy and the need for changing treatment zzso Our purpose was to adapt the zzso zzso technique to measure tumor zzso This technique requires only limited operator zzso 

zzso zzso brain MR imaging was performed in 19 patients with primary zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was performed on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso images by using a zzso algorithm, and tumor volumes were zzso zzso interaction was limited to selecting representative seed points within the tumor and, if necessary, editing the segmented image to include or exclude improperly classified zzso 

zzso of tumor volume were highly zzso when they were obtained with no zzso zzso zzso of variation were zzso and zzso respectively, for enhanced images and zzso zzso zzso consistently produced smaller volumes, at the cost of greater zzso in volume zzso zzso of variation for volumes with editing ranged from zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso permits zzso reliable, consistent and highly zzso measurement of tumor volume from MR images with limited operator zzso
