To describe the use of zzso to identify and biopsy areas of zzso in patients with a suspected diagnosis of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is characterized at magnetic resonance imaging zzso as having a zzso zzso appearance on zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were assessed in 15 patients with a final pathological diagnosis of zzso zzso for regions of zzso reduced signal zzso Information regarding the site of ultrasound or zzso zzso zzso biopsy was available in 10 zzso 

Nine patients were male and six female with a mean age of 60 years zzso zzso zzso The sites involved were the zzso zzso zzso pelvis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso component consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 14 of the 15 cases, areas of lower signal intensity lacking in zzso were zzso In nine of the 10 cases, biopsy site included such areas and yielded high-grade zzso 

zzso within zzso may be identified on zzso zzso as areas of reduced signal zzso These areas should be the preferred site of zzso
