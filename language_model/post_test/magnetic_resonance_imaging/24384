This study compares the diagnostic performance of zzso CT zzso zzso conventional zzso MR and MR zzso zzso in detecting intrinsic ligament and triangular zzso complex zzso tears of the zzso 

Ten zzso zzso of five male subjects with an average age zzso zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso conventional zzso MR and zzso We assessed the presence of zzso ligament zzso zzso ligament zzso and zzso tears using a combination of conventional zzso and zzso as a gold zzso All images were evaluated in consensus by two musculoskeletal zzso with sensitivity, zzso and accuracy being zzso 

zzso of zzso conventional zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest sensitivity, zzso and accuracy among the three investigations while zzso performed better than conventional zzso zzso also had the highest sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for identifying which component of the zzso and zzso was zzso zzso tears of both zzso and zzso were better zzso than zzso or zzso tears on all three imaging zzso 

Both CT and MR zzso have a very high degree of accuracy for diagnosing tears of the zzso zzso and zzso with both being more accurate than conventional MR zzso
