Recent developments in zzso software and hardware have increased the speed and versatility of cardiac zzso by allowing image acquisition in a single zzso Many studies have shown that conventional cardiac zzso is as accurate as zzso or cardiac zzso for diagnosing numerous cardiac zzso In many cases cardiac zzso is the most accurate diagnostic technique but has not been widely adopted for routine cardiac zzso One reason why the use of cardiac zzso has been limited is the long examination times required for conventional cardiac zzso The development of better hardware, such as faster zzso amplifiers and dedicated surface zzso has allowed the zzso of much faster zzso imaging zzso These can be used in a single zzso period, with a significant improvement in image quality compared with conventional zzso zzso sequences can provide all the information provided by conventional cardiac zzso in a shorter time and with equal or better zzso zzso imaging will allow much wider application of zzso to routine cardiac zzso
