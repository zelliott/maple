Previous studies have highlighted the associations between zzso cardiac or total fat zzso and cardiovascular zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different zzso fat zzso on zzso of zzso dysfunction and cardiovascular disease zzso 

Using magnetic resonance imaging in 113 subjects, we measured abdominal zzso and zzso and cardiac zzso and zzso fat zzso and examined their association with overall zzso and abdominal obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso total and HDL zzso zzso tolerance (by an oral zzso tolerance zzso and insulin sensitivity, blood pressure and 10-year coronary heart disease risk by zzso zzso 

Fat zzso was zzso to the degree of zzso with body fat ranging from 14 to 33 zzso visceral fat from zzso to zzso zzso and cardiac fat from zzso to 236 zzso Most cardiac fat zzso on zzso was zzso with a wide zzso for both cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only visceral and zzso fat, but not zzso or subcutaneous fat, could discriminate between subjects with three or more factors of the zzso syndrome or zzso coronary heart disease risk zzso Controlling for gender and zzso by multivariable analysis, the best marker of reduced insulin sensitivity was visceral fat zzso r zzso zzso zzso fat was the closest associate of increased blood pressure zzso r zzso zzso and both zzso and visceral fat clustered with zzso zzso r zzso zzso and zzso both P zzso zzso 

Increased zzso fat per zzso does not necessarily translate into presence or prediction of zzso In contrast, increased deposition of visceral abdominal and zzso zzso fat are both associated with an enhanced cardiovascular disease risk zzso
