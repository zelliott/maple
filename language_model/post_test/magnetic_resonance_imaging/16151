zzso is strongly depending on medical imaging technology and consequently directing technological zzso A novel technology can only be established, however, if improved diagnostic accuracy influence on therapeutic management and/or overall reduced cost can be zzso It has been demonstrated recently that zzso zzso Imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can technologically be integrated into one single hybrid zzso Some scientific arguments on the benefits are obvious, zzso that simultaneous imaging of zzso and functional information will improve tissue zzso However, crossfire of questions still remains: what zzso zzso needs are addressed by the novel zzso What level of hardware integration is reasonable, or would software-based image zzso be zzso Will zzso achieve higher diagnostic accuracy compared to separate zzso What is the added value compared to other hybrid imaging zzso like zzso And finally, is the system economically reasonable and has the potential to reduce overall costs for therapy planning and zzso This article tries to highlight some perspectives of applying an integrated zzso system for simultaneous zzso and functional zzso
