A number of techniques have been developed to track the migration of T cells in zzso but they all suffer significant shortcomings, including the examination of selected zzso rather than the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso limitations imposed by poor spatial resolution and the application of zzso zzso By zzso the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso in a reaction yielding a mean zzso of 45, a magnetic resonance zzso contrast agent was zzso that allowed T cells to be efficiently zzso within just 5 zzso The zzso zzso were incorporated into both the zzso and nucleus of zzso cells, which retained normal in zzso zzso responses to a zzso zzso zzso responses zzso by zzso zzso zzso regulatory T zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso and zzso of an activated zzso zzso We believe that this zzso efficient and essentially zzso approach to zzso both zzso and human T cells for zzso holds considerable promise, paving the way for the wider zzso application of this exciting zzso
