To determine the spectrum and frequency of zzso zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso and to define a risk profile of the zzso 

A prospective follow-up of 71 zzso bone zzso recipients 14 zzso 3 months after zzso Patients underwent a zzso examination, a zzso test battery, and zzso zzso before and after zzso 

A large proportion of patients zzso developed zzso after zzso Acute complications of defined zzso occurred in zzso of the patients and led to death in zzso of the study zzso A total of zzso of the patients developed new zzso abnormalities of undefined origin that were mild and zzso and predominantly affected the peripheral nervous zzso The cognitive and zzso outcome was favorable in a majority of these patients, but a small zzso exhibited cognitive deterioration and white matter zzso zzso factor analysis identified acute zzso disease zzso and other variables partly related to zzso such as long-lasting zzso as the main zzso of zzso after zzso zzso The authors have established an association with various factors but, zzso to the zzso character of this study, conclusions about the zzso of the findings are zzso 

zzso complications significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality of patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso cognitive deficits, and white matter zzso detected 1 year after zzso in a zzso of patients may be related to more extensive zzso changes observed after transplantation in an earlier retrospective study and may be associated with the risk factor chronic zzso
