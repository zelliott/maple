Previous studies have suggested that zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso influences responses to zzso zzso with opposite effects in patients recovered from depression zzso and zzso Here we sought to clarify the zzso mechanisms underpinning these surprising zzso Twenty controls and 23 zzso subjects completed the study; functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso data were available for 17 zzso subjects and 16 zzso Following zzso or sham zzso subjects performed an zzso task during zzso Although no zzso effects on mood were identified, significant zzso interactions were observed in the zzso and zzso zzso in response to emotionally zzso zzso In both regions, zzso depletion increased responses to negative words, relative to positive words, in zzso controls, previously identified as being at low-risk for mood change following this zzso By contrast, in zzso zzso controls and zzso zzso subjects, zzso depletion had the opposite zzso Increased neural responses to negative words following zzso depletion may reflect an zzso mechanism promoting resilience to mood change following zzso of the zzso system, which is reversed in zzso vulnerable to developing depressive zzso However, this interpretation is complicated by our failure to replicate previous findings of increased negative mood following zzso zzso
