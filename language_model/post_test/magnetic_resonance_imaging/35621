zzso is a core symptom of major depressive disorder zzso long thought to be associated with reduced zzso zzso However, most zzso do not act directly on the zzso system and all zzso have a delayed full therapeutic zzso Recently, it has been proposed that zzso fail to alter zzso function in zzso unresponsive zzso There is compelling evidence that zzso zzso code a specific zzso (short zzso zzso zzso described by zzso difference zzso zzso There is no current evidence for other zzso coding a TD zzso zzso although such evidence may be found in zzso The zzso zzso of the TD signal were not explored in this zzso zzso signals are believed to have quite different properties to zzso zzso zzso zzso No studies have investigated zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso adults with zzso receiving long-term zzso medication, and comparison controls both zzso and acutely zzso with the zzso zzso were scanned using zzso during a zzso zzso Three hypotheses were zzso first, patients with zzso have blunted TD zzso zzso second, controls given an zzso acutely have blunted TD zzso zzso third, the extent of zzso in TD signals in major depression zzso with illness severity zzso The results supported the zzso Patients with zzso had significantly reduced zzso signals in many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anterior cingulate, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the TD signal was increased in the zzso of zzso As predicted, acute zzso administration to controls was associated with a blunted TD zzso and the zzso TD signal was not increased by acute zzso zzso In a number of regions, the magnitude of the abnormal signals in zzso correlated with illness severity zzso The findings highlight the importance of zzso zzso signals, and are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso fail to zzso zzso function in zzso zzso zzso there is evidence that some zzso acutely suppress zzso function, the long-term action of virtually all zzso is enhanced zzso zzso zzso This distinction might help to zzso the delayed action of zzso Finally, analogous to recent work in zzso the finding of abnormal zzso zzso signals in zzso implies that an integrated understanding of symptoms and treatment mechanisms is possible, spanning zzso zzso and zzso
