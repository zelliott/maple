We report a case of zzso zzso of the zzso and correlate magnetic resonance zzso and pathological zzso The zzso appeared as multiple zzso areas along the wall of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso on zzso images and slight zzso on zzso zzso However, the zzso areas did not yield low apparent diffusion zzso zzso values on zzso map zzso These MR findings were similar to the signal intensity of the zzso zzso reflecting the presence of abundant zzso zzso
