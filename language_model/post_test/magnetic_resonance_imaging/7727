Independent component analysis zzso has been often used to decompose zzso data mostly for the zzso block and zzso designs due to its outstanding zzso For zzso data during zzso experiences, only a few exploratory studies applied zzso 

For processing the zzso data zzso by zzso modern zzso a zzso based zzso filter was used to further zzso the zzso data to remove sources of no interest and zzso Then, a fast model order selection method was applied to estimate the number of zzso Next, both individual zzso and group zzso were zzso zzso zzso components whose zzso courses were significantly correlated with musical features were zzso Finally, for individual zzso common components across majority of participants were found by diffusion map and spectral zzso 

The extracted spatial maps (by the new zzso zzso common across most participants evidenced slightly zzso activity within and surrounding the auditory zzso Meanwhile, they were found associated with the musical zzso 

Compared with the conventional zzso approach, more participants were found to have the common spatial maps extracted by the new zzso zzso Conventional model order selection methods underestimated the true number of sources in the conventionally zzso zzso data for the individual zzso 

zzso the zzso data by using a reasonable zzso digital filter can greatly benefit the following model order selection and zzso with zzso data by zzso zzso zzso map and spectral zzso are straightforward tools to find common zzso spatial zzso
