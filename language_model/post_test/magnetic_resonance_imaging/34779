To define various zzso MR appearances in Wilson's disease zzso 

MR examinations of 30 patients zzso years old) with zzso were zzso zzso Six patients were zzso zzso Three other patients had isolated zzso involvement, one with no zzso The remaining 21 patients had neurological involvement, 7 of whom had the mixed form of the zzso Nine patients had zzso dysfunction, the 3 with isolated zzso involvement and 6 of the 7 with the mixed zzso 

All symptomatic patients zzso zzso zzso had abnormal MR zzso zzso was present in the majority of zzso The most frequently involved sites were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with neurological zzso The zzso zzso showed a consistent pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were lacking in only 3 patients with neurological involvement, all of whom were relatively old and had had the disease for a longer zzso Most of the patients with zzso dysfunction zzso had increased zzso signal intensity in the zzso zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso involvement always included the zzso aspect of the zzso however, in some cases the central portion of zzso was also affected but zzso zzso fibers were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nucleus zzso zzso were also zzso In a few patients cortical and zzso white matter zzso were present with a zzso to the frontal zzso particularly the zzso zzso In one patient, a zzso focus was identified within the white matter zzso 

On zzso images, zzso is suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso with a pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the involvement of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gray matter, the zzso zzso and the zzso The zzso component of zzso may cause increased zzso signal intensity in zzso zzso In the adult age group, the zzso zzso zzso may be different from those in the pediatric zzso the zzso zzso may not be zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso may show increased zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may also be present with a zzso to the frontal zzso
