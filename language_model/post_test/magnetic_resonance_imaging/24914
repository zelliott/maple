The present study investigated the role that imaging could have for assessing lung inflammation in a mouse model of zzso zzso dust zzso allergic zzso zzso is usually assessed using terminal procedures such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, zzso zzso resonance zzso and CT zzso zzso methods have the potential to allow zzso repeated study of individual zzso Female zzso mice were administered daily either zzso or a solution of mixed zzso proteins sufficient to deliver a dose of 12 or 25 zzso total zzso zzso (1 zzso of body weight, during weeks zzso for 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were taken on weeks 3, 5 and zzso Following imaging sessions at weeks 3, 5 and 7 lungs were prepared for zzso zzso samples were taken at week 7 and lungs prepared for zzso zzso showed a gradual weekly increase in zzso zzso tissue zzso in animals treated with zzso compared with zzso The 25 zzso zzso group showed a continual significant increase in zzso between weeks 3 and 7, the 12 zzso zzso group showed a similar rate of increase, and zzso by week zzso A corresponding increase in zzso cell counts and zzso were zzso CT showed significant increases in lung tissue density from week 1 of zzso exposure and this was maintained throughout the 7 zzso zzso treatment reversed the increase in tissue zzso zzso and CT therefore provide zzso sensitive methods for zzso assessing lung zzso Lung tissue changes could be compared directly with the classical functional and inflammatory zzso allowing more accurate assessments to be made within each animal and providing a clinically zzso zzso
