What are the brain mechanisms that mediate conscious object zzso To investigate this question, it is essential to distinguish between brain processes that cause conscious recognition of a stimulus from other zzso of its sensory zzso Previous zzso studies have identified large-scale brain activity ranging from zzso to high-level sensory and prefrontal regions associated with conscious visual perception or zzso However, the possible role of changes in connectivity during conscious perception between these regions has only rarely been zzso Here, we used zzso and connectivity zzso together with 120 zzso zzso zzso images to directly assess whether conscious recognition of an object is accompanied by a zzso change in the functional zzso between zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso We compared recognizing an object versus not recognizing it in 19 zzso subjects using two different response zzso We find that connectivity between the zzso zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso increases when objects are consciously zzso This interaction was independent of the response zzso used to report conscious zzso Furthermore, computing the difference in zzso causality between recognized and not recognized conditions reveals stronger zzso connectivity than feedback connectivity when subjects recognized the zzso We suggest that frontal and visual brain regions are part of a functional network that supports conscious object recognition by changes in functional zzso
