In parallel to the detection of new zzso zzso the diagnosis of zzso zzso encephalitis has zzso Given that cerebral imaging studies show highly variable results, the present retrospective study investigates imaging findings in association with zzso zzso An institutional database search identified 18 patients with zzso zzso encephalitis who had undergone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sixteen of these patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso images were zzso as zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso finding but otherwise abnormal zzso zzso zzso were determined in serum and/or zzso zzso were grouped according to the cellular zzso of their target zzso zzso against surface zzso zzso zzso zzso 9; zzso against zzso zzso zzso Hu, zzso zzso 4; no zzso zzso The fraction of abnormal scans was lower for zzso zzso than for zzso zzso There was a significant association between PET findings and zzso zzso All patients with zzso against zzso zzso showed zzso findings on zzso In turn, only zzso patients with zzso against surface zzso displayed zzso zzso In the remaining seven patients, four scans were rated as normal and three only showed findings outside the zzso zzso A similar association was found using zzso although this did not reach statistical zzso zzso type was found to be associated with zzso and, to a lesser extent, with zzso imaging zzso Our observations may explain the zzso of imaging data in zzso and based on in zzso findings support the assumption of different zzso mechanisms underlying zzso due to zzso against surface and zzso zzso zzso
