The zzso ligament is difficult to image accurately, partly because it contains zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and muscle tissue in the normal zzso Our hypothesis was that magnetic resonance zzso imaging would be more accurate than zzso in identifying the size of the zzso ligament and the presence and size of zzso zzso within the zzso Eleven horses were used for zzso and MR imaging and zzso evaluation of the rear zzso zzso The origin and body of the normal zzso ligament had a zzso appearance on MR images with two separate islands of mixed signal intensity evident throughout its otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso there were isolated islands of muscle, zzso loose zzso tissue and dense zzso zzso organized in two separate zzso that extended through the full length of the zzso ligament origin and body to the level of its zzso zzso of MR images with corresponding zzso sections confirmed that islands of zzso signal intensity in normal zzso ligaments correlated well with these zzso Using zzso it was impossible to distinguish these islands from surrounding dense zzso tissue zzso MR imaging determined the zzso area of the zzso ligament more accurately than zzso Based upon these results, MR imaging is superior to zzso for assessment of the zzso zzso The appearance associated with normal ligament anatomy needs to be understood before MR signal variation can be considered as indicative of disease in the zzso zzso
