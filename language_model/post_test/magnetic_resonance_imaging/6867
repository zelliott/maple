The consequences of spinal zzso injury zzso have considerable effects on motor function, typically resulting in functional zzso zzso changes have been studied at the site of zzso zzso within the cord, and in the zzso Few studies, however, have investigated the consequences of zzso at the cortical zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to explore the zzso changes in the zzso and white matter within the primary motor zzso zzso of individuals with cervical zzso The zzso zzso a landmark of zzso zzso dedicated to hand function, was selected for regionally specific zzso of zzso Thirty-one zzso of zzso subjects and 28 zzso of control subjects were compared using a manual measurement after the images were segmented into zzso matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal fluid zzso No significant differences in zzso matter area measured at the zzso zzso were found with the manual zzso An automated zzso zzso analysis was also performed and demonstrated no significant differences in zzso or white matter volume within an zzso region of zzso These data suggest that there is no gross anatomical change within zzso following cervical zzso Our previously reported findings of reorganization of cortical motor output maps following zzso therefore likely result from changes in functional organization rather than anatomical zzso
