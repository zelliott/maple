The extent of the zzso zone by magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been related to zzso mortality in patients with coronary artery zzso This relationship may result from zzso in the zzso zzso However, the relationship between tissue zzso in the zzso periphery and zzso zzso has not been zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and relate it to an zzso marker of zzso zzso in patients with left zzso zzso zzso dysfunction undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Before zzso zzso zzso zzso for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, 47 patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso to measure zzso function, volumes, mass, and zzso zzso A method for zzso the zzso zzso periphery and the denser zzso core is zzso zzso zzso were related to zzso of sustained zzso zzso zzso during zzso or device zzso For the zzso versus zzso patients, zzso ejection fraction zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso size by standard zzso zzso definitions zzso were zzso zzso of tissue zzso at the zzso periphery was strongly associated with zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and was the single significant factor in a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is present and quantifiable within human zzso More extensive tissue zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso by programmed electrical zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso tissue zzso increases zzso to zzso zzso in patients with prior zzso zzso and zzso zzso
