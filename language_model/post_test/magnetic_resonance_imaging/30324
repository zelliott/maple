The results suggest that after a sudden change in the visual zzso zzso adaptation is impaired in patients with instability and central nervous system disorders zzso 

The aim of this study was the assessment of zzso adaptation, as a transient phenomenon, when sudden changes in visual perception occur in normal subjects and in patients with instability due to different zzso 

zzso zzso stimulation (40 s and suddenly zzso was performed in 16 patients with zzso and also in 22 normal zzso zzso were made of the body center of pressure area zzso and the body sway zzso zzso during 10 s before and after the stop and labeling the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso signed rank test, zzso and zzso zzso in normal subjects did not show any significant change before and after the zzso In 15 of the 16 assessed patients with instability associated with zzso an increase of the zzso and zzso values zzso signed test, zzso and zzso zzso was observed in the 10 s after the visual zzso zzso labeling showed zzso of the zzso spatial evolution approaching the limits of zzso
