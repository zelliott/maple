Hearing conservation surgery for small acoustic zzso is well zzso At present, two approaches are primarily zzso the zzso and the middle zzso The middle zzso approach to the internal auditory canal has the advantage of using zzso landmarks to identify and protect the facial zzso Because of zzso constraints presented by the superior semicircular canal however, its uses are limited to zzso tumors or tumors protruding only slightly into the zzso zzso By extending the approach through the superior semicircular canal, a wide access to the zzso angle can be safely zzso In this study three procedures, two through the superior semicircular canal and one through the zzso semicircular canal, were zzso for hearing conservation zzso By immediately zzso off the canal ends, hearing preservation was accomplished in two out of three of these zzso The zzso that labyrinthine opening invariably leads to zzso should be zzso By utilizing approaches through the semicircular canal, it is possible that morbidity from this surgery may be zzso
