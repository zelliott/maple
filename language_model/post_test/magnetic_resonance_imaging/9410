zzso of evoked zzso responses despite constant input or task is a feature of large-scale brain signals recorded by zzso zzso evidence zzso relevance of zzso signal zzso for perception and zzso Yet the underlying intrinsic zzso sources have not been previously zzso Here, we address this issue using simultaneous zzso and real-time zzso of ongoing zzso states triggering visual stimulation in human zzso We investigated whether spontaneous zzso zzso reflected in the zzso alpha zzso for zzso of evoked zzso zzso Based on previous work, we specifically hypothesized linear zzso of zzso activity related to fluctuations of ongoing alpha rhythm and a visually evoked zzso zzso We observed that spontaneous zzso power fluctuations largely explain evoked zzso response zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso For zzso areas, we confirmed the linear zzso zzso We hence linked evoked zzso response zzso to an intrinsic zzso power zzso These findings contribute to our conceptual understanding of how brain rhythms can account for zzso zzso in stimulus zzso
