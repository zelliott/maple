zzso sets and rough sets have been widely used in many zzso zzso for medical image zzso and have recently been combined together to better deal with the uncertainty implied in observed image zzso Despite of their wide spread applications, traditional hybrid approaches are sensitive to the empirical weighting parameters and random zzso and hence may produce less accurate zzso In this paper, a novel hybrid zzso approach, namely the generalized rough fuzzy zzso zzso zzso is proposed for brain MR image zzso In this algorithm, each cluster is characterized by three automatically determined zzso regions, and accordingly the membership of each zzso is estimated with respect to the region it zzso The importance of each region is balanced by a weighting zzso and the bias field in MR images is modeled by a linear combination of zzso zzso The weighting zzso zzso and bias field correction have been incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso has been compared to the existing rough zzso and hybrid zzso zzso in both synthetic and clinical brain MR zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed zzso is more robust to the zzso noise, and bias field, and can produce more accurate and reliable zzso
