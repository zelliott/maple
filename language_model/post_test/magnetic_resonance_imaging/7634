Some theories of motor control suggest zzso of motor commands reach zzso zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test these zzso We varied the amount of zzso signal by making participants squeeze a soft material either actively or zzso We found zzso recordings, an zzso proxy, to predict activity in primary zzso regions, in particular zzso Area zzso zzso zzso correlation analyses confirmed that brain activity in cortical structures associated with motor control zzso and supplementary motor zzso the zzso area zzso and the zzso predicts brain activity in zzso without being entirely zzso by activity in early zzso zzso zzso Our study therefore provides valuable empirical evidence for zzso models of motor control, and shows that signals in zzso can indeed reflect an input from motor zzso and suggests that we should interpret zzso in zzso as evidence for zzso rather than zzso coding zzso
