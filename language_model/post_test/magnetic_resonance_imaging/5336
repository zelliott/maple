To create a large animal coronary chronic total zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The patterns and time profiles of zzso changes and zzso formation during coronary zzso maturation are zzso 

zzso were created in 15 zzso by zzso deployment of a collagen zzso zzso changes were assessed by zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and several imaging zzso including conventional and zzso spin zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at six and 12 weeks following zzso zzso zzso changes included an intense inflammatory reaction at six weeks which had partially abated by 12 zzso A zzso zzso at six weeks was partially replaced with collagen by 12 zzso Similar changes were noted in the zzso cap which was zzso Three patterns of zzso formation were identified and defined based on the presence and extent of a zzso zzso No major differences in pattern or extent of zzso were noted between six and 12 zzso 

zzso in zzso patterns occurs during coronary zzso development in a zzso zzso zzso imaging to determine the zzso type of zzso prior to and during zzso zzso may improve zzso crossing success zzso This model may be useful for further exploration of zzso zzso and may aid in further refinements of in zzso imaging of zzso and development of novel therapeutic approaches to zzso of zzso such as zzso of the zzso cap, zzso zzso zzso zzso and device zzso
