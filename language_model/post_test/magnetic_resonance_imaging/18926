Although conventional zzso of cerebral zzso zzso zzso supports zzso zzso it is still difficult to zzso the detailed anatomical zzso of the zzso the point of zzso the feeding arteries or draining zzso and the three-dimensional zzso of zzso in the zzso or zzso In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of enhanced three-dimensional surface MR zzso zzso zzso and zzso reversed imaging zzso zzso in diagnosis and surgical planning for cerebral zzso Surface zzso clearly demonstrated zzso adjacent to eloquent area and three-dimensional figures of feeding arteries and draining zzso zzso imaging was useful to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso and to estimate the depth of the zzso in the zzso Although it has generally been assumed that zzso is present in the zzso zzso imaging clearly demonstrates that most of the zzso is in the zzso and is possible to be dissected and removed without damaging zzso Indeed, these imaging methods supply clinically relevant data that is difficult to obtain with conventional zzso and provide better details of zzso zzso surgical planning and zzso
