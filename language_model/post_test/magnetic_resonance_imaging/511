Bone geometry is an important zzso of bone strength and is influenced by muscle pull and zzso Muscle mass and exposure to zzso decrease with age and thus the purpose of the study was to compare bone geometry of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso bones of the leg in different age zzso zzso resonance images of the right leg were acquired in 13 young zzso zzso 13 old zzso zzso and 13 very old men zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso areas zzso of the bones were measured at approximately one-third and two-thirds the length of the zzso Muscle zzso of the zzso lateral and zzso compartments was measured at the zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately 14 to zzso smaller in the elderly in the zzso but similar across age in the zzso zzso zzso was larger with age zzso 5 to zzso in both bones but approximately 15 to zzso greater in the zzso than zzso Total zzso was similar across age in both zzso Muscle mass was similar between young and old but approximately zzso less in the very old and as a consequence, the magnitude of differences in bone geometry at zzso and zzso sites varied in the two elderly zzso These findings indicate that there is a complex zzso interaction between muscle pull and zzso The greater age-related differences in bone geometry in the zzso suggest the zzso role of the zzso makes it more susceptible than the fibula to the reduced activity typically associated with zzso
