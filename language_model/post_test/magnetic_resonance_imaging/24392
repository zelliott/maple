The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and identify imaging differences between type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso once zzso zzso zzso tumors have been zzso 

zzso zzso zzso tumors were classified at pathology as type 1, type 2, or zzso The CT and zzso examinations of these tumors were zzso Imaging features such as tumor size, margins, zzso and enhancement were assessed and the findings in type 1 and type 2 tumors were zzso 

There were 43 type 1 and 13 type 2 zzso zzso zzso features zzso tumors containing both type 1 and type 2 zzso clear cells, or components with atypically high nuclear grade zzso type 1 zzso or low nuclear grade zzso type 2 zzso were seen in 26 zzso On CT, type 2 tumors more commonly had zzso margins zzso zzso zzso and were more likely to have zzso zzso zzso zzso than type 1 tumors, although these features were seen in all tumor zzso Type 2 tumors were also more zzso than type 1 tumors zzso zzso zzso On CT, 11 zzso zzso showed enhancement of less than 20 zzso seven of which showed enhancement of less than 10 zzso On zzso all tumors showed enhancement on zzso zzso 

Nearly one third of zzso zzso in our patient population had zzso features at zzso On CT and zzso there are some significant differences in imaging features between type 1 and type 2 zzso however, substantial overlap zzso categorization on a zzso zzso On CT, many zzso zzso do not zzso indicating that assessment of enhancement alone is insufficient for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso
