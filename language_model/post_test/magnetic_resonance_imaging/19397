The objective of this study was to compare enhancement patterns of a zzso contrast agent, zzso with those of zzso zzso in bacterial zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

Fourteen rabbits with zzso induced bacterial zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso underwent dynamic zzso MR imaging with zzso and zzso zzso at a 24-hr zzso The enhancement ratios zzso to zzso signal zzso of zzso in the same animal were assessed and correlated with zzso zzso 

For zzso the enhancement ratio of the zzso zzso zzso zzso peaked 15 zzso after the injection, while that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso peaked at 10 zzso The enhancement ratios of the zzso were consistently higher than those of the zzso up to 30 zzso For zzso zzso peak enhancement ratio of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen 5 zzso after the injection, while that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen at 3 zzso The enhancement ratios of the zzso were significantly higher at 1 zzso but significantly lower at zzso zzso compared with those of the zzso as a result of rapid decrease of enhancement ratios in the zzso The zzso density was zzso zzso zzso vessels per field of view for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso vessels per field of view for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Delayed peak enhancement and slow zzso were found in both bacterial zzso and zzso zzso with zzso whereas early peak enhancement and rapid zzso were found especially in zzso zzso with zzso zzso Enhancement ratios on MR imaging with a zzso contrast agent correlated well with the zzso density in bacterial zzso and zzso zzso
