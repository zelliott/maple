Recently, a new technique has been demonstrated which effectively zzso the zzso effects of spins moving during application of MR imaging zzso This paper presents an analysis of imaging axes significance in spin zzso for motion occurring along the slice zzso read and zzso zzso A flow phantom under constant flow conditions in all experiments was used to provide complete spin zzso when zzso imaging zzso were zzso The zzso technique was used to zzso along various combinations of imaging zzso and variable number of terms from the Taylor expansion of motion along zzso zzso indicate that motion along any imaging axis can be zzso effectively when zzso zzso are used along only the slice select and read zzso
