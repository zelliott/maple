zzso disease zzso is an inherited disorder characterized by cognitive zzso motor deficits, and progressive zzso These symptoms result from progressive neurodegenerative changes mainly affecting the zzso This pathology is fatal in 10 to 20 years and there is currently no treatment for zzso Early in the course of the disease, initial clinical manifestations are due to zzso zzso dysfunction, which is later followed by massive zzso zzso A major therapeutic objective is therefore to reverse zzso dysfunction prior to cell zzso Using a zzso model zzso the clinical features and the progressive zzso zzso typical of zzso we tested the therapeutic effects of direct zzso infusion of zzso zzso factor zzso To achieve a continuous delivery of zzso over the full period of zzso we took advantage of the zzso zzso Baby zzso kidney zzso cells previously engineered to produce human zzso were zzso into zzso zzso and implanted zzso into zzso We show here that zzso delivery of low doses of zzso at the onset of symptoms not only protects zzso from zzso but also restores zzso zzso zzso primates recovered, in particular, cognitive and motor functions dependent on the zzso integrity of zzso pathways that were zzso altered in this HD zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso infusion into the zzso of HD patients not only could block the zzso of zzso but also alleviated motor and cognitive symptoms associated with persistent zzso zzso
