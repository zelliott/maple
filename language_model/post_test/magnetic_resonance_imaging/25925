To evaluate the ability of zzso zzso to differentiate between slow flow and mural zzso in zzso diseases, we reviewed the zzso zzso of 10 patients with zzso zzso that had been documented by CT in 8 patients and zzso in 2 zzso Six patients had zzso zzso with mural zzso and four had zzso zzso with adherent mural zzso within the false zzso Five of seven gated zzso zzso or zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso slow flow signal within the residual zzso This zzso slow flow signal was accompanied by a parallel zzso rim due to a boundary layer zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso MR studies demonstrated a zzso zone due to fresh zzso at the edge of a mural zzso on zzso images zzso The zzso boundary layer between slow flow and mural zzso on either gated zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso not only predicted the presence of flow within the residual zzso but also clearly separated the area of slow flow from that of mural zzso in 9 of 10 zzso Proper interpretation of zzso images may zzso the need for phase display imaging or zzso imaging in zzso between slow flow and mural zzso
