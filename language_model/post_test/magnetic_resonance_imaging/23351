The aim of this study was to compare tumor changes in patients with zzso zzso receiving zzso using evaluation criteria of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases zzso and the European Association for the Study of the Liver zzso as opposed to the Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso version zzso 

Twenty-five patients with zzso zzso zzso receiving oral zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and follow-up every 8 weeks zzso zzso zzso mean, zzso zzso Data were evaluated zzso zzso time until progression ranged from 5 to 102 weeks zzso zzso weeks), with a total of 54 target zzso being zzso Additionally, evaluation of serum zzso was performed at zzso 

The best response at follow-up using zzso resulted in rates of zzso objective response zzso zzso or partial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso criteria identified objective responses in zzso and zzso Twenty percent of all patients classified as having progressive disease by zzso were identified as having zzso due to extensive zzso Eleven percent of patients classified as having stable disease by zzso were disclosed as essentially zzso zzso area and zzso diameter disclosed zzso and zzso of patients as having partial zzso respectively, whereas zzso criteria discovered only zzso There was no significant correlation between serum zzso progression and zzso zzso or zzso evaluation zzso 

Response monitoring via functional criteria such as zzso or zzso criteria is likely to more accurately reflect vital tumor burden in zzso zzso compared to zzso
