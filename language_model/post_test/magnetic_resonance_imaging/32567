This study was conducted to examine the volume of the zzso in zzso and to investigate the effect of brain size on this structure in an attempt to zzso in a larger sample, findings from a previous study reporting the existence of a relationship between brain volume and zzso in healthy controls but not in individuals with zzso Additionally, the relationships between zzso volumes and clinical features were zzso zzso zzso of the right and left zzso zzso were performed on zzso scans obtained from 40 zzso individuals with zzso (age zzso zzso zzso and 41 healthy controls (age zzso zzso zzso No differences were observed between the two groups for zzso zzso zzso However, the expected linear relationship between zzso and zzso volume was not observed in individuals with zzso Furthermore, no correlations were observed between zzso volumes and clinical zzso zzso from this larger study are consistent with the previous report of an abnormal brain size effect on the zzso in zzso and support the possibility of abnormal connections between cortical and zzso structures in this zzso
