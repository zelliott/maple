To determine if the position of the superficial cerebral cortical veins can be used to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso on MR brain zzso 

zzso review of MR scans obtained in cases of zzso fluid collections, separating these into two groups, zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

All cases of zzso in this study showed cortical veins and their branches zzso widened zzso fluid spaces over the cerebral zzso None of the zzso zzso patients showed this zzso zzso veins in zzso patients were seen only at the margin of the displaced cortex, and did not traverse the fluid collections over the cerebral zzso 

The authors call the zzso of cortical veins and their branches within fluid collections at the cerebral zzso zzso cortical vein zzso They believe this sign to be zzso zzso evidence of zzso its presence rules out the diagnosis of zzso zzso in the region of zzso
