Previous studies have indicated that the zzso signal can be modified by tumor processes in close vicinity to functional brain zzso This effect has been investigated primarily for the zzso area but there is only a limited number of studies concerning frontal cortical zzso zzso the aim of the current study was to characterize zzso signal and zzso patterns in patients with frontal brain tumors while performing a verbal zzso zzso Six patients zzso zzso zzso suffering from frontal (5 left sided and 1 right zzso zzso tumors were examined with zzso while performing a verbal zzso task in a blocked paradigm zzso Eight healthy volunteers served as the control zzso The patients (5 right and 1 left zzso demonstrated left frontal zzso which could be clearly located outside the tumor area and adjacent zzso with varying degrees of additional right frontal zzso In the zzso left frontal zzso zzso the mean zzso based zzso and cluster size were not statistically different between patients and zzso The present zzso study is indicating that language related zzso signal changes in the frontal zzso of patients with tumors close to functional areas were comparable to the signal in normal zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso response characteristic was comparable in both zzso This is an important finding consistent with PET results and corroborates the feasibility of functional mapping approaches in patients with tumors affecting the frontal zzso Additional studies investigating zzso of the zzso response depending on tumor location and zzso are required in order to further zzso the association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
