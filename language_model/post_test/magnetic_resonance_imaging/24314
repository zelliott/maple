The aim of this study was to assess the enhancement patterns of zzso focal zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective study had institutional review board zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR images were evaluated in 23 patients with 30 zzso zzso zzso proven and 4 zzso zzso The zzso enhancement patterns of the zzso phase images were classified as zzso or homogeneous signal intensity zzso and as zzso zzso or low zzso compared with those of adjacent liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and homogeneous low zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso group, whereas homogeneous zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso on zzso weighted images, zzso images and apparent diffusion zzso zzso values were compared between the two zzso 

The zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso low zzso zzso homogeneous zzso zzso zzso or homogeneous low zzso zzso at the zzso phase MR zzso The zzso group zzso were more likely to show high zzso on zzso images and zzso weighted images compared with those in the zzso group zzso zzso values tended to be lower in the zzso group than those in the zzso group without zzso 

zzso showed variable enhancement patterns on zzso phase images during zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso weighted images differed according to the zzso component contained in the zzso 

zzso shows a wide spectrum of imaging findings on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
