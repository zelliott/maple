The association between diet and fatty liver disease zzso has predominantly been analyzed for single nutrients or foods, and findings have been zzso 

We aimed to compare associations of zzso and exploratory dietary pattern scores with liver fat zzso 

Liver fat was measured by using magnetic resonance imaging as liver signal intensity zzso in a zzso zzso study that included 354 zzso We applied partial zzso zzso to derive an exploratory dietary pattern score that explained variation in both the intake of 38 food groups, which were assessed by using a zzso zzso and zzso The zzso score was calculated on the basis of published zzso zzso linear or zzso zzso was used to investigate associations between dietary pattern scores and zzso or zzso 

A higher percentage of zzso variation was explained by the exploratory zzso compared with the zzso zzso dietary zzso Of the 13 most important food groups of the exploratory dietary pattern, zzso of green and black tea, soups, and beer were also individually associated with zzso zzso A zzso increase in the exploratory dietary pattern score was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso increase in the zzso dietary pattern score, which consisted of alcohol, soft drinks, meat, coffee, and tea, was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We defined a zzso dietary pattern and derived an exploratory dietary pattern, both of which included alcohol, meat zzso and tea, associated with liver fat content independent from zzso which should be explored in prospective zzso
