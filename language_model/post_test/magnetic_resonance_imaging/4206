The authors determine the feasibility of dynamic magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the diagnosis of groin zzso 

Ten volunteers and 10 patients with clinically evident and surgically proven zzso were evaluated using zzso and zzso sequences and two dynamic zzso The visibility of zzso structures that are crucial for the assessment and the differentiation of zzso zzso was zzso 

The zzso rings could be identified in all zzso The inferior zzso vessels could be identified in zzso In 10 patients, 11 zzso were found at MR imaging, whereas at surgery and physical examination 13 zzso were diagnosed zzso The two zzso that were missed initially could be identified zzso on MR zzso One volunteer showed a small bilateral zzso zzso on MR imaging that could be confirmed on physical zzso 

The zzso structures that are crucial for the assessment and the differentiation of zzso zzso can be identified zzso with MR zzso
