This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of zzso in zzso zzso region in zzso meningitis zzso and zzso strokes and its sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of these zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso strokes in zzso zzso region were zzso evaluated from our zzso meningitis and zzso stroke zzso zzso resonance imaging findings were grouped into anterior zzso zzso anterior limb of internal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso limb of internal zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of these patterns in diagnosing zzso and zzso stroke were zzso 

There were 24 patients in each zzso zzso in zzso was purely anterior in eight patients and in zzso stroke purely zzso in 18 zzso The frequency of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso stroke zzso vs zzso In zzso patients, purely zzso zzso were present in seven zzso three had associated risk factors of zzso zzso The sensitivity of pure anterior zzso in the diagnosis of zzso was zzso specificity zzso For zzso stroke, the sensitivity of zzso zzso was zzso and specificity zzso 

zzso patients having zzso in zzso region should be looked for associated risk factors of zzso zzso
