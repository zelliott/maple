zzso voids in the zzso zzso cannot always be recognized on magnetic resonance imaging, even in patients with typical zzso zzso In this report, flow voids in the zzso zzso and zzso flow voids of the zzso valley were evaluated in patients with zzso disease, and their diagnostic value was zzso A total of 41 consecutive patients with zzso disease were included in this zzso The number of flow voids in the zzso zzso and the zzso valley were counted on each side by 3 zzso Then the numbers of flow voids were compared between the patients with zzso disease and zzso The patients with zzso disease had a significantly higher mean number of flow voids in the zzso zzso and the zzso valley zzso zzso zzso however, the number of flow voids in the zzso zzso was 0 or 1 in 69 sides zzso in patients with zzso zzso Comparative analysis using the area under the receiver operating curve indicated that the evaluation of flow voids in the zzso valley was significantly superior method to that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value for the number of zzso flow voids in the zzso valley for the diagnosis of zzso disease was zzso Based on these findings, we recommend a definitive diagnosis of zzso disease should include assessment for abnormal vessels around the terminal portions of the internal carotid zzso
