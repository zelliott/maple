Patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso typically experience a progressive disease course from zzso leading to the zzso of severe neurological zzso This is in contrast with the observation that the burden and activity of zzso on conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of the brain are much lower in patients with zzso than in those with other less disabling forms of the zzso Studies with structural and functional zzso techniques are providing relevant contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the zzso of irreversible neurological deficits in patients with zzso The results of these studies zzso that the main factors possibly explaining the zzso zzso observed in patients with zzso include the presence of a diffuse tissue damage that is beyond the resolution of conventional imaging, the extent of cervical zzso damage, and the impairment of the zzso capacity of the zzso to limit the functional consequences of zzso zzso
