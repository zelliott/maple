zzso zzso with zzso components zzso or strictly zzso zzso are zzso Their zzso raises the problems of nerve root preservation, zzso artery zzso control, and spinal zzso 

A series of 57 patients with zzso (29 zzso 23 zzso 4 zzso and 1 zzso zzso was treated during the period of 1980 to 1995, using one of the lateral approaches zzso or zzso zzso The VA was always controlled before zzso of the zzso In cases of zzso forms, the zzso component was removed by a complementary zzso (three zzso in the early period and then by an zzso zzso through the same lateral approach (five zzso in the late zzso A zzso had been performed in 15 other patients (11 patients with zzso zzso before they were referred to zzso These patients included seven with zzso zzso occurring after an average period of zzso years zzso zzso 

Complete zzso was achieved in all except two patients, in whom the nerve root reacted positively to zzso stimulation and could not be separated from the zzso One of the patients was subsequently operated on after 2 zzso Another recurrence was observed in another patient at 1 zzso The four patients with zzso died from recurrence within 2 zzso The rate of root preservation included an average of zzso including zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for lower cervical zzso zzso and zzso for upper cervical zzso zzso zzso of zzso neurological deficits was observed in only two zzso The VA was always zzso except in one patient with a zzso that was preoperatively zzso No instability was observed in any of the zzso 

Complete zzso with good neurological results can be achieved in most patients harboring cervical zzso each with an zzso component by using a lateral approach and VA zzso If the root cannot be separated from the zzso especially in patients with zzso zzso stimulation can help decide whether the root may be divided without incurring zzso zzso The lateral approach permits the zzso of the zzso as well as the zzso component by a complementary zzso zzso There was no morbidity in relation to VA control as well as no zzso zzso
