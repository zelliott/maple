Motor and linguistic aspects of writing were evaluated in 31 subjects with focal damage in 1 of 3 regions of the left zzso zzso zzso frontal lobe sparing primary motor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso or zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso A standard procedure was used to evaluate writing for zzso formation, spatial arrangement, zzso word selection, zzso and zzso It was predicted that zzso would be observed in all 3 groups, and that the most severe zzso would be associated with frontal lobe damage, particularly in aspects of writing dependent on sequencing zzso formation, zzso and zzso It was found that zzso was common in all groups, particularly in the acute zzso and that all groups showed considerable recovery of writing by the chronic zzso Few differences were found between zzso However, the FL group was impaired on spelling and grammar relative to the zzso group in the acute zzso and impaired on grammar relative to the zzso group in the chronic zzso The findings are consistent with the notion that writing relies on a distributed zzso network, which acts in concert to link fragments of zzso activity with component linguistic zzso
