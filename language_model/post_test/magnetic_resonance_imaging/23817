zzso correlations of the human lip with corresponding magnetic resonance zzso images obtained ex zzso are zzso MR images were acquired with a dedicated zzso zzso zzso MR system, with a resolution of 100 zzso 100 zzso and a slice thickness of 1 zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso visible on images are of high signal intensity, while the zzso zzso zzso are of low signal intensity, both for skin and oral zzso It is possible to use a zzso system to obtain high resolution images of small biological zzso
