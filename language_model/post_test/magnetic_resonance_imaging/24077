To analyze the path of zzso muscles zzso zzso in highly zzso subjects with and without restricted eye zzso versus zzso To zzso the cause of the acquired zzso disorder in patients with high zzso 

zzso orbits were zzso using a zzso or zzso Vision zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained with repetition time of 550 zzso and echo time of 15 zzso zzso had to fixate in different positions of zzso zzso of three patient groups were zzso group 1 zzso zzso zzso patients with high zzso zzso and restricted eye zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso error more than zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso zzso subjects with high zzso zzso and normal eye zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control group zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects with normal eye zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients showed significant zzso of zzso zzso in comparison with control zzso Mean zzso measured in the plane 3 zzso anterior to the zzso nerve junction in primary zzso were in group 1, lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso downward and in group 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso zzso zzso In groups 1 and 2 the inferior zzso zzso was displaced zzso zzso zzso and zzso In both groups of zzso patients the superior zzso zzso was displaced zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In patients with high zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso can be detected by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were very similar in groups 1 and 2 versus zzso zzso displacement into the lateral and inferior zzso of the orbit was greatest in patients with restricted eye zzso Thus, zzso displacement is probably the major zzso factor for the restrictive zzso disorder in high zzso zzso zzso can be explained by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positions in relation to the zzso zzso
