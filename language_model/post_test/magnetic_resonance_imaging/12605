The zzso zzso lobe zzso consists of several regions thought to be involved in learning and zzso However, the degree of functional specialization among these regions remains zzso Previous studies have demonstrated effects of both content and processing stage, but findings have been zzso In particular, studies have suggested that the zzso zzso is more involved in object processing than spatial processing, while other regions such as the zzso zzso have been implicated in spatial zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for the zzso region was used to probe zzso zzso during intentional zzso of object identities or zzso A region of interest analysis showed that object zzso evoked stronger zzso than position zzso in bilateral zzso cortex, zzso cortex, zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso also indicate an unexpected significant correlation in zzso level between anterior and zzso portions in both the left zzso zzso and left zzso zzso analysis did not show any regional content effects during preparation and rehearsal zzso These results provide additional evidence for functional specialization within the zzso but were less clear regarding the specific nature of content specificity in these zzso
