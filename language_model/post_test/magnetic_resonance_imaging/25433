For the human brain, zzso to irrelevant sensory input is an important function whose failure is associated with behavioral zzso zzso gating can be studied by recording the zzso electrical responses to repeated zzso the zzso potential is normally reduced to the second of two paired zzso but not in schizophrenia zzso To identify its neural zzso we recorded electrical traces of sensory gating directly from the human zzso and zzso 

zzso evoked zzso were recorded using zzso depth zzso and zzso strip and grid zzso in 32 zzso patients undergoing invasive zzso zzso 

We found evidence of sensory gating only in the zzso the zzso region zzso areas 22 and zzso and the prefrontal zzso zzso areas 6 and zzso however, whereas zzso zzso responses to paired zzso were zzso around 50 zzso responses within the zzso proper had a zzso of about 250 zzso 

zzso with data from animal studies, our findings show that the zzso proper contributes to sensory zzso albeit during a time window following zzso zzso zzso Thus, sensory gating may be a zzso process, with an early phase zzso by the zzso and prefrontal zzso and a later phase zzso by the zzso
