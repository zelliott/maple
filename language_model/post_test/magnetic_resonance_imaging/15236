The present study serves to detail the specific procedures for a mock scanner zzso report on its use in the context of a zzso study, and make suggestions for improving such protocols based on data acquired during study zzso Specifically, a mock scanner compliance training protocol was used in a functional imaging study with a group of adolescents and adults with Attention Deficit zzso Disorder zzso and a matched sample of healthy children and zzso Head motion was measured during mock and actual zzso Participants across groups exhibited excess motion zzso zzso on zzso of runs during the mock zzso During actual zzso excessive motion was limited to zzso of zzso There was a clear zzso head motion during a zzso task that occurred even after the compliance training: participants had a tendency to respond with increased head motion immediately after committing an zzso This study illustrates the need to zzso report data attrition due to head motion, zzso assess zzso motion, and zzso consider mock scanner training in functional imaging zzso
