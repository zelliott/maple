In experiments involving transgenic animals or animals treated with transgenic cells, it is important to have a method to monitor the expression of the relevant genes zzso and zzso An zzso reporter gene enables monitoring of gene expression in the deep zzso of living zzso This information can be zzso with detailed high-resolution anatomical and functional zzso We describe here the synthesis of the reporter probe, zzso zzso which can be used for imaging of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso reporter gene expression in zzso by zzso The protocol also includes data acquisition and data processing routines customized for chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso contrast zzso The zzso zzso is zzso through a zzso zzso of the zzso bond of zzso to yield zzso which is zzso on the zzso position of the resulting saturated zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso can be completed within 5 zzso and the compound is stable for more than 1 zzso
