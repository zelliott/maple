Patients with zzso can be classified as clinical zzso zzso possible, or unlikely Parkinson's disease zzso zzso zzso includes patients with zzso according to conventional diagnostic criteria and with at least a moderate response to zzso zzso However, these patients have clinical features that may reduce the probability for idiopathic zzso The objective of this study was to clinically characterize patients with possible disease in a prevalence study of zzso and to indicate the frequency of idiopathic zzso in this group of zzso The diagnostic zzso was based on detailed zzso examinations and investigations of zzso drug response after several years of zzso In a community-based prevalence study in Norway, zzso 245 zzso patients, we found 36 patients zzso with clinical possible zzso The patients with possible disease had significant and clinically important differences in demographic and disease characteristics compared to patients with zzso and probable zzso zzso zzso patients were older at disease zzso more disabled, and had more zzso zzso zzso examinations of 14 of the 36 patients with possible zzso in the prevalence study revealed significant group effects compared to an zzso control group, with reduced zzso zzso zzso and increased cortical zzso In individual patients, signal zzso consistent with vascular zzso of the zzso zzso contributed to diagnostic zzso zzso drug withdrawal revealed no response in 4 of 12 examined zzso Two of the remaining eight patients had a clear zzso drug zzso Six patients had only a varying degree of zzso zzso The zzso of diagnosis indicates that probably less than half of the patients with clinical possible zzso have idiopathic zzso Patients with zzso features and diagnosed as possible zzso should thus be excluded from studies with a presumed high specificity for idiopathic zzso
