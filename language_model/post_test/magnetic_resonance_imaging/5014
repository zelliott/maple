While a zzso in or abutting primary motor zzso leads to motor zzso how zzso elsewhere in the frontal or zzso zzso affect functional connectivity in a weak patient is less zzso We hypothesized that diminished functional connectivity in a distributed network of motor zzso would correlate with motor weakness in subjects with brain zzso Furthermore, we hypothesized that zzso connections would be most vulnerable to subtle disruptions in functional zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity to probe motor networks in control subjects and patients with brain zzso zzso Using a control zzso we developed a method for automated detection of key zzso in the motor network, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, zzso area and superior zzso zzso based on the zzso location of the zzso zzso in the primary motor zzso We then calculated functional connectivity between motor network zzso in control subjects, as well as patients with and without brain zzso We used this information to construct zzso zzso zzso which were then compared to variables of interest, including performance on a motor task, the zzso zzso Strong connectivity was observed within the identified motor networks between all zzso zzso and especially between the primary motor zzso and supplementary motor zzso zzso connectivity was observed in subjects with motor weakness versus subjects with normal strength zzso This difference was driven mostly by decreases in zzso connectivity between the primary motor zzso zzso and between the left primary motor zzso and the right zzso area zzso as well as other zzso area zzso In the subjects without motor zzso however, performance on the zzso zzso did not relate to zzso zzso but rather was zzso correlated with connectivity between the left zzso area and left supplementary motor area, for both the left and the right hands zzso Finally, two subjects who experienced severe weakness following surgery for their brain zzso were followed zzso and the subject who recovered showed zzso of her motor network at zzso The subject who was persistently weak did not zzso his motor zzso Motor weakness in subjects with brain zzso that do not involve primary motor structures is associated with decreased connectivity within motor functional networks, particularly zzso zzso Motor networks become weaker as the subjects become weaker, and may become strong again during motor zzso
