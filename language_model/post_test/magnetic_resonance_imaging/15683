zzso zzso mice show direct parallels with many zzso of Down syndrome zzso including effects on the structure of zzso and zzso A small segment of zzso known as the zzso critical zzso zzso has been held to contain a gene or genes sufficient to cause impairment in learning and memory tasks involving the zzso To test this hypothesis, we developed zzso and zzso mouse models that are, respectively, zzso and zzso for this zzso Here, we show that zzso for the zzso alone is not sufficient to produce the structural and functional features of zzso impairment that are seen in the zzso mouse and zzso However, when the critical region is returned to normal dosage in zzso zzso mice, performance in the Morris water maze is identical to zzso demonstrating that this region is necessary for the zzso Thus, although the prediction of the critical region hypothesis was zzso novel gene dosage effects were identified, which help to define how zzso for this segment of the zzso contributes to zzso of zzso
