To determine the blood oxygen zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso in the zzso and cerebral zzso in patients with partial zzso 

Among 64 tested patients, 40 had zzso spikes during scanning and were divided in two groups: unilateral or bilateral independent spikes (29 zzso and zzso zzso spikes (11 zzso Each spike topography was analyzed zzso yielding 40 studies in the first group and 17 in the zzso 

zzso percent of focal spike studies showed significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represented the dominant response and had a better correlation with spike location than cortical zzso zzso zzso In the second group, all patients had significant zzso zzso they were more widespread compared to the first group, and zzso areas were as important as activated zzso A zzso response was seen in zzso of studies in the first group and zzso in the zzso 

The zzso is involved in partial zzso during zzso zzso This involvement and also cortical zzso are more commonly seen with bilateral spikes than focal zzso 

These findings show evidence for a role for the zzso and a more important role for zzso in secondary bilateral zzso
