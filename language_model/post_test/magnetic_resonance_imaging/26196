The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic potential of a new dark fluid zzso high intensity reduction zzso in the diagnostic zzso of patients with cerebral zzso The zzso sequence zzso a very long zzso value of the zzso fluid zzso to suppress its high signal contribution in zzso imaging by a image zzso zzso Fifteen patients with zzso confirmed cerebral zzso were examined with zzso fast zzso zzso zzso SE, fast zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso imaging using identical scan zzso In patients with enhancing zzso fast zzso and zzso were added to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Images were analyzed in a qualitative and quantitative zzso In the qualitative analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and differentiation between enhancing and zzso tumor tissue were assessed in a zzso zzso For the quantitative analysis, zzso and zzso contrast and zzso ratios were determined in a region of interest zzso zzso achieved a significant reduction of the zzso signal without losing the high zzso matter contrast of zzso zzso In the quantitative analysis, the contrast ratios of the zzso images were lower compared with the zzso images due to a relatively high background and zzso zzso After administration of contrast media, zzso images presented a significant signal increase in enhancing zzso which subsequently increased the contrast and zzso zzso In the qualitative analysis, both readers found all tumors clearly delineated on zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso the tumor zzso with zzso was better in nine patients, equal in four patients, and less in one zzso Compared with the zzso images, zzso was rated superior in three patients, equal in nine patients, and inferior in another three zzso zzso of the enhancing tumor parts was possible with zzso in all zzso zzso images had significantly fewer image artifacts than zzso images due to reduced inflow zzso The zzso zzso sequence presented is an alternative to the zzso zzso zzso with the advantage of better zzso matter contrast and shorter measurement zzso Due to the zzso technique, signal zzso from zzso with relaxation times in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also gradually affected, corresponding to their zzso zzso With respect to this unwanted effect, an improvement in zzso imaging will be possible by using a zzso zzso zzso In a forthcoming study this concept will first be tested on appropriate phantom zzso
