zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso has been studied in detail in the zzso zzso It has been zzso that zzso acts as a localized gating of cortical zzso Here, the induced zzso response in the zzso is measured by zzso and the zzso response is measured by zzso We assess the zzso of the responses to stimuli of varying duration in the primary motor zzso and to a zzso drifting grating of varying contrast zzso and drift frequency in the visual zzso In this way, we explore the nature of zzso and their relationship with zzso zzso Excellent spatial zzso of zzso and zzso in both central and lateral zzso visual areas and zzso areas suggests that the two are intimately zzso In contrast to the zzso response, the level of zzso is not modulated by stimulus contrast or by stimulus zzso consistent with a gating zzso The zzso of zzso in the central visual area is however modulated by drift frequency, and this seems to parallel the zzso in zzso zzso at the same zzso
