To explore the neural zzso of zzso zzso integration during motion direction discrimination, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging with 15 zzso We initially performed independent zzso visual and tactile experiments involving motion direction matching zzso Visual motion discrimination activated the zzso zzso zzso extending to the zzso portion of the superior zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso motion direction discrimination activated the bilateral zzso zzso The left superior zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and right zzso were activated during both visual and tactile motion zzso zzso discrimination zzso the visual zzso including the middle zzso zzso To identify the zzso interference of the neural activities in both the zzso and the zzso areas, tactile and visual zzso experiments with zzso designs were also performed by the same subjects who performed zzso zzso tasks or zzso zzso and zzso matching tasks within the same zzso The activities detected during zzso tasks in the visual regions (including the middle zzso zzso and the tactile regions were suppressed during zzso conditions compared with zzso zzso Within the zzso areas, the left superior zzso zzso and the zzso areas were activated by zzso zzso The left superior zzso zzso was more prominently activated under zzso event conditions than under zzso zzso These findings suggest that a zzso and competitive association between the zzso and zzso areas zzso the interaction between motion zzso signals received simultaneously from different sensory zzso
