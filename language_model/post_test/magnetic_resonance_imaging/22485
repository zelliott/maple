zzso zzso zzso complexes display high zzso due to their two inner sphere water zzso This zzso can be further increased by zzso the zzso zzso with an zzso A significant hydrogen bonding interaction between the zzso and another water zzso close to the zzso apparently zzso its coordination on the open site of the zzso The resulting zzso complex has three inner sphere water zzso while maintaining high stability and fast zzso exchange zzso
