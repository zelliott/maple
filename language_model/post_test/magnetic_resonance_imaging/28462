The potential advantages of zzso procedures over traditional zzso are zzso but the use of laser energy to zzso disc tissue appears entirely zzso To date, no experimental study exists investigating the results of laser on zzso zzso zzso The present study was therefore undertaken to determine the zzso and zzso changes induced by zzso zzso laser on such disc zzso It was shown that the zzso of disc tissue was caused by zzso laser in early period, but this was gradually replaced by zzso zzso tissue at 60 days after laser zzso as a result of the proliferation of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso the magnetic resonance zzso imaging index zzso moved to the left in the early period, but it moved to the right again at 60 days after laser zzso In view of these data, we conclude that the use of laser in zzso disc disease does not represent an effective treatment as an alternative to conventional surgical zzso
