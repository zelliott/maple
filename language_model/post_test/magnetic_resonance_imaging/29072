The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of benign liver zzso in patients with breast cancer who are referred to magnetic resonance zzso imaging for suspected breast cancer zzso at initial zzso The original MR imaging reports of consecutive patients with breast cancer were zzso these patients had undergone MR imaging at our institution to investigate for suspected breast cancer liver zzso at initial presentation between April 1993 and May zzso zzso of the presence of benign and zzso liver zzso in each patient was made, as well as their relative zzso zzso accuracy of MR imaging was evaluated by correlation with zzso specimens (5 zzso and imaging follow-up (27 zzso Thirty-four patients with newly diagnosed breast zzso were evaluated with MR zzso A total of 11 zzso of these patients had benign zzso zzso Of 21 zzso total patients who had zzso liver zzso 19 had breast cancer zzso (2 had zzso benign zzso 1 had zzso zzso and 1 had zzso zzso No liver zzso were detected in two patients zzso In one patient with zzso zzso breast zzso no focal zzso were shown on MR zzso No other diagnostic errors in zzso of liver zzso by MR imaging occurred, as shown by clinical correlation and imaging follow-up in all zzso True positive detection of zzso liver zzso was zzso true negative was zzso false positive was zzso and false negative was zzso for a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for the detection of zzso liver zzso zzso liver zzso are common in breast cancer patients suspected clinically of having liver zzso zzso zzso alone were observed in one-third of our zzso The high diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging in the evaluation of zzso zzso underscores the value of this technique for baseline investigation of breast cancer patients with clinically suspected liver zzso particularly patients in whom treatment approaches are dramatically affected by the presence of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
