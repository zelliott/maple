General intelligence zzso is a common factor in diverse cognitive abilities and a major influence on life zzso zzso studies in adults suggest that the lateral prefrontal and zzso zzso play a crucial role in related cognitive activities including fluid reasoning, the control of attention, and working zzso Here, we investigated the neural bases for intellectual zzso zzso in zzso using zzso The participants consisted of a zzso group zzso zzso 18, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the national academy for gifted adolescents and the control group zzso zzso 18, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from local high schools in Korea zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were acquired while they performed two reasoning tasks with high and low zzso In both groups, the high zzso tasks specifically increased regional activity in the bilateral zzso network including the lateral zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso zzso zzso However, the regional zzso of the zzso group were significantly stronger than those of the control group, especially in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analysis revealed that activity of the superior and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso with individual differences in g zzso zzso zzso to zzso A correlated zzso analysis implicated bilateral zzso zzso areas in zzso These results suggest that zzso may not be due to the recruitment of additional brain regions but to the functional zzso of the zzso network particularly driven by the zzso zzso zzso
