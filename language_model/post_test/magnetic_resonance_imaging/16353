To determine if a zzso tube zzso is required for optimal examination of zzso and if patients can be examined only in the zzso zzso 

Data were collected from all patients undergoing small zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso examination over a zzso zzso Patients either underwent a magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso or a MR zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The quality of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as the presence of motion zzso and image quality were assessed by 2 zzso 

One hundred and zzso MR studies were undertaken zzso zzso in 108 patients in the zzso position zzso Image zzso was more frequent in zzso than in zzso zzso vs zzso but was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was obtained in zzso of zzso examinations and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was, however, less frequently optimal in zzso than in zzso zzso particularly in patients over the age of 50 years zzso Image quality was good in all zzso 

All patients could be successfully zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are equivalent for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently less optimal in zzso than in zzso zzso is, therefore, the preferred MR examination method of the zzso
