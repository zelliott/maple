zzso exists in the diagnosis and treatment of zzso major tear zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is useful in determining the grade and the location of zzso major tears and in guiding toward an appropriate treatment zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

Between January 1998 and December 2002, 27 patients were treated for zzso major zzso All patients were evaluated by history and physical zzso A clinical impression was formed regarding the location and grade of injury, and a treatment plan was zzso All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and images were reviewed by an zzso surgeon and a zzso musculoskeletal zzso resulting in a final treatment zzso The mean follow-up was 12 zzso All patients were evaluated by questionnaire and clinical examination to assess pain, function, zzso and overall zzso 

In 19 of 27 patients, the clinical impression and magnetic resonance imaging agreed regarding the location and the grade of the zzso A total of 19 patients underwent surgical repair, and 8 patients were treated zzso The magnetic resonance imaging result changed the treatment plan in 3 patients from operative to zzso 

The clinical impression appeared to overestimate the severity, the location, and the grade of the zzso zzso resonance imaging provided a more accurate assessment and, in conjunction with the clinical examination, helped to identify those patients who would benefit most from surgical zzso
