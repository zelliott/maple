Serious zzso in adulthood may be associated with disturbed zzso brain development, which potentially shows lingering zzso zzso in the zzso and facial zzso Several methods exist for assessing external zzso and internal brain distances but, to our knowledge, no method yet provides simultaneous measurement of zzso facial and brain dimensions in live zzso In this article we describe a method to identify landmarks on magnetic resonance images zzso for simultaneous measurement of zzso facial and brain characteristics potentially associated with zzso To test the method itself, 30 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 31 healthy comparison subjects, mean age 41 years, were randomly selected from a larger cohort recruited at the zzso Hospital, zzso Participants were investigated with zzso and 60 landmarks in the zzso facial and brain regions were identified in the zzso An independent zzso examination measured external zzso characteristics for study in relation to zzso produced through zzso High zzso and zzso zzso were obtained for two independent scorers of the landmarks in the MR zzso zzso of potentially comparable zzso distances showed high alignment with an established zzso zzso This new method can provide simultaneous investigation of multiple aspects of zzso facial and brain zzso in MR images originally collected for other zzso In a second article we will use this method to compare zzso zzso zzso and shape between schizophrenia patients and healthy zzso
