The bulk zzso properties of the active ingredients in three zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso MR contrast agents are zzso zzso content and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are consistent with zzso zzso zzso in all three active zzso No separate zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso of representative samples of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso yielded mean crystal diameters zzso weighted zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso showed that the crystal sizes were zzso distributed with respective mean crystal diameters zzso weighted zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with their small crystal sizes, the three zzso zzso are zzso with no zzso after zzso at high applied fields zzso 1 zzso and showed characteristic relaxed zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were consistent with the presence of zzso relaxation above a blocking temperature of approximately 60 zzso Due to the larger crystal sizes of zzso its zzso zzso showed the presence of rapid collective magnetic zzso on the zzso time scale zzso zzso zzso All three zzso showed high MR zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso are composed of zzso of zzso zzso zzso while zzso consists of single zzso of zzso zzso Dynamic light scattering zzso zzso showed that zzso particles have average zzso diameters of approximately 21 zzso zzso weighted zzso or 30 zzso zzso weighted zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso are coated with an 8-12 zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso zzso have average particle sizes of approximately 35 zzso zzso average zzso zzso and zzso or approximately 50 zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso Mean sizes of zzso zzso are approximately 300 zzso zzso weighted zzso A discussion of the various particle size zzso is zzso
