zzso zzso restoration zzso is a promising zzso for treatment of heart failure due to left zzso zzso dysfunction, particularly that due to zzso heart zzso The role of zzso in improving diagnosis, operative planning, and follow-up is reviewed to analyze how one examination may define a spectrum of important zzso 

Proper patient selection and optimal surgical planning relies on accurate assessment of measures of zzso volume, function, and zzso and of the mechanics of the zzso valve zzso A complete zzso imaging evaluation includes assessment of the left zzso volume (both zzso and zzso regional and global zzso function, viability of the target area for surgical exclusion and of the remote zzso determination of the zzso of the remote zzso remaining after proposed zzso to support circulatory function, and of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscle zzso factors which contribute to functional zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso allows a complete evaluation of these zzso the zzso zzso and zzso volumes (and hence ejection zzso are easily assessed zzso and zzso the regional wall motion of the zzso area and the remote zzso can be measured by several quantitative means, including with zzso zzso and the presence or absence of zzso irreversible zzso can be detected with zzso zzso contrast zzso Furthermore, an accurate measurement of the zzso zzso dimensions and the zzso muscle spacing can be easily performed using cardiac zzso allowing planning of effective therapy for zzso zzso 

The entire imaging study can be performed in less than zzso making cardiac zzso a truly useful and comprehensive tool in planning zzso and for subsequently evaluating zzso
