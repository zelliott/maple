The brain is known to be structurally abnormal in zzso with zzso findings between anatomical deficits and some zzso These zzso associations have, however, only very rarely been studied in relatives at risk of zzso We studied the relationships between structure and zzso features zzso using zzso and zzso and verbal learning and memory zzso using zzso in relatives at high risk of developing schizophrenia and normal zzso Since these zzso test scores are strong zzso of schizophrenia in the Edinburgh High zzso zzso we zzso that these relationships would differ between those high-risk subjects who will develop schizophrenia from those who will zzso We performed multiple zzso of the zzso matter segments of the subjects and controls, produced using zzso matter zzso zzso zzso with their zzso zzso and zzso scores in zzso Where significant relationships were found, we used zzso to test for subject group by zzso score zzso In those high-risk subjects who became ill, zzso matter density zzso was significantly correlated with zzso in the left superior zzso zzso In subjects who remained well, zzso was significantly correlated with GMD in the right zzso Across the whole zzso group, GMD in the right zzso zzso zzso nucleus was significantly correlated with zzso In those subjects who developed symptoms, zzso significantly correlated with GMD in right zzso zzso whereas in those who became ill, significant correlations existed zzso in the zzso These results suggest complex and changing patterns of zzso relationships in those subjects at high-risk of zzso
