zzso fluctuations in the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at rest, exhibit a temporally coherent activity thought to reflect functionally relevant zzso zzso zzso structures are the site of early pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease and have been shown to be critical for zzso zzso Our study aimed at exploring the functional impact of zzso connectivity of an anterior zzso network zzso on zzso zzso A zzso group of subjects with varying performance on tasks assessing memory was therefore selected, including healthy subjects and patients with isolated memory complaint, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mild Alzheimer's disease zzso Using Independent zzso Analysis on zzso zzso we extracted a relevant anterior zzso network zzso composed of the zzso and zzso cortex, the zzso head, the zzso and the lateral zzso zzso extending to the zzso zzso A default mode network and an zzso network were also selected to serve as control zzso We first compared zzso functional connectivity of the zzso between patients and control zzso Relative to controls, patients exhibited significantly increased functional connectivity in the zzso during zzso Specifically, zzso analysis revealed an increase within the inferior and superior zzso zzso and the zzso In the patient group, positive correlations between averaged connectivity values of zzso and performance on zzso and retrograde zzso memory tasks were observed, while no correlation was found with other evaluated cognitive zzso These correlations were specific to the zzso as no correlation between performance on memory tasks and the other selected networks was zzso Taken together, these findings provide evidence that zzso connectivity inside the zzso network has a functional role in zzso zzso zzso They also suggest that increased connectivity at rest within the zzso could reflect zzso mechanisms that occur in response to early pathological zzso
