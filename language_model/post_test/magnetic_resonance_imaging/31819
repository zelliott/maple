Despite tremendous progress in zzso zzso zzso treatment, mortality rates remain zzso Permanent loss of zzso after zzso injury, results in irreversible loss of zzso zzso reduction in zzso performance, and may initiate the development of zzso heart zzso The discovery that zzso zzso cells bear the capacity to differentiate to mature cardiac cells raised the hope of zzso zzso zzso zzso of stem cells in the damaged zzso repair and functional improvement appeared suddenly a nearby zzso Promising results in animal models, and preliminary studies reporting the feasibility and safety of adult stem cell therapy in zzso patients led to the first zzso randomized, zzso zzso The initial great enthusiasm for this paradigm shift in zzso treatment has been tempered by the mainly negative or modestly positive study zzso Before new, larger clinical trials can be zzso a number of critical questions and issues need to be considered starting with a scrutinized analysis of currently available data to extending our knowledge of the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell therapy zzso a multidisciplinary approach, zzso imaging, in particular zzso and the input of the imaging specialist is crucial to the success of cardiac cell zzso zzso zzso is an appealing technique for cell trafficking depicting zzso differentiation and zzso zzso cell administration can be achieved safely with MR zzso and zzso is without any doubt the most accurate and zzso technique to measure study zzso
