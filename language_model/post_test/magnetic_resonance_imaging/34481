We studied the relationship between corpus zzso area and both zzso zzso and interference in zzso and zzso zzso sections through the corpus zzso were measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging on 42 patients and 43 normal controls, along with symptom zzso In a zzso a modified version of the zzso Test was also performed (27 patients and 29 zzso to assess zzso zzso and interference of zzso zzso In the larger sample zzso subjects, zzso zzso zzso there were no significant differences between patients and controls in zzso area but a trend towards smaller values in patients in all but the zzso zzso In the zzso bilateral zzso was greater, and zzso less in zzso compared with zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso area, zzso by a negative correlation between interference and zzso zzso area, in both patients and controls, which only reached statistical significance when both groups were zzso These findings suggest that the zzso between zzso size and zzso processes involving zzso transfer of information, is common to both zzso and normal zzso There were significant negative correlations between anterior zzso area and zzso poverty zzso zzso and affective zzso and a suggestion that the negative correlation between age and zzso size in controls was not present in zzso
