A new hypothesis on the origin of zzso signal changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso involving transient formation of zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by reaction of zzso oxide zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated in zzso were found to produce marked zzso signal intensity changes when examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso acid (3 zzso to healthy volunteers, to specifically reduce any zzso formed during brain zzso markedly decreased zzso signal changes during standard tasks, suggesting a blood zzso effect produced by the zzso These results open a new perspective on the zzso evaluation of zzso processes associated with zzso zzso of brain zzso
