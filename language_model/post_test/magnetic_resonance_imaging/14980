zzso is characterized by marked zzso in a broad and diverse array of zzso zzso Fundamental deficits in the ability to zzso and shift to the perspectives of others and the neural networks that support this ability may contribute to many of these zzso This study sought to investigate deficits in prefrontal brain function and connectivity in patients with schizophrenia during visual zzso and the degree to which such deficits contribute to zzso zzso in social zzso A total of 20 zzso with schizophrenia and 20 zzso and zzso healthy volunteers completed a zzso visual zzso task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, along with a behavioral assessment of theory of mind after zzso zzso revealed zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso trials compared to control trials in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy zzso In addition, patients demonstrated significant deficits in negative connectivity between zzso prefrontal and zzso regions during zzso which fully zzso behavioral zzso observed in theory of zzso These findings suggest that disruptions are present in the most fundamental aspects of zzso in zzso and that these disruptions impact zzso social information zzso
