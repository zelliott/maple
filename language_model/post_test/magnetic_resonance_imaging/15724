In this study, we used zzso to analyze quantitative zzso maps of zzso zzso relaxation times in a zzso study of transgenic mice expressing zzso forms of zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso or both zzso modeling aspects of Alzheimer's disease zzso The main goal was to characterize the effects of progressive zzso zzso and deposition on the zzso environment of water and to investigate if these zzso would provide early indirect evidence of zzso pathological changes in the brains of these zzso Our results demonstrate that at an early age before zzso deposition, only zzso mice show a reduced zzso in the zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso controls, whereas a statistically significant zzso zzso decrease in zzso values is seen in the zzso and zzso of all three transgenic zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso In addition, for animals older than 12 months, we confirmed our previous report that only the two zzso that form zzso plaques zzso and zzso have significantly reduced zzso values compared with zzso zzso Thus, zzso changes in these zzso models can zzso zzso deposition or even occur in zzso models that do not deposit zzso zzso zzso but are intensified in the presence of zzso zzso
