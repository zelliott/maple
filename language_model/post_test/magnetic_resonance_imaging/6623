The purpose of this study was to compare third zzso and zzso cerebral blood flow of women with zzso to zzso control subjects with the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Nine zzso pregnant women and 12 zzso women with zzso underwent zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging of the bilateral middle and zzso cerebral arteries in the third zzso and at 6 to 8 weeks after zzso The Student zzso test was used for comparison, with a probability value of zzso considered zzso 

zzso large cerebral artery blood flow was significantly higher in zzso Mean vessel diameter was zzso except for the left zzso cerebral zzso There was no difference in mean vessel diameter or cerebral blood flow between the 2 groups while the women were not zzso 

zzso blood flow is increased significantly in zzso We zzso that increased cerebral blood flow ultimately could lead to zzso through zzso and the development of zzso zzso
