zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess healthy adults while they performed spatial and zzso context memory tasks matched in task zzso After zzso task structure between spatial versus zzso context tasks, subjects reported using similar strategies across tasks and we observed no significant differences in accuracy and reaction time performance between zzso We used three methods of statistical analysis to interrogate similarities and differences in zzso activity across retrieval tasks, while zzso on prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso partial least squares analysis zzso zzso statistical zzso mapping zzso and conjunction zzso The zzso and conjunction analyses indicated that the overall pattern of zzso activity was similar across both zzso and spatial context retrieval zzso but the zzso results indicated that some of these zzso regions exhibited differences in the degree to which they were engaged between zzso However, none of these methods identified unique zzso zzso specific to zzso spatial and/or zzso context zzso These results indicate that, overall, similar patterns of zzso activity were observed during zzso and spatial context memory retrieval once task structure and performance were zzso
