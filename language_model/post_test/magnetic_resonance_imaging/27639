zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso fatty liver disease zzso The visceral zzso index zzso a novel marker of visceral fat distribution and dysfunction, has been correlated with zzso in zzso zzso We assessed the ability of zzso to predict disease severity in zzso and hence its role as a zzso marker of liver zzso 

We examined 190 adults with zzso zzso and 129 zzso All had zzso and zzso zzso zzso was calculated using waist circumference zzso body mass index, zzso and zzso zzso fat was zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 38 zzso 

On zzso analysis, zzso diagnosis and zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso increased across control, zzso and NASH groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, this association was no stronger than the increase in zzso across groups zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso was not associated with zzso zzso inflammation or fibrosis, but zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with an increasing number of zzso syndrome components zzso zzso zzso p zzso and with zzso syndrome diagnosis zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso only modestly correlated with visceral fat on zzso zzso p zzso compared to zzso zzso p zzso 

In zzso zzso is not associated with zzso inflammation or zzso zzso is no more powerful than zzso in discriminating zzso from zzso reflecting limitations of the formula with what is known about the zzso of zzso
