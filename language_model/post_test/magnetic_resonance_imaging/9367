MRS and zzso are valuable tools for the detection of zzso changes in zzso The currently emerging era of molecular medicine, which is shaped by zzso targeted zzso therapies combined with molecular imaging of the effects of such therapies, requires powerful imaging technologies that are able to detect molecular zzso MRS and zzso are such technologies that are able to detect zzso arising from zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso in zzso settings and at higher resolution in tissue zzso The roles played by MRS and zzso in the diagnosis of different types of cancer, as well as in the early monitoring of the tumor response to traditional zzso are zzso The emerging roles of MRS and zzso in the development and detection of novel targeted zzso therapies that target zzso signaling pathways or markers in zzso or zzso metabolism are zzso
