A 20-year magnetic resonance imaging zzso and functional outcome follow-up study was performed on patients who had undergone anterior zzso zzso zzso 

The objectives of the present study are to determine whether or not zzso is related to adjacent level fusion and the clinical significance of this zzso 

There are concerns that zzso fusion leads to increase stress at the adjacent zzso However, the clinical significance of this remains zzso 

Thirty-nine patients who underwent lower zzso anterior zzso zzso fusion and who had normal zzso zzso at the level adjacent level were evaluated with a minimum of a 20-year zzso zzso scans were performed and independently evaluated for any evidence of zzso zzso status was assessed using the Low Back zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients had some evidence of zzso in their zzso spine and advanced zzso was identified in 12 zzso zzso Nine zzso patients had advanced zzso isolated to the adjacent level and 7 zzso patients had evidence of advanced zzso with preservation at the level adjacent to the zzso There was no association between function and zzso zzso Only 3 patients required additional surgery as a result of adjacent level zzso 

The prevalence of degenerative changes is similar to other studies involving normal zzso zzso Furthermore, the majority of degenerative changes seen occurred over multiple levels or at levels not adjacent to the fusion, suggesting that changes seen may be more likely related to constitutional factors as opposed to the increased stresses arising from the original zzso
