Previous imaging studies in the zzso disease zzso have mostly concentrated on the zzso and zzso Our goal was to perform a whole brain zzso zzso 

We included 45 patients and 51 controls, who underwent two brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analysis zzso to extract zzso matter density zzso values from regions of zzso We used a linear zzso model and a general linear model to correlate GMD with clinical zzso and paired zzso for the zzso zzso 

We observed decreased GMD zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso matter, zzso and zzso White matter zzso was restricted to the zzso Age, zzso and disease duration predicted GMD in different areas, but age and zzso were the most important zzso The zzso analysis failed to demonstrate zzso Changes in regions other than the zzso appeared to contribute significantly to the final International Cooperative zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We confirmed cortical involvement in zzso The most important factors in predicting GMD were age and zzso The lack of progression of zzso may indicate floor effect and/or short duration of zzso
