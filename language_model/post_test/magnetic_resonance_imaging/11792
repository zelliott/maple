The purpose of the study was to determine the frequency of associated MR imaging findings in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and to correlate MR with surgical zzso MR imaging studies of 18 patients with surgically and zzso proven zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso analyzed and correlated with surgical zzso The diameters of the zzso zzso ranged from 10 zzso to 28 zzso with a mean of 16 zzso A zzso zzso was found in 15 patients zzso and a zzso zzso in three patients zzso zzso zzso was found in six patients zzso at the level of the zzso cyst, with displacement ranging from 3 to 5 zzso mean 4 zzso Surgery revealed instability and zzso of the facet joint at the level of the zzso zzso in all patients with degenerative zzso and in five additional zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso spine were associated with degenerative zzso in six of 18 patients zzso and with instability of the facet joint in 11 zzso These findings may support the theory that increased zzso motion plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso
