To measure the rate of enhancement in immature zzso disks in comparison with that of mature disks after intravenous administration of zzso contrast zzso 

Four rabbits were zzso with MR for 120 minutes after the injection of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso enhancement was measured in the zzso zzso disks on each zzso The rate and magnitude of enhancement in the immature and mature disks were zzso 

zzso enhancement was detected in zzso disks with all three contrast zzso Enhancement was significantly greater in immature than in mature zzso 

Greater enhancement in immature disks is consistent with a lower concentration of fixed negative charges in the zzso of the zzso
