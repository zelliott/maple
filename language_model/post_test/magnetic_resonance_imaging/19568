To correlate a triangular area of high signal intensity in the zzso zzso on zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso findings in a portal mass observed during a zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive zzso and infants (age range, zzso zzso mean age, 59 zzso with zzso underwent US and zzso MR zzso In 12 patients with zzso zzso diagnosed at zzso examination, MR zzso findings in the zzso zzso were correlated with US and zzso findings in the portal zzso 

At zzso eight of the 12 patients had round, zzso or zzso zzso portions within a triangular zzso MR zzso revealed a triangular area of high signal intensity confined to the zzso zzso zzso examination of the portal mass revealed a zzso or zzso zzso surrounded by loose zzso zzso and zzso fetal zzso zzso Neither the large zzso zzso without zzso zzso nor the small zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso Similar areas of high signal intensity were not seen on zzso images in the remaining patients (four with zzso zzso and nine with zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso can show a triangular area of high signal intensity in the zzso zzso that may represent zzso zzso of the fetal zzso zzso
