To zzso characterize early zzso changes in the lung zzso of current and former smokers with zzso zzso 3 zzso lung zzso and to compare these results with the clinical standards, pulmonary function testing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study was approved by the local institutional review board, and all subjects provided informed zzso Thirty current and former smokers, each with a minimum zzso smoking history and mild or no abnormalities at zzso underwent zzso lung zzso This technique is based on diffusion MR imaging with zzso zzso gas and yields quantitative localized in zzso zzso of zzso airway geometric zzso such as airway zzso zzso depth, and number of zzso per unit lung zzso These zzso enable calculation of standard zzso zzso such as mean linear intercept and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso lung zzso was used to detect zzso in zzso structure in smokers with normal zzso zzso When compared with smokers with the largest forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso to forced vital capacity zzso ratio, those with chronic zzso pulmonary disease had significantly reduced zzso depth zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and enlarged zzso ducts zzso zzso vs zzso zzso The mean zzso geometry zzso in the zzso subjects were in excellent quantitative agreement with literature values obtained by using invasive techniques zzso duct zzso zzso zzso zzso depth, zzso zzso at 1 L above functional residual zzso zzso lung zzso depicted greater abnormalities than did zzso and zzso No adverse events were associated with inhalation of zzso zzso 

zzso lung zzso yields valuable zzso insight into early zzso changes in zzso geometry with increased sensitivity compared with conventional zzso
