zzso social interactions requires the ability to accurately interpret zzso actions, sometimes only on the basis of subtle body language zzso Here we address an important issue that has not yet received much attention in social zzso that of an interaction between two zzso We attempted to isolate brain responses to two individuals interacting compared to two individuals acting zzso 

We used zzso zzso displays to depict the characters, as they provide the most straightforward way to isolate mechanisms used to extract information from motion per zzso without any interference with other visual zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso method was used to determine which brain regions were recruited during the observation of two interacting agents, mimicking everyday social zzso While the mirror and zzso networks are rarely zzso active, we found that both of them might be needed to catch the social intentions carried by zzso zzso 

These findings shed light on how motor zzso contributes to social zzso when social information is embedded in zzso motion zzso Finally, the approach described here provides a valuable and original tool for investigating the brain networks responsible for social understanding, in particular in psychiatric zzso
