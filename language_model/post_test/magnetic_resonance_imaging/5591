zzso of cortical areas related to visual motion processing and control of eye movement, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso stimulation zzso The results agreed well with those of previous studies, which indicates that the current protocol is reliable enough to be used as a clinical zzso 

To propose an zzso zzso with zzso that is reliable and simple enough to be performed as a clinical zzso 

Ten right-handed healthy volunteers participated in this zzso zzso was used to measure blood oxygen zzso zzso signal increases zzso zzso - zzso and decreases zzso rest - zzso during zzso zzso zzso images were acquired using a standard clinical scanner operating at a magnetic field strength of zzso zzso The data were analyzed by statistical zzso mapping zzso and the significance level was set at zzso zzso 

zzso signal increases were observed in the visual association area of both zzso zzso zzso primary visual zzso zzso of the right hemisphere, bilateral superior zzso zzso zzso and bilateral frontal eye fields zzso zzso of zzso signals were observed in the zzso zzso
