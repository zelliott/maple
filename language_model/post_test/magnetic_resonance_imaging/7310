The purpose of this study was to evaluate normal values for regional and global zzso wall motion parameters in young and elderly individuals, as detected by zzso gated high zzso resolution tissue phase zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso wall motion, as well as zzso zzso and zzso strain rates, were assessed in two age groups of volunteers, 23 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and 66 zzso 7 years old zzso zzso zzso zzso All subjects were healthy, zzso without known cardiac zzso An increased global left zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso peak zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso motion zzso zzso values at zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso peak zzso values zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso in the older age group were the most prominent zzso Lower peak zzso zzso zzso with a longer zzso values, most pronounced at the zzso are consistent with reduced zzso function with zzso Lower peak zzso and zzso zzso at all zzso levels revealed limitations in resting zzso zzso motions in the older zzso zzso changes in the undulating pattern of the zzso motions of the left zzso were also zzso The results demonstrate distinct changes in regional and global zzso wall motion in elderly zzso Increased zzso zzso rate and reduced zzso zzso motion were particularly prominent in the older zzso These parameters may have a role in the assessment of global zzso zzso and help differentiate age-related changes from cardiac zzso
