We describe the use of liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso coils and a DC zzso quantum interference device zzso zzso to improve the zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso are used both to reduce zzso interactions with the zzso system's room temperature magnet and zzso coils and also to reject interference from more distant sources, which reduces the need for zzso zzso We have tested both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a more rapid zzso in sensitivity with increasing distance from its zzso than the zzso zzso but this is compensated for by reduced zzso interactions and improved interference zzso We have used the system to image the human zzso
