The purpose of this study was to compare the zzso assessment of severity of pulmonary zzso with zzso zzso versus cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso in adult patients with repaired zzso of zzso zzso 

We studied 52 zzso zzso consecutive patients zzso 32 zzso 2 years, 23 zzso 5 years after zzso using zzso zzso and compared these findings with zzso From the zzso zzso zzso the duration of pulmonary zzso and of total zzso was measured and the ratio between the 2 was defined as pulmonary zzso index zzso Pulmonary zzso fraction zzso was assessed with flow phase zzso mapping with zzso 

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median value zzso of zzso measured by zzso Group I zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso and Group II with zzso zzso There was no difference between patients' age, sex, or age at repair between the 2 zzso More patients from Group II had a right zzso zzso or zzso patch repair compared to Group I zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso Mean pulmonary zzso time was shorter zzso zzso 60 vs 440 zzso 135 zzso P zzso and zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso in Group II compared to Group zzso Color zzso zzso jet was also broader in Group II zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso signifying more severe pulmonary zzso zzso zzso correlated closely with zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso and with color zzso pulmonary zzso jet zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso the latter correlated with zzso assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso A zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for identifying patients with pulmonary zzso fraction zzso with a zzso accuracy of zzso Furthermore, zzso right zzso zzso dimensions correlated with zzso zzso volume index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Pulmonary zzso is common in zzso adults with zzso zzso of pulmonary zzso and its effects on right zzso dimensions in these patients can be assessed zzso by zzso zzso and zzso with reasonable agreement between the 2 zzso
