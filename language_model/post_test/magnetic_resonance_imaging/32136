The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the zzso vein diameter and zzso size of the zzso in patients with portal hypertension in whom zzso bodies were present in their zzso with those of zzso patients without zzso bodies and a control zzso 

Between July 2001 and February 2006, patients in whom zzso bodies were detected in their zzso and the number of patients who had been undergone magnetic resonance zzso imaging with the diagnosis of chronic liver disease were zzso A total of 43 cases with zzso bodies were zzso Out of these patients, a case of zzso was excluded from the zzso Additional 3 cases with zzso vein zzso were not included in statistical zzso zzso the zzso vein diameter and zzso size of the zzso in 39 patients zzso 1: 12 women, 27 zzso mean age, zzso zzso with portal hypertension in whom zzso bodies were detected in their zzso on zzso zzso MR images between July 2001 and February 2006 were zzso The values obtained were compared with those of 29 zzso patients without zzso bodies zzso zzso 14 women, 15 men, mean age zzso zzso and control group zzso zzso 13 women, 18 men, mean age zzso zzso The differences between the groups were analyzed with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso bodies were detected in zzso zzso of patients with chronic liver zzso The mean zzso axis of the zzso zzso zzso in group 1 was significantly greater zzso than in group 2 zzso zzso The mean zzso vein diameter was significantly larger in group 1 zzso zzso than those in groups 2 and 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso vein diameter and zzso size of the zzso in portal zzso patients with zzso zzso bodies are significantly larger than that of zzso patients without zzso bodies and that of control zzso
