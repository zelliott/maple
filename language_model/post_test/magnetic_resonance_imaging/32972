zzso monitoring with zzso zzso zzso is a useful assessment tool for the zzso of the zzso zone in patients with drug-resistant focal zzso We aimed at assessing the morbidity related to zzso zzso and the surgical outcome in patients who underwent zzso surgery after zzso zzso zzso All patients zzso admitted to our zzso Surgery Centre for drug-resistant focal zzso who underwent zzso surgery after zzso monitoring with zzso zzso and were followed up for at least 2 years were included in the zzso Their mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso were female, and 44 zzso zzso had a preoperatively detected structural zzso The mean duration of invasive recording was zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed the identification of the zzso focus in all zzso The zzso lobe was involved in 21 zzso zzso patients, whereas zzso zzso were identified in 24 (41 zzso zzso Thirteen patients zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso brain mapping was performed in 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso complications related to zzso zzso occurred in three zzso Among patients with evidence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso alone was performed in 12 cases (27 zzso while it was combined with tailored cortical zzso in the remaining zzso zzso cortical zzso was also performed in patients without evidence of zzso on zzso After zzso surgery, transient neurological deficits occurred in five cases, while another patient experienced permanent lateral zzso zzso At the last follow-up zzso 34 zzso zzso patients were zzso zzso class zzso This study suggests that invasive zzso recording with zzso zzso may be useful and fairly safe for many candidates for zzso zzso
