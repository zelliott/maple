While zzso specialization of language processing is well established, zzso of emotion processing is still under zzso Several conflicting hypotheses have been proposed, including right zzso hypothesis, zzso asymmetry hypothesis and zzso zzso zzso However, experimental evidence for these hypotheses remains inconclusive, partly because direct comparisons between zzso are zzso 

The present zzso study systematically investigated functional zzso during affective stimulus processing in 36 healthy zzso We zzso our functional data on a symmetrical template to avoid zzso effects of anatomical zzso zzso comparison of zzso responses between zzso was accomplished taking two zzso a zzso region of interest analysis focusing on brain areas most frequently reported in earlier zzso studies of zzso and an exploratory whole volume analysis contrasting zzso with flipped functional data using paired zzso 

The region of interest analysis revealed zzso towards the left in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 10) during positive stimulus zzso while negative stimulus processing was zzso towards the right in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 9 & zzso and towards the left in the zzso and zzso The whole brain analysis yielded similar results and, in addition, revealed zzso towards the right in the zzso zzso zzso 6) and the zzso junction zzso 19 & zzso during positive stimulus zzso while negative stimulus processing showed zzso towards the right in the zzso junction zzso zzso and towards the left in the middle zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggests zzso functional zzso of emotion zzso zzso show zzso asymmetry for prefrontal cortical areas and zzso negative stimulus processing in zzso areas, in particular, zzso and zzso
