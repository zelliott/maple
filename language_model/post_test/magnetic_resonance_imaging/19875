We report on a prospective selective case series of 17 patients with cervical zzso treated with closed reduction under zzso zzso 

To demonstrate the safe and effective use of zzso zzso traction in the reduction of cervical zzso using zzso zzso 

Closed reduction of the cervical spine for acute zzso has been a traditional technique used for restoring zzso alignment and providing neural element zzso The safety of this technique has been questioned, with concerns of disc migration and zzso causing zzso worsening cited as reasons to choose operative reduction and zzso as a safer option in some zzso 

zzso patients with zzso of the zzso cervical spine were given a trial of traction under zzso guidance between 1999 and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso disc material was noted, and the diameter of the spinal canal at the injured level was recorded before and after zzso 

All patients tolerated traction without zzso zzso zzso disc disruption was found in 15 of 17 zzso of patients, with zzso zzso in 4 of 17 zzso zzso caused a return of zzso disc material toward the disc space in all zzso Canal dimensions improved in 11 of 17 patients, with canal diameter increasing by a factor of zzso to zzso with a mean improvement of zzso The process of reduction was observed to be a gradual one, with progressive, significant improvement in canal dimensions occurring before zzso zzso As distracting force was increased, sequential zzso showed that canal dimensions did not diminish at any time in any zzso 

zzso monitoring in closed cervical reduction is a useful research tool for this zzso Closed reduction appears to be safe as used in this preliminary study and is effective in achieving immediate spinal zzso zzso
