The usefulness of zzso imaging and diffusion weighted imaging zzso in zzso benign and zzso zzso fractures has been zzso In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the severity of zzso damage on the diagnostic performance of these two zzso 

zzso 59 patients with 68 acute benign zzso fractures and 43 patients with 79 zzso zzso were included in this zzso The MR protocol included zzso and zzso zzso zzso recalled zzso The severity of zzso damage was expressed by zzso ratio zzso the ratio of zzso area to zzso area on the slices of largest abnormal signal area in the zzso zzso zzso zzso intensity ratio zzso defined as signal intensity zzso on zzso zzso recalled echo zzso images divided by zzso on zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso value derived from zzso analysis was performed, the relationships between zzso and the zzso of these two technologies were analyzed using linear zzso The zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were also fitted to evaluate the influence of zzso on the diagnostic performance of zzso and zzso 

The difference in both zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and acute benign zzso fractures was significant zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation between the zzso and the zzso was found in benign fractures zzso zzso zzso The severity of zzso damage had a significant influence on the zzso zzso under zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso More severe cases were associated with increased zzso for zzso 

zzso is capable of affecting the diagnostic performances of chemical shift zzso Thus, when applying these tests to make diagnoses on zzso fractures, the severity of the zzso damage should be taken into zzso The zzso zzso model is recommended because it substantially improves the ability to avoid bias when evaluating zzso
