An investigation was made into the nature of the zzso observed in auditory functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments associated with increases in total duration of acoustic imaging noise zzso zzso et zzso zzso Shah et zzso zzso A zzso zzso paradigm was used to evaluate four acoustic conditions zzso zzso the presence or absence of a desired broadband music zzso and zzso two possible zzso of trains of acoustic noise associated with image zzso zzso observed while increasing the duration of acoustic imaging noise were consistent with previous work zzso et zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso but the response to combined stimulation did not exhibit variation as a function of the acoustic imaging noise zzso These results suggest that spectral overlap of the stimuli produced zzso responses that did not add zzso This conclusion has implications for conducting both blocked and zzso zzso auditory zzso zzso The cortical activity induced by the stimulus may not reflect the zzso in spatial extent or magnitude of signal change, occurring in the absence of other acoustic zzso
