We used functional imaging of normal subjects to identify the neural zzso for the perception of voices in external auditory zzso This fundamental process can be abnormal in zzso when voices that are not true external auditory objects zzso verbal zzso may appear to originate in external zzso The perception of voices as objects in external space depends on filtering by the outer zzso zzso that distort this process involve the cerebral zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was carried out on 12 normal subjects using an zzso simulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso voices in the form of typical auditory verbal zzso zzso between the brain activity associated with the two conditions allowed us to test the hypothesis that the perception of voices in external space zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso network zzso association auditory zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso Group analyses of response to zzso zzso versus zzso zzso voices showed significant zzso solely in the left zzso This was demonstrated in three experiments in which the zzso zzso of the stimulus was to the right, to the left or zzso These findings suggest a critical involvement of the left zzso in the perception of voices in external space that is not dependent on precise spatial zzso Based on this, we suggest a model for the false perception of zzso located auditory verbal zzso
