zzso of zzso structures and networks is believed to significantly contribute to zzso restoration of functions after zzso However, it has been unclear to what extent the brain reorganizes and how this zzso with functional recovery in relation to stroke zzso We applied serial zzso functional zzso and diffusion zzso imaging together with behavioral testing to relate zzso modifications in functional and structural connectivity of the zzso zzso network to changes in zzso function after unilateral stroke in zzso We found that gradual improvement of functions is associated with wide-ranging changes in functional and structural connectivity within bilateral zzso networks, particularly after large zzso Both after medium and large stroke, brain reorganization eventually leads to zzso zzso of zzso signal synchronization within the affected zzso cortical network zzso signal zzso as well as between the affected and unaffected zzso zzso zzso functional zzso Furthermore, the bilateral network zzso shifts from zzso increased zzso possibly reflective of initial excessive zzso zzso and zzso toward a baseline zzso zzso optimal for global information transfer and local processing, at chronic zzso zzso network zzso was accompanied by recovery of initially disrupted structural integrity in zzso tract regions, which correlated positively with retrieval of zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that the degree of functional recovery after stroke is associated with the extent of preservation or restoration of zzso zzso tracts in combination with zzso of zzso zzso signal synchronization and zzso of zzso cortical network zzso
