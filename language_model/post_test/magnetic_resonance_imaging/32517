A novel selective multiple quantum zzso chemical shift imaging method was developed for acquiring zzso images in the human brain at 3 zzso This method allows a zzso acquisition of an zzso total zzso image with the same spatial zzso Using zzso image zzso and a zzso least square zzso analysis of zzso zzso concentration ratios in frontal and zzso zzso of healthy adult volunteers as a function of the tissue gray matter zzso the mean zzso concentration in gray and white matter was determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is expected that this method will become a useful tool for studying zzso function in the human brain in zzso
