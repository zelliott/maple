zzso state brain activity can provide valuable insights into the zzso of Parkinson's disease zzso The purpose of the present study was zzso to investigate abnormal spontaneous zzso activity in early zzso patients using zzso functional zzso zzso with a regional zzso zzso method and zzso to demonstrate the potential of using changes in abnormal spontaneous zzso activity for monitoring the progression of zzso during its early zzso zzso early zzso patients were assessed with the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso disability scale and the zzso State zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso and zzso healthy zzso All subjects underwent zzso scans using a zzso General Electric zzso Excite II zzso The zzso scan protocol included zzso zzso imaging using a zzso inversion recovery prepared zzso fast zzso zzso pulse sequence and zzso zzso zzso zzso slices covering the whole zzso zzso zzso using an echo zzso imaging zzso zzso Images were analyzed in zzso together with a zzso zzso using the in-house software program zzso A corrected threshold of zzso was determined by zzso and used in statistical zzso Compared with the healthy controls, the early zzso group showed significantly increased zzso in a number of brain regions, including the left zzso left zzso zzso right middle zzso zzso right zzso nucleus areas, right superior frontal zzso middle frontal zzso zzso right inferior zzso lobe zzso right zzso zzso left zzso and left zzso Additionally, significantly reduced zzso was also observed in the early zzso patients in the following brain zzso the left zzso left inferior frontal zzso right zzso right anterior zzso and bilateral zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso patients, zzso in the left zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso scores zzso These results indicate that the abnormal resting state spontaneous brain activity associated with patients with early zzso can be revealed by zzso zzso
