This paper describes continuous zzso zzso zzso In these studies, stimuli are presented in an zzso sequential manner, and can be used to estimate simultaneously the mean difference in neural activity between stimuli as well as the effect of one stimulus upon another zzso zzso zzso adaptation, which has been the basis of many recent zzso studies, is shown to be a specific form of zzso zzso With this approach, the adapting effects of stimuli may be studied in a continuous zzso as opposed to within isolated pairs or zzso Additionally, the average, direct effect of a stimulus upon neural response can form the basis of a simultaneously obtained distributed pattern analysis, allowing comparison of neural population coding on focal zzso zzso and distributed zzso zzso spatial zzso These studies are zzso conducted with serially balanced zzso in which every stimulus precedes and follows every other zzso While zzso can provide this stimulus order, the type 1 index 1 sequence of zzso and zzso may be used in zzso studies for those experimental designs for which an zzso solution does not zzso Continuous zzso designs with serially balanced sequences are argued to be particularly well suited to the characterization of zzso zzso in which the zzso similarity of stimuli is related to the structure of neural representation both within and across zzso These concepts are illustrated with a worked example involving the neural representation of zzso It is shown that data from a single scanning session are sufficient to detect direct and zzso effects, as well as demonstrate the correspondence of the similarity structure of distributed patterns of neural firing and the zzso similarity of a set of zzso
