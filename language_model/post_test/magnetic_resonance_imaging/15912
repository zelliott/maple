To determine the feasibility of labeling human zzso stem cells zzso with zzso zzso and assessing their potential as imaging zzso in the monitoring of zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were measured at zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso Using zzso and the zzso labeling efficiency, zzso and proliferation were zzso zzso laser scanning zzso and transmission electron zzso were used to specify the zzso zzso of the zzso iron zzso We also observed in zzso and in zzso zzso of the labeled zzso with a zzso MR scanner and optical zzso 

zzso showed both zzso and fluorescent zzso The zzso and zzso zzso values of the zzso were zzso and 398 zzso zzso at zzso respectively, and zzso and 453 zzso zzso at zzso zzso The effective zzso of zzso into zzso was observed by zzso laser scanning zzso zzso The transmission electron zzso images showed that zzso was zzso into the cells and mainly resided in the zzso The viability and proliferation of zzso zzso were not significantly different from the control zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso and in zzso with optical and MR zzso 

zzso can be a useful contrast agent for stem cell imaging, which is suitable for a zzso detection by zzso and optical zzso
