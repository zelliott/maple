To determine whether muscle fiber zzso associated with steroid zzso can be detected with zzso relaxation zzso 

Animal and human studies were approved by the ethics zzso zzso consent was zzso Twelve rabbits were divided into a group that received 3 zzso of zzso zzso each day for 10 consecutive days zzso zzso 6) and a control group that received saline zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging was performed before and after zzso zzso and fat deposition ratio zzso of zzso and zzso muscles before and after treatment and between control rabbits and rabbits treated with steroids were compared by using zzso repeated analysis of zzso and zzso post hoc test to evaluate effects of steroid zzso After imaging, rabbits were zzso zzso space ratio zzso and fiber diameter were zzso zzso among zzso zzso and diameter of type 2 muscle fibers was analyzed with a zzso correlation test with zzso correction in zzso to determine factors affecting zzso In humans, zzso relaxation time and zzso of both muscles were compared between volunteers not treated with steroids and patients treated with steroids by using an zzso zzso test to evaluate the effects of zzso 

In zzso zzso of zzso muscle was significantly zzso zzso zzso longer after steroid treatment than before steroid treatment and was also significantly zzso zzso zzso longer than after saline zzso zzso of the zzso showed no significant difference in control rabbits before or after saline administration or in control rabbits and rabbits before steroid zzso zzso of the zzso muscle or zzso of either muscle showed no significant zzso There was a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso and diameter of type 2 muscle fibers in the zzso In humans, zzso of the zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso longer in patients than in zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso of either muscle showed no significant zzso 

Muscle fiber zzso associated with steroid zzso is zzso as zzso of zzso relaxation time in the zzso zzso the authors believe zzso of zzso relaxation time is mainly due to increased zzso reflecting type 2 muscle fiber zzso
