zzso resonance imaging zzso contrast agents have become an important tool in clinical zzso The most common agents are zzso complexes that shorten bulk water zzso by rapid exchange of a single zzso water zzso with bulk zzso zzso Current zzso agents lack tissue specificity and typically do not respond to their chemical zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that MR contrast may be altered by an entirely different mechanism based on chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso contrast can originate from exchange of zzso zzso or zzso zzso or from zzso sites on zzso zzso zzso This has opened the door for the discovery of new classes of responsive agents ranging from MR gene reporter molecules to small molecules that sense their tissue environment and respond to biological zzso
