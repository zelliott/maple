To explore how repetitive zzso movement training effects upper limb motor function and cortical zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso treatment trial with baseline zzso 

Ten chronic patients with stroke with zzso of the upper zzso 

zzso were performed during a zzso baseline period before and once after 4 weeks of training using the Motor Assessment zzso of the upper zzso Nine Hole Peg zzso zzso for range of movement and the modified zzso scale for muscle zzso Two patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso The treatment consisted of daily sessions of repeated functional reaching and grasping movements guided passively and attempted actively during 4 zzso 

The group improved in range of motion and Motor Assessment zzso zzso zzso reported improvements in a variety of daily tasks requiring the use of the affected upper zzso zzso in cortical zzso in prefrontal and zzso areas were observed in parallel with improvements of upper limb motor function in the 2 patients zzso 

The zzso training zzso improved hand motor function and zzso zzso zzso on functional magnetic resonance imaging changed in parallel suggesting reorganization of areas related to movements of the zzso zzso
