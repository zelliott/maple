zzso of brain structure in genetic speech and language disorders provide an opportunity to identify zzso zzso and further zzso the neural bases of language and its zzso Here we report such investigations in a large family, known as the zzso family, half the members of which are affected by a severe disorder of speech and language, which is transmitted as an zzso zzso zzso The structural brain abnormalities associated with this disorder were investigated using two zzso methods of zzso zzso A zzso zzso method was used to compare the amounts of zzso matter in the brains of three groups of zzso the affected members of the zzso family, the unaffected members and a group of zzso zzso This method revealed a number of mainly zzso and zzso brain regions in which the affected family members had significantly different amounts of zzso matter compared with the unaffected and control groups, who did not differ from each zzso Several of these regions were abnormal zzso including the zzso nucleus, which was of particular interest because this structure was also found to show functional zzso in a related PET zzso We performed a more detailed zzso analysis of this zzso The results confirmed that the volume of this nucleus was reduced zzso in the affected family members compared with both the unaffected members and the group of zzso zzso This reduction in volume was most evident in the superior portion of the zzso The volume of the zzso nucleus was significantly correlated with the performance of affected family members on a test of oral zzso a test of zzso repetition and the coding zzso of the zzso Intelligence zzso These results thus provide further evidence of a relationship between the abnormal development of this nucleus and the zzso in zzso control and articulation reported in the zzso zzso
