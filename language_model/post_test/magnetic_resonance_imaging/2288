The zzso has long been regarded as involved in the control of movement, in part through its connections with the cerebral zzso These connections were thought to combine zzso from widespread regions of the cerebral zzso and zzso them into the motor system at the level of the primary motor zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso virus type I has recently been used to identify areas of the cerebral zzso that are zzso influenced by the output of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso output projects via the zzso to multiple cortical areas, including zzso and prefrontal cortex, as well as the primary motor zzso In addition, the projections to different cortical areas appear to originate from distinct regions of the deep zzso zzso These observations have led to the proposal that zzso output is composed of a number of separate zzso zzso Evidence from functional imaging studies in humans and single zzso recording studies in monkeys suggests that individual output channels are concerned with different aspects of motor or cognitive zzso
