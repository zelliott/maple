zzso is associated with zzso zzso and behavioral zzso known as sickness zzso zzso zzso are implicated in zzso this central motivational zzso accompanying peripheral zzso responses to zzso Studies in zzso suggest an zzso zzso neural zzso although comparable data in humans are zzso 

In a zzso zzso crossover study, 16 healthy male volunteers received typhoid vaccination or saline zzso injection in two experimental zzso Profile of zzso State questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 2 and 3 zzso Two hours after injection, participants performed a zzso color word zzso task during functional magnetic resonance zzso Blood samples were performed at baseline and immediately after zzso 

zzso but not zzso injection produced a robust inflammatory response zzso by increased circulating zzso accompanied by a significant increase in fatigue, confusion, and impaired concentration at 3 zzso Performance of the zzso task under inflammation activated brain regions zzso representations of internal bodily zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of this response are consistent with zzso information flow via zzso zzso zzso During performance of this task, activity within zzso brain regions also predicted individual differences in zzso but not zzso fatigue and zzso Maintenance of cognitive performance, despite zzso fatigue, led to recruitment of additional prefrontal cortical zzso 

These findings suggest that peripheral infection selectively influences central nervous system function to generate core symptoms of sickness and zzso basic motivational zzso
