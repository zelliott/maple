zzso systems have been developed for zzso neurosurgery to aid in the accurate zzso of zzso brain zzso zzso the accuracy of the zzso is zzso However, many factors can reduce the navigation accuracy during zzso Before zzso the patient's head is secured to a head frame with head zzso this fixation may cause displacement of zzso markers and reduce the zzso We term this phenomenon skin zzso In this study, the extent of skin shift and its effect on navigation accuracy were determined by use of both zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans acquired before fixation and zzso zzso scans acquired after zzso We measured the displacement of the zzso markers by using fusion images obtained by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also evaluated the navigation accuracy of registration based on zzso and on zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso extent of skin shift was zzso zzso zzso zzso The navigation accuracy of registration based on zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of registration based on zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was observed between the extent of skin shift and the distance between the head pins and zzso markers zzso zzso zzso The navigation accuracy of registration based on zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of registration based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that skin shift was caused by the zzso and that this shift reduced the navigation zzso zzso zzso can correct the effect of skin zzso
