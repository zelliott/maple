Charged contrast agents have been used both in zzso and in zzso for zzso of the fixed charge density zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, the effects of molecular size and charge on the diffusion and equilibrium distribution of several magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso contrast agents were zzso Full thickness cartilage disks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared from fresh bovine zzso zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso zzso diffusion was allowed either through the zzso surface or through the deep zzso CT imaging of the samples was conducted before contrast agent administration and after 1, 5, 9, 16, 25 and 29 h (and with three samples after 2, 3, 4 and 5 zzso diffusion using a clinical peripheral quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso With all contrast agents, the diffusion through the deep cartilage was slower when compared to the diffusion through the zzso zzso With zzso zzso and zzso it took over 29 h for diffusion to reach the zzso zzso The slow diffusion of the contrast agents raise concerns regarding the zzso of techniques for zzso zzso as these contrast agents may not reach the equilibrium state that is zzso However, since cartilage zzso zzso deep versus superficial, had a significant effect on zzso imaging of the zzso diffusion process might enable more accurate assessment of cartilage zzso
