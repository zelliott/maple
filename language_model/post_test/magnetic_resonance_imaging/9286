zzso zzso zzso is a genetic disease zzso characterized by a profound disarray of zzso zzso and by local zzso We sought to characterize regional left zzso zzso in zzso patients using deformation analysis and to compare it with the presence or absence of delayed enhancement in cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

We studied 58 zzso patients zzso age 41 years, 37 zzso The control population comprised 15 normal zzso zzso zzso imaging was acquired in two-dimensional mode from zzso zzso and zzso views; zzso analysis was performed in four zzso and four middle left zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 36 zzso zzso In zzso patients, peak zzso strain was not uniform across left zzso zzso differences were not related to site or thickness of the segment zzso Paradoxically, positive zzso strain values were measured in six middle zzso Delayed zzso enhancement was associated with lower peak zzso strain zzso zzso zzso Regional zzso in peak zzso strain were not observed in normal zzso 

Areas of reduced left zzso zzso in deformation analysis are associated with delayed zzso enhancement in patients with zzso
