zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on cerebral zzso and cerebral damage were examined in a rat middle cerebral artery zzso zzso model and their zzso were compared with the conventional zzso agents, aspirin and zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso induced zzso zzso by oral (1 and 10 zzso and intravenous (1 zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso also inhibited zzso The potency of zzso was about 10 times stronger than that of zzso being comparable with the zzso of blood zzso zzso Aspirin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso tendency on zzso zzso zzso h after zzso zzso cerebral zzso and cerebral zzso were observed, and the zzso content in the brain zzso zzso and zzso prevented this zzso and the zzso effects of the drugs were correlated with the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso size and inhibited the increase in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso inhibit cerebral damage by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso probably resulting from the zzso of zzso generation, and their effects are superior to those of aspirin and zzso zzso might play an important role in cerebral damage in the zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a useful drug for the treatment of cerebral zzso and for the prevention of cerebral zzso
