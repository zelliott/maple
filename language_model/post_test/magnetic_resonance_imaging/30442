Lung cancer is the zzso 1 cancer killer of both men and women in the United zzso zzso is frequently employed as part of the zzso However, radiation must traverse surrounding regions of normal zzso potentially inducing pulmonary zzso Because these patients frequently have underlying lung disease, a zzso zzso in lung function could be highly zzso or even zzso It is well known that lung function is not uniform, with wide ranges of ventilation and zzso levels throughout the zzso Currently radiation zzso do not have the ability to account for this variation when generating treatment zzso 

This article reviews some techniques used to assess pulmonary ventilation and zzso including nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Many techniques have the potential to be used in zzso treatment planning for zzso cancer patients to spare normal functional lung volumes while delivering adequate radiation dose to the zzso The article outlines a promising new technique to generate 3-D ventilation maps by using zzso image registration of zzso CT image zzso 

While there are some technical challenges to overcome before pulmonary functional imaging can be routinely employed clinically in radiation zzso there is the potential to zzso spare better zzso regions of normal zzso which promises to reduce pulmonary zzso
