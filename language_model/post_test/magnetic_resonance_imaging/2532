To evaluate the ability of monitoring laser induced temperature changes in an open, zzso zzso T zzso adopting fast zzso zzso 

A fast zzso zzso zzso and a fast zzso zzso zzso zzso both enabling an image update every zzso zzso were investigated for their ability to zzso laser tissue effects at 5 zzso zzso induced temperature was zzso measured and correlated with signal intensity zzso changes depicted by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso 

zzso changes on zzso images appeared as early as 15 s following the onset of laser application and were significantly more pronounced than those seen on zzso images zzso zzso zzso A correlation of r zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso between temperature and zzso loss was zzso zzso to a steeper zzso the zzso sequence was considered more sensitive to temperature zzso The areas of zzso tissue change correlated with those of zzso loss, but zzso size was generally underestimated by zzso 

zzso monitoring is possible with rapid image updates in a midfield zzso zzso zzso zzso environment using fast zzso echo sequence zzso
