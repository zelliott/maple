There is zzso between the exact representation of anatomical structures and zzso in the CT or zzso scan and the more or less accurate zzso zzso methods based mostly upon landmarks of the skull and zzso space and visible abnormalities of the cerebral zzso To overcome these problems of exact zzso zzso a Computer Assisted zzso zzso is presented which allows precise zzso orientation without these zzso It consists of a mechanically articulated arm with six degrees of freedom with a high precision digital incremental and an image zzso for 3 D data of the zzso zzso and/or CT investigation is done zzso with four reference markers fixed on the patient's zzso They are visible on the CT or zzso slices and are used as reference points during surgery for adjustment of the zzso The zzso of the zzso arm tip are projected into the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso CT slices so that the system simultaneously presents three zzso zzso CT reconstructions with a zzso indicating the position of the tip of the zzso As the surgeon directs the arm to the region of interest the corresponding CT slices are displayed on the monitor at a rate of 20 zzso determined by the motion of the zzso The accuracy of measurement of the device itself lies within 1 zzso The accuracy is somewhat reduced however by the thickness of CT or zzso slices zzso 2 zzso slices were zzso and by zzso of the reference markers on the skin surface which amount up to 3 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
