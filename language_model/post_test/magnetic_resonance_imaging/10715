In this study, a zzso fast image reconstruction algorithm, based on the fact that zzso lines are perpendicular to current lines in a volume conductor, is proposed for magnetic resonance electrical zzso zzso zzso The proposed technique is evaluated both on simulated and measured data for conductor and zzso zzso
