zzso Acquisition of zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso technique that increases MR image acquisition speed by an zzso factor over existing zzso methods, without significant sacrifices in spatial resolution or zzso zzso Image acquisition time is reduced by exploiting spatial information inherent in the geometry of a surface zzso array to substitute for some of the phase zzso usually produced by magnetic field zzso This allows for partially parallel image acquisitions using many of the existing zzso zzso Unlike the data combination zzso of prior proposals for parallel imaging, zzso reconstruction involves a small set of MR signal combinations prior to zzso zzso which can be advantageous for artifact handling and practical zzso A twofold savings in image acquisition time is demonstrated here using commercial phased array coils on two different zzso zzso zzso time savings factors can be expected for appropriate zzso zzso
