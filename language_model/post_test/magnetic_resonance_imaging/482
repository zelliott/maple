Women have an increased risk of knee zzso zzso However, little is known about gender differences in cartilage health before the onset of clinical knee zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether there are zzso gender differences in knee cartilage in a cohort of healthy, zzso adults with no clinical knee zzso 

Two hundred zzso participants zzso zzso aged between 50 and 79 years with no clinical history of knee pain or pathology were examined using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and zzso years zzso From these images, changes in zzso and zzso cartilage volume and progression of cartilage defects were zzso 

In zzso zzso after adjustment for potential zzso the average annual percentage loss of total zzso cartilage volume was significantly greater in women zzso zzso zzso zzso than in men zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Likewise, the female gender was also associated with an increased risk for the progression of zzso cartilage defects zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso At the zzso average annual percentage loss of cartilage volume was significantly greater in women zzso zzso zzso zzso than in men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

The female predisposition toward knee zzso may, at least in part, be due to gender differences in cartilage health, even before the onset of clinical knee zzso zzso the mechanism for these gender differences may provide a means to reduce the risk of knee zzso in zzso
