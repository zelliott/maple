To test the accuracy of bilateral language mapping using a standard clinical magnetic resonance zzso imaging device during word zzso 

A study of normal zzso 

Volunteers from the Washington, DC, zzso 

Nine normal, zzso native English speakers (four women, five men, mean age 31 zzso 

During four MR acquisition zzso subjects would alternately rest and silently generate zzso zzso MR images covered the middle and inferior frontal zzso zzso and part of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso maps of zzso signal changes obtained by zzso in each zzso the signal during word generation and rest zzso and zzso analysis of the time course of the zzso 

zzso responses were in the left hemisphere, mainly in the frontal lobe zzso area, zzso cortex, and zzso prefrontal zzso but also in zzso regions such as zzso zzso In agreement with previous studies, some degree of zzso changes was present in a subset of the corresponding regions in the right zzso 

Despite certain limitations, it is possible, using widely available MR equipment, to obtain results consistent with previous zzso The technique may have important implications for assessment of cognitive functions in patients with zzso disorders in a clinical zzso
