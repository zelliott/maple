The aim of the study was to generate equations predicting visceral zzso and subcutaneous zzso abdominal zzso tissue zzso from simple zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to measure zzso and SAT zzso areas at the level of zzso in 49 subjects (19 men and 30 zzso with a large range of age and body mass index zzso zzso waist and hip zzso waist to hip ratio zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total body fat content by the zzso method, and abdominal zzso diameter by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso to estimate zzso and SAT from age and simple zzso zzso zzso excluding total body fat and abdominal zzso zzso were zzso These equations were then used in 24 subjects zzso men and 15 zzso to zzso zzso The best zzso zzso including waist circumference in men and waist circumference and age in women, explained zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The corresponding standard error of the estimate zzso in men was approximately zzso and in women approximately 37% of the mean value of zzso measured by zzso The best zzso equations developed to predict SAT had a higher explained zzso zzso zzso in both men and zzso and a lower SEE zzso zzso of the mean values of SAT measured by zzso In men, the equation included zzso and hip zzso and in women, zzso and zzso The inclusion of a higher number of simple zzso parameters in the zzso models neither significantly increased the explained zzso of zzso or SAT nor significantly decreased the SEE of zzso or zzso Also, inclusion in the multiple zzso analysis of total body fat content and abdominal zzso diameter did not improve zzso In the zzso study, differences between predicted and observed values of zzso were large, with a tendency to zzso in both men and zzso In contrast, differences between predicted and observed values of SAT were zzso We suggest that SAT but not zzso can be estimated from age and simple zzso zzso zzso methods zzso zzso zzso zzso or other zzso should be used for assessment of zzso
