To describe tissue zzso time intervals and derived zzso in zzso left heart syndrome zzso across surgical zzso taking account of age-related changes in the heart zzso zzso of the zzso performance index zzso and the zzso to zzso zzso time ratio with other zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of cardiac zzso 

zzso patients at different stages of zzso zzso were studied zzso using tissue zzso imaging of the right zzso free wall, with simultaneous cardiac zzso in the zzso Both zzso contraction time and zzso relaxation time were prolonged compared with the normal left and right zzso median zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso When adjusted for heart rate, the zzso zzso and zzso times in zzso were not significantly different from published normal zzso The zzso was increased at all surgical stages in zzso Neither zzso nor heart zzso zzso time ratio zzso correlated with zzso ejection fraction or zzso cardiac output when the zzso effect of significant zzso zzso was taken into zzso 

The zzso in zzso relaxation and contraction times may be due to adaptation or reduced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso time ratio between surgical stages can be accounted for by the heart rate zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso correlated with zzso or other zzso zzso of zzso or zzso function with the exception of a negative correlation between central zzso pressure and zzso ratio zzso
