zzso zzso zzso of the breast has been investigated for over 10 zzso The reports of sensitivity for cancer detection have generally been greater than 90 zzso However, estimates of specificity have varied zzso Differing results are due to differences in study zzso technical methods and criteria for zzso Early and marked signal rise, detected using dynamic imaging technique following contrast administration, is the zzso hallmark of zzso However, some zzso zzso may enhance slowly or minimally, and a variety of benign zzso may enhance rapidly with marked signal zzso High resolution techniques generally requiring longer acquisition times are more likely to depict the slowly enhancing zzso at the cost of a decrease in specificity due to lack of zzso zzso This disadvantage may be offset by the improved zzso of zzso zzso with high resolution zzso This report reviews the methods and results of the leading investigators of breast zzso
