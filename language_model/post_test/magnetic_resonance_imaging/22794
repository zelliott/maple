To investigate the effectiveness of a simplified approach to the evaluation of the zzso structures of the fetal brain using three-dimensional zzso zzso 

zzso examinations were performed in normal fetuses and in cases with anomalies involving the zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso median planes were obtained by aligning the zzso with the anterior zzso and zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso Median planes were also reconstructed using zzso zzso from volumes acquired from zzso zzso planes of the fetal head zzso median zzso by either zzso analysis of zzso volumes or volume contrast imaging in the zzso plane zzso zzso and zzso median planes were compared zzso and zzso by measuring the corpus zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso median planes could be zzso in zzso normal zzso zzso median planes were obtained in all, usually more easily and zzso There was a good correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the corpus zzso and zzso zzso were highly zzso with mean variations of zzso and zzso zzso The abnormal group included 13 fetuses (five with partial or complete zzso of the corpus zzso six with zzso zzso zzso two with a combination of these two zzso In all cases the diagnosis could be made by both zzso and zzso views and was always confirmed by zzso zzso Although zzso median views were of better quality, zzso images were always adequate for diagnosis, both in normal and abnormal zzso 

zzso median planes are obtained more easily than zzso ones, and allow an accurate diagnosis of normal cerebral anatomy and zzso The zzso approach may be valuable particularly for rapid assessment of fetal cerebral anatomy in standard zzso
