To investigate the negative zzso value zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso level and prior negative zzso 

We enrolled 26 patients with zzso level between zzso and 10 zzso and no cancer at previous zzso zzso were performed on a zzso system using zzso imaging, zzso imaging, zzso and zzso dynamic zzso A regional scheme was used to record zzso findings and to perform subsequent zzso zzso Based on the matching between imaging and biopsy findings we estimated zzso zzso values, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy on a zzso and zzso zzso 

On a per patient basis, zzso had five zzso zzso zzso eight zzso zzso zzso and no zzso cases, corresponding to a zzso and sensitivity of zzso zzso Thirteen patients were assessed as zzso cases zzso zzso zzso of zzso Five of them zzso zzso showed high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proliferation zzso at zzso zzso imaging alone showed zzso zzso zzso 

Because of the high zzso zzso had the potential to avoid unnecessary biopsy in approximately one-third of zzso patients with a negative zzso Additionally, zzso was useful to address to biopsy more than one-third of patients with cancer or high-risk zzso as zzso and zzso
