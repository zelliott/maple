To explore the presence of functional connectivity between anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during the manipulation of zzso network test zzso and its relationship with behavioral zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 25 healthy subjects aged 17 - 20 zzso And zzso was used as a zzso zzso connectivity between zzso was tested and correlation analysis conducted between functional connectivity zzso and behavioral scores of zzso 

zzso functional connectivity between the zzso zzso zzso with bilateral zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso functional connectivity zzso between left zzso and left zzso were zzso associated with the behavioral scores of executive control zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Our findings provide new evidence that zzso and zzso are functionally connected and such functional connectivity has advantageous influence on executive control function of attention so as to contribute to our understanding of the integrated role of these brain regions in zzso zzso
