zzso at zzso is said to be more accurate than zzso zzso but costs and other practical differences mean that it is unclear which to zzso 

We systematically reviewed studies comparing diagnostic accuracy at zzso with zzso We searched zzso zzso and other sources from 1 January 2000 to 22 October 2010 for studies comparing diagnostic accuracy at zzso and zzso in human zzso We extracted data on methodology, quality criteria, technical factors, subjects, zzso diagnostic accuracy and errors according to zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso 150 studies zzso zzso most were zzso compared old zzso with new zzso technology, and only 22 zzso described diagnostic zzso The zzso images were often described as zzso but we found little evidence of improved zzso zzso were limited to research applications zzso zzso zzso zzso automated zzso zzso zzso doubling of the zzso ratio was not confirmed, mostly being zzso zzso were worse and acquisitions took slightly longer at zzso 

zzso evidence to guide zzso purchasing decisions and routine diagnostic use is zzso zzso evaluation accuracy and zzso of diagnostic imaging technologies should be the routine, as for pharmacological interventions, to improve effectiveness of zzso 

zzso Higher field strength zzso may improve image quality and diagnostic zzso zzso There are few direct comparisons of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso doubling of the zzso ratio in practice was only zzso zzso zzso evidence of improved routine clinical diagnosis is zzso zzso Other aspects of technology improved images more than field zzso
