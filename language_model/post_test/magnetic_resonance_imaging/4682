To investigate imaging findings in premature infants who had profound zzso 

CT (three zzso MR (three zzso and zzso (four zzso studies of five patients who had profound zzso before the zzso age of 32 weeks were zzso zzso The patients ranged from 1 day to 4 months old at the time of the imaging zzso An autopsy report was available in one zzso The results were compared with reports in the literature of patients with similar injuries at similar zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were present in all infants examined with CT or zzso CT showed low zzso in the zzso zzso and high zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and low zzso of the upper brain stem were present in one zzso MR showed zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso in all zzso zzso MR changes were noted in the zzso zzso ranging from diminished size with normal signal intensity to zzso and zzso zzso with normal size and complete zzso zzso and zzso zzso were seen in the zzso brain stem in one zzso zzso showed transient or persistent zzso in the zzso in three patients and zzso of the zzso in one zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was not present in any zzso 

zzso zzso before 32 weeks zzso age shows consistent injury to the zzso zzso zzso and brain stem that can be detected by all three imaging zzso The pattern of injury seems to differ from that of partial zzso in premature infants and of profound zzso in term zzso
