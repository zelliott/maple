zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso techniques sensitive to the local changes in blood flow, volume and zzso accompanying zzso zzso are powerful tools to investigate the human brain zzso zzso were performed on 10 right-handed healthy volunteers (age zzso zzso zzso using a zzso T zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso planes were investigated along the central zzso of the left zzso zzso images were acquired using a zzso Echo sequence while the subjects zzso performed sequential finger to thumb opposition movements of the right hand or mental imagery of a visual zzso Twelve images for each task were obtained over a zzso experimental zzso they were then analyzed with the software provided by the zzso In all the subjects small areas were activated in both the zzso and zzso zzso mean percentage signal increases during finger movement being zzso and zzso zzso These values are fairly higher than literature zzso However several factors, such as zzso volume, are involved in determining the measured signal increase during zzso Moreover, in most cases the software procedures provided with the MR equipment to analyze the functional images imply zzso zzso It is thus necessary to implement new software packages for the analysis of zzso images to apply more appropriate statistical procedures and to obtain more homogeneous and objective final zzso
