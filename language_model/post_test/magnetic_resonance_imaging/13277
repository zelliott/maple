zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant, fully zzso neurodegenerative disease that most commonly affects adults in zzso Our aim was to identify sensitive and reliable zzso in zzso carriers of zzso zzso and in individuals with early HD that could provide essential methodology for the assessment of therapeutic zzso 

This zzso study uses an extensive battery of novel zzso including zzso zzso zzso clinical, zzso quantitative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses were done on the baseline zzso data from zzso zzso 123 controls, 120 zzso zzso individuals, and 123 patients with early zzso 

The first participant was enrolled in January, 2008, and all assessments were completed by August, zzso zzso analyses identified significant changes in zzso volume, regional zzso and white matter differences, impairment in a range of voluntary zzso zzso and zzso tasks, and cognitive and zzso dysfunction in zzso HD gene carriers with normal motor scores through to early clinical stage 2 zzso 

We show the feasibility of rapid data acquisition and the use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso motor measures in a large zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for quantifiable biological and clinical zzso in zzso expansion carriers compared with zzso zzso Many parameters differ from zzso controls in a graded fashion and show changes of increasing magnitude across our zzso who range from about 16 years from predicted disease diagnosis to early zzso These findings might help to define novel quantifiable zzso and methods for rapid and reliable data zzso which could aid the design of therapeutic zzso
