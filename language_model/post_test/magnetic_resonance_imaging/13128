zzso functional imaging studies of cognitive control show progressive age-related increase in zzso zzso zzso in male development from childhood to zzso Little is known, however, about how gender affects this functional zzso In this study, we used event related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine effects of sex, age, and their interaction on brain zzso during zzso switching and interference zzso in 63 male and female adolescents and adults, aged 13 to zzso Linear age correlations were observed across all subjects in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gender analysis revealed increased zzso in females relative to males in zzso areas during the zzso task, and zzso effects in the Simon task, with females showing increased left inferior prefrontal and zzso zzso and males showing increased right inferior prefrontal and zzso zzso Increased prefrontal zzso clusters in females and increased zzso zzso clusters in males zzso overlapped with clusters that were zzso across the whole group, potentially reflecting more mature prefrontal brain zzso patterns for zzso and more mature zzso zzso patterns for zzso Gender by age interactions further supported this zzso revealing exclusive zzso age correlations in inferior and zzso prefrontal brain regions during both tasks, and exclusive zzso age correlations in superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions (Simon zzso These findings show increased recruitment of zzso prefrontal zzso in zzso and of zzso zzso zzso in zzso during tasks of cognitive zzso Gender differences in frontal and zzso recruitment may thus be related to gender differences in the zzso maturation of these brain zzso
