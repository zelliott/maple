zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have provided evidence of widespread zzso loss and reductions of cerebral and spinal zzso volume in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso measures on zzso may be a useful surrogate marker of worsening disability in zzso but the published studies are of relatively short zzso Change in brain volume zzso was measured over a four-year period in 20 patients with zzso zzso and 18 with secondary progressive zzso zzso using three-dimensional zzso zzso acquired during treatment trials of zzso zzso Brain zzso and lateral zzso volume changes were determined and correlated with clinical zzso Over four years, brain zzso volume zzso decreased in zzso and zzso patients by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the lateral zzso volumes increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients both lateral zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso change zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were related to disability change, as measured by the Expanded zzso zzso zzso Even though a small study and despite the possible zzso effects of zzso treatment, this study demonstrated an association between measures of cerebral zzso and worsening zzso The data also provides evidence that brain zzso can be detected early in the disease course and central white matter zzso as reflected by zzso enlargement appears to be a continuous zzso
