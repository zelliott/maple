Our purpose was to investigate the zzso zzso zzso in various brain regions of zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso adult subjects were involved, 17 social drinkers as control subjects and 15 subjects who were zzso or recovering zzso zzso psychiatric diseases were ruled out based on zzso zzso The majority of subjects were zzso zzso binding in 11 brain areas was expressed as the total distribution volume zzso distribution volume of specific binding zzso and distribution volume ratio zzso The zzso was used as reference tissue for calculation of zzso and zzso 

In subjects with a history of alcoholism, zzso was lower in all brain regions, with significant differences in the zzso thalamus, amygdala, zzso zzso zzso frontal cortex, and zzso Additionally, zzso was lower in all brain regions, but differences were only significant in the zzso zzso was lower in nine regions but the differences did not reach statistical zzso 

These studies demonstrate lower binding of zzso to the zzso in the brain of zzso or recovering zzso compared with control zzso zzso in the zzso distribution volumes are more significant before than after correction for zzso binding of the zzso
