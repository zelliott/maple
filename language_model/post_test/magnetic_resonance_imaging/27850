zzso zzso occurs in zzso conditions, such as cancer, zzso heart disease and stroke when oxygen demand is greater than oxygen zzso An imaging method that can differentiate hypoxic versus zzso tissue could have an immediate impact on therapy zzso In this work, the zzso complex of zzso acid zzso with a zzso attached to one zzso group via an zzso linkage was prepared, characterized and tested as a zzso zzso zzso A control complex, zzso was also prepared in order to test whether the zzso zzso alters either the water zzso zzso zzso or the zzso stability of the zzso The zzso of these complexes were lower than that of zzso as expected for zzso zzso The water zzso zzso zzso zzso bound water residence lifetime zzso and zzso correlation time zzso of both complexes was determined by zzso zzso variable temperature zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic relaxation zzso zzso zzso The resulting parameters zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determined for the zzso zzso closely parallel to those of other zzso complexes of similar molecular zzso In zzso MR imaging experiments with zzso rat zzso cells maintained under nitrogen zzso versus oxygen zzso gas showed that both agents enter cells but only the zzso zzso was trapped in cells maintained under zzso as evidenced by an approximately twofold decrease in zzso measured for hypoxic cells versus zzso cells exposed to this zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso might serve as a molecular reporter for discriminating hypoxic versus zzso zzso by zzso
