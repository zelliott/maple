The goals of this study were to investigate zzso whether the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cerebral white matter are changed in patients with symptomatic zzso of the internal carotid artery zzso and zzso whether possible changes in zzso concentration are related to regional cerebral zzso or cerebral zzso 

In 19 patients zzso age, zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso were measured with zzso MR zzso imaging on average zzso months after symptoms zzso In selected zzso corresponding cerebral blood flow and volume, mean transit time, and zzso peak were determined with dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso CO2 zzso was determined with zzso zzso zzso 

No significant changes in zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso concentration was significantly reduced in the zzso on the side of the symptomatic zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and control subjects zzso zzso zzso Although no significant zzso difference in zzso concentration was found in patients who presented with retinal zzso patients with cerebral zzso had a significantly lower zzso concentration in the symptomatic zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In all patients, zzso concentration was not significantly correlated with quantitative cerebral zzso parameters or CO2 zzso 

Patients with symptomatic zzso zzso may show chronic zzso damage in cerebral white matter as evidenced by reduced zzso zzso This seems to be related to previous zzso rather than to the cerebral zzso status in a chronic zzso
