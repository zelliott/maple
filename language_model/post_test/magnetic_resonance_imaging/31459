Local drug delivery has recently attracted much attention since it represents a strategy to increase the drug concentration at the target location and decrease systemic toxicity zzso zzso can be used in different ways to trigger regional drug zzso It can cause the local drug release from a carrier vehicle and the local increase of cell membrane zzso either by a mechanical action or by a temperature zzso zzso contrast agents may enhance these effects by means of zzso zzso can be focused deep inside the body into a small region with dimensions on the order of 1 zzso Several types of drug zzso have been proposed, from zzso to zzso sized zzso The objective of real-time imaging of local drug delivery is to assure that the delivery takes place in the target region, that the drug concentration and the resulting zzso reaction are zzso and to intervene if zzso zzso and nuclear imaging techniques play an important zzso zzso is rather insensitive but allows precise targeting of zzso zzso can provide real-time temperature zzso and gives access to a variety of imaging zzso that may be used to assess drug zzso Examples from recent articles illustrate the potential of the principles of zzso local drug zzso
