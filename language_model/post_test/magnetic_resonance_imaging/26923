zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease zzso More advanced stages are accompanied by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are intimately linked to cerebrovascular pathology zzso with zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso study zzso zzso in zzso precursor protein transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso were detected in cortical and zzso brain regions of aged zzso zzso Their strength and number was considerably enhanced by intravenous administration of iron oxide zzso which are taken up by zzso through zzso zzso 24 h before image zzso The number of cortical sites displaying signal zzso increased with zzso zzso at these sites demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso blood zzso A fraction of the sites additionally showed thickened vessel walls and zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso detected a much smaller number of attenuated signal sites in zzso mice, for which a strong zzso zzso caused a shift toward zzso zzso thus reducing vascular zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso and zzso mice, which develop significantly less zzso and zzso pathology than zzso In a zzso study, we zzso demonstrated the reinforced formation of zzso pathology during passive zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso of signal zzso reflected an increase in zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso has the sensitivity to zzso monitor the development of vascular pathology and its possible enhancement by zzso zzso zzso in transgenic mice modeling zzso
