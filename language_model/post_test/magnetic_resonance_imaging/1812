To assess by zzso using a pelvic phased array zzso the accuracy for staging prostate zzso and to correlate the results with the rate of positive surgical zzso 

Between January 1995 and December 1999, 176 patients with localized prostate zzso underwent a zzso zzso examination using a pelvic zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso and zzso results were compared in a prospective zzso 

131 were classified zzso and 45 were classified zzso at zzso zzso findings showed 103 zzso and 73 zzso The accuracy of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso The risk for a patient zzso zzso or zzso at zzso to have a positive surgical margin was respectively zzso and zzso 

This study shows that the zzso zzso has a low sensitivity but a good specificity to distinguish between zzso cancer or zzso It shows that the risk of positive surgical margins is higher for zzso zzso at zzso The low sensitivity should be improved by using a zzso zzso phased zzso
