This study is a case report demonstrating a rare clinical presentation of zzso artery zzso We believe that this is the first reported case with zzso combined zzso zzso We have also included a literature zzso 

The purpose of this report is to inform the reader of a unique clinical presentation and to draw attention to some of the rare features of zzso zzso artery zzso We believe that this condition is perhaps underrecognized and this paper may help to increase zzso thereby encouraging prompt investigation, diagnosis, and implementing early zzso The literature review also includes a brief zzso and zzso description of the underlying zzso zzso 

Only a small number of similar cases are described in the literature, though most describe a motor deficit at a single root zzso Our case included both motor and sensory deficits at more than 1 level and we describe the possible zzso and zzso reasons for zzso 

The case described is one that presented to our institution and was initially assessed by the first zzso zzso The literature review is based on articles identified from a zzso search on zzso artery zzso 

The clinical and zzso findings are discussed in the case zzso 

zzso motor deficits are a rare clinical presentation of spontaneous zzso artery dissection and tend to affect a solitary root level, typically zzso zzso is usually zzso We describe a case presenting with zzso combined zzso zzso which we believe has not previously been zzso
