It is well established that the optimal unbiased way to combine image data from array coils is a zzso sum of zzso signals, with each signal weighted by the individual zzso sensitivity at the location of the zzso A pragmatic alternative combines the images from the coils as the square root of the sum of squares zzso which can reduce the zzso ratio zzso and introduce zzso This work describes how to replace zzso sensitivity by an zzso quantity that enables close to optimal signal combination up to a global intensity zzso Typical zzso is by an individual zzso sensitivity or a linear or zzso combination of the sensitivities of some or all of the coils in the zzso The method decreases signal bias, improves zzso when coils have unequal noise levels, and can reduce image zzso It can produce zzso data, which eliminates bias zzso In addition, the method allows images from zzso that include highly localized zzso such as a prostate zzso and external pelvic zzso to be combined with zzso zzso and an intensity zzso that makes them easier to zzso
