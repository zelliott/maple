In order to compare the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso study, in children with zzso zzso with and without zzso I zzso zzso both brain magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were zzso 

Brain MR images were retrieved from the Helsinki University Hospital Picture zzso and Communications System to identify patients with zzso during zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls were retrieved from the same zzso zzso analysis of zzso was carried zzso 

Seven patients with zzso zzso with zzso were zzso In zzso patients, the absolute zzso length was zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso area was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and controls, zzso In zzso patients, the relative zzso length of the zzso was, on average, 91 % of the zzso zzso On average, the zzso was 95 % and the zzso area was 88 % of the zzso zzso 

In pediatric zzso zzso patients, a statistically significant reduced zzso diameter of the zzso is found in patients with an adjacent zzso as compared to their zzso zzso and zzso controls of zzso
