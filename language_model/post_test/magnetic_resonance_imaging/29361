Because the processing capacity of the visual system is zzso selective attention to one part of the visual field comes at the cost of zzso other zzso In this paper, we review evidence from zzso studies in monkeys and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies in humans for neural competition and how competition is biased by zzso We suggest that, at the neural level, an important consequence of attention is to enhance the influence of zzso relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant ones, providing a mechanism for the filtering of distracting information in cluttered visual zzso zzso evidence suggests that processing outside the focus of attention is attenuated and may be even eliminated under some zzso A major exception to the critical role of attention may be in the neural processing of zzso zzso which are reported to be processed automatically, zzso without zzso zzso to this prevailing view, in a recent study we found that all brain regions responding zzso to faces with emotional content, including the amygdala, did so only when sufficient resources were available to process those zzso After reviewing our findings, we discuss their zzso in particular zzso how emotional stimuli can bias competition for processing zzso zzso the source of the zzso signal for emotional zzso zzso how visual information reaches the zzso and finally zzso the relationship between attention and zzso
