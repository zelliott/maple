Because lower limb muscles differ in architecture and function, the systemic effects of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and related disuse may result in regional zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences between patients with COPD and healthy controls in three-dimensional shape and size zzso of individual thigh zzso 

Twenty patients with COPD and 20 healthy adults zzso zzso zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso After manual zzso of individual knee zzso and zzso muscles, the three-dimensional shape of each muscle was obtained using specialized zzso Eight shape zzso were zzso both globally (for the whole zzso and regionally (for portions of the zzso A zzso zzso test with a modified zzso correction was used to compare group zzso 

Compared to the thigh muscles of healthy subjects, zzso zzso and zzso showed the most shape abnormalities in the COPD group zzso zzso zzso Greater regional shape anomalies in the COPD group were found in the middle to zzso regions of all knee zzso muscles and the middle region of the zzso muscle, compared to those of the control group zzso zzso zzso In the COPD group, more shape abnormalities were found in the knee zzso than in the knee zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso distribution of zzso and size changes was found across knee zzso and zzso in patients with zzso Further research is required to investigate the underlying mechanisms of regional zzso abnormalities of the thigh muscles and the increased zzso of the knee zzso to zzso zzso anomalies in zzso
