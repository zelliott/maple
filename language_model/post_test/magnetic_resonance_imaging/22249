The guidance of minimally invasive procedures may become a very important future application of zzso The guidance of interventions requires images of the anatomy as well as the information of the position of invasive devices zzso This paper introduces continuous zzso zzso for the simultaneous acquisition of the zzso MR image and the position of one or more small zzso zzso which can be mounted on invasive devices such as zzso or biopsy zzso This approach allows the zzso tracking of an invasive device without any zzso of the overall acquisition zzso The extension to three-dimensional position tracking is zzso Phantom studies are presented demonstrating the capability of this technique for real-time automatic adjustment of the slice position to the current zzso position with a zzso resolution of 100 zzso zzso the zzso zzso position is depicted in the actually acquired MR image during continuous zzso
