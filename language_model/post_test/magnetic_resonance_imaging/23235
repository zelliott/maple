To report the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in athletic injuries of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessing the utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences with wrist zzso and zzso 

Sixteen patients (13 male, three zzso mean age zzso zzso with athletic injuries of the zzso zzso sustained between January 2003 and June 2009 were included in this retrospective zzso zzso and follow-up zzso wrist zzso were performed with zzso zzso and STIR sequences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences with wrist zzso and zzso Two zzso assessed the type of injury (A to zzso zzso zzso stability, associated zzso and rated pulse sequences using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were most valuable, compared with STIR zzso and zzso zzso Nine type A, one type B and six type C injuries were zzso There were trends towards diminution in size, signal intensity and enhancement of associated zzso on follow-up zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso sequences with wrist zzso and zzso are most valuable in assessing and follow-up athletic injuries of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso
