The case of an zzso old infant with zzso zzso zzso drained through the zzso air cells prompted an zzso study of the dimensions of this zzso Of the various approaches to the zzso zzso the zzso dissection has been the least zzso 

Twenty zzso bones were dissected to completely expose the zzso This required zzso zzso of zzso root and zzso air cells, and removal of the zzso zzso were taken from three sides of a triangle described by the zzso zzso zzso zzso facial nerve zzso and superior semicircular canal zzso Similar zzso were obtained from standard zzso computerized zzso zzso scans from a random series of 20 zzso 

Mean lengths of the sides of the triangle were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The superior zzso zzso air cells or zzso space was accessible through the zzso exposure in all zzso Mean lengths from the zzso CT images were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The authors conclude that the zzso approach may provide adequate access to the superior zzso zzso for drainage and biopsy in selected zzso
