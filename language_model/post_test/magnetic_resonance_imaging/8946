In experimental animal models and human autopsy studies, zzso zzso caused by zzso injury has been detected after coronary zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether detection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso is influenced by the presence of zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso zzso zzso rest zzso and late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso days after the onset of acute zzso zzso On zzso MR images, the signal intensity in relation to that of remote zzso was determined in the late zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine whether the presence of zzso obstruction influences the detection of zzso zzso 

The averaged signal intensity in the late zzso area without zzso obstruction was significantly higher than the signal intensity in remote normal zzso zzso signal intensity, zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In contrast, the signal intensity in the zzso obstruction area on zzso images was not significantly different from the signal intensity in remote zzso zzso signal intensity, zzso zzso zzso The percentages of late zzso segments with high signal intensity on zzso MR images were zzso zzso without zzso obstruction and zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

With zzso zzso zzso zzso can be reliably detected in zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso however, does not necessarily exhibit high signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso attention is required in interpretation of cardiac MR images of patients who have experienced acute zzso zzso and undergone zzso coronary zzso The findings on zzso MR images can be substantial zzso of the extent of acute zzso zzso
