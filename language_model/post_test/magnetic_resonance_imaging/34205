Using zzso magnetic resonance zzso we investigated cerebral metabolism and its zzso in zzso heart failure zzso and the effects of cardiac transplantation on these zzso 

Few data are available about cerebral metabolism in zzso 

Fifty patients with zzso zzso fraction zzso or zzso zzso and 20 healthy volunteers were included for this zzso Of the patients, 10 patients underwent heart zzso All subjects performed zzso bicycle exercise zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso was obtained from localized regions (8 to 10 zzso of zzso gray matter zzso and zzso white matter zzso Absolute levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

In zzso only zzso level was significantly lower in zzso than in control subjects, but in zzso all four zzso levels were decreased in zzso The zzso level was independently correlated with zzso time and duration of heart failure symptoms in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and with peak oxygen consumption and serum sodium concentration in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were improved after successful cardiac zzso 

This study shows that cerebral metabolism is zzso zzso in advanced zzso and it may serve as a potential marker of the disease zzso
