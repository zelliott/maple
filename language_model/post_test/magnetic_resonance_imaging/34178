The zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso Research zzso Guilford, zzso zzso gel has been shown to be a valuable dosimeter for determining three-dimensional zzso dose zzso Because the zzso relaxation rate zzso of the gel changes as a function of absorbed dose, MR scans of the zzso gel can be used to generate zzso dose zzso Previous work with the zzso however, has not relied on precise zzso of the measured dose zzso This has limited its quantitative use, as no precise correlation exists with the planned zzso This paper reports on a technique for providing this zzso thus providing a quality assurance tool that includes all of the steps of imaging, treatment planning, dose zzso and treatment zzso 

The zzso gel zzso was prepared and poured into zzso zzso zzso inner zzso A zzso head ring was attached to each zzso Three magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso compatible zzso markers were placed on the zzso thus defining the central zzso zzso A high-resolution CT scan was obtained of each zzso These images were transferred to a zzso zzso program, where treatment plans were zzso The gels were zzso using our systems for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The gels were MR zzso and a relative zzso dose map was created from an zzso map of these zzso The dose maps were transferred to an zzso program, and then fused to the zzso CT scan through a rigid body match of the zzso zzso zzso The fused dose maps were imported into the zzso system for quantitative comparison with the calculated treatment zzso 

zzso and measured zzso surfaces agreed to within 2 zzso at the worst points within the zzso dose zzso This agreement is excellent, considering that the zzso resolution of the zzso dose maps is zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso dose zzso were calculated on a zzso dose zzso All points within the dose distribution were well within the zzso set forth for commissioning and quality assurance of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the quantitative evaluation presented here tests the accuracy of the entire zzso and delivery process, including zzso frame zzso CT zzso zzso zzso dose zzso and radiation zzso 

zzso zzso gel zzso coupled with image correlation provides quantitative zzso of the accuracy of zzso dose zzso Such quantitative evaluation is imperative to ensure the high quality of the zzso dose zzso generated and delivered by zzso and other zzso zzso zzso
