zzso resonance imaging zzso is limited in many cases by long scan times and low spatial zzso Recent advances in zzso systems hardware allow very rapid imaging zzso such as zzso free zzso zzso which has repetition times zzso of zzso zzso The design of these rapid sequences demands zzso zzso zzso zzso to provide maximum zzso zzso and preserve spatial resolution and zzso while keeping zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso zzso for certain simple zzso However, certain problems, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso design with moment constraints, either may not have a solution or must be solved zzso We show that zzso zzso design is a zzso problem, for which very efficient solution methods zzso These methods can be applied to solve zzso design problems for zzso zzso design, spiral imaging, and zzso using either a constant slew rate or the more exact zzso zzso zzso Ultimately, these methods provide a zzso solution to many zzso and zzso zzso design problems in a sufficiently short time for interactive zzso
