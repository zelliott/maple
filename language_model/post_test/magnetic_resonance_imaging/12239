zzso resonance images were performed using a zzso recalled echo sequence with acquisition of images every 30 s in zzso rats before and after intravenous zzso injections of 100 zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso All three agents caused significant enhancement of the zzso cortex, and even greater enhancement of the zzso zzso showed an early peak at 11 s followed by a zzso as blood zzso fell, whereas zzso and zzso showed sustained tissue zzso The enhancement in each organ was equivalent for zzso and zzso which stay zzso but zzso less for zzso which enters the zzso zzso In addition zzso showed an initial enhancement of the zzso zzso but then a subsequent loss of zzso whereas zzso resulted in a greater enhancement of the zzso as compared to the zzso We conclude that zzso studies of local tissue response to MR indicators reflect tissue zzso parameters such as zzso blood volume, and concentrating ability in a zzso zzso
