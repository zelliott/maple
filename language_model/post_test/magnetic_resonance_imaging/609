In this zzso study, we used dynamic zzso modeling to characterize the abnormalities of effective connectivity of the zzso network in 61 patients with multiple sclerosis zzso compared with 74 zzso healthy zzso We also investigated the correlation of such abnormalities with findings derived from structural zzso In a zzso of subjects, diffusion zzso zzso zzso metrics of the corpus zzso and the left zzso tract zzso were also zzso zzso patients showed increased effective connectivity relative to controls between: zzso the left primary zzso and the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the left zzso and the supplementary motor areas zzso zzso the left secondary zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the right zzso and the zzso zzso the left zzso and the right zzso and zzso the right zzso and the zzso zzso patients had relatively reduced effective connectivity between the left zzso and the right zzso No interaction was found between disease group and zzso zzso of altered connectivity were zzso correlated with brain zzso zzso but moderately correlated with zzso zzso damage of the left zzso In conclusion, large zzso zzso studies of effective connectivity changes in diseased people are feasible and can facilitate studies with sample size large enough for robust zzso Increased effective connectivity in the patients for the simple motor task suggests local network zzso contributing to enhanced long-distance effective connectivity in zzso zzso This extends and zzso previous evidence that enhancement of effective connectivity may provide an important zzso mechanism in zzso
