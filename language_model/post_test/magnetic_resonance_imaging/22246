zzso zzso zzso strategies are useful in fast imaging but prone to blurring when reconstructed off zzso Field zzso or zzso variations, coupled with a long zzso time, are the major sources of this zzso Correction methods based on a zzso zzso information such as an acquired field map have been proposed in the zzso An alternative approach estimates the zzso varying zzso frequency from the data itself before applying a zzso In this latter approach there is a zzso between the extent of correction and the chance of increased artifact due to zzso zzso This paper introduces an improved zzso for field map zzso which is both faster and more robust than the existing zzso It uses a zzso zzso of the field map, starting from a coarse estimate both in frequency and space and proceeds towards higher zzso The new zzso is applied to phantom and in zzso images acquired with zzso and spiral sequences to give sharper zzso
