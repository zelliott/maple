zzso zzso zzso can be mapped using zzso zzso to provide a clinical insight into vascular health that can be used to diagnose cerebrovascular zzso zzso are a readily accessible method for producing the required zzso CO2 increases but their zzso into clinical studies is limited by concerns that patients will demonstrate highly variable performance of zzso zzso This study zzso the zzso of zzso zzso despite poor task performance, to determine if and how robust results could be achieved with zzso in zzso Twelve healthy volunteers were scanned at 3 zzso Six functional scans were acquired, each consisting of 6 zzso challenges zzso 15, or 20 s zzso zzso with periods of paced zzso These scans simulated the varying zzso consistency and ability levels that may occur in patient zzso Uniform ramps, zzso ramps, and zzso CO2 data were used as zzso in a general linear model in order to measure zzso at the zzso matter, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso measurement for each zzso zzso type and scale of interest across the variable task zzso The ramp zzso did not fully account for zzso in zzso performance and did not achieve acceptable zzso zzso in several regions zzso In contrast, the zzso CO2 zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso in the average zzso matter data, and resulted in acceptable zzso in all smaller regions tested zzso Further analysis of zzso zzso zzso across the brain zzso and zzso zzso supported the use of zzso CO2 data to extract robust zzso zzso zzso despite zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that the incorporation of zzso CO2 monitoring into scanning enables zzso zzso measurement of zzso that makes zzso challenges suitable for routine clinical zzso
