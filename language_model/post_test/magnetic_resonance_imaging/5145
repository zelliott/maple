zzso birth is a leading cause of cognitive impairment in childhood and is associated with cerebral gray and white matter zzso Using zzso image analysis, we tested the hypothesis that altered zzso development is an important component of zzso brain injury and is associated with other zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance images and zzso diffusion zzso images were acquired from 71 zzso infants at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso were combined for a zzso zzso survey of the effect of zzso on regional tissue volume and zzso zzso zzso was related to volume reduction in the thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso After controlling for zzso reduced zzso volume zzso lower cortical zzso decreased volume in frontal and zzso zzso including zzso and to a lesser extent, zzso and zzso zzso and reduced fractional zzso in the zzso tracts and corpus zzso In the thalamus, reduced volume was associated with increased zzso This demonstrates a significant effect of zzso on zzso development that is related to abnormalities in allied brain zzso This suggests that zzso delivery zzso specific aspects of cerebral development, such as the zzso zzso
