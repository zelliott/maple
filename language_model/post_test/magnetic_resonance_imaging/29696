To investigate the zzso basis underlying face zzso the activity of face zzso in the anterior superior zzso zzso zzso and the anterior inferior zzso zzso zzso of zzso monkeys was analyzed during their performance of a zzso zzso The face space was composed by the activities of face zzso during the zzso task, based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso the face space composed by the anterior zzso zzso represented facial views, whereas that composed by the anterior ITG zzso represented facial zzso The zzso correlation between the behavioral reaction time of the animal and the zzso of zzso zzso responses was also zzso The response zzso of some of the face zzso in the anterior ITG exhibited a significant correlation with the behavioral reaction time, whereas this correlation was not significant in the anterior zzso The correlation of the zzso of zzso zzso responses in the anterior ITG with the behavioral reaction time was not found to be attributed to the correlation between the response zzso and the magnitude of the zzso zzso The present results suggest that the anterior ITG is closely related to judgments of facial identity, and that the anterior zzso is closely related to analyses of incoming zzso zzso face identification in monkeys might involve interactions between the two zzso
