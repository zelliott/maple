To assess the prevalence and patterns of cardiac abnormalities as detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso in systemic sclerosis zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with zzso underwent cardiac zzso to determine zzso functional, zzso at rest and delayed enhancement zzso 

At least one zzso on cardiac zzso was observed in zzso patients zzso Increased zzso signal intensity in zzso was observed in 6 patients zzso thinning of left zzso zzso zzso in 15 patients zzso and zzso zzso in 10 patients zzso zzso and right zzso zzso ejection zzso were altered in 12 patients zzso and 11 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction was found in zzso patients zzso zzso kinetic abnormalities were found in zzso patients zzso and zzso delayed contrast enhancement was detected in zzso patients zzso No zzso defects at rest were zzso Patients with limited zzso had similar zzso abnormalities to patients with diffuse zzso Seven of 40 patients zzso without pulmonary zzso hypertension had RV zzso 

This study shows that zzso is a reliable and sensitive technique for diagnosing heart involvement in zzso and for zzso its mechanisms, including its zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso appears to provide additional information by zzso zzso zzso and zzso RV zzso appeared to be zzso for pulmonary zzso hypertension but could also reflect zzso involvement related to zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether cardiac zzso abnormalities have an impact on the prognosis and treatment zzso
