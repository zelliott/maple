The natural history of spinal zzso of the zzso zzso has not been well zzso Because of disappointing long-term results with early surgical treatment of zzso children with zzso we have followed a protocol of conservative management for these zzso The results are presented in this zzso 

Since 1994, all zzso children with zzso who were examined at zzso zzso Hospital were subject to a protocol of conservative zzso The records for those patients were zzso to determine the zzso and timing of neurological zzso The findings were compared with those for a previously reported historical cohort of zzso patients who underwent early surgery at our zzso 

zzso zzso children (35 girls and 18 zzso with zzso were zzso with conservative zzso During a mean follow-up period of zzso years zzso 12 zzso to 9 zzso 13 patients zzso exhibited neurological zzso At 9 years, the zzso risks of zzso as determined with the zzso method, were zzso for the conservatively treated patients and zzso for the surgically treated zzso With a Cox zzso model, there was no significant difference in the risks of neurological deterioration for patients who were treated conservatively and those who underwent early zzso 

The zzso and patterns of neurological deterioration seemed to be very similar, regardless of whether early surgery was zzso These results suggest that conservative treatment of zzso patients is a reasonable zzso A more definitive zzso study will be required to clarify the relative efficacy of early surgery for zzso among zzso zzso
