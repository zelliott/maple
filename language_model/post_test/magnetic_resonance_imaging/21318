The combination of deep brain stimulation zzso and functional zzso zzso is a powerful means of tracing brain zzso and testing the zzso effects of electrical stimulation on a zzso network in zzso The goal of this study was to trace zzso global zzso network zzso in a large animal model by monitoring the blood zzso zzso zzso response on zzso We conducted zzso in normal zzso zzso targeting the zzso nucleus zzso zzso and the zzso nucleus zzso the zzso analog of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso functional zzso map for group analysis and the application of general linear modeling across subjects, we found that both zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso network zzso In addition, we found zzso zzso zzso network zzso In each group the activated brain areas showed a distinctive correlation pattern forming a group of network zzso zzso suggest that the scope of zzso extends beyond an zzso effect and that it may have zzso effects not only on circuits that facilitate motor function but also on those involved in higher cognitive and emotional zzso Taken together, our results show that the zzso model for zzso zzso which zzso to human implanted zzso zzso zzso and human zzso may be a useful platform for zzso studies investigating the global zzso effects of zzso
