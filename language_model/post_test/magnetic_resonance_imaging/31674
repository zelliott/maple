During the rapid filling phase of the heart cycle, the internal volumes of the two zzso cavities approximately zzso while the zzso pressures rise typically only by an amount of less than 1 zzso Such a small pressure increase cannot be the sole driving mechanism for the large inflow of blood associated with zzso expansion during this zzso Instead, the rapid filling phase is to be interpreted as being zzso primarily by the heart zzso zzso from its contracted state, causing blood to be zzso rapidly into the zzso In order to study the role of this zzso elastic finite element zzso simulations of zzso expansion were performed, taking into account the large zzso occurring during this period and the effective zzso of the zzso due to zzso fluid zzso zzso a realistic three-dimensional geometry derived from magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of both human zzso was zzso To validate our zzso zzso the results were compared with published zzso relating to the rapid filling phase of the human left zzso Our study shows that, under normal zzso conditions, zzso aspiration plays a key role in the zzso filling zzso
