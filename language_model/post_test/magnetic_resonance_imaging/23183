The zzso space is currently investigated through zzso and ultrasound for surgical approach, whereas magnetic resonance imaging has been used to provide detailed zzso The aim of the present paper is to describe the zzso anatomy of the zzso canal through a review of its appearance in the different zzso zzso CT is able to zzso also the zzso and the content of the zzso canal, triangular in shape in the zzso images, being able to establish the measurement of the zzso area of the zzso zzso and of the canal zzso On the zzso CT scans, the zzso membrane appears as a zzso structure, between the zzso end of the zzso vertebra and the zzso tip of the zzso In magnetic resonance imaging, on zzso plane images, the zzso canal appears zzso due to the presence of the zzso The zzso zzso appears as a zzso band and its termination as zzso zzso de zzso in the context of the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso membrane appears as a zzso band between the zzso end of the zzso vertebra and the zzso tip of the zzso On ultrasound imaging, in the zzso zzso view, two zzso reversed zzso structures zzso to the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso between which there were two zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure on top is the zzso zzso The zzso structure at the bottom is the zzso surface of the zzso The zzso hiatus zzso to the zzso region observed between the two zzso zzso zzso
