To investigate the utility of five different standard measurement methods for determining image uniformity for partially parallel imaging zzso acquisitions in terms of consistency across a variety of pulse sequences and reconstruction zzso 

Images were produced with a phantom using a zzso head zzso zzso in a zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso Medical zzso zzso zzso Images produced using zzso fast spin zzso zzso zzso and balanced steady state free zzso pulse sequences were zzso Two different zzso reconstruction methods were investigated, generalized zzso partially parallel acquisition zzso zzso and modified zzso zzso with acceleration factors zzso of 2, 3, and zzso zzso images were acquired with zzso two-dimensional zzso imaging methods zzso Five measurement methods of zzso recommended by the American College of zzso zzso and the National zzso Manufacturers Association zzso were zzso The methods investigated were zzso an zzso method and a zzso zzso method for calculating the peak zzso zzso zzso a modification of a zzso method used to produce a gray scale uniformity map, zzso determining the zzso absolute average zzso zzso and zzso a zzso method that focused on 17 areas of the image to measure zzso Changes in uniformity as a function of reconstruction method at the same zzso were also zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso was used to determine whether zzso or reconstruction method had a greater influence on signal intensity uniformity zzso for partially parallel zzso 

Two of the methods studied had consistently negative slopes when signal intensity uniformity was plotted against zzso The results obtained comparing zzso against zzso found no consistent difference between zzso and zzso with regard to signal intensity zzso The results of the zzso zzso analysis suggest that zzso and pulse sequence type produce the largest influences on uniformity and zzso reconstruction method had relatively little zzso 

Two of the methods of measuring signal intensity zzso described by the zzso zzso standards, consistently indicated a decrease in uniformity with an increase in zzso Other methods investigated did not demonstrate consistent results for evaluating signal uniformity in MR images obtained by partially parallel zzso However, because the spatial distribution of noise affects zzso it is recommended that additional uniformity quality metrics be investigated for partially parallel MR zzso
