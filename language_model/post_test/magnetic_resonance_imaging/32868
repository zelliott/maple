We report updated results of magnetic resonance imaging guided partial prostate zzso and propose a definition of zzso failure following focal zzso 

From 1997 to 2007, zzso men with zzso prostate specific zzso less than 15 zzso zzso 3 + 4 or less prostate cancer received magnetic resonance imaging guided zzso in which only the peripheral zone was zzso To exclude benign prostate specific zzso increases due to zzso zzso we investigated the usefulness of defining prostate specific zzso failure as zzso zzso with prostate specific zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso per zzso Cox zzso was used to determine the factors associated with prostate specific zzso zzso 

Median followup was zzso years zzso zzso While 36 patients met the zzso zzso criteria, 16 of 17 biopsy proven local zzso were among the 26 men who also had a prostate specific zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso per year (16 of 26 vs 1 of 10, p zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso definition, prostate specific zzso zzso survival for low risk cases at 5 and 8 years was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This rate improved to zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso with prostate specific zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso per zzso For intermediate risk cases survival was zzso zzso at 5 years and zzso zzso at 8 years (the same values as using zzso zzso with prostate specific zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso per zzso 

zzso a prostate specific zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso per year in addition to zzso zzso appears to better predict clinical failure after therapies that target less than the whole zzso Further followup will determine whether magnetic resonance imaging guided zzso targeting the peripheral zone produces comparable cancer control to whole zzso treatment in men with low risk zzso However, at this time it does not appear adequate for men with even favorable intermediate risk zzso
