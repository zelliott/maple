zzso zzso at low field zzso zzso was carried out in the cervical spinal zzso of healthy volunteers in this study to examine the feasibility of detecting zzso density zzso accompanying zzso in the spinal zzso zzso were asked to grip both hands zzso providing zzso simulation for spinal zzso Over zzso subjects recruited had zzso localized at zzso spinal levels with discrete zzso detected in both the anterior and zzso horns of the cervical spinal cord, and the average fractional signal change was zzso The zzso T low magnetic field and the 24 zzso short TE used in this study diminished the zzso effect to a negligible level, thus the observed signal change was believed to be mainly attributable to zzso density increase during zzso zzso Our results suggested the existence of zzso zzso density change in the cervical spinal zzso
