The main objective of this study was to compare the heating patterns of chicken fingers deep-fried conventionally and using a zzso Two zzso internal temperature maps of fried chicken fingers with zzso geometry were measured post zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso was performed in a zzso oven at 365 W power level for zzso and zzso zzso after bringing the oil temperature to 180 zzso 1 degrees zzso zzso were also fried in a conventional zzso at 180 degrees C for 2 and 5 zzso for zzso Variations in internal temperature distribution increased zzso to zzso time in both zzso and conventional zzso Internal zzso equilibrium is reached in all samples after 13 zzso of holding zzso Internal structural changes, void formation, were also zzso in the zzso zzso formation did not significantly impact cooling zzso
