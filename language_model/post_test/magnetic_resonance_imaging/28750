Patients with focal zzso zzso zzso or frontal lobe zzso were examined on various measures of remote zzso zzso patients showed a severe impairment with a characteristic zzso zzso whereas two patients with focal zzso damage (and zzso zzso were virtually zzso on remote memory zzso Patients with frontal lobe pathology were severely impaired in the recall of autobiographical incidents and famous news zzso Patients with zzso lobe pathology showed severe impairment but a relatively zzso zzso zzso largely attributable to zzso encephalitis zzso From recognition and cued recall tasks, it is argued that there is an important retrieval component to the remote memory deficit across all the zzso zzso In general, the pattern of performance by the frontal lobe and zzso lobe groups was closely similar, and there was no evidence of any major zzso difference between zzso However, zzso comparisons across these groups indicated that the right zzso and frontal lobe regions may make a greater contribution to the retrieval of past episodic zzso and zzso zzso whereas the left zzso region is more closely involved in the zzso zzso of remote zzso
