Data from experiments in zzso monkeys as well as from invasive and zzso recordings in patients with Parkinson's disease suggest an abnormal synchronization of zzso activity in the generation of resting zzso in Parkinson's zzso In six patients with zzso idiopathic Parkinson's disease, we recorded simultaneously surface zzso zzso of hand muscles, and brain activity with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a recently developed analysis tool zzso Imaging of zzso zzso zzso we determined zzso and zzso zzso as well as the partial zzso between cerebral areas and muscle, and localized coherent sources within the individual zzso zzso The phase lag between the zzso and cerebral activity was determined by means of a zzso transform of both zzso After overnight withdrawal from medication, patients showed typical Parkinson's disease resting zzso zzso zzso This zzso was associated with strong zzso between the zzso of zzso muscles and activity in the zzso primary motor zzso zzso at zzso frequency but also at double zzso zzso Phase lags between zzso activity and zzso were between 15 and 25 zzso zzso activity zzso at single, but also at double zzso frequency, corresponding well to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, significant zzso was observed between zzso and zzso wall areas zzso motor area; zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at single zzso and, even stronger at double zzso zzso zzso of zzso between zzso activity and zzso as well as several brain areas revealed additional broad zzso around 20 zzso Power spectral analysis of activity in all central areas indicated the strongest frequency components at double zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and the calculation of phase shifts revealed a strong zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso activity and a direct zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso and the zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and PM show little evidence for direct zzso with the peripheral zzso but seem to be connected with the periphery via other cerebral areas zzso zzso In zzso our results demonstrate zzso zzso activity within a cerebral network, with abnormal zzso in a zzso loop and cortical motor zzso zzso zzso and sensory zzso zzso areas zzso to the zzso zzso The main frequency of zzso zzso zzso to double the zzso zzso
