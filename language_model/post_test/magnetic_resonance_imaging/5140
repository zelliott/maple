To better define the underlying brain network for the decoding of emotional zzso we recorded high-resolution brain scans during an implicit and explicit decoding task of angry and neutral zzso Several zzso in the right superior zzso zzso zzso and bilateral in the inferior frontal zzso zzso were sensitive to emotional zzso zzso processing of emotional zzso engaged regions in the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso whereas explicit processing relied more on mid zzso left zzso amygdala, and zzso anterior zzso zzso Furthermore, whereas some bilateral zzso regions and the zzso showed general sensitivity to zzso zzso features during implicit processing, activity in inferior frontal brain regions was insensitive to these zzso Together, the data suggest a differentiated zzso zzso and zzso network of brain regions, which varies with the levels of processing and shows a higher specificity during explicit decoding of emotional zzso
