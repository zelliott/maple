The anterior zzso zzso zzso and adjacent regions in the zzso wall have been implicated in zzso motor and cognitive zzso including zzso Our previous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have demonstrated zzso zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso during zzso electrical nerve stimulation zzso and variable patterns of cortical zzso with innocuous and noxious zzso stimuli in individual zzso The present study represents the companion paper to our recent study of zzso and zzso cortical zzso with the aim to use zzso to delineate the zzso in the zzso and surrounding regions of the zzso wall during application of innocuous and noxious zzso stimuli as well as during performance of a motor task in individual zzso Ten normal subjects were zzso on a conventional zzso T GE zzso zzso zzso images were obtained from zzso sections through each zzso centered at approximately 3-5 and 7-9 zzso from zzso Each subject was zzso during innocuous zzso zzso and noxious zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso and execution of a motor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were mostly confined to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the present results demonstrate zzso zzso in the zzso zzso some general zzso patterns were zzso zzso innocuous zzso zzso were located mainly in the anterior zzso zzso noxious zzso zzso were primarily located in the anterior zzso the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and the supplementary motor area zzso zzso zzso zzso were primarily located in the zzso and zzso portion of the zzso zzso These results indicate that specific spatial patterns of zzso exist within the zzso and surrounding regions of the zzso wall for innocuous and noxious zzso zzso and that noxious zzso and zzso zzso appear to be zzso within the zzso zzso we propose a segregation of the zzso into an anterior zzso zzso system and a zzso pain zzso
