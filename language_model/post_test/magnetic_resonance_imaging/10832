To evaluate the feasibility and the clinical benefits of retrospective digital image fusion zzso zzso CT and zzso 

In a prospective study, a total of 273 image zzso were performed and zzso The underlying image acquisitions zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed in a way appropriate for the respective clinical question and anatomical zzso Image fusion was executed with a software program developed during this zzso The results of the image fusion procedure were evaluated in terms of technical zzso clinical objective, and therapeutic zzso 

The most frequent combinations of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The clinical questions included following regions (more than one region per case zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neck zzso zzso zzso lung and zzso zzso zzso 24), abdomen zzso zzso zzso and pelvis zzso zzso zzso In zzso % of all cases zzso zzso zzso image fusion was technically zzso Image fusion was able to improve sensitivity and specificity of the single zzso or to add important diagnostic zzso Image fusion was problematic in cases of different body positions between the two imaging zzso or different positions of mobile zzso In zzso % of the cases, image fusion added clinically relevant information compared to the single zzso 

For clinical questions concerning liver, zzso zzso neck, or zzso image fusion is a reliable method suitable for routine clinical zzso zzso motion still limits its feasibility and routine use in other areas zzso zzso zzso
