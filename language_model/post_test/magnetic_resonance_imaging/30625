zzso pain typically combines superficial and deep zzso We wished to generate pain that resembled surgical pain, reliably and zzso in zzso 

We constructed a computer-controlled zzso device to apply pressure to the anterior zzso The zzso of the pain was tested by rating the pressure that caused pain rated 4-5 on a visual analogue scale zzso on days 0, 7, and 24 in 10 zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on pain tolerance in another set of volunteers zzso was used as an indirect measure of the reliability of pain zzso 

The pressure needed zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce pain rated 4-5 zzso did not vary, showing long-term zzso of the zzso When pressure was applied to cause increasing pain in volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased pain tolerance by zzso An approximate doubling of the dose zzso zzso zzso zzso increased pain tolerance significantly zzso The linear zzso zzso relationship shows that the device causes pain zzso and this can be reduced with zzso zzso 

This zzso device can apply pain reliably and zzso
