zzso resonance imaging zzso of the zzso is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing disease activity in patients with inflammatory zzso disease zzso We compared magnetic resonance zzso zzso with and without water enema to conventional zzso to evaluate the advantage of a water enema for zzso zzso of Crohn's disease zzso 

We zzso evaluated 50 patients with known zzso zzso with enema was performed in 23 cases, whereas 27 patients received an zzso without zzso All patients underwent conventional zzso We assessed the degree of inflammation in both zzso evaluating up to seven zzso segments in each zzso We compared zzso with and without zzso enema to each other and to conventional zzso 

zzso achieved a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, for detection of inflammation in the terminal zzso with enema and a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, without zzso Considering the zzso zzso with enema had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso while the examination without enema showed a sensitivity of 38% zzso zzso zzso with enema proved statistically superior to zzso without enema in detecting inflammation in the terminal zzso ascending zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with enema is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing inflammation in CD zzso Water enema is well tolerated and significantly improves detection of inflammation in the terminal zzso Water enema should therefore be included in zzso protocols for CD zzso
