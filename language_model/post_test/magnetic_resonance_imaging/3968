zzso acid zzso doped zzso gels have been used extensively to produce magnetic resonance imaging test zzso These materials are limited in their use in zzso operating at different zzso and zzso The aim of this paper is to show that the theories used to predict the relaxation times for zzso doped gels could be used for other zzso zzso gels with the aim of producing materials whose relaxation times can be theoretically determined but are less temperature and frequency zzso In the present work, various zzso gels were studied regarding their zzso zzso and zzso water zzso relaxation time zzso with temperature and zzso zzso zzso zzso doped zzso gels have a zzso relaxation time dependence with temperature of zzso zzso However an zzso doped gel has a temperature dependence of only zzso zzso zzso zzso doped zzso gels vary by zzso zzso over the frequency range zzso zzso to 80 zzso compared to zzso which varies zzso zzso over the same zzso These results show that it is possible to produce zzso doped zzso gels that have markedly reduced temperature and frequency zzso of their relaxation times, but are still predictable using existing zzso This would allow the direct comparison of the performance of zzso operating at different zzso and zzso
