The paper presents a zzso coding zzso for zzso medical images based upon zzso zzso with zzso basis function zzso By using the properties of the zzso product, the zzso of the network parameters and the zzso image reconstruction are efficiently done in zzso zzso time and zzso storage space, when applied to zzso images of size zzso zzso L zzso zzso A further reduction in processing time is accomplished by using sparse zzso zzso The salient features of the proposed coding method are that arbitrary zzso images can be progressively displayed without reconstruction of the whole zzso image; the first image reconstruction starts as soon as the first data transmission has been zzso no expanding procedure is required in zzso image zzso and the blocking effects are not apparent even in the zzso zzso Experimental results using two zzso zzso images, of size zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso and with zzso zzso levels, show that the coding performance is better than that of the zzso zzso coding by about zzso bits zzso at higher bit rates, and that the new zzso display method zzso the zzso zzso section image about six zzso times faster than the standard method that requires the whole zzso image zzso
