zzso and zzso changes in central nervous system induced by 14 zzso of vitamin A deprivation zzso were monitored and zzso in zzso In zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed at 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 zzso of each diet after weaning in the zzso 1) zzso zzso 2) control zzso zzso and 3) control group that consumed the diet ad zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After 14 zzso high-resolution magic angle spinning zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on small samples of cortex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso remained stable and cerebral volume zzso increased as a linear function of body weight in the ad zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso decreased from the onset of deprivation zzso zzso zzso zzso to reach zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 5, followed by a stopping of body weight gain from zzso zzso In zzso rats, the zzso decreased from zzso 5 and reached a value zzso lower than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso at zzso 14 and was correlated with zzso status zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso volume decreased beginning at zzso 9 and was zzso lower than that of the control group at zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso Compared with the control, zzso led to lower N zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and higher zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso changes comparable to those associated with neurodegenerative zzso By zzso 7 of zzso the slowing in cerebral growth that correlated with the zzso level could be considered as a zzso marker of brain disorders, confirmed by zzso data from zzso rats after 14 zzso
