The psychological zzso period zzso refers to the fact that humans typically cannot perform two tasks at zzso zzso experiments have led to the proposal that, in fact, peripheral zzso and motor stages continue to operate in zzso and that only a central decision stage zzso a serial zzso We tested this model using zzso methods combined with innovative zzso analysis zzso zzso performed a zzso zzso paradigm in which a delay of 300 zzso was injected into the auditory task either within or outside of the zzso interference zzso zzso zzso indicated that the first approximately 250 zzso of processing were insensitive to zzso zzso and that the zzso was mainly reflected in a delayed global zzso By a zzso analysis based on zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified networks with zzso different timing zzso sensory areas tracked the objective time of stimulus zzso a bilateral zzso network correlated with the zzso zzso and an extended bilateral network that included bilateral zzso zzso cortex, zzso cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior part of the zzso and zzso was shared by both tasks during the extent of zzso zzso The results provide zzso evidence for the coexistence of serial and parallel processes within a cognitive zzso
