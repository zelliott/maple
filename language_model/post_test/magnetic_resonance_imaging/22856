Conventional high-resolution zzso is capable of detecting zzso zzso plaques in both human zzso and animal models of zzso In this study we induced zzso zzso in zzso mice by placing a zzso zzso around the right carotid zzso The model was zzso with conventional zzso zzso and the thickened wall could not be distinguished from surrounding zzso We then tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for their ability to improve zzso zzso of induced zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the neck area of the mice was performed before and 15 zzso 45 zzso and 24 zzso after intravenous injection of either zzso zzso or zzso The collared vessel wall of mice that were injected with zzso showed a pronounced signal enhancement of approximately zzso immediately after injection, which was sustained largely until 24 zzso zzso In contrast, the vessel wall of all controls zzso carotid artery and animals injected with zzso did not show significant contrast enhancement at those time zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso in zzso mice can be effectively detected by zzso zzso upon injection of zzso zzso
