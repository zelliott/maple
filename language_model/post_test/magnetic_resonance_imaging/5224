To evaluate zzso factors for survival after zzso zzso zzso for new, progressive, or zzso brain zzso zzso after prior whole brain zzso zzso 

Patients treated between 1991 and 2007 with zzso zzso zzso for zzso after prior zzso were zzso zzso Potential zzso factors were analyzed overall and by primary site using zzso and zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso analysis, including age, zzso performance status zzso primary tumor control, zzso zzso number of zzso treated, total zzso target volume, and zzso from zzso to zzso 

A total of 310 patients were zzso including 90 breast, 113 zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso 42 melanoma, and 34 zzso zzso The median age was 56, zzso 80, number of zzso treated 3, and zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso had controlled primary tumor and zzso had zzso zzso The median survival was zzso months overall and zzso zzso zzso months for single zzso multiple zzso treated zzso zzso zzso There was no relationship between number of zzso and survival after excluding zzso zzso On zzso analysis, favorable zzso factors included age zzso smaller total target volume, and longer zzso from zzso to zzso in breast cancer zzso smaller number of zzso zzso zzso and controlled primary in zzso lung cancer zzso and smaller total target volume in melanoma zzso 

Among patients treated with salvage zzso for zzso after prior zzso zzso factors appeared to vary by primary zzso Although survival time was significantly longer for patients with a single zzso the median survival time of zzso months for patients with multiple zzso seems sufficiently long for salvage zzso to appear to be zzso and no evidence was found to support the use of a zzso for number of zzso appropriate for salvage zzso
