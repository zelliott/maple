Grey matter volume and cortical thickness represent two complementary aspects of brain zzso Several studies have described reductions in zzso matter volume in people at zzso risk zzso of zzso however, little is known about cortical thickness in this zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate cortical thickness zzso in zzso subjects and compare individuals who subsequently did and did not develop zzso 

We examined magnetic resonance imaging data collected at four different scanning zzso The zzso subjects were followed up for at least 2 zzso zzso to zzso 50 zzso subjects developed psychosis and 117 did zzso zzso thickness was examined in regions previously identified as sites of zzso zzso in zzso subjects, using zzso cortical zzso 

At baseline zzso subjects, compared with controls, showed reduced cortical thickness in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso error zzso There were no significant differences in cortical thickness between the zzso subjects who later developed psychosis and those who did zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso is characterized by zzso in the thickness of the zzso zzso zzso We did not find evidence that the later progression to psychosis was linked to additional zzso in cortical zzso although we cannot exclude the possibility that the study lacked sufficient power to detect such zzso
