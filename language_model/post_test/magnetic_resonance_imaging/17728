To assess the value of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the prediction of zzso extension zzso in patients with clinical zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso compared to digital zzso examination zzso 

A retrospective review of data for patients treated by radical zzso for zzso zzso was zzso Patients who underwent zzso in the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso extension zzso and seminal zzso invasion zzso were scored on the basis of MR zzso For data analysis, receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were zzso 

Overall, 70 consecutive patients were zzso Mean age was zzso zzso zzso years, and the mean zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso specimens confirmed zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso According to zzso 57 zzso patients were predicted correctly to have zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso or both was zzso 7 or zzso zzso The sensitivity, specificity and positive zzso and negative zzso values zzso of zzso were zzso 69, 93 and zzso The zzso index of zzso between zzso zzso stage and pathological stage was zzso zzso zzso zzso The performance of zzso for zzso staging was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso adds significant incremental value to the assessment of patients with zzso zzso Its ability to accurately predict and characterize pathological zzso status and its superiority to standard clinical variables zzso zzso confirm its usefulness in zzso zzso
