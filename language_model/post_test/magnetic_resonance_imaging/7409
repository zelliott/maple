zzso symptoms are common in the population and index risk for a range of severe zzso zzso We wished to investigate functional connectivity in a community sample of adolescents who reported psychotic symptoms (the extended psychosis zzso 

This study investigated intrinsic functional connectivity zzso during zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Following screening in schools, 11 zzso zzso youth with psychotic symptoms zzso zzso and 14 community controls participated in the zzso zzso regions of interest comprised brain regions previously shown to exhibit zzso zzso during zzso control in adolescents with psychotic zzso 

Relative to controls, adolescents with psychotic symptoms exhibited reduced zzso between regions supporting zzso zzso Specifically, they showed weaker zzso between the right inferior frontal zzso zzso and the cingulate, zzso and the zzso anterior zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso the psychotic symptoms group exhibited stronger zzso between the superior frontal zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The present findings are the first to reveal zzso functional connectivity in zzso networks in a community sample of adolescents with psychotic symptoms and suggest that disruption in integration between distributed neural networks zzso between zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso may be a key zzso feature of the extended psychosis zzso
