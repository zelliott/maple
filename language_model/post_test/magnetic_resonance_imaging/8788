This prospective study examined the value of serum zzso protein levels for detecting zzso brain damage following carotid zzso An zzso was used for zzso of zzso protein heavy chain zzso levels from patients undergoing zzso for symptomatic zzso zzso 17) and zzso high-grade internal carotid artery zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso brain imaging before and after the zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in patients with a symptomatic carotid artery zzso zzso zzso if compared to zzso patients zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, serum zzso levels were not related to signs of brain zzso on routine brain imaging zzso Our pilot data suggests that raised zzso serum levels in patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease may be a sensitive zzso for diffuse zzso damage to the zzso We conclude that zzso failed to qualify as a zzso for zzso brain injury in zzso and factors that may have compromised the validation of this zzso are discussed and need to be taken into account for the design of further zzso
