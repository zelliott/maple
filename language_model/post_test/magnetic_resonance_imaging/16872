In 1997, the zzso zzso was introduced, a guide designed for zzso to characterize zzso zzso with emphasis on zzso extensions and impact on adjacent zzso To our knowledge no previous evaluation of the zzso agreement of the zzso zzso has been zzso 

To evaluate the zzso agreement of the zzso zzso 

Sixty patients operated on for growth hormone producing zzso zzso at zzso University Hospital zzso had an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of them also had an zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean time between surgery and zzso zzso scans was 11 zzso Two observers evaluated all the zzso scans zzso The outcome of the evaluation is presented as the percentage of zzso in each of the evaluated directions and the degree of zzso for each of the directions zzso 

In zzso zzso of 360 zzso zzso both observers agreed zzso In 17 of the 60 zzso zzso scans, both observers made identical assessments according to the zzso zzso in all the six different directions of tumor zzso In 76 zzso the results differed between the zzso The difference was 1 grade (or less) in 69 zzso In 230 zzso of zzso zzso zzso the results were identical for both zzso In 18 of the 45 zzso zzso scans, both observers made the same assessments according to the zzso zzso in all the six different directions of tumor zzso In 40 zzso the results differed between the zzso The difference was 1 grade (or less) in all 40 zzso 

We found a relatively high zzso agreement both zzso and zzso supporting the usefulness and easy zzso of the zzso system for grading of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso
