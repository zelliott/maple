In an attempt to determine the visceral risk secondary to a direct zzso puncture of the upper zzso zzso the zzso relations of the upper pole of the kidney were studied by magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso was performed on 25 normal volunteers placed successively in the right and left prone zzso zzso The kidney axis and minimal distances from the zzso plane at the level of the upper and lower poles were zzso zzso and zzso simulated zzso approaches to the upper zzso zzso were compared in term of risk of damage to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso angle was statistically comparable for right and left zzso but the zzso zzso angle was significantly higher for right zzso zzso zzso zzso The minimal distance from the zzso plane was statistically comparable for the upper and lower zzso The lower pole was significantly deeper for left than right zzso zzso zzso zzso The visceral risk was statistically comparable for left and right zzso and was significantly higher in case of an approach in the axis of the upper zzso zzso or through the 10th zzso space compared to a puncture via the zzso space zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso puncture of the upper pole of the kidney above the 11th rib increases the risk of visceral zzso zzso zzso with the aid of CT scan or zzso of the risk of zzso zzso or zzso injury could be carried out in these zzso
