zzso zzso and zzso mapping zzso is an established technique to facilitate the zzso of near eloquent zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is increasingly used to aid in the zzso of zzso zzso Standard draping protocols in zzso zzso units make awake zzso challenging, and only two groups have previously reported combined zzso and zzso zzso 

We present an illustrative case describing a simple technique for combining awake zzso and zzso with zzso zzso A zzso platter is used to transfer the patient from the operating table to a transport zzso and into the adjacent zzso and still maintaining the patient's surgical zzso This system allows excess zzso to be removed, zzso awake zzso 

A zzso right-handed man presented with new onset zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated a large left zzso zzso The patient underwent an awake, left zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated a single critical area for speech in his inferior frontal zzso After an initial tumor zzso the scalp zzso was loosely zzso the wound was covered with additional drapes, and the excess surrounding zzso were zzso An zzso was zzso The zzso system was zzso and the patient was zzso Additional zzso was performed, allowing extensive removal of what proved to be an zzso zzso The patient tolerated this well without any new neurological zzso 

Standard protocols for positioning and draping in zzso zzso units make awake zzso zzso This straightforward technique for combined awake zzso and zzso may facilitate safe removal of large zzso in eloquent zzso
