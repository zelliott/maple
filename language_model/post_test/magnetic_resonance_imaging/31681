Manual zzso in limb zzso and zzso coordination have usually been attributed to differences in online processing capabilities between the left and the right cerebral zzso In the present zzso experiment, we examined in right zzso the brain areas involved in zzso coordination with either the left or the right zzso Although zzso and spatial accuracy was equal for zzso and right-hand movements, manual zzso were found in behavioral and zzso data, suggesting an zzso mode of control for left zzso right zzso zzso For left zzso zzso peak zzso and zzso completion occurred earlier than for the zzso movements, suggesting that there was more time needed for zzso on the zzso When using the right hand, there was more zzso in zzso zzso This might indicate a more intense visual processing or zzso of the target zzso When using the left hand, there was more zzso in zzso areas, frontal areas and zzso This might point toward more processing zzso zzso movements may be considered as more difficult than right-hand movements by right-handed zzso zzso and more zzso these findings might reflect a difference in attention or resources attributed to different aspects of the tasks because of the different functional zzso of both zzso zzso
