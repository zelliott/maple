zzso consecutive patients with displaced zzso neck fractures (12 Hawkins type II, 9 Hawkins type zzso were zzso evaluated with magnetic resonance zzso scans performed between 3 days and 12 months after zzso All patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation with titanium screws, except two who underwent fixation with stainless steel implants that were subsequently zzso All patients had plain zzso We classified the scans as zzso type A, no abnormal signal changes in the body of the zzso type B, signal changes in less than zzso of the zzso type C, signal changes in zzso to 50% of the zzso and type D, signal changes in greater than 50% of the zzso Plain zzso zzso correlated well with MR scans in patients with type D scans, but an inconsistent correlation was noted with lesser degrees of signal changes zzso zzso with the MR scans being more accurate in displaying the volume of avascular zzso zzso obtained less than 3 weeks after injury were not helpful in assessing for avascular zzso We found that high-quality MR images of the zzso were consistently obtained in the presence of titanium screws in contrast to images obtained with stainless steel zzso We use titanium screws in all zzso neck fracture zzso because they permit high-quality MR zzso We believe that further study of patients with Hawkins type III fractures and Hawkins type II fractures with zzso zzso evidence of avascular necrosis is warranted to try to identify those patients at risk for collapse and perhaps to guide zzso zzso
