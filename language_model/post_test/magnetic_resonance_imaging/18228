zzso of brain function between children and adults with zzso provides an understanding of the effects of the disorder and associated zzso differences on language zzso zzso imaging zzso magnetic resonance zzso was used to examine brain zzso and cortical synchronization during the processing of literal and ironic texts in 15 children with zzso 14 children with typical development, 13 adults with zzso and 12 adult zzso Both the children and adults with zzso had lower functional connectivity zzso of brain activity among activated zzso than their age and ability comparison group in the left zzso language network during irony processing, and neither zzso group had an increase in functional connectivity in response to increased task zzso zzso differences for the literal and irony conditions occurred in key zzso regions zzso middle zzso left zzso zzso left zzso zzso left zzso zzso and right middle zzso The children and adults with zzso differed from each other in the use of some brain regions during the irony task, with the adults with zzso having zzso levels similar to those of the control zzso Overall, the children and adults with zzso differed from the adult and child controls in zzso the degree of network zzso zzso the distribution of the workload among member zzso and zzso the dynamic recruitment of regions in response to text zzso Moreover, the differences between the two zzso age groups may be indicative of positive changes in the neural function related to language processing associated with maturation and/or educational zzso
