To assess the technical feasibility and the clinical results of cerebral protection with the zzso zzso zzso system during carotid artery zzso zzso for high-grade zzso 

In 20 patients 20 zzso of the internal carotid artery were treated with zzso zzso In all patients zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain was performed before and 24 zzso after the zzso 

The filter device was effectively employed during all steps of the procedure in 16 of 20 patients, in two only zzso could be protected, and in two no protection was zzso After three of the 20 procedures new zzso cerebral zzso were zzso by zzso No new permanent zzso deficits zzso 

zzso protection with the filter device is technically feasible in most zzso zzso demonstrated new cerebral zzso indicating the occurrence of cerebral zzso during the protected zzso Further investigations are necessary to determine whether the use of the cerebral protection device will improve the results of zzso
