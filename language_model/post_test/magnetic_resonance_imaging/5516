To determine the value of MR zzso zzso in the zzso and characterization of primary zzso tumors of the small zzso and to describe typical imaging zzso 

Twenty patients with suspicion of primary small zzso zzso tumors zzso were recruited to undergo zzso following zzso zzso and small zzso filling with zzso zzso of zzso zzso solution under MR zzso zzso zzso was performed on a zzso T MR scanner including zzso zzso zzso and contrast enhanced zzso zzso sequences with fat zzso Fifteen patients, who subsequently had surgery for zzso of their zzso were zzso included in the zzso All zzso were analyzed as for the presence, location, number, size, zzso and zzso appearance of the zzso by two board certified zzso in zzso The zzso of the tumors was rated for each sequence type zzso according to a 4-point rating zzso Signal intensity zzso were performed in tumor and zzso The presence of zzso reaction, vascular involvement and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso 

zzso were correctly identified and localized in zzso zzso Due to their zzso tumors was best detected on zzso zzso fat saturated zzso zzso zzso was clearly inferior with the tumors being either zzso or zzso to zzso zzso appeared as zzso zzso masses in zzso of the cases, as focal wall zzso in zzso and in zzso with zzso Mean size was 25 zzso zzso with a tendency to smaller size for zzso zzso zzso failed to depict superficial zzso zzso spread in one zzso zzso reaction was observed in zzso of the cases with zzso masses exhibiting lower signal than the zzso due to zzso zzso 

zzso is a valuable method for the detection and zzso of primary zzso tumors, provided that appropriate zzso zzso is zzso Various characteristic zzso features could be identified which may contribute to characterize zzso and their zzso zzso
