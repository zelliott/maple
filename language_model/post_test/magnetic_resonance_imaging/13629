We combined repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the functional relevance of zzso zzso zzso during the performance of zzso zzso zzso provides information about local transient changes in zzso zzso during zzso or cognitive zzso Information on the functional relevance of this zzso was obtained by using zzso to induce temporary regional zzso We thereby turned the zzso zzso of brain activity into an independent variable controlled and manipulated by the zzso and investigated its effect on the performance of the cognitive tasks within a controlled experimental zzso We investigated cognitive tasks that were performed on the same visual material but differed in the demand on zzso zzso For the zzso tasks we found a selective enhancement of zzso signal in the superior zzso zzso zzso and a selective impairment of performance after zzso to this region in comparison to a control zzso We could thus show that the zzso zzso is functionally important for the execution of spatial zzso on visually presented material and that zzso as an experimental tool has the potential to interfere with higher cognitive functions such as zzso information zzso
