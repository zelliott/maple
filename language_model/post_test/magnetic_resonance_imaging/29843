In patients with alertness deficits due to right zzso vascular brain damage, training induced changes in the individual functional networks involved in intrinsic alertness were assessed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were trained by administering the alertness routine of the zzso computerized attention training or, in the control condition, by using a computerized training of verbal and zzso zzso Before and after the training, both a zzso and a zzso assessment were carried zzso In this paper, we are presenting four patients after alertness training: three, whose alertness performance improved significantly after training, and one, who did not zzso In the patients showing zzso improvement, the zzso zzso after training revealed partial zzso of the right zzso zzso functional network known to zzso intrinsic alertness in normal subjects, especially in the right zzso or zzso frontal zzso For the patient without zzso improvement, the PET zzso after training showed an increase of zzso only in the left zzso Out of the four patients in the memory training control group only one showed significant improvement of zzso Another patient had an increase of right frontal zzso after the training but this did not zzso to zzso zzso In a control group of six normal participants, repetition of the alertness zzso paradigm in zzso revealed a decrease of right frontal and zzso zzso from the first to a second measurement after 3 weeks, in contrast to the observed training induced effects in the zzso
