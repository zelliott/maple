In blind, zzso zzso showed robust zzso to zzso stimuli in many prior functional zzso zzso The cognitive processes represented by these zzso are not fully determined, although a verbal recognition memory role has been zzso In zzso blind and sighted (10 per group), we contrasted responses to a zzso zzso frequency retention task with zzso delays and a zzso zzso zzso both tasks involved the same zzso zzso The zzso paradigm required continuous updating for working memory zzso zzso in both groups confirmed roles in zzso for right zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso attention components of zzso zzso zzso zzso findings in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso suggested task performance without zzso In bilateral zzso cortex, blind showed comparable positive responses to both tasks, whereas zzso evoked large negative responses in zzso Greater zzso of attention resources in blind were suggested as causing larger responses in zzso and zzso attention systems, right zzso and persistent responses across delays between trials in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso responses in zzso and zzso areas showed zzso zzso matched to stimulation trial zzso The findings in zzso zzso of blind suggest that tactile zzso do not represent cognitive operations for zzso zzso zzso However, these data suggest a role in sensory processing for tactile information in blind that parallels a similar contribution for visual stimuli in zzso zzso of zzso
