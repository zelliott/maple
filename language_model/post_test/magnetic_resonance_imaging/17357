zzso infantile zzso is a rare World Health Organization zzso grade I tumor commonly arising in early infancy and usually presenting with both solid and zzso zzso We report a case of a large zzso zzso infantile zzso in which newly formed zzso in communication with lateral zzso contained highly zzso zzso zzso analysis of the fluid showed three proteins not normally found in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the tumor sample showed that the zzso infantile zzso produced a high concentration of zzso which probably accounts for most of the zzso to zzso increase in protein compared with normal zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso zzso by a brain zzso and ongoing studies on the mechanism might yield novel approaches to reducing zzso production and protein content in an otherwise stable solid zzso
