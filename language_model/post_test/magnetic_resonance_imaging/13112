Using a zzso method for rapidly calculating the zzso varying magnetic field zzso generated by a general zzso distribution, zzso maps of the zzso frequency variation in a structured zzso the human zzso and zzso structures have been simulated and compared with experimental data acquired at 7 zzso The results from the phantom indicate that the zzso method can generate an accurate estimate of the zzso frequency variation in a complex structure where the magnitude of zzso variation is similar to that in the human zzso zzso based on a zzso model of the human head show that zzso variation can give rise to sharp boundaries between zzso and white matter zzso The frequency difference in the simulated data was found to be significantly less than the volume zzso difference scaled by zzso zzso based on a simple model of the zzso zzso red zzso and surrounding white matter, made up of three homogeneous zzso showed patterns of field zzso that were very similar to those seen in experimental zzso These results indicate that care must be exercised in interpreting phase or zzso weighted images, since the simulations show that features such as rings and graded phase variation can easily be generated by simple homogeneous zzso The results also indicate that even after spatial zzso frequency variation can be projected outside of zzso zzso zzso analysis provides some insight into the conditions needed to ensure that the measured frequency zzso directly represents the anatomical zzso
