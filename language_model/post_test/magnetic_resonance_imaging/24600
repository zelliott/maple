We previously reported that zzso volume was associated with zzso but not lifetime zzso stress disorder zzso symptom zzso In the present study, we test the hypothesis that like the zzso the volumes of other brain regions previously implicated in zzso are also zzso related to zzso but not lifetime zzso symptom zzso One hundred zzso veterans underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a zzso zzso Seventy-five veterans were trauma zzso 43 were trauma exposed without zzso 39 were trauma exposed with current zzso and 34 were trauma exposed veterans with zzso zzso zzso amygdala, zzso and zzso anterior cingulate, zzso and corpus zzso volumes, zzso with zzso version zzso were analyzed by group using zzso analysis of zzso Veterans with zzso had smaller zzso zzso anterior cingulate, zzso and corpus zzso volumes than the zzso controls zzso smaller zzso zzso anterior cingulate, zzso zzso and marginally smaller corpus zzso zzso than veterans with zzso zzso and smaller zzso and zzso anterior zzso volumes than veterans without zzso zzso In contrast, there was no significant volume differences between veterans with zzso zzso compared to those without zzso or zzso zzso The finding that current but not lifetime zzso accounts for the volumes of multiple brain regions suggests that either smaller brain volume is a vulnerability factor that zzso recovery from zzso or that recovery from zzso is accompanied by a zzso restoration of brain zzso
