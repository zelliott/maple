zzso increases resulting in higher zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso sequences can be used to diagnose nerve zzso By comparing the signal zzso over time, zzso may become a new method for monitoring the healing zzso Muscle zzso is assessed by comparing the signal intensity of affected muscle with that of zzso zzso However, in severe zzso zzso the signal of zzso muscle may also be increased by wound zzso thus masking the effect of zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of wound zzso on muscle signal intensity in 29 consecutive patients examined on a zzso zzso scanner at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after severe zzso zzso The long-term course of wound zzso and the influence of wound distance were thus investigated using a standardized imaging, zzso and zzso zzso The signal zzso of zzso intrinsic hand muscles were measured in the affected and zzso zzso Muscle signal zzso were increased on the trauma side at 1 and 3 months zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso hand, no significant signal changes were zzso No relationship was found between wound distance and the severity of wound zzso This study shows that wound zzso influences muscle signal intensity comparisons in patients with zzso zzso When comparing zzso muscle with zzso muscle, an additional scan of the zzso side is indicated during the first 6 months after trauma to assess the extent of wound zzso After 6 months, the zzso side can be used for muscle signal intensity zzso
