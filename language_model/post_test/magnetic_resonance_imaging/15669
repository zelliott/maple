In this paper we report the preparation and characterization of zzso zzso layered double hydroxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transferred into zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso into zzso was confirmed by X-ray zzso for the new phase with the zzso spacing of zzso zzso and by zzso for the characteristic zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of the zzso was influenced by the extent of zzso zzso in which the zzso quality decreased as the zzso loading was zzso Compared with the zzso of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso sheets of zzso zzso the modified zzso zzso are zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a length of zzso zzso zzso was expected to have an increased water zzso magnetic resonance zzso due to the zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso that led to slower molecular zzso tumbling compared with free zzso in zzso Indeed, zzso suspension containing approximately zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately 16 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately 50 zzso zzso at room temperature and a magnetic field of 190 zzso which represents an enhancement four times zzso and 12 times zzso that of free zzso in solution under the same reaction zzso We have thus tailored zzso into a novel contrast agent with strong zzso promising for great potential applications in magnetic resonance zzso
