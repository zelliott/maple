Development of left zzso zzso zzso after acute zzso zzso zzso is a serious medical zzso We investigated the correlation of zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso using magnetic zzso tagging zzso derived zzso index zzso uniformity ratio estimate zzso zzso patients diagnosed with zzso zzso were zzso After treatment with primary zzso intervention, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to obtain a zzso image, a delayed enhancement image, and an zzso zzso zzso as a zzso index was calculated from the zzso image using zzso software zzso 0 to 1 zzso zzso to zzso After 6 months, follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess degree of zzso zzso Sixteen patients zzso had an increased zzso zzso volume zzso zzso compared with zzso The baseline zzso zzso index, zzso was significantly associated with zzso at 6 months zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso correlated with change in zzso zzso compared with baseline values zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was associated only with change in zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analysis for patients with zzso zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso 31) showed that this correlation was stronger zzso zzso p zzso zzso suggesting that zzso could predict progression of zzso zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso immediately after zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso index, zzso might be useful for prediction of zzso zzso in patients with zzso
