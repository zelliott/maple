zzso zzso differences in zzso twins who are zzso for zzso can help unravel the relative contributions of zzso and environment to this pervasive zzso zzso The authors used magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate several brain regions of interest in zzso twins who varied in degree of zzso zzso for narrowly defined zzso 

The subjects were 14 pairs of zzso twins between the ages of 5 and 14 years old and 14 singleton zzso and zzso typically developing comparison zzso The zzso twin group was a cohort of children with narrowly defined zzso deficits and their zzso who presented with varying levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired and zzso zzso obtained for the frontal zzso amygdala, and zzso and zzso of the prefrontal cortex, corpus zzso and zzso zzso 

No zzso differences were found between twin zzso Relative to typically developing comparison subjects, zzso prefrontal zzso volumes and anterior areas of the corpus zzso were significantly altered in zzso zzso and volumes of the zzso zzso were altered in both zzso twins and zzso zzso correlation analysis of brain volumes between children with zzso and their zzso indicated that the degree of zzso zzso zzso varied with brain zzso In the group of subjects with narrowly defined zzso only, zzso prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and zzso zzso volumes were significantly associated with the severity of zzso based on scores from the zzso zzso Observation zzso 

These findings support previous research demonstrating zzso in the prefrontal cortex, corpus zzso and zzso zzso in children with zzso and further suggest that zzso are associated with the severity of the zzso zzso zzso research involving twins who are zzso and zzso for zzso is essential to zzso the genetic and environmental contributions to zzso
