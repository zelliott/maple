The inability to observe the zzso irregular shape of the frozen region that develops during zzso has inhibited the application of this surgical technique to the treatment of tumors in the brain and deep in visceral zzso We used zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging to monitor the development of frozen zzso during zzso in the rabbit brain and the resulting zzso changes up to 4 zzso after zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso were acquired during freezing and zzso at a rate of 15 zzso Although the frozen region itself is invisible in MR images, its presence is distinguished easily from the surrounding zzso soft tissue because of the large contrast difference between frozen and zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso obtained after zzso suggest that zzso forms first at the margin of the region that was frozen zzso and then moves into the region's zzso zzso examination showed complete necrosis in the zzso and a sharp transition to undamaged tissue at the margin of the zzso and its zzso zzso barrier zzso damage was investigated using zzso The region of zzso in the zzso zzso images was zzso with the area of zzso damage in the zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso and both were distinguishable as areas of high signal relative to the surrounding normal zzso The results of these experiments indicate that MR can both effectively monitor the zzso freezing and zzso cycle and characterize the zzso changes in tissue during zzso
