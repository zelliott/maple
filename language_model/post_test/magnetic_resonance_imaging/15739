The neural mechanisms underlying feelings of fatigue are poorly zzso The primary purpose of the study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to determine the association between feelings of mental fatigue and blood oxygen level dependent zzso brain responses during a mentally fatiguing cognitive zzso zzso zzso controls and chronic fatigue syndrome zzso patients were included to determine the influence of chronic levels of fatigue on brain zzso We hypothesized that mental fatigue would be significantly related to brain activity during a fatiguing cognitive task but not during either a zzso motor zzso zzso or cognitive zzso zzso zzso Patients zzso and controls zzso completed a finger tapping task, a simple auditory monitoring task and a challenging working memory task, designed to induce mental fatigue, while undergoing zzso zzso was measured prior to scanning and following each task during zzso data zzso zzso showed that mental fatigue was significantly related to brain activity during the fatiguing cognitive task but not the finger tapping or simple auditory monitoring zzso zzso zzso or zzso positive relationships were found for zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso A significant zzso negative relationship was found for the left zzso zzso zzso zzso participants did not differ from controls for either finger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks, but exhibited significantly greater activity in several cortical and zzso regions during the fatiguing cognitive zzso Our results suggest an association between zzso feelings of mental fatigue and brain responses during fatiguing zzso
