The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso application of zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences in comparison with a zzso fast zzso zzso 

First, zzso zzso and fast zzso sequences were evaluated for blurring artifacts with a stationary phantom and for motion artifacts with a moving zzso which repeated constant or intermittent zzso motions at variable zzso Second, 30 consecutive patients with various zzso diseases were zzso examined with the three zzso zzso were classified into four groups according to size and signal intensity on fast zzso MR images as zzso large zzso small zzso small markedly zzso and zzso zzso Signal zzso of the zzso zzso and gray matter were compared with the signal intensity of white matter, and zzso ratios were zzso zzso image quality, zzso of zzso zzso of the junction between gray matter and white matter, zzso of the zzso and certain types of artifacts were evaluated zzso 

In the phantom study, the zzso sequence was least affected by motion artifacts and the fast zzso sequence was most affected although the images of the zzso sequence were most zzso by blurring zzso In the clinical study, we found no significant differences among the three sequences for zzso ratios or zzso of large zzso and small markedly zzso zzso However, the zzso ratios of zzso zzso and gray matter, and the zzso of zzso zzso were significantly poorer for the zzso sequence than for the fast zzso zzso The zzso ratios of small zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of small zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the junction between gray matter and white matter were significantly poorer for zzso and zzso sequences than for the fast zzso zzso zzso artifacts, which were observed during the zzso zzso were sometimes superimposed on the zzso 

The zzso and zzso sequences afford substantial time reduction and also decrease motion artifacts and thus have potential advantages for zzso application, especially in uncooperative or zzso zzso The zzso sequence may be preferable to the zzso sequence because of fewer blurring artifacts and higher zzso zzso However, small zzso and zzso zzso may be overlooked when zzso and zzso sequences are zzso
