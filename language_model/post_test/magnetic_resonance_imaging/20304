zzso cancer zzso patients receive zzso therapy zzso to reduce tumor zzso However, complete zzso of zzso is unusual, and zzso disease is evident within approximately 2 years in high-risk zzso Clinical evidence suggests that combining zzso with zzso improves local control and zzso survival in these patients compared with zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso of zzso zzso zzso changed after zzso and whether such therapy affected radiation zzso zzso zzso received combinations of zzso by zzso zzso and 15 zzso of zzso zzso At a shortest tumor diameter of 8 zzso zzso was zzso by dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging before radiation and 1 and 9 days after zzso zzso quantitative modeling of contrast enhancement zzso extracted the zzso zzso zzso reflecting a combination of zzso density, and blood zzso zzso volumes and zzso zzso zzso were monitored during the zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso tumors zzso days after zzso was zzso higher than zzso of zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors showed no significant changes in zzso after radiation, whereas zzso of zzso tumors at day 1 decreased compared with zzso values zzso zzso zzso before a continuous increase from day 1 to day 9 followed zzso zzso zzso Total zzso in blood correlated positively to tumor volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso demonstrated zzso reductions in zzso and tumor volumes, whereas zzso zzso showed increased zzso and growth zzso but no significant additive effect of zzso
