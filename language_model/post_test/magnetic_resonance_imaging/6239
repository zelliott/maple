The factors that determine the zzso increase in zzso of tissue water zzso were investigated for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso introduced zzso into zzso zzso was used in preference to other zzso zzso in part because of the distinct zzso profiles zzso field dependence of zzso of free zzso zzso their small zzso complexes, and their zzso zzso and in part because the relatively low toxicity of zzso is favorable for animal zzso zzso content of zzso was determined in all samples by zzso coupled plasma analyses the state of zzso in excised zzso was determined from the form of the zzso zzso profile of water zzso and distribution of contrast agent within tissue and access of water on a zzso time scale were determined by zzso analyses of zzso relaxation behavior in intact doped zzso as well as by the change of zzso relaxation rates and zzso signal intensity upon gentle disruption of the zzso zzso is found in all zzso except fat and skeletal muscle, but liver is most avid at low dose, and zzso accumulates in zzso after high zzso zzso targets zzso to liver and zzso zzso the liver chemically at relatively low zzso We suggest that pronounced increase in tissue zzso results from zzso bound zzso ostensibly associated with the polar head groups of cell zzso zzso of contrast agent and restricted diffusion of tissue water influences the maximum relaxation rates attainable, so that there is an optimal dose of these contrast agents which is rather zzso
