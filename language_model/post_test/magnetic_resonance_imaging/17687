Design and development of a new zzso as a unique assembly of distinct fluorescent reporters with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso magnetic resonance imaging agent into zzso and zzso stable zzso zzso are zzso Specifically, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso phase of the zzso and a zzso dye was introduced into the hydrocarbon zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a zzso zzso system where each oil phase, zzso and zzso are zzso labeled and formulated into an zzso and zzso stable zzso zzso each oil phase separately labeled by a fluorescent dye allows for improved correlation between in zzso imaging and zzso zzso Further, dual fluorescent labeling can improve zzso tracking of the zzso and help assess the fate of the zzso in biologically relevant zzso The zzso were produced by high zzso processing zzso and stabilized with zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso size distribution with average zzso size less than 200 zzso zzso demonstrate excellent zzso stability and only moderate changes in the zzso signal for both zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso exposed to zzso shows the presence of both zzso agents in the zzso
