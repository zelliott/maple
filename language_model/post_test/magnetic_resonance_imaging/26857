in zzso analysis in an immature zzso zzso 

to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso of an zzso flexible spinal zzso on growth zzso zzso as zzso creation, disc response, spinal motion, and screw fixation using zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso testing, and zzso 

spinal growth zzso using an zzso flexible zzso has been proposed as a zzso surgical zzso correction strategy for idiopathic zzso and has been successfully demonstrated in a zzso model to create spinal zzso while maintaining disc zzso 

twelve zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso construct over 4 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso N) was performed in alternate pigs zzso and zzso groups, zzso zzso 6 per zzso zzso were coated with zzso in half of the animals in each surgical zzso zzso zzso and monthly zzso were zzso comparing zzso creation, zzso body zzso and disc zzso between the zzso zzso body shape was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso resonance and zzso evaluated disc zzso zzso testing was performed to determine the effect of zzso the zzso on spinal motion and screw zzso 

zzso zzso produced immediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso disc zzso zzso zzso on zzso side, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso After 12 months, the groups were similar in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and disc zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no zzso evidence of screw zzso One of the discs from each group had diminished zzso signal after 12 months of zzso zzso zzso did not affect spinal zzso or zzso Interestingly, screw fixation increased with zzso however, there was no significant advantage with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso created immediate zzso without zzso ultimate zzso or disc zzso zzso Spinal motion and zzso were not altered by zzso however, zzso increased the zzso required for screw zzso
