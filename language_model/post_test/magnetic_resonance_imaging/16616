Personal zzso such as zzso and zzso require a zzso to continuously zzso their zzso relation to their zzso depending on who is saying the zzso This process, called zzso zzso may zzso the incorrect production of these zzso or zzso zzso such as referring to oneself with the zzso zzso which has been reported in children with zzso The underlying neural basis of zzso shifting, however, is not zzso nor has the processing of zzso been studied in adults with zzso The present study compared the brain zzso pattern and functional connectivity zzso of zzso across brain zzso of adults with zzso zzso and control participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a linguistic zzso task that required zzso zzso The results revealed significantly diminished frontal zzso anterior zzso to zzso zzso functional connectivity during zzso shifting in the zzso group, as well as reliably slower and less accurate zzso zzso A comparison of two types of zzso shifting revealed that the functional connectivity between the right anterior zzso and zzso was lower in zzso while answering a question that contained the zzso zzso zzso something about the zzso view, but not when answering a query about someone else's zzso In addition to the functional connectivity between the right anterior zzso and zzso being lower in zzso zzso in each region was zzso suggesting over reliance on individual regions as a potential compensation for the lower level of collaborative zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso shifting constitutes a challenge for adults with zzso zzso particularly when reference to one's self is involved, and that the functional collaboration of two critical zzso right anterior zzso and zzso may play a critical role for zzso shifting by supporting an attention shift between oneself and zzso
