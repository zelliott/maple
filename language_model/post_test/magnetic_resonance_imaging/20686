zzso knee zzso zzso is a common disease, and a significant cause of knee pain, however few data have examined zzso change at the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine factors affecting change in zzso cartilage over a longer time period than previously zzso 

zzso study of 77 subjects zzso zzso with knee zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso with a repeat zzso of the same knee obtained approximately zzso years zzso 

Annual change in zzso cartilage volume, and annual percentage change over zzso zzso 

After adjusting for age, zzso zzso and zzso bone volume at zzso cartilage change was observed at the rate of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso per zzso over zzso zzso zzso was lost at a higher rate in women compared to men after accounting for age, zzso or bone volume at baseline zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso Increased zzso bone volume was associated with increased zzso cartilage loss zzso No measures of zzso severity of disease affected change in cartilage zzso 

The increased rate of cartilage loss in women may contribute to the increased prevalence of disease, although the underlying mechanism requires further zzso Increased zzso bone volume was also associated with increased zzso cartilage zzso Whether this is due to zzso factors will need to be zzso
