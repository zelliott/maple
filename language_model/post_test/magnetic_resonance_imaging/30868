zzso resonance imaging zzso is an established zzso in clinical use but may be potentially zzso to zzso and investigate zzso As its use is totally zzso only for zzso devices, it was employed to zzso deployment, zzso healing, and zzso of a commercially available zzso device, namely the zzso zzso The quality of the observations coupled with the absence of zzso zzso are likely to make this technique an attractive imaging zzso in the zzso 

The potential benefits of the zzso technique were investigated in a GE zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso under different conditions: zzso zzso inserted in the delivery zzso as received from the manufacturer zzso 1), deployed in a mock zzso tube zzso zzso and as a pathological zzso harvested at the autopsy of a patient zzso zzso The device was submitted to zzso for examination in addition to zzso At step 3, the device was further investigated with light zzso and scanning electron zzso zzso together with X-ray zzso 

The device which was inserted and zzso in the delivery zzso did not demonstrate any significant observation either in zzso or in zzso When it was deployed in the mock zzso glass tube, light zzso were associated with the zzso weighed zzso images around the zzso whereas zzso gave images of zzso zzso Similar results were noted using the zzso zzso Very high contrasts were obtained with zzso whereas zzso images were almost zzso zzso The zzso allowed to accurate imaging of the zzso skeleton but were poor to discriminate between the different zzso zzso observations using light zzso were not really challenged, as the magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a zzso zzso 

The benefits of magnetic resonance imaging as a quality control technique to examine an zzso device within its zzso remains ill zzso Similarly, the role of conventional zzso is zzso The observation of devices fully deployed in a mock zzso zzso under zzso are potentially useful but zzso images allowed better zzso The zzso examination of the zzso device does permit observations related to the healing of the device that might be obtained in zzso and, thus offers new avenues for the follow-up of implanted zzso The pathological investigations brought additional zzso about the zzso and the zzso of the zzso However, it is unlikely that zzso will permit detailed analysis of the zzso and in particular the zzso process of the zzso 

These early observations of the follow-up of devices using zzso warrant further zzso The absence of zzso radiation with zzso makes this technique particularly zzso As there is no zzso of zzso radiation associated with magnetic zzso it is recommended that further investigation using this environment friendly technique for the follow-up of devices made of zzso that are zzso zzso
