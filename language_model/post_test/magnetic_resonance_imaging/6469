zzso spinal biopsy zzso is considered a safe and accurate zzso Our goal was to determine the accuracy of a zzso of zzso spinal zzso in patients with known or suspected underlying zzso in reference to major variables such as the zzso appearance of the zzso zzso and its location within the spinal zzso 

We zzso reviewed results of 410 consecutive zzso zzso procedures of zzso spinal zzso zzso was determined to be adequate if diagnostic tissue was obtained zzso zzso zzso or unsatisfactory zzso zzso 9) if only blood without cellular elements was present on final zzso zzso 

The level of spinal biopsy was cervical in nine patients zzso zzso in 123 zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in 96 zzso The overall diagnostic accuracy of zzso was zzso with a zzso rate of zzso zzso of zzso zzso yielded an accurate diagnosis in zzso zzso of zzso Despite technical challenges inherent to biopsy of sclerotic zzso diagnostic accuracy was zzso zzso of zzso although more importantly, zzso (20 of zzso of the results in sclerotic zzso were falsely zzso 

zzso of zzso spinal zzso is an important tool in the zzso of patients with known or suspected underlying zzso zzso However, a negative result must be confirmed with either close follow-up or, zzso open zzso especially in cases of sclerotic zzso for which diagnostic accuracy is decreased and the zzso rate is zzso
