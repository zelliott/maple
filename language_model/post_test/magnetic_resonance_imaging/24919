The primary visual zzso zzso is probably the best characterized area of zzso cortex, but whether this region contributes directly to conscious visual experience is zzso Early zzso and zzso studies found that visual awareness was best correlated with neural activity in zzso visual areas, but recent studies have found similarly powerful effects in zzso zzso and zzso studies have provided further evidence that zzso might be necessary for conscious zzso Whereas zzso models propose that damage to zzso simply zzso the flow of information to zzso areas that are crucial for zzso interactive models propose that zzso connections between zzso and higher areas form functional circuits that support zzso Further investigation into zzso and its interactions with higher areas might uncover fundamental aspects of the neural basis of visual zzso
