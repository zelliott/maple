We describe a zzso MR zzso imaging method that employs zzso preparation zzso zzso in conjunction with segmented zzso acquisition and zzso to produce images that, ideally, contain no signal from stationary zzso and display vessels with a signal intensity that is dependent on the zzso of the blood in the zzso The novel features of this method are a) it acquires several zzso zzso of a single zzso pulse, b) it uses zzso to eliminate signal that is not sufficiently suppressed by the zzso zzso and c) it uses zzso zzso that are synchronized with the cardiac cycle so it can be used to produce zzso images of zzso zzso An advantage of this sequence is that it detects a signal that, after preparation, is relatively unaffected by changes in blood zzso This leads to a large zzso ratio for all the zzso values, a reduction of zzso artifacts, and the ability to zzso blood that is in motion for only a short time during the cardiac zzso Because the signal is prepared during peak flow, zzso signal can be suppressed by making the sequence sensitive to high zzso An additional advantage of this sequence is that it permits sampling with a short TE because the zzso zzso can be applied in a zzso zzso Signal loss that results from zzso during the longer TE preparation zzso can be reduced or eliminated by allowing the zzso spins to flow out of the region of complex flow, and perhaps out of the zzso by introducing a delay between the finish of the zzso pulse and the beginning of data zzso
