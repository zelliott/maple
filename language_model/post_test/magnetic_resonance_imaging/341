zzso resonance imaging zzso investigations of breast cancer incorporate zzso intense techniques to develop zzso maps of zzso tissue zzso Common approaches zzso for example, quantitative zzso of T zzso the apparent diffusion zzso and kinetic modeling based on dynamic zzso zzso zzso In this paper, an integrated medical image zzso and archive system zzso is zzso zzso demonstrates how image zzso and user interface programs, written in the interactive data language zzso programming language with data storage provided by a Microsoft Access database, and the file system can reduce turnaround time for creating zzso zzso maps and provide additional organization for clinical zzso The results of developing the zzso are discussed including potential limitations of the use of zzso for the application framework and how the zzso design supports extension to other programming languages and imaging zzso We also show that network storage of images and zzso has a significant zzso zzso zzso increase in data retrieval time compared to zzso zzso The system shows promise for becoming both a robust research picture archival and communications system working with the standard hospital zzso and an image zzso environment that extends to other medical image zzso
