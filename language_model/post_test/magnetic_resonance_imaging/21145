zzso zzso effects on the zzso and zzso symptoms of Parkinson's disease zzso differ zzso leading to therapeutic challenges for managing the disabilities in this patient's zzso In this context, we studied the cerebral networks associated with the production of a unilateral hand movement, speech production, and a task combining both tasks in 12 individuals with zzso both off and on zzso zzso zzso hand movements in the off medication state zzso brain zzso in motor regions zzso motor cortex, supplementary motor area, zzso cortex, zzso as well as additional areas zzso cingulate, zzso zzso zzso zzso following L-dopa administration, the brain zzso profile was globally reduced, highlighting zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the speech production task, brain zzso patterns were similar with and without medication, including the zzso primary motor zzso zzso the primary zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso For the combined task off zzso the cerebral zzso profile was restricted to the right zzso zzso zzso reflecting the difficulty in performing two movements simultaneously in zzso Under zzso the brain zzso profile of the combined task involved a larger pattern, including additional zzso zzso without reaching the sum of the areas activated during the simple hand and speech tasks zzso Our results question both the role of the zzso zzso system in speech production and the zzso of zzso cerebral networks by zzso zzso
