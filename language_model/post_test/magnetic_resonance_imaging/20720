To determine zzso vaccination status of children with recent zzso deafness and to review our current approach for achieving early zzso in this special population that is at significant risk for cochlear zzso 

Review of imaging studies and test zzso 

zzso zzso children's zzso 

Five children ranging in age from 15 months to 10 years who experienced recent onset of profound bilateral zzso hearing loss due to zzso zzso 

All children underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging with zzso heavily zzso zzso free zzso zzso Four children underwent auditory zzso response zzso All underwent bilateral cochlear zzso 

Degree of zzso zzso using standard surgical zzso 

All children developed meningitis despite a history of zzso zzso Complete zzso zzso in both ears was zzso 

zzso vaccination has reduced but not eliminated childhood deafness secondary to zzso zzso zzso zzso response testing and zzso zzso free zzso imaging are zzso that zzso candidacy evaluation of this zzso Early bilateral simultaneous zzso increases the likelihood of zzso hearing and ensures zzso of the better ear in this population of children whose course is often complicated by formation of zzso tissue and zzso within the zzso
