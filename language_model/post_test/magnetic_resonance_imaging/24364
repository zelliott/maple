To develop a technique with clinical zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging to delineate local contrast agent distribution in coronary artery walls for potential molecular MR zzso local gene or drug therapy of zzso coronary artery zzso 

This animal protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and was in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory zzso For in zzso confirmation, human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso were used to determine capability of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its optimal zzso For ex zzso zzso a zzso mixture of zzso and zzso blue was locally infused into coronary artery walls of six zzso pig hearts with MR monitoring and an MR imaging zzso surface zzso or zzso For in zzso zzso the balloon zzso was placed into coronary arteries of seven living zzso and the zzso and zzso blue mixture was infused into zzso walls with MR zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso of coronary artery walls were recorded by using different coils between zzso and zzso infusion, with subsequent zzso zzso zzso Student zzso tests were used to compare average zzso and zzso of zzso walls before and after contrast agent infusion with different zzso 

zzso could take up zzso with the optimal concentration at 150 zzso Average zzso with the MR imaging zzso and surface zzso combination was significantly higher than that with the MR imaging zzso only or with surface coils only zzso zzso zzso and average zzso and zzso of zzso MR imaging was significantly higher than that of zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to confirm successful zzso zzso of zzso and zzso blue within coronary artery zzso 

MR imaging can be used to delineate locally infused contrast agent distribution in coronary artery zzso This establishes groundwork for development of molecular MR zzso zzso zzso
