The purpose is to define the origin of zzso of patients with degenerative zzso zzso and to assess the correlation between percentage of initial zzso leg pain relief with selective nerve root injections and lateral canal zzso 

zzso clinical zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso age zzso from Twin zzso zzso Center with degenerative zzso zzso zzso major curve zzso and zzso symptoms were zzso 

Patients underwent 46 selective steroid injections of nerve roots zzso with clinical zzso 

zzso zzso included major and zzso curve Cobb zzso zzso zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso included minimum zzso height and zzso zzso area of the nerve roots that were zzso zzso response from the nerve root injections was also zzso 

Twenty-five percent of nerve root symptoms were coming from the major curve, zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso from both zzso The affected nerve roots were more frequently the zzso zzso and zzso zzso nerve zzso A total of zzso of zzso symptoms were originating from the zzso of the curve and zzso from the zzso zzso The relief from injections was more than 50% in zzso of the patients at 15 days zzso There was no statistical significant correlation zzso between the lateral canal dimensions and the initial response to injection of zzso plus steroid zzso 

In degenerative zzso zzso curves, zzso symptoms are attributed mainly to nerve roots zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso No evidence was found that the rate of initial relief from selective nerve root injections zzso with the degree of zzso noted in the zzso
