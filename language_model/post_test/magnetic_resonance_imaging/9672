Both past depressive episodes and the personality trait of depressive zzso are strong risk factors for future zzso Depression is associated with abnormal emotional processing, which may be a zzso marker for vulnerability to zzso A consistent picture has yet to emerge as to how a history of depression and the tendency to zzso influence emotional zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso past depression and neural responses when processing face zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso was completed by 30 zzso zzso and 37 controls who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanning while viewing happy, sad, fearful and neutral zzso 

The zzso zzso showed overall reductions in neural responses to negative emotions relative to the zzso However, in the zzso zzso but not the controls, zzso scores were correlated with increased neural responses to negative emotions and decreased responses to happiness in zzso zzso 

Automatic emotion processing biases and zzso seem to be correlated to aspects of vulnerability to zzso However, zzso from depression may be maintained by a general suppression of zzso responsiveness to negative zzso
