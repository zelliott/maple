zzso brain zzso are quantitative traits showing considerable variation in human zzso zzso structural brain abnormalities are also repeatedly reported in patients with psychiatric disorders such as zzso zzso the genetic and environmental causes of these differences might therefore highlight biological mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and directly result in the identification of risk factors for zzso zzso estimates indicate a strong genetic component contributing to zzso zzso Brain structure volumes have substantial zzso rates ranging from high zzso for total brain volume, zzso gray and white matter, and corpus zzso to moderate zzso determined for the zzso the four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso horn volume, brain zzso white matter zzso and zzso zzso zzso Middle structures of the brain show high zzso scores for the deeper structures zzso earlier zzso and moderate zzso scores for the surface zzso zzso formed earlier in development show consistently higher zzso rates than brain structures formed later in development, for example, surface structures, which seem to be influenced by environmental zzso Even higher zzso reaching zzso for total brain volume are estimated in nonhuman zzso zzso models employing zzso extended pedigree and highly uniform rearing conditions, reducing the effects of environmental zzso zzso highly zzso structural brain zzso may serve as an zzso for gene mapping studies and lead to identification of genes that are involved in the regulation of human brain volume and the biological mechanisms involved in the zzso mechanisms of psychiatric zzso
