The zzso effects of zzso closure therapy in cardiac surgery are zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso cardiac output and left zzso chamber volumes after zzso closure using magnetic resonance imaging, which is known to be the most accurate method for zzso these zzso 

Six pigs had median zzso followed by zzso closure treatment in the presence and absence of a zzso zzso interface zzso zzso output and stroke volume were examined using magnetic resonance imaging flow zzso zzso and zzso Chamber volumes were assessed using zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso output and stroke volume decreased immediately after application of negative pressures of 75, zzso and 175 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in cardiac zzso zzso of 4 layers of zzso zzso dressing over the heart during zzso closure therapy resulted in a smaller decrease in cardiac output zzso zzso zzso 

zzso closure therapy results in an immediate decrease in cardiac zzso although to a lesser extent than shown zzso Covering the heart with a wound interface dressing zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso
