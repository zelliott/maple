To compare use of zzso T magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso joint zzso and zzso zzso in zzso induced canine stifle zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso 

Dogs zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast spin echo with fat zzso were performed at baseline zzso and at week 4 zzso week 8 zzso and week 26 zzso after zzso cruciate ligament zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and joint zzso were scored on zzso and zzso and zzso zzso on zzso 

zzso was more sensitive than zzso for detection of zzso and could better discriminate joint zzso from soft tissue zzso although scores for these variables strongly correlated between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Scores for zzso bone sclerosis also correlated zzso zzso although this variable may have been over interpreted on zzso Joint zzso and zzso zzso peaked at week 8, before partially zzso at week zzso zzso zzso and sclerosis progressed zzso over 26 zzso 

zzso is more sensitive than zzso in assessing onset and progression of zzso in canine experimental stifle zzso and provides enhanced discrimination between joint zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is as a more powerful imaging zzso that should be increasingly used in animals to assess the joint related effects of zzso zzso zzso
