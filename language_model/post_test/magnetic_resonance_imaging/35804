The results of selective magnetic resonance imaging of the knee were compared with those of zzso in a prospective series of fifty zzso A specifically designed protocol for imaging, producing zzso zzso images zzso at four zzso while the patient's foot was in 20 degrees of external zzso was zzso This technique, called selective magnetic resonance imaging, yielded excellent zzso of the zzso cruciate zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso in all zzso However, in only 76 per cent of the patients was the anterior cruciate ligament well zzso Compared with zzso the sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of selective magnetic resonance imaging were, respectively, zzso 100, and 98 per cent for tears of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 90 per cent for tears of the lateral zzso zzso 100, and 100 per cent for tears of the zzso cruciate zzso and 100, zzso and zzso per cent for tears of the anterior cruciate zzso when that ligament was well zzso Our selective sequence can be performed in zzso minutes at a cost that is comparable with that of zzso It is totally zzso and requires no exposure to zzso zzso Selective magnetic resonance imaging can be a safe and valuable adjunct to the clinical evaluation of the knee and an aid to efficient zzso zzso
