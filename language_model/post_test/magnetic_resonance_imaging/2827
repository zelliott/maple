The objective of this study was to correlate findings on conventional MR imaging and MR zzso of the hip with zzso findings in zzso with abnormal zzso to determine zzso the efficacy of MR imaging in assessing zzso zzso zzso whether zzso of the zzso from the joint capsule is possible, and zzso if the zzso of surface abnormalities of the zzso is improved by administering zzso contrast zzso 

Twelve zzso hip zzso were obtained from elderly zzso Each hip was examined using zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso acquisition in the steady zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso imaging before and after zzso injection of contrast zzso zzso zzso sections (three from each hip zzso were evaluated zzso to determine the zzso relationship, the presence of zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso These findings were correlated with the results of a blinded MR evaluation of these zzso 

zzso of the zzso from the adjacent joint capsule was possible on zzso and zzso MR zzso images zzso of 36 and 33 of 36 zzso respectively), but was not consistently possible on standard zzso and zzso MR images (7 of 36 and 4 of 36 zzso zzso The sensitivities and zzso of the various MR sequences in evaluating zzso zzso varied from 50% to zzso and from zzso to zzso Increased signal at the base was common in both the normal zzso zzso zzso and the abnormal zzso zzso 24) zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso complex is enhanced with the zzso administration of contrast zzso Although MR zzso did not improve our specificity for diagnosing zzso zzso the detection of surface zzso particularly those near the base, was significantly zzso
