zzso zzso are focal deposits of zzso that can be zzso with zzso Little is known on their prevalence in the general population and on their zzso It has been suggested that, in zzso to spontaneous zzso zzso the zzso of zzso differs according to their location in the brain, with zzso zzso being caused by cerebral zzso zzso and deep or zzso zzso resulting from hypertension and zzso We investigated the prevalence of and risk factors for zzso in the general population aged 60 years and zzso 

This study is based on zzso persons zzso age zzso zzso from the zzso Rotterdam zzso zzso zzso was performed at zzso T and included a sequence zzso to increase the zzso of zzso We assessed the relation of zzso zzso cardiovascular risk factors, and markers of small vessel disease to the presence and location of zzso with multiple zzso zzso 

zzso prevalence of cerebral zzso was high and increased with age from zzso in persons aged zzso years to zzso in those over 80 zzso zzso zzso 4 carriers had significantly more often strictly zzso zzso than zzso In contrast, cardiovascular risk factors and presence of zzso zzso and white matter zzso were associated with zzso in a deep or zzso location but not in a zzso zzso 

The prevalence of cerebral zzso is zzso Our data support the hypothesis that strictly zzso zzso are related to cerebral zzso zzso whereas zzso in a deep or zzso location result from zzso or zzso zzso
