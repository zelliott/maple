Previous findings demonstrated that zzso B of zzso the gene coding for zzso C, is a zzso risk factor for zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso von der zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zhang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mann, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reiss, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association of the zzso C gene with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso In the present zzso zzso zzso study, we analyzed the effects of zzso zzso on resting cortical zzso in subjects with zzso and mild cognitive impairment zzso with the hypothesis that sources of resting zzso rhythms are more impaired in carriers of the zzso B zzso than zzso We enrolled a population of 84 zzso subjects zzso with the B zzso and 65 zzso patients zzso with the B zzso zzso zzso zzso data were recorded in all zzso zzso rhythms of interest were delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso beta 1 zzso zzso and beta 2 zzso zzso zzso cortical sources were estimated by zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of alpha 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and alpha 2 zzso zzso was statistically lower in zzso B carriers than zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas there was a trend towards statistical significance that zzso of zzso delta sources was stronger in zzso B carriers than in zzso This was true for both zzso and zzso zzso The present findings represent the first demonstration of relationships between the zzso genetic risk factor zzso B and global zzso zzso zzso cortical delta and alpha zzso in zzso and zzso subjects, prompting future zzso zzso studies for the early prediction of zzso conversion in individual zzso zzso
