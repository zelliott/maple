zzso bypass has been used to zzso victims of accidental deep zzso Unlike other zzso techniques, it restores organ zzso immediately in patients with inadequate zzso This study evaluated the long-term outcome of survivors of accidental deep zzso with circulatory arrest who had been zzso with zzso zzso 

Deep zzso zzso temperature, zzso degrees zzso with circulatory arrest was found in 46 of 234 patients with accidental zzso In 32 of the 46 patients, zzso with zzso bypass was zzso resulting in 15 long-term zzso In most of these patients, deep zzso developed after zzso accidents or suicide at zzso After an average zzso of zzso years of zzso we obtained the patients' medical histories and performed zzso and zzso zzso zzso ultrasound studies, zzso and magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso 

The average age of the patients was zzso years; seven were female and eight were zzso The mean zzso from discovery of the patient to zzso with zzso bypass was zzso minutes zzso 30 to zzso At follow-up there were no zzso zzso that impaired quality of zzso zzso and zzso deficits observed in the early period after zzso had fully or almost completely zzso One patent had zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging with mild clinical signs, a condition that may have been caused by zzso Other clinical abnormalities were either zzso or due to injuries not related to zzso 

This clinical experience demonstrates that young, otherwise healthy people can survive accidental deep zzso with no or minimal cerebral zzso even with prolonged circulatory zzso zzso bypass appears to be an zzso zzso zzso
