zzso and zzso human zzso models of schizophrenia are used for testing compounds that target the zzso zzso However, corresponding functional zzso models are difficult to reconcile with functional imaging and zzso findings in zzso zzso the discrepancies between different zzso levels is critical to understand the complex pharmacological zzso action and its usefulness for modeling schizophrenia zzso 

We conducted a zzso randomized, zzso zzso study in zzso male zzso zzso were given zzso zzso zzso prior to functional zzso zzso during zzso thereafter continuous zzso zzso reduced by zzso every ten minutes) or zzso while performing a visual oddball task during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with continuous recording of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso Before and after intervention, zzso status was assessed using the Positive and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso State of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and corresponding zzso responses were diminished in the zzso condition in cortical regions being involved in sensory zzso zzso In both measurement zzso separation of drug conditions was achieved with area under the curve zzso values of up to zzso zzso effects were also observed in the clinical, behavioral and peripheral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reaction hit and false alarm rate, zzso activity and heart zzso which were in part related to the zzso zzso 

The findings from our zzso experiment are consistent across zzso and directly related to observations in schizophrenia supporting the zzso of the zzso Our investigation provides the first zzso example of a zzso study using simultaneously acquired zzso
