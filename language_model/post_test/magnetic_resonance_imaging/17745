This article summarizes the use of zzso in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis zzso Current and emerging imaging techniques are reviewed pertaining to their utility in zzso 

Conventional zzso and zzso sequences are used to identify and characterize disease pathology in zzso zzso zzso burden, zzso enhancement, zzso zzso and regional and global zzso are all zzso and correlate to clinical measures, such as disease zzso to a variable zzso Newer techniques such as diffusion zzso imaging, zzso transfer imaging, and MR zzso are increasingly being incorporated into clinical trials and may provide improved specificity to the underlying zzso Double inversion recovery and zzso zzso have direct application in zzso for evaluating cortical zzso Newer functional zzso techniques such as zzso functional connectivity are increasingly being applied in zzso 

Conventional and emerging imaging techniques greatly inform our understanding of zzso These techniques are integral in diagnosis, in evaluating new treatments for zzso and for following patients in the clinical zzso
