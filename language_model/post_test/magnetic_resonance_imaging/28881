Our goal was to use functional zzso zzso to measure brain zzso in response to imagination of zzso in zzso 

zzso brain scans were obtained in 21 normal subjects (9 men, 12 zzso using zzso zzso zzso in response to imagination of zzso of banana and peppermint and to the actual smells of the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in three zzso sections selected from anterior to zzso zzso brain zzso Similar studies were obtained in two patients with zzso using zzso zzso and in one patient with zzso using echo zzso imaging, both before and after zzso treatment, which returned smell function to or toward normal in each zzso zzso images were derived using correlation analysis, and ratios of areas of brain activated to total brain areas were zzso 

zzso was present in each section in all normal subjects and in each patient after imagination of each zzso In normal subjects, brain zzso in response to imagination of zzso was significantly less than that in response to the actual smell of these zzso and zzso following imagination of banana odor was significantly greater in men than in women, as was previously reported for the actual smell of the odor of zzso zzso However, in relative terms, albeit at an absolute lower brain zzso level, the ratio of brain zzso by imagination of banana to zzso by actual zzso zzso odor was about twice as high in women as in zzso Before treatment, in patients with zzso brain zzso in response to odor imagination was greater than after presentation of the actual odor zzso After treatment, in patients with zzso in whom smell acuity returned to or toward normal, brain zzso in response to odor imagination was not significantly different zzso from that before zzso however, brain zzso in response to the actual odor was significantly greater than that in response to imagination of the corresponding zzso Brain regions activated by both odor imagination and actual corresponding odor were similar and consistent with regions previously described as responding to zzso 

These studies indicate that zzso zzso can be imagined and similar brain regions are activated by both imagined and corresponding actual zzso zzso imagination of zzso elicits zzso less brain zzso than do actual smells of corresponding zzso in normal zzso zzso absolute brain zzso in men by odor imagination is greater than in women for some zzso but on a relative basis, the ratio for odor imagination to actual smell in women is twice that in zzso zzso odor imagination, once the odor has been zzso is present, zzso and capable of inducing a relatively constant degree of brain zzso even in the absence of the ability to recognize an actual corresponding zzso
