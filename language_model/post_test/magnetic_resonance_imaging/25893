zzso of zzso zzso have been tested as blood zzso However, evidence exists that there is long-term retention of some zzso by the zzso of the zzso system zzso The authors investigate organ retention of the blood substitute zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Various zzso of an emulsion of zzso were administered to five zzso At intervals up to 86 weeks after infusion, zzso zzso was used to measure the amount of zzso in liver and zzso The data were fit to both linear and exponential elimination models, and organ retention zzso were zzso 

The exponential zzso for combined liver and zzso zzso ranged from 110 to 190 zzso Linear zzso ranged from 175 to 300 zzso 

zzso retained by the liver and zzso may be zzso by zzso zzso The zzso that were measured are longer than those reported previously for zzso
