zzso resonance imaging zzso has become an important technique for monitoring the effectiveness of putative treatments for multiple sclerosis zzso because of its high sensitivity, objectivity, and zzso zzso Its importance as a surrogate measure of disease, however, is an issue that is more difficult to validate than might seem to be the zzso In this review, we describe the role of zzso in the assessment of putative therapies for zzso New magnetic resonance techniques and methods of image analyses aimed at better demonstrating the nature and extent of disease are discussed, and the role of zzso in published zzso therapeutic trials is zzso zzso is a frequently used secondary outcome measure for putative treatment strategies for zzso Although it is sensitive to changes in the inflammatory component of the zzso disease process, poor correlation has been noted between zzso findings and long-term patient zzso There is a widespread expectation that new magnetic resonance zzso as zzso inversion recovery, zzso transfer imaging, and magnetic resonance zzso ultimately be useful for characterization of zzso changes within the zzso zzso and more generally of the zzso disease zzso Whether magnetic resonance changes seen in experimental therapies predict the long-term clinical course of the disease remains to be zzso
