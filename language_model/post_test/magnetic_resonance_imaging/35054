Cell recognition molecules of the zzso family serve important functions in the developing and the mature nervous zzso zzso in genes zzso the zzso family members close zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso have been found to alter connectivity and zzso of several brain zzso In order to emphasize similarities and differences of these two structurally related zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were directly compared with respect to zzso guidance in the zzso and the zzso bulb and the sizes of the zzso system and the zzso zzso using a combined structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the absence of zzso leads to zzso zzso mossy fiber projections whereas in both zzso zzso and zzso the guidance of the zzso nerve projections is zzso Both zzso also alter the size of the zzso system and the zzso with a specific profile of changes and partially opposite effects in each of the zzso zzso zzso mice do not show any enhancement of the single zzso zzso but balance the opposing effects on the zzso zzso In zzso the results show that zzso and zzso both affect zzso guidance and the anatomy of the zzso system and the zzso zzso but act differently on these zzso
