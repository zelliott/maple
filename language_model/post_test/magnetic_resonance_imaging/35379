To assess the effect of age, size, the degree of zzso and contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso using quantitative standardized zzso values zzso 

A total of 61 zzso of 41 patients, who underwent combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso were included in this zzso zzso zzso were divided into two groups: zzso zzso showing distinct low signal intensity on zzso images and intermediate signal intensity on zzso images, and zzso zzso showing other types of signal zzso zzso zzso were also divided into two groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in terms of their degree of contrast enhancement on zzso 

The mean values of the maximum and average zzso for the total of 61 zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a moderate negative correlation between the maximum and average zzso and age zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso r zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Although there was a mild positive correlation between maximum zzso and size zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso there was no significant difference between average zzso and zzso Although there was no significant difference in average zzso between zzso and zzso zzso the maximum zzso of zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The degree of contrast enhancement on zzso was not significantly correlated with zzso zzso 

zzso or moderate zzso of zzso is often observed in zzso zzso and declines with age, and should not be confused with zzso zzso
