The purpose of this study was to zzso investigate the influence of zzso tunnel placement in zzso reconstruction on early outcomes and return to sports due to zzso and zzso zzso 

A prospective study was conducted from 2008 to 2010, with 86 athletes who underwent zzso reconstruction between zzso zzso footprint and high AM zzso zzso functional outcomes zzso objective and zzso zzso score, and zzso zzso return to sports and complications were analyzed at 6- and 12-month zzso 

At zzso it was observed that tunnel projection along zzso line was correlated with functional outcomes on zzso scale (at 6 and 12 zzso and zzso zzso (at 12 zzso There was a significant difference in mean tunnel projection along zzso line when analyzing return to sports zzso zzso zzso and 79 zzso zzso zzso respectively, for projections on return zzso no return to sports, p zzso zzso and complications zzso zzso zzso zzso 78 zzso zzso zzso respectively, for projections on no complications zzso zzso p zzso zzso No differences were stated on zzso zzso These correlations between tunnel positioning on functional outcomes could not be explained by demographic or baseline zzso 

The clinical relevance of this study is that tunnel positioning along AM footprint and high AM position represented by tunnel projection along zzso line is associated with early return to sports on previous zzso level and better functional outcome in zzso
