zzso and animals use information obtained from the local visual scene to orient themselves in the wider zzso Although neural systems involved in scene perception have been identified, the extent to which processing in these systems is affected by previous experience is zzso We addressed this issue by scanning subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while they viewed photographs of familiar and unfamiliar zzso zzso regions in zzso zzso (the zzso place area, or zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso responded more strongly to images of familiar locations than to images of unfamiliar locations with the strongest effects zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso repetition suppression zzso effects indicated that images of familiar and unfamiliar locations were processed with the same degree of viewpoint zzso however, increased viewpoint zzso was observed as individual scenes became more familiar over the course of a scan zzso Surprisingly, these zzso zzso zzso effects were only observed when scenes were repeated across different trials but not when scenes were repeated within a trial, suggesting that zzso and zzso zzso effects may index different aspects of visual scene zzso The sensitivity to environmental familiarity observed in the zzso zzso and zzso supports earlier claims that these regions mediate the extraction of zzso relevant spatial information from visual zzso As locations become familiar, the neural representations of these locations become zzso but the viewpoint zzso of these representations does not zzso
