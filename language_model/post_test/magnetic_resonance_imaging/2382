To evaluate the narrowing of the left zzso zzso tract zzso during zzso caused by a rigid zzso zzso the geometric relationship between the zzso (or the zzso zzso and the left zzso base zzso was studied in five patients with mechanical zzso valve zzso and eight normal zzso The images of the zzso valve zzso zzso and the zzso orifice reconstructed in three dimensions were projected on the plane of the zzso zzso zzso the areas of these projected images zzso those for zzso zzso zzso orifice zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso the zzso ratio zzso was zzso In the normal subject, the zzso ratio was nearly constant during zzso zzso zzso zzso at 0 zzso and 62 zzso zzso at 300 zzso respectively), whereas in the patients with zzso the ratio increased from 61 zzso zzso zzso zzso to 69 zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso ratio reduces the zzso share of zzso orifice in relation to the total zzso The ideal zzso valve zzso should be flexible at the zzso to attain good performance in zzso zzso
