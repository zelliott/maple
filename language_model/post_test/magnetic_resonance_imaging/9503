To evaluate the feasibility and value of zzso zzso dynamic and zzso zzso zzso in patients after zzso zzso of left zzso zzso zzso to identify incorrect placement and persistent zzso 

7 patients with different zzso systems zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso underwent 2 zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to assess zzso artifact size and potential leaks of the zzso zzso zzso was analyzed visually and zzso to identify potential zzso 

All zzso were positioned within the zzso The zzso zzso presented the most extensive artifact zzso Visual assessment revealed a residual zzso of the zzso zzso in 4 cases using zzso zzso and zzso indicating a zzso zzso zzso assessing zzso the cases with a visually detected leak showed a zzso higher zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase from baseline zzso than those without a leak zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In contrast, the signal increase in zzso zzso to the zzso showed no difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no leak zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

This zzso pilot study provides valuable zzso information in patients after zzso zzso of the zzso to identify correct placement and potential zzso We recommend incorporating zzso in future clinical studies to evaluate new device zzso
