zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of left zzso zzso zzso However, the relationship between sympathetic zzso and zzso mass zzso has not been clearly defined across a range of zzso pressure zzso The present study was planned to determine that relationship, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to accurately zzso zzso in zzso patients with and without zzso and in normal zzso 

zzso patients with uncomplicated and zzso essential hypertension zzso were compared with 25 patients with essential hypertension and left zzso zzso zzso and 24 normal control zzso zzso muscle sympathetic nerve activity was zzso as zzso bursts and single zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was zzso to body surface area zzso zzso in the zzso group, zzso index was zzso zzso a value between those of the zzso zzso zzso and normal control zzso zzso groups, zzso The sympathetic activity in the zzso group zzso bursts per 100 cardiac beats and zzso impulses per 100 cardiac zzso was between (at least zzso those of the zzso zzso bursts per 100 cardiac beats and zzso impulses per 100 cardiac zzso and normal control zzso bursts per 100 cardiac beats and zzso impulses per 100 cardiac zzso zzso zzso positive correlation existed between sympathetic activity and zzso index in the zzso and zzso groups (at least zzso zzso but not in the normal control zzso However, no consistent relationship existed between zzso blood pressure and sympathetic activity or zzso zzso 

These findings further support the hypothesis that central sympathetic zzso is associated with the development of zzso in human zzso
