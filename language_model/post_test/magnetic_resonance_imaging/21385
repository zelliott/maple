zzso has allowed the study of mineral deposition in the brain throughout life and in zzso However, studies differ in their reporting of minerals on zzso for reasons that are zzso 

We conducted a systematic review from 1985 to July 2011 to determine the appearance of iron, zzso copper and zzso on zzso and CT and their zzso We assessed which imaging investigations provided the most consistent results compared with zzso 

Of 325 papers on minerals imaging, we included 46 studies that confirmed findings either directly or indirectly using a zzso method such as zzso Within this group, there was inconsistency in the identification of iron probably because of changes in its zzso properties during its zzso Iron appeared consistently zzso only on zzso zzso and along with zzso areas, zzso on zzso zzso of copper, calcium and zzso although consistently reported as zzso on zzso zzso was confirmed zzso in few zzso On zzso imaging, zzso areas were always reported as zzso while the appearance of iron depended on the zzso location and degradation zzso 

More work is required to improve the reliability of imaging methods to detect and differentiate brain mineral deposition zzso 

There is inconsistency in reporting the appearance of minerals on zzso zzso zzso Only 46 studies confirmed mineral appearance using a zzso zzso zzso Iron is the mineral more widely zzso consistently zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistently reported copper, calcium and zzso zzso zzso zzso is consistently reported zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso
