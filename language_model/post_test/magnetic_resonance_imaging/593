The perceived emotional value of stimuli and, as a consequence the zzso emotional experience with them, can be affected by zzso styles of zzso zzso the investigation of the neural zzso of emotional experience requires accounting for such a zzso a matter of an experimental zzso zzso the eyes affects the style of attending to auditory stimuli by zzso the zzso relationship with the environment without changing the stimulus zzso In the current study, we used zzso to characterize the neural zzso of such modification on the experience of zzso in zzso We assumed that closed eyes position will reveal interplay between different levels of neural processing of zzso More specifically, we focused on the zzso as a central zzso of the zzso system and on its zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regions involved in processing of, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso zzso values of emotional zzso Fifteen healthy subjects listened to negative and neutral music excerpts with eyes closed or zzso As expected, behavioral results showed that closing the eyes while listening to emotional music resulted in enhanced rating of zzso specifically of negative zzso In correspondence, zzso results showed greater zzso in the zzso when subjects listened to the emotional music with eyes closed relative to eyes zzso More so, by using zzso correlation and a dynamic zzso model analyses we demonstrated that increased zzso zzso to negative music with eyes closed led to increased zzso in the zzso and zzso This finding supports a zzso model of perceived zzso in which the zzso has a central role in zzso the effect of zzso processing style by recruiting neural operations involved in both visceral zzso zzso and cognitive zzso zzso related processes of zzso
