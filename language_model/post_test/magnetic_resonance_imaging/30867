In magnetic resonance electrical zzso zzso zzso we try to zzso zzso zzso (or zzso images of a zzso We inject electrical currents into the subject through surface zzso and measure the zzso component zzso of the induced internal magnetic flux density using an zzso zzso Here, zzso is the direction of the main magnetic field of the zzso zzso We formulate the zzso image reconstruction problem in zzso from a careful analysis of the relationship between the injection current and the induced magnetic flux density zzso Based on the novel mathematical zzso we propose the zzso zzso decomposition zzso to reconstruct zzso zzso This new zzso needs to differentiate zzso only once in contrast to the previously developed harmonic zzso zzso where the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso The new algorithm, therefore, has the important advantage of much improved noise zzso zzso simulations with added random noise of realistic amounts show the feasibility of the zzso in practical applications and also its zzso against measurement zzso
