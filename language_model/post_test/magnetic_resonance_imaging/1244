To test the hypothesis that dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides a useful in zzso measure of passive blood retinal barrier zzso surface area product zzso zzso in experimental diabetic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso control rats, sodium zzso rats, rats receiving zzso injected human serum zzso zzso or vascular zzso growth zzso zzso factor zzso or in rats that were diabetic for 2, 4, 6, or 8 zzso 

zzso zzso rats exhibited an zzso increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso compared to that in control zzso Furthermore, in zzso rats, the average zzso signal enhancement was zzso dependent on zzso dose zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Six hours zzso zzso rats exhibited a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to eyes injected with zzso In zzso zzso and zzso diabetic rats, zzso zzso was not significantly different zzso zzso zzso from control zzso zzso zzso After 8 months of diabetes, a twofold increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso over control zzso values was zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso becomes leaky immediately before death, possibly causing an artificial increase in retinal zzso in methods that require zzso or retinal isolation to assess zzso 

zzso provides a sensitive, zzso and linear zzso that accurately measures, without potential artifacts associated with death and zzso passive zzso zzso in experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expected to provide a useful surrogate marker of drug treatment zzso
