Patients with complex zzso heart disease are at risk for zzso zzso Evidence suggests that brain maturation can be delayed and zzso and zzso brain injury may occur, and there is limited information on the long-term effect of zzso heart disease on brain development and function in adolescent zzso At a mean age of zzso years, 39 adolescent survivors of childhood zzso bypass surgery with no structural brain zzso evident through conventional cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and 32 healthy control subjects underwent extensive zzso assessment and cerebral magnetic resonance zzso zzso scans were zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso Compared with control subjects, patients had lower total brain zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso and cortical zzso matter zzso zzso zzso volumes, whereas zzso fluid volumes were not zzso Regional brain volume reduction ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso heart disease showed more brain volume loss than those with zzso heart disease, particularly in the white matter, zzso zzso and corpus zzso (all zzso zzso zzso Brain volume reduction correlated significantly with zzso motor and executive functions zzso zzso P zzso zzso white zzso P zzso zzso Our findings suggest that there are long-lasting cerebral changes in adolescent survivors of zzso bypass surgery for zzso heart disease and that these changes are associated with functional zzso
