The purpose of this study was to compare liver zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso liver zzso after the administration of a standard dose zzso zzso of body zzso or a triple dose zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that the higher dose would produce a higher zzso zzso and therefore increase the zzso of zzso zzso 

A total of 85 patients with zzso zzso masses zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso and two zzso proved by zzso or follow-up studies underwent MR imaging at zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso imaging were done before and within 1 zzso after zzso zzso as well as 5 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso after the injection of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso per zzso zzso before the start of the study zzso patients received the standard dose, and 46 received the triple zzso The signal zzso of the liver and zzso and the zzso of background noise were measured by use of regions of interest to calculate the zzso of the liver and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was increased significantly at 5 and 15 zzso after the administration of zzso No significant differences in the liver zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (after 1 zzso standard dose, -5 zzso 8, and triple dose, zzso zzso zzso after 5 zzso standard dose, zzso zzso 5, and triple dose, 2 zzso zzso and after 15 zzso standard dose, 1 zzso 5, and triple dose, 6 zzso zzso were found between the doses at all time zzso 

zzso zzso does not improve the zzso contrast of zzso zzso zzso over that provided by the standard dose and is not warranted for liver MR zzso
