The aim of this study was to compare the performance of a dedicated double breast zzso for MR imaging and intervention with a standard diagnostic double breast zzso 

zzso ratios zzso were determined for both coils by using a water zzso Fourteen patients were zzso 11 underwent zzso zzso zzso two were zzso and one received diagnostic zzso Breast images were acquired in three patients with both coils and were visually zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and surgeries following zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

zzso was superior with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso part of the imaging volume and inferior in the anterior part compared with the standard zzso zzso MR breast images were of similar diagnostic zzso For the two biopsy procedures the zzso was correctly placed in front of the suspicious zzso zzso were correctly located inside the zzso in nine patients and in contact with the zzso in one zzso In one patient a 2 zzso distance between the zzso and the wire was zzso 

zzso imaging followed by subsequent zzso intervention is possible within a single session by using the dedicated zzso zzso The correct final position of the zzso demonstrates the precision of the MR guided zzso zzso
