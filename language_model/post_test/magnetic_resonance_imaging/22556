The human visual system possesses a remarkable ability to reconstruct the shape of an object that is partly zzso by an zzso zzso zzso results suggest that, under some circumstances, this zzso process zzso zzso zzso zzso from an initial representation of local image features to a completed representation of a shape that may include features that are not explicitly present in the retinal zzso Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have shown that the completed surface is represented in early visual cortical zzso We used zzso adaptation, combined with brief, masked zzso to track the zzso completion process as it unfolds in early visual cortical zzso We report evidence for an evolution of the neural representation from the zzso feature representation to the completed zzso Our method offers the possibility of measuring changes in cortical activity using zzso over a time scale of a few hundred zzso
