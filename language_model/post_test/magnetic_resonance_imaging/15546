zzso of mental zzso suggest zzso networks may mediate performance of tasks requiring precise zzso We assessed whether zzso networks are functionally integrated during the performance of timing zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data from 31 healthy adults were collected during performance of several different types of discrete zzso timing zzso Independent component analysis zzso was used to examine functional connectivity within zzso zzso zzso identifies groups of zzso discrete brain regions sharing similar patterns of zzso signal change over zzso The results confirm the existence of a zzso neural timing circuit that includes anterior zzso zzso supplementary motor area, bilateral anterior zzso bilateral zzso zzso bilateral thalamus, and right superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several other distinct neural circuits were identified that may represent the zzso zzso of different information processing stages of mental zzso Small areas of right zzso were engaged in several of these zzso suggesting that zzso function may be important in, but not the primary zzso of, the mental timing tasks used in this zzso These findings are discussed within the context of current biological and information processing models of neural zzso
