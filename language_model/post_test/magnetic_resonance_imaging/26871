Even though zzso in the zzso properties of zzso zzso the development of the most prevalent and zzso zzso they are not directly zzso in zzso by zzso zzso Imaging zzso or zzso zzso zzso This circumstance has lead to the development of a wide variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and MRS zzso able to inform non zzso on zzso variables such as zzso zzso zzso concentration o even zzso This review covers the fundamentals of environmental contrast and the current arsenal of zzso and zzso zzso and MRS contrast enhancing agents available to zzso zzso We begin describing the zzso background necessary to understand zzso and zzso contrast enhancement with a special reference to novel zzso transfer and zzso zzso zzso We describe then the main zzso structures used to support the environmentally sensitive zzso sensors, including zzso and zzso pH sensitive zzso temperature zzso and zzso activity or gene expression zzso zzso Finally we address the most commonly used zzso contrast agents including zzso derivatives to reveal zzso pH and tissue zzso values by zzso The potential applications of these agents in zzso and molecular imaging approaches are zzso
