To establish an animal model of human zzso we have injected human zzso cells into the zzso magna of nude zzso zzso grew in 3 out of 4 animals injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso animals showed little or no weight gain and eventually lost weight but did not develop obvious neurological symptoms until the end of observation on day 31 after zzso At this time, magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso rats revealed contrast enhancement in the region of the fourth zzso and the zzso zzso zzso examination demonstrated corresponding zzso growth in the zzso magna invading the zzso zzso and tumor growth within the fourth zzso invading the zzso The tumors basically showed the same zzso pattern as zzso cells in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso but no zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso No tumor grew in the fourth animal, which had a normal weight gain and no zzso on zzso In conclusion zzso the zzso injected human zzso cells spread similar to zzso in patients, zzso tumor growth is readily detected by zzso zzso the new animal model is a suitable tool for further experimental research including zzso therapeutic zzso
