In this study, the zzso mechanical properties, zzso behaviors, in zzso zzso and magnetic zzso of zzso zzso with various zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were systematically investigated to explore their potential use in biomedical zzso The experimental results indicated that zzso zzso zzso consisted entirely or primarily of zzso zzso The zzso elements significantly increased the strength and zzso of pure zzso and had a relatively slight influence on elastic zzso zzso was the most effective enhancing element and zzso zzso had the largest zzso The results of zzso zzso indicated that adding various elements to zzso improved its zzso resistance, as indicated by the reduced zzso current zzso The extracts of the studied zzso zzso produced no significant deleterious effects on zzso cells zzso zzso indicating good in zzso zzso All except for zzso zzso showed decreased magnetic zzso compared to pure zzso and zzso zzso had the lowest magnetic zzso value, being comparable to that of zzso phase zzso zzso and zzso zzso and far lower than that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among the experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing high strength coupled with good zzso good in zzso zzso and low magnetic zzso may be a good candidate zzso for medical devices within a magnetic resonance imaging zzso
