In zzso tasks, conflict effects in behavioral measures and zzso activity are smaller on trials following an zzso trial than following a zzso zzso Researchers have found no agreement on whether these sequential effects in zzso can be driven by experienced zzso only or also by expectations about target zzso In the present zzso experiment, we specifically manipulated the zzso by using symbolic cues predicting with zzso or 50% certainty the zzso or zzso targets in a zzso zzso Both behavioral and zzso zzso data zzso previous sequential effects, with conflict effects being smallest for targets following the cues that predicted with zzso certainty the zzso zzso However, these effects were not driven by experienced conflict but by symbolic zzso These results demonstrate differential zzso control activity in zzso after zzso zzso providing evidence for control adjustments driven by changes in zzso
