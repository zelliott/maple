The aim of the study was to investigate the neurological outcome of spinal zzso injuries in the traumatized cervical spine with a zzso of the spinal zzso zzso From 1992 to 1999 we treated 145 spinal zzso injuries and/or injuries with an unstable cervical spine, 138 were treated zzso in 7 patients we found an injury of the spinal zzso with a stable cervical spine and a zzso of the spinal zzso zzso The zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso of the cervical spine, an X-ray view of the zzso axis and a stress zzso in extension and zzso An zzso was performed within the first 12 hours after the zzso The zzso of the spinal zzso canal was evaluated by the zzso of the zzso diameter of the spinal zzso canal as well as the zzso body zzso and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso changed values were found in 4 patients within 2 segments and in 3 patients within 3 zzso In the zzso echo sequence zzso zzso of the spinal cord, accordingly to an zzso were found in 6 zzso The neurological evaluation was performed according to the zzso Neurological zzso of Spinal zzso zzso Treatment of these 7 patients was performed zzso consisting of zzso as well as zzso according to the pattern of zzso and zzso The follow-up was performed after 12 to 18 zzso We evaluated the zzso in zzso and lateral view, stress zzso and neurological zzso zzso findings showed stable conditions of the cervical spine with block zzso and increased zzso The neurological outcome was evaluated according to the zzso and showed an improvement from 8 to 63 points within 13 months in one zzso In 6 cases, the average zzso of 78 increased to 100 points within 2 to 5 months after zzso Most zzso symptoms were found in the upper zzso zzso in fine motor movement were unable to be examined with the zzso We can conclude that spinal zzso injuries in stable cervical spines with zzso of the spinal zzso canal can be treated conservatively with a good zzso A zzso of the neurological zzso can be expected within 2 to 5 months, but even after one year, zzso zzso is zzso
