The in zzso harvest of zzso bone zzso when assessed by clinical zzso has been shown to be a safe procedure when performed by experienced zzso However, might there be adverse zzso from bone graft harvest that are not severe enough to produce zzso changes and thus are missed by studies that rely on clinical zzso This study was designed to determine the zzso of zzso zzso complications following routine bone graft harvest, such as zzso zzso bleeding and cerebral zzso This prospective clinical study included 20 zzso All patients had in zzso zzso bone graft harvest performed by a single surgeon and underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging within 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were found to be the most helpful in the zzso determination of donor zzso The average area of bone graft harvest was just under 14 zzso zzso 3 to 30 zzso No patients who had not previously undergone skull surgery were noted to have zzso zzso Three patients identified with zzso zzso at surgery had harvest sites located in areas in which a previous zzso had occurred, suggesting that extreme care be used when harvesting bone from this subset of zzso All 20 zzso magnetic resonance scans were reviewed by a zzso and determined to be completely zzso In conclusion, not only is in zzso zzso bone graft harvest a safe procedure as assessed by clinical zzso but no zzso complications were identified by zzso magnetic resonance zzso
