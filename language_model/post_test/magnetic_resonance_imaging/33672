A method for obtaining localized zzso from arbitrarily shaped regions of interest is zzso When a sample consists of homogeneous compartments or zzso zzso localized in each compartment can be obtained from signals of single zzso with regular shapes by solving a set of simultaneous linear zzso Experimental demonstrations on a phantom and on human brain in zzso for a two zzso two zzso case are zzso The issue of zzso ratio is also zzso
