zzso zzso Type I zzso with an associated spinal zzso is a common pediatric zzso A better understanding of the relative age-related prevalence and MR imaging characteristics of these associated conditions may lead to improved treatment zzso 

The authors performed a retrospective review of zzso consecutive individuals 18 years of age or younger who had undergone brain or cervical spine MR imaging at the University of Michigan between November 1997 and August zzso In the patients with zzso zzso clinical, and zzso information was zzso 

Five hundred nine children zzso with zzso were zzso Among these patients, zzso also had a spinal zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso were found in the cervical zzso The MR imaging prevalence of zzso with a zzso was zzso in girls and zzso in boys zzso zzso zzso The severity of impaired zzso flow at the zzso zzso was associated with the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso were treated surgically in zzso of zzso these patients exhibited more severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso flow zzso zzso zzso as compared with those who did not undergo zzso On imaging, zzso of all the patients with zzso were considered symptomatic by the treating zzso Patients were more likely to be considered symptomatic if they were female, had a zzso displayed abnormal zzso zzso or had a greater amount of zzso zzso 

In this study the authors describe the age-related prevalence and MR imaging characteristics of zzso and its association with a zzso and other abnormalities in a large group of children who underwent MR imaging for any zzso zzso are more common in older children, in girls, and in patients with a greater degree of zzso descent and zzso flow zzso
