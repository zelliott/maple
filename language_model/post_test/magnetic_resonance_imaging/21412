To evaluate the reliability and accuracy of skeletal muscle CT to correctly identify different muscular zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

Four zzso assessed scans from 118 patients with zzso muscular zzso zzso caused by zzso in 7 different genes and from 32 zzso The conditions studied were scans of genetically confirmed cases of Becker muscular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26), zzso zzso zzso 24), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The control group zzso zzso zzso consisted of patients with zzso disorders zzso with zzso weakness in which the aforementioned muscular zzso were zzso The scans were compared with the characteristic patterns described in zzso 

The overall zzso agreement was poor zzso zzso zzso with markedly higher scores for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity to detect selective patterns in relation to the genetic diagnosis was zzso if all zzso were taken zzso The specificity was zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso and 1 - negative zzso value zzso zzso zzso better scores were observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 - zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 - zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that muscle CT might be an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso However, pattern recognition was cumbersome in the other zzso
