Previous case reports supported the presence of the zzso zzso tract in exceptional zzso However, most of these case reports have not fully discussed involvement of the motor zzso controlling the zzso zzso 

The authors investigated a 62-year-old man who developed right zzso after right zzso zzso by using zzso zzso magnetic zzso functional zzso zzso and sensory evoked zzso He had moderate weakness including the face, zzso with brisk deep zzso zzso and zzso sign, and impaired zzso and position sense, all on the right zzso 

A zzso study showed zzso in the right zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso study during a sequential finger opposition task showed zzso in the motor zzso zzso to the finger movements, but not on the zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso showed cortical response zzso to the side of zzso 

The zzso tract and the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not cross in the zzso in this zzso In view of the presence of the abnormal shape in the zzso and zzso zzso a zzso factor might be responsible for the zzso zzso tract and zzso zzso zzso in this zzso
