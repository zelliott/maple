The function of sleep in humans has been investigated using simultaneous zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings to provide accurate sleep scores with spatial zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that spontaneous brain zzso and functional connectivity zzso during zzso eye movement zzso sleep; this leads to spontaneous cognitive zzso such as memory consolidation and emotional zzso However, variations in network connectivity across the sleep stages or between zzso transitions require further zzso We observed changes in the connectivity of the zzso and zzso networks zzso zzso by midnight sleep among 18 healthy zzso The results indicated that zzso functional connectivity in both networks showed increasing zzso as zzso sleep zzso whereas zzso occurred during rapid eye movement zzso sleep; and zzso compared with connectivity before sleep, the zzso presented a comparable connectivity pattern immediately after zzso whereas the connectivity of the zzso network remained zzso These findings showed that connectivity patterns zzso and reconnect zzso in both cortical networks during zzso and zzso sleep, zzso After the person zzso the zzso connectivity was zzso before the zzso zzso These dynamic zzso zzso and zzso between zzso conditions might provide the key to understanding cognitive zzso in zzso If so, connectivity changes might serve as an alternative indicator beyond the zzso signature to unveil the spontaneous processes that occur during zzso
