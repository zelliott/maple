The zzso presentation of zzso branching zzso zzso includes a severe infantile form and a zzso zzso known as adult zzso body zzso zzso we describe 2 patients with adult acute onset of fluctuating neurological signs and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso simulating multiple zzso A better definition of this new clinical entity is needed to facilitate zzso 

To describe the clinical presentation and progression of a new intermediate zzso of zzso branching zzso zzso and to discuss zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and molecular study of 2 patients followed up for 6 years and 8 years at academic medical zzso The participants were 2 patients of zzso descent with adult acute onset of neurological signs initially diagnosed as multiple zzso 

Clinical course, muscle and nerve zzso zzso study of brain magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso branching zzso activity and zzso molecular zzso 

zzso analysis showed that one patient was zzso zzso and the other patient was compound zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso branching zzso activity was zzso and zzso of normal in zzso Both patients zzso acute episodes of transient neurological symptoms, and neurological impairment was mild at age 45 years and 53 zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed zzso white matter zzso and zzso zzso similar to typical adult zzso body zzso 

zzso zzso can cause an early zzso zzso form of zzso body disease distinct from adult zzso body disease in several ways, including younger age at zzso history of infantile liver involvement, and zzso and zzso course simulating multiple zzso This should orient zzso toward the correct zzso
