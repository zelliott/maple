For maximum zzso of a zzso MR imaging zzso it is desirable to use a zzso imaging zzso This article introduces a new zzso imaging approach that combines the advantages of multiple zzso with the technique of line scan diffusion zzso A slab volume, which can be zzso zzso with fewer phase encodes than a regular field of view, is selected with zzso selective zzso With the shorter echo train, the sensitivity to field zzso and chemical shift is thus greatly zzso Further reduction is achieved by zzso short zzso echo trains with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that produce flip angles close to 180 degrees are used to minimize the zzso echo zzso zzso phase shifts, which change polarity with each zzso zzso will give rise to artifacts that are zzso by processing even and odd zzso zzso As with line scan diffusion imaging, the complete field of view is acquired by sequential zzso Since with each shot several lines of data are collected, a considerable improvement over line scan diffusion imaging in terms of scanning speed is zzso zzso data obtained in zzso and normal subjects demonstrate the feasibility of this novel zzso
