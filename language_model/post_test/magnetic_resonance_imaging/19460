The electrical activity of the brain can be monitored using zzso zzso From the positions of the zzso electrodes, it is possible to zzso focal brain zzso zzso the accuracy of the zzso strongly depends on the accuracy with which the positions of the zzso can be zzso In this work, we present an zzso simple, and accurate scheme that detects zzso zzso markers from zzso MR data of the human zzso
