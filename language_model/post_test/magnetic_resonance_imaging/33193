It remains unclear whether brain structural abnormalities observed before the onset of psychosis are specific to schizophrenia or are common to all psychotic zzso This study aimed to measure regional gray matter volume prior to the onset of zzso and of affective zzso We investigated 102 subjects at zzso risk zzso of developing psychosis recruited from the Personal Assessment and zzso zzso Clinic in Melbourne, zzso zzso of these subjects developed psychosis subsequent to zzso 19 zzso 7 affective psychoses, and 2 other zzso We examined regional gray matter volume using zzso zzso thick, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso methods of image zzso zzso were scanned at presentation and were followed up clinically for a minimum of 12 months, to detect later transition to zzso We found that both groups of subjects who subsequently developed psychosis zzso and affective zzso showed reductions in the frontal zzso relative to zzso subjects who did not develop zzso The zzso that subsequently developed schizophrenia also showed smaller volumes in the zzso zzso and, at trend level, in the zzso cortex, whereas those who developed an affective psychosis had significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso These preliminary findings suggest that zzso abnormalities in zzso individuals developing schizophrenia vs affective zzso comprise a combination of features that zzso both disorders and others that may be specific to the nature of the subsequent zzso
