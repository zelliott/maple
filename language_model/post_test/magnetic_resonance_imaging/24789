To investigate differences in cortical thickness in patients with zzso sleep zzso zzso syndrome and healthy zzso 

zzso thickness was measured using a three-dimensional zzso method that enabled more accurate measurement in deep zzso and localized regional zzso 

University zzso 

zzso male patients with severe zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso and 36 zzso male healthy controls were zzso 

zzso thickness was obtained at zzso zzso across the entire brain by reconstructing inner and outer cortical surfaces using an automated anatomical zzso 

Group difference in cortical thickness and correlation between patients' data and thickness were analyzed by a general linear zzso 

zzso cortical thinning in patients was found in the zzso zzso zzso prefrontal regions, zzso zzso anterior cingulate, zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions at corrected P zzso zzso Patients with zzso showed impaired attention and learning difficulty in memory tests compared to healthy zzso Higher number of respiratory zzso was related to cortical thinning of the anterior zzso and inferior zzso zzso A significant correlation was observed between the longer zzso maximum duration and the cortical thinning of the zzso prefrontal regions, zzso zzso and zzso zzso scores in visual memory tests were associated with cortical thickness of zzso zzso and zzso 

Brain regions with cortical thinning may provide zzso for prefrontal cognitive dysfunction, upper airway zzso zzso and cardiovascular disturbances in zzso patients, that experience sleep disruption including sleep fragmentation and oxygen zzso
