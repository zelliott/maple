zzso zzso zzso were recorded by whole head zzso zzso and zzso zzso simultaneously from two patients with medically intractable zzso lobe zzso In one patient whose zzso zzso emerged from the lateral zzso zzso simultaneously recorded zzso could estimate equivalent current zzso reliably near the zzso The zzso of the zzso was in proportion not only to the zzso of zzso discharge but also to the number of zzso zzso zzso In the other patient, zzso detected only a small proportion of zzso zzso even when they were recorded by zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso and the depth of zzso zzso would largely affect the sensitivity of zzso zzso by zzso
