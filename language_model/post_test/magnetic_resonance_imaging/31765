zzso training zzso and circuit weight training zzso improve peak oxygen zzso zzso During zzso the circulatory system is exposed to higher pressure, which could induce left zzso zzso zzso possibly distinct from those derived from zzso zzso 

To compare the effects of zzso training and zzso upon zzso and functional cardiac adaptations detected by magnetic resonance zzso 

Twenty healthy sedentary individuals were randomly assigned to participate in a zzso zzso of zzso training zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) or no intervention zzso zzso 7, zzso Training zzso consisted of 36 sessions, 35 zzso each, 3 times per week, at zzso of zzso heart rate, and zzso included series of resistance exercises performed at zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso exercise testing and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after the zzso 

There was a similar improvement in zzso following zzso training zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso and zzso (12 zzso while there was no change in the control zzso zzso training (12 zzso and zzso (16 zzso improved strength in the lower zzso and only zzso resulted in improvement of 13 zzso in the strength of the upper zzso However, there were no zzso changes in left zzso mass, zzso volume, stroke volume or ejection zzso 

In previously sedentary individuals, short-term zzso and zzso training induce similar improvement in functional capacity without any adaptation in cardiac zzso zzso by cardiac magnetic resonance zzso
