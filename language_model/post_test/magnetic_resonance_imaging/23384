The aim of the current study was to test the zzso of different quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso methods to assess the zzso and functional peripheral vascular status and vascular adaptations over time in patients with peripheral zzso disease zzso 

Ten patients with proven zzso zzso zzso and zzso collateral formation within the upper leg and 10 healthy volunteers were zzso All subjects underwent 2 identical MR examinations of the lower zzso on a clinical zzso MR system, with a time zzso of at least 3 zzso The MR protocol consisted of zzso zzso MR zzso to zzso the number of arteries and artery diameters of the upper leg, zzso zzso MR phase contrast zzso flow zzso in the zzso artery, dynamic zzso zzso zzso imaging to determine the influx constant and area under the curve, and dynamic blood oxygen zzso zzso imaging in calf muscle to measure zzso relative zzso changes and zzso Data were analyzed by 2 independent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined as outcome measures and expressed as the zzso of variation zzso 

zzso of the number of zzso artery diameter, and blood flow proved highly zzso in patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso level and zzso zzso and zzso at zzso level, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was poor in patients with a zzso up to zzso 

zzso of the zzso vascular status by zzso MR zzso as well as phase contrast zzso zzso to assess zzso blood flow proved highly zzso in both zzso patients and healthy volunteers and might therefore be helpful in studying the development of collateral arteries in zzso patients and in unraveling the mechanisms underlying this zzso zzso assessment of the zzso status using zzso and zzso zzso did not prove zzso at zzso T and is therefore currently not suitable for zzso application in zzso
