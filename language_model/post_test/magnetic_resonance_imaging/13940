zzso zzso zzso are a key option in the management of a variety of conditions, including zzso zzso to zzso zzso is not documented in zzso We describe such a zzso 

A 74-year-old female with zzso previously treated with zzso zzso external zzso and zzso daily zzso zzso had stable zzso levels of 19 zzso zzso progressively rose following switches to zzso and depot zzso as zzso zzso from 29 to 126 zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso scanning revealed no zzso growth or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso was discontinued and zzso in daily 200 zzso h increments by continuous zzso infusion, to a maximum of 1000 zzso zzso and maintained over 3 weeks with daily, followed by weekly, zzso zzso Competitive zzso zzso binding zzso measured in zzso zzso of zzso analogue zzso In zzso zzso binding studies zzso zzso rat zzso zzso 

Median zzso fell by zzso from 504 to zzso zzso and rose zzso on continued infusion to 120 zzso zzso withdrawal for 16 h produced a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with no zzso with natural zzso was zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding by zzso analogue zzso zzso was observed at zzso serum zzso 

This is the first report of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso We believe that the short time course of zzso following acute zzso withdrawal is suggestive of an zzso on zzso function or on the zzso signal zzso cascade at sites further zzso rather than an zzso zzso
