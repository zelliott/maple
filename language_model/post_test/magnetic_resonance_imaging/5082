The authors have developed a novel sterile draped touch display solution for convenient zzso access to imaging zzso This study describes the technology and clinical experience of the zzso 

We developed a flexible, mounted touch display solution zzso zzso that allows fixation of the display on the operation microscope and fine adjustments during surgery when the microscope is zzso We compared this setup with a conventional wall-mounted flat-panel and a mobile display stand in illustrative cases of zzso zzso 

The surgeon was able to employ the system without the need to leave the operation field or the need for external assistance while referring to imaging zzso zzso through imaging data with sterile gloves on the touch display was more convenient, more precise, and faster compared with other zzso 

The zzso touch display provides useful assistance for zzso imaging zzso in zzso zzso
