Some acoustic zzso do not grow or grow very zzso It is therefore of value to compare the results of measuring the size of acoustic zzso by either CT or zzso zzso Imaging zzso scanning with a view to being able to observe the growth rate of these zzso Fifteen patients with acoustic zzso had both zzso and zzso zzso Two trained zzso evaluated the size of the zzso in a blinded zzso There was a significant difference between one zzso calculations from the zzso and the zzso and also a significant difference between the two zzso calculations from the zzso No difference in calculating zzso size was found between the two zzso calculations from the zzso It is concluded that the size of acoustic zzso i evaluated more equally by two observers using zzso than when using zzso By the use of repeated zzso it is possible to keep patients with acoustic zzso under observation and avoid operation in those patients where the zzso does not zzso
