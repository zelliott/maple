A zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent targeted to liver was developed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso groups onto the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso was used to formulate zzso zzso by zzso diffusion method, and then zzso was loaded onto the zzso by zzso with the unfolding zzso on the surface of the zzso zzso The mean size of the zzso was zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was measured, and the distribution in zzso was evaluated in zzso Compared with conventional contrast agent zzso the zzso zzso zzso showed significant enhancement both on liver targeting ability and imaging signal zzso The zzso and zzso zzso per zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso In addition, the signal intensity in zzso was stronger comparing with the zzso and the zzso weight time was lasting for zzso The liver targeting efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso in rats was zzso comparing with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed the potential as targeting molecular zzso contrast agent for further clinical zzso
