zzso zzso studies typically observe signals during two or more periods of differing cognitive activity which are then analyzed by a zzso to test for localized zzso zzso between cognitive zzso zzso activity found between task conditions is frequently assumed to reflect a novel cognitive process present in one task and not the zzso We present a conceptual framework that considers the neural mechanisms underlying such observed zzso zzso We propose that zzso experiments which present stimuli at a fixed pace (where each trial takes the same amount of zzso will be sensitive to changes in both duration and intensity of neural zzso In contrast, the signal observed during a zzso design is derived from neural processing averaged over the reaction time and hence could be less sensitive to differences in duration of neural zzso As an empirical demonstration of these ideas, we studied normal subjects using zzso functional zzso during two zzso tasks zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso performed using zzso and zzso zzso In both pacing designs, reaction times were greater in the zzso than zzso task, interpreted as a greater duration of neural processing during the zzso compared to the zzso zzso In the zzso design, significantly greater signal was present within a zzso cortical region during the zzso task compared to the zzso zzso This difference was not observed during the zzso zzso This result illustrates the importance of considering trial pacing in the interpretation of functional zzso zzso zzso
