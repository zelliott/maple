The potential role of zzso laser zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso is currently being zzso Since its introduction in 1983 it has evolved into an innovative minimally invasive zzso 

On the basis of a zzso literature search and the zzso experience, the principles, current state and prospects of zzso for zzso zzso are zzso 

Animal studies and early clinical studies have shown the safety and feasibility of zzso The site of interest can be approached at zzso or zzso and treatment is easily zzso Recent advances include the use of zzso with a zzso zzso light-emitting tip, the length of which is adaptable to zzso diameter, zzso zzso systems, simultaneous multiple zzso application, and zzso inflow zzso during laser zzso zzso allows complete destruction of zzso up to 5 zzso in zzso Currently a limitation is the lack of reliable real-time monitoring of zzso effects but progress in magnetic resonance imaging techniques should allow accurate temperature zzso to be obtained rapidly during zzso However, the actual benefit of zzso in terms of patient survival remains to be zzso 

In terms of tools and experience, zzso has now been developed sufficiently to study its effect on survival of patients with zzso zzso zzso
