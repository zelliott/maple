At high magnetic fields radiation losses, wavelength effects, zzso and the high resistance of typical components all contribute to increased losses in conventional zzso zzso zzso High zzso ceramic zzso zzso create strong uniform magnetic fields in a compact structure at high zzso and can potentially solve some of the challenges of high field zzso zzso In this study an zzso probe was constructed for operation at 600 zzso zzso using an zzso fed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso hollow bore zzso zzso The design has an zzso Q value greater than 2000, and the electric field is largely confined to the zzso itself, with near zero values in the hollow bore which zzso the zzso Experimental and simulation mapping of the zzso field show good agreement, with the ceramic zzso giving a pulse zzso approximately zzso less than a loop gap zzso of similar inner zzso High resolution images, with zzso dimensions less than 50 zzso have been acquired from fixed zzso samples, showing excellent zzso of several fine zzso
