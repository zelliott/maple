zzso disorder zzso patients suffer from risk zzso which may be zzso by their exaggerated response to threat and diminished response to zzso In this study, 13 zzso patients and 13 healthy matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while playing an interactive risky choice game encompassing distinct intervals of threat and zzso as well as anatomical diffusion zzso imaging zzso Compared to healthy controls zzso patients were reluctant to make risky choices during the zzso Furthermore, they displayed higher zzso zzso to zzso lower nucleus zzso zzso zzso to reward and reduced functional connectivity of the zzso and zzso to two frontal regions, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients also displayed reduced structural integrity in clusters within the zzso and zzso fiber zzso Finally, these deficits in zzso connectivity zzso both at the functional and structural level, were associated with severity of zzso symptoms, as well as with each zzso Our results thus suggest that risk zzso in zzso is zzso by abnormal zzso responses to threatening and rewarding zzso as well as by deficient functional and structural zzso zzso Such zzso characterization may aid in identifying neural zzso for treatment response and zzso individual targets for direct neural intervention zzso
