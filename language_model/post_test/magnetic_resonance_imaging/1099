The discovery and analysis of cortical visual areas is a major accomplishment of visual zzso In the past decade the use of zzso functional imaging, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has dramatically increased our detailed knowledge of the functional organization of the human visual zzso and its relation to visual zzso The zzso method offers a major advantage over other techniques applied in zzso by providing a large-scale zzso perspective that stems from its ability to image the entire brain essentially at zzso This bird's eye view has the potential to reveal large-scale principles within the very complex plethora of visual zzso Thus, it could arrange the entire constellation of human visual areas in a unified functional organizational zzso Here we review recent findings and methods employed to uncover the functional properties of the human visual zzso focusing on two zzso functional specialization and zzso zzso
