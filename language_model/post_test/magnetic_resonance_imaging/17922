Early visual areas contain specific information about visual items maintained in working memory, suggesting a role for early visual zzso in more complex cognitive functions zzso It is an open question, however, whether these areas also zzso the ability to internally generate images de zzso zzso mental zzso Research on mental imagery has to this point focused mostly on whether mental images activate early sensory areas, with mixed results zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso pattern analysis of neural activity patterns in visual regions can reveal zzso representations during cognitive zzso even though overall zzso levels are low zzso Here, we used this approach zzso zzso to study zzso activity patterns in early visual areas zzso when these items are internally zzso We could reliably decode stimulus identity from neural activity patterns in early visual zzso during both working memory and mental zzso zzso these activity patterns resembled those evoked by bottom-up visual zzso suggesting that mental images are indeed zzso in zzso These findings suggest that the visual zzso serves as a dynamic zzso zzso zzso that is used during both bottom-up stimulus processing and zzso internal generation of mental zzso
