An inverse zzso package which is capable of generating zzso dose distribution with zzso dose escalation is developed to achieve maximum equivalent uniform dose zzso for target while keeping the critical structure doses as low as zzso Relative cerebral blood volume zzso maps obtained with a dynamic zzso zzso zzso technique were used to delineate spatial zzso zzso The zzso zzso was converted to zzso zzso parameters zzso alpha and zzso based on previously reported correlations between zzso tumor grade, and zzso A software package, zzso developed using zzso zzso the zzso weights to achieve maximum zzso for target while limiting doses to critical zzso Using zzso we have generated zzso zzso zzso for selected patient zzso Depending on the variation of the zzso zzso the zzso dose escalation can be as high as zzso of the uniform dose as planned zzso The target dose escalation comes from both the zzso zzso and the elimination of integral target dose zzso The target zzso are found to be higher than those for the uniform dose planned ignoring the spatial zzso zzso The zzso for zzso at risk are found to be approximately equal to or lower than those for the uniform dose zzso In conclusion, we have developed a package that is capable of generating zzso dose zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso dose escalation may lead to increased treatment effectiveness as indicated by higher zzso The current development will impact biological image guided zzso
