Several zzso for measuring the cortical thickness in the human brain from MR image volumes have been described in the literature, the majority of which rely on fitting zzso models to the inner and outer cortical zzso However, the constraints applied during the model fitting process in order to enforce zzso zzso and to fit the outer cortical surface in narrow zzso where the zzso fluid zzso channel may be obscured by partial zzso may introduce bias in some circumstances, and greatly increase the zzso time zzso In this paper we describe an alternative, zzso based technique that measures the cortical thickness using inversion recovery anatomical MR zzso Grey matter, white matter and zzso are identified through zzso and edge detection is used to identify the boundaries between these zzso The cortical thickness is then measured along the local zzso surface normal at every zzso on the inner cortical zzso The method was applied to 119 normal volunteers, and validated through extensive comparisons with published zzso of both cortical thickness and rate of thickness change with zzso We conclude that the proposed technique is generally faster than zzso zzso alternatives, and free from the possibility of model bias, but suffers no reduction in zzso In particular, it will be zzso in data sets showing severe cortical zzso where thinning of the zzso leads to points of high zzso and so the fitting of zzso models is zzso
