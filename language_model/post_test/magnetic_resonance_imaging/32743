zzso zzso are an adjunct to obtain zzso closure after zzso zzso This study aims to characterize the appearance on MR imaging of 3 commonly employed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To this end, patients who underwent spinal zzso procedures that included the use of zzso zzso during closure were identified zzso zzso data on 15 patients, including complications such as zzso formation and infection, were zzso The appearance of zzso zzso on follow-up MR imaging scans within 3 days of surgery was zzso Fifteen patients were identified (5 with zzso zzso 5 with zzso and 5 with zzso applied during zzso with appropriately timed zzso MR imaging zzso All 3 substances were identifiable based on zzso location and imaging characteristics on zzso MR imaging in standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differentiation between zzso and zzso glue or zzso was not possible with the zzso or zzso zzso or with the zzso zzso zzso in intensity between zzso and zzso were also not significant on either zzso zzso but they were statistically significant on the zzso zzso All patients had an zzso zzso course, and no patients developed zzso zzso at 30 zzso This study concludes that zzso zzso zzso such as zzso glue and zzso are difficult to differentiate from zzso on standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso is easily recognized on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso therefore requires communication between the zzso and the zzso to avoid zzso zzso
