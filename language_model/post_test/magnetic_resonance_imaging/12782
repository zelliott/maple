We are developing a method for real-time magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of zzso delivery zzso of zzso viral zzso zzso to the zzso zzso By including zzso zzso zzso with zzso we can track the zzso movement of viral particles by continuous monitoring of distribution of surrogate zzso In order to validate this approach, we infused two zzso zzso and zzso into three different regions of zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso The procedure was tolerated well by all three animals in the zzso The distribution of zzso determined by zzso in both brain regions correlated closely with distribution of zzso determined by zzso zzso was weaker with zzso although in zzso PET scanning with zzso for zzso activity correlated well with zzso of zzso Although this is a relatively small study, it appears that zzso zzso better with zzso delivery than does zzso It seems likely that the difference in distribution may be due to differences in tissue specificity of the two zzso
