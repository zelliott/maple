zzso zzso is a well-known complication of breast implant surgery that can pass unnoticed by both patient and zzso To date, no prospective study has addressed the possible health implications of silicone breast implant zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether zzso zzso are associated with changes over time in magnetic resonance imaging findings, zzso zzso or zzso breast zzso A baseline magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed in 1999 on zzso women who were randomly chosen from a larger cohort of women having zzso breast implants for a median period of 12 years zzso 3 to 25 zzso A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging examination was carried out in 2001, excluding women who underwent zzso in the period between the two magnetic resonance imaging examinations zzso zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso the authors identified 64 women who had at least one zzso implant at the first magnetic resonance imaging examination and, for comparison, all women who had intact implants at both examinations zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance images from the two examinations were compared and changes in zzso zzso were zzso Comparisons were also made for zzso breast symptoms occurring during the study period and for changes in serum values of antinuclear zzso zzso factor, and zzso zzso zzso G and zzso zzso The majority of the women with implant zzso had no visible magnetic resonance imaging changes of their zzso zzso For 11 implants (11 percent) in 10 women, the authors observed progression of silicone zzso either as a conversion from zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as progression of zzso silicone zzso zzso zzso or as increasing zzso of the silicone within the zzso capsule zzso zzso zzso however, in most cases, these changes were zzso Some changes could be ascribed to zzso but others seemed zzso There was no increase in levels of zzso during the study period in either study zzso Women with zzso implant zzso reported a significant increase in zzso breast changes zzso ratio, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso compared with women without zzso On the basis of this first study of women with zzso silicone breast implant zzso the authors conclude that implant zzso is a relatively harmless condition, which only rarely zzso and gives rise to notable zzso Even so, because of a small risk of silicone spread, the authors suggest that women with implant zzso be followed zzso if not operated zzso Because implant zzso often occur zzso any woman with silicone zzso regardless of zzso status, should be evaluated at regular zzso
