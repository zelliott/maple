A simple method of measuring baseline zzso fluid volume fraction zzso ) in three-dimensional is proposed that used the characteristic of zzso fluid with very long zzso zzso It is based on the fitting of zzso zzso of only zzso fluid zzso using a zzso zzso preparation zzso zzso zzso and zzso acquisition also improves zzso ratio efficiency and brain zzso Both zzso and zzso are fitted zzso by zzso and analyzed in different cortical areas across zzso zzso is largely regionally dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Measured zzso was zzso zzso 146 zzso within cortical zzso as compared with zzso zzso 37 zzso from zzso zzso Different zzso set were zzso and the zzso of the new method is zzso zzso when comparing with the proposed approach, large zzso of zzso based method using zzso zzso images is found, and the underlying causes are zzso
