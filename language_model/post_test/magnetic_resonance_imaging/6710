zzso and functional abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso particularly the zzso and amygdala, have been described in people with zzso The authors hypothesized that parents of children with a diagnosis of zzso disorder would show similar changes in these zzso 

zzso resonance imaging scans were performed in 17 biological parents of children with a diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso The scans were compared with scans from 15 adults with zzso disorder and 17 zzso comparison subjects with no personal or familial history of zzso The volumes of the zzso amygdala, and total brain were measured in all zzso 

The volume of the left zzso was larger in both the parents of children with zzso disorder and the adults with zzso disorder, relative to the comparison zzso The zzso was significantly larger in the adults with zzso disorder than in the parents of children with zzso zzso The left zzso was smaller in the adults with zzso disorder, relative to the other two zzso No differences in total brain volume were observed between the three zzso 

The finding of larger zzso volume in zzso is suggestive of abnormal early zzso processes but is partly consistent with only one prior study and contradicts the findings of several zzso The finding of larger zzso volume for the parental group suggests a potential genetic basis for zzso abnormalities in zzso
