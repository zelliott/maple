Recent zzso studies have revealed zzso centers of zzso that appear to be linked specifically to zzso zzso Furthermore, there is evidence that these centers of zzso are more likely to be zzso represented in women than in zzso However, behavioral evidence of such zzso zzso or of related sex differences is somewhat zzso Two experiments were carried out to determine whether behavioral zzso of the zzso findings could be zzso The first experiment employed a zzso task used in a recent zzso study, in which two nonsense words were projected successively to the left or right sides of the visual zzso The results indicated that the left zzso was superior for this zzso An analysis of gender effects, however, revealed that the asymmetry was restricted to zzso The second experiment employed a zzso zzso detection task that was designed to determine whether the results of the first experiment could be confirmed in the context of a zzso task with a simpler zzso This experiment broadly supported the findings of the first zzso The results support the specialization of the left zzso for zzso processing, and the existence of gender differences with respect to these zzso
