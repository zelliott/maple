We examined the reliability of an zzso diagnosis prior to radical zzso for prostate zzso 

A radical zzso was performed in 24 patients with prostate zzso zzso specimens were fixed and 5 zzso step sections vertical to the zzso were prepared to resemble zzso zzso We compared this pathological map with the zzso zzso diagnosis which included zzso or seminal zzso invasion and tumor zzso in the zzso We defined a new criterion for the presence of zzso invasion as a chemical shift that occurred on the zzso side on zzso images 5 minutes after zzso zzso enhancement and the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso We also examined 4 diagnostic factors of tumor zzso including a zzso intensity area detected in the peripheral zone on zzso images, the presence of an enhanced area on zzso zzso images, and a low zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

The accuracy of a zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso invasion was zzso using the conventional criteria, but zzso adding the new zzso The accuracy of predicting seminal zzso invasion was zzso in a group using a body surface zzso compared to zzso in the group using an zzso surface zzso The zzso positive zzso value, sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing tumor zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This new criterion proved superior for diagnosing zzso invasion in prostate cancer zzso Also, analysis of tumor zzso in the peripheral zone demonstrated that cancer detection is increased if the zzso intensity area is enhanced by zzso
