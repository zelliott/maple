The optimal surgical treatment of zzso zzso is zzso especially in patients with zzso Various surgical approaches have included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fourth zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to differentiate zzso and zzso approaches in the treatment of zzso I zzso 

We reviewed the medical records and magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of 34 surgical zzso of zzso zzso performed at our institution from 1988 to zzso The age and sex of the patient, the presence of zzso the type of surgery zzso or zzso and the clinical outcome were zzso 

Eleven patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and C1 zzso without zzso Eight zzso of these patients had an improvement in zzso Seven of the 11 patients had zzso Of the six patients who underwent follow-up zzso three zzso had a decrease in the size of the zzso and all three had clinical zzso We also noted a zzso increase in zzso zzso volume on zzso zzso scans in these three patients, which was not observed in those without zzso Two of the three patients whose zzso did not decrease on follow-up zzso scans worsened zzso and one underwent a zzso with zzso zzso patients underwent combined zzso C1 zzso and zzso Twenty zzso of these patients had zzso Twelve of the patients who underwent zzso had zzso nine underwent follow-up zzso All nine of these patients zzso had a decrease in the cavity size, including eight with clinical zzso There were 10 minor complications zzso 4; superficial infection, 3; zzso fluid zzso 2; zzso meningitis and zzso nerve pain, 1) when the zzso was opened, compared with one superficial wound infection that resolved in patients who underwent zzso zzso 

zzso C1 zzso and zzso for the treatment of zzso I zzso may lead to a more reliable reduction in the volume of zzso zzso compared with zzso and C1 zzso zzso However, there seems to be a subset of patients whose symptoms will resolve and whose zzso cavity will decrease with the removal of bone zzso These patients seem to undergo a zzso increase in the zzso zzso Further studies are needed to better characterize these patients, to determine which patients with zzso I zzso are better served with zzso zzso only, and which will require zzso to resolve their zzso
