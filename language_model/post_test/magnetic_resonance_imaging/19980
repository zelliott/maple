zzso disease zzso is a rare zzso zzso caused by zzso protein 1 zzso gene zzso Previous studies indicated that zzso proteins zzso with zzso zzso are zzso and trapped in the zzso zzso zzso during transportation to the cell surface, which eventually leads to zzso cell death in zzso Here we report a zzso patient with a very mild zzso carrying a novel zzso zzso in zzso 4 of the zzso gene that causes a zzso substitution in the zzso We also investigated zzso trafficking of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to an enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso or a short zzso tag was not carried to the plasma zzso However, in contrast to previous studies, this zzso zzso was not retained in the zzso indicating an escape of the newly translated protein from the quality control zzso We also found that the zzso zzso accumulated in the nuclear envelope zzso in a zzso zzso This zzso zzso with its distribution outside the zzso and a very mild zzso supports the idea that zzso of zzso zzso protein in the zzso causes the severe zzso of zzso
