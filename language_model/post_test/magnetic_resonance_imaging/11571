In 26 patients with zzso zzso emergence of new zzso zzso were identified within 13 days from onset by zzso magnetic resonance zzso The identified zzso zzso were repeatedly zzso using zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence up to 600 days from zzso On zzso images taken by 23 days from zzso zzso zzso showed homogeneous zzso On the later zzso images beyond 25 days from onset they were observed as zzso zzso zzso in half of the zzso In the other patients, zzso zzso were observed as zzso areas with a zzso rim beyond 41 days from zzso which indicates zzso transformation with surrounding zzso These zzso images of zzso zzso differ from those of zzso zzso space which is observed as an area of simple zzso
