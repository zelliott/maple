To describe the magnetic resonance zzso findings in zzso functional zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 21 patients with 22 zzso proven by follow-up ultrasound zzso in 11 women and surgery in 10 women, had US and MR examinations within 24 zzso The study was limited to zzso with obvious an zzso zzso All patients had zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso spin echo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Four zzso zzso were zzso on zzso without and with fat suppression, and zzso on zzso Five zzso zzso were zzso on zzso images without and with fat suppression but zzso on zzso zzso Five zzso zzso were zzso on zzso images but showed intermediate signal intensity on zzso fat suppression images and zzso signal intensity on zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were entirely intermediate on zzso zzso Five zzso zzso displayed high signal intensity occupying less than zzso of the zzso content on zzso images and one zzso zzso displayed high signal intensity occupying more than zzso of the zzso zzso 

Despite an obvious zzso pattern on zzso zzso of zzso were zzso on zzso images and zzso were also zzso on zzso zzso Only zzso demonstrated intermediate or high signal intensity on zzso zzso
