To test the hypothesis that safety, zzso and image quality in pediatric patients who undergo deep sedation for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso heart disease zzso is similar to general zzso zzso 

zzso review of all zzso records from zzso Six hundred sixty patients underwent deep sedation zzso and 161 underwent zzso Statistics included analysis of zzso zzso analysis, and the zzso of zzso 

zzso included a broad spectrum of zzso No serious adverse events zzso including zzso and zzso occurred because of zzso There were 18 zzso zzso events in the zzso group with a success rate of zzso The zzso rate for patients undergoing zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso including 2 overnight hospital stays with a success rate of zzso zzso and success rates did not differ between the 2 zzso zzso blinded to the patient's group found no difference in image zzso Even in young zzso excellent image quality was zzso 

zzso of appropriately screened pediatric patients with zzso undergoing zzso is safe and well tolerated and yields high-quality images similar to zzso zzso should be considered for patients with zzso with zzso or airway compromise, in whom sedation has failed, or who have special zzso
