Although zzso applied zzso are quickly taken up by zzso cells, mainly zzso the interactions between engineered zzso and zzso are still not well zzso We therefore analyzed the zzso of zzso used zzso zzso iron oxide zzso of 60 zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso by human zzso By pharmacological and in zzso zzso approaches, the principal zzso mechanism for both particles was identified as zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso We developed a mathematical model of the zzso process that allows determination of key parameters of zzso including the rate of zzso the number of zzso per cell in zzso the mean zzso time, and the correlation between the number of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso The calculated parameters correlate well with experimental data obtained by zzso zzso Moreover, the model predicts the individual and collective wrapping times of different zzso describes the relation between zzso forces, membrane elasticity and the zzso zzso We also introduced a new physical zzso zzso governing the collective zzso process, a reflecting minimal linear spacing between simultaneously acting neighboring zzso zzso
