Exercise therapy is effective in improving symptoms of knee zzso but its effect on structural change remains zzso 

To describe the associations between physical activity and structural changes of the knee joint as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in adult male and female zzso 

A convenience sample of 325 subjects zzso age 45 zzso range zzso was measured at baseline and approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso of physical activity included questionnaire items, physical work capacity zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso cartilage volume, zzso plateau area, and cartilage zzso score zzso were determined using zzso fat zzso zzso 

zzso muscle strength at baseline was positively associated with both zzso changes in total cartilage volume zzso zzso zzso and lateral and total zzso plateau area zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not other zzso Change in muscle strength was zzso associated with annual changes in lateral and total zzso plateau area zzso zzso zzso and zzso In females only, zzso at baseline was zzso associated with zzso changes in lateral and total cartilage volume zzso zzso zzso and zzso and positively for lateral and total zzso plateau area zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso change in zzso was positively associated with changes in cartilage volume at all sites zzso zzso zzso For all associations, P zzso zzso 

Overall, these associations were modest in zzso but they suggest that knee cartilage volume and zzso plateau area are dynamic structures that can respond to physical zzso Greater muscle strength and endurance zzso especially in women, may be protective against cartilage loss, but it also may result in a zzso enlargement of zzso bone in both zzso suggesting that physical activity may have both good and bad effects on the zzso
