Imaging studies have demonstrated that prefrontal and zzso regions are activated during working memory zzso zzso Recently some molecular genetic studies reported associations between a functional promoter zzso of the zzso zzso 2 gene zzso that regulates the synthesis of zzso and zzso In 49 healthy Caucasian subjects the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso was tested by means of an imaging zzso approach in an zzso zzso zzso data showed an increased zzso for the zzso as compared to the zzso condition for a large network in prefrontal and zzso zzso Although zzso data showed no performance differences between the zzso groups of the zzso zzso a significantly stronger zzso of the zzso zzso carriers in BA 6, BA 46, and BA 40 was visible in contrast to the zzso and zzso zzso Present findings in zzso with previous findings support the hypothesis that zzso carriers compensate deficits in executive control functions by increased brain zzso
