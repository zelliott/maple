A retrospective magnetic resonance imaging zzso review of a series of patients who underwent a single-level anterior cervical zzso and fusion followed by anterior plate stabilization using an anterior cervical zzso mesh plate and screw zzso 

zzso evaluation of the long-term implant zzso properties of a zzso anterior cervical plate and the adjacent zzso soft tissue zzso 

The use of zzso anterior cervical plates for immediate cervical stabilization following an anterior cervical zzso and fusion presents several distinct advantages over metallic zzso zzso zzso may diminish, by their zzso zzso complications such as zzso migration, and failure of zzso as well as stress shielding of the underlying zzso Information on the intermediate and long-term zzso and soft tissue reaction to the zzso byproducts of these zzso is zzso 

There were 9 consecutive patients who underwent single-level anterior cervical zzso and fusion using zzso cortical bone, followed by zzso zzso anterior mesh plate and screw zzso Following institutional review board approval, 5 of the 9 patients agreed to zzso zzso assessment of the zzso zzso An independent zzso then characterized implant degradation, and the presence of soft tissue inflammation and swelling during the zzso phase of the zzso zzso 

At an average follow-up of 32 months, zzso assessment showed no evidence of soft tissue swelling or inflammation related to the zzso of a zzso anterior plate in any of the 5 zzso In addition, none of the patients complained of any zzso or zzso zzso 

Based on zzso assessment, these devices, at more than zzso zzso did not indicate any local chronic inflammation or swelling resulting from their zzso Clinical symptoms of zzso or zzso a common reported problem following anterior cervical spine procedures, were not observed in any zzso
