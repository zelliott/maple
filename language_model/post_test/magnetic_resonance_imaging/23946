In experimental allergic zzso zzso central nervous system zzso zzso imaging is achievable by zzso using zzso an zzso particle iron oxide contrast agent at a dose of 300 zzso zzso The objective was to test the feasibility at the human recommended dose of 45 zzso zzso 

Two groups of zzso rats were tested with zzso using 45 and 300 zzso zzso zzso Following zzso injection of zzso they were scanned after a delay of 4-6 and zzso zzso 

With a high dose of zzso all animals showed low signal intensity related to zzso zzso in the zzso At low dose no abnormalities were found in the zzso Furthermore, a delay of 4-6 h failed to demonstrate abnormalities even at high zzso 

zzso scanning delay after administration and blood zzso are major parameters for zzso zzso zzso zzso
