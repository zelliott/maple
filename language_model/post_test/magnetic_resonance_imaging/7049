This article presents the evaluation of an interactive zzso watershed zzso zzso for zzso tumors in magnetic resonance brain images of patients scheduled for zzso zzso 

The watershed method is compared with manual zzso with respect to zzso zzso and zzso 

In the 20 patients included in this study, the measured volume of the tumors ranged from zzso to zzso zzso A comparison of the tumor volumes measured with watershed zzso to the volumes measured with manual zzso shows that the two methods are interchangeable according to the zzso and Altman zzso and thus equally zzso The zzso of the watershed method and the manual method are compared by looking at the similarity of the segmented zzso The similarity for zzso and zzso zzso for watershed zzso is zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso and zzso for manual zzso from which it may be concluded that the watershed method is more zzso Moreover, the watershed zzso is on average three times faster than manual zzso 

The watershed method has an accuracy comparable to that of manual zzso and zzso manual outlining on the criteria of zzso and zzso
