The superior zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso structure in the zzso zzso whose superficial layers receive visual information from the zzso in a zzso zzso Despite the increasing number of studies investigating zzso projection in visual brain development and disorders, in zzso high-resolution zzso mapping of zzso organization in the zzso visual zzso has not yet been zzso This study explores the capability of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 200 zzso zzso resolution for in zzso zzso mapping of the rat SC upon partial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso One day after zzso zzso injection into both eyes, animals with partial zzso at the right superior zzso zzso nerve in Group 1 zzso exhibited a significantly lower zzso signal intensity in the lateral region of the left SC compared to the left zzso SC and right control zzso zzso zzso toward the zzso or zzso region of the right zzso zzso nerve in Group 2 zzso led to zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso region of the left zzso whereas a clear border was observed separating 2 halves of the left SC in all zzso Previous zzso and zzso studies showed that the retinal zzso cell zzso emanating from superior, inferior, zzso and zzso zzso projected respectively to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso SC in zzso While this zzso pattern is preserved in the zzso zzso zzso it was shown that partial zzso of the superior zzso zzso nerve led to primary injury predominantly in the superior but not inferior zzso and zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrated the sensitivity of zzso zzso for in zzso zzso mapping of the precise zzso projections in SC upon reduced zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso from localized regions of the anterior visual pathways to the zzso zzso zzso Future zzso studies are envisioned that measure the zzso changes in brain development, diseases, plasticity and zzso therapies in a global and zzso zzso
