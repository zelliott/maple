A zzso zzso 13-member panel representing the fields of zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso surgery, health services research, zzso internal medicine, and the zzso In addition, experts in these same fields presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of approximately zzso 

Presentations by zzso a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and zzso and an extensive bibliography of zzso research papers, prepared by the National Library of zzso Scientific evidence was given zzso over clinical anecdotal zzso 

Answering zzso questions, the panel drafted a statement based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific zzso The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the experts and the audience for zzso The panel then met in executive session to consider these comments and released a revised statement at the end of the zzso The statement was made available on the World Wide Web at zzso immediately after the zzso This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the zzso or the Federal zzso 

In the diagnosis of zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso have comparable sensitivity and zzso Patients undergoing zzso do not require zzso preoperatively if there is low probability of having zzso zzso common zzso duct exploration and zzso zzso are both safe and reliable in clearing common zzso duct zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and stone removal is a valuable therapeutic zzso in zzso with zzso zzso common zzso zzso acute zzso or zzso In patients with pancreatic or zzso cancer, the principal advantage of zzso is zzso of zzso obstruction when surgery is not zzso In patients who have pancreatic or zzso cancer and who are surgical candidates, there is no established role for zzso zzso drainage by zzso zzso sampling for patients with pancreatic or zzso cancer not undergoing surgery may be achieved by zzso but this is not always zzso zzso is the best means to diagnose zzso zzso zzso has no role in the diagnosis of acute zzso except when zzso zzso is zzso In patients with severe zzso zzso early intervention with zzso reduces morbidity and mortality compared with delayed zzso zzso with appropriate therapy is beneficial in selected patients who have either zzso zzso or pancreatic zzso Patients with type I zzso of zzso dysfunction zzso respond to zzso zzso zzso Patients with type II zzso should not undergo diagnostic zzso zzso If zzso of zzso zzso pressures are zzso zzso zzso is beneficial in some zzso zzso of unnecessary zzso is the best way to reduce the number of zzso zzso should be avoided if there is a low likelihood of zzso stone or zzso especially in women with zzso pain, a normal zzso and no other objective sign of zzso zzso zzso performing zzso should have appropriate training and expertise before performing advanced zzso With newer diagnostic imaging technologies emerging, zzso is evolving into a predominantly therapeutic zzso
