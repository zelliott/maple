We evaluated the zzso of functional MR imaging zzso onto brain images superimposed zzso for zzso identification of the central zzso In 20 volunteers and 12 patients with brain tumors located around the zzso cortex, zzso echo and large flip angle functional MR image was performed to allow zzso of flow effect and zzso related changes in relative large vein by motor hand zzso zzso MR image acquired was zzso on zzso anatomical image with zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso evoked zzso zzso were zzso The significant zzso area obtained from functional MR imaging was projected on an ascending cortical vein in 16 volunteers zzso and 10 patients zzso Comparing the anatomical zzso map with visual inspection of the exposed cortical surface made it easy to identify the zzso area during zzso The cortical veins in 9 of 10 were validated as a central vein by zzso cortical recording of zzso Combination of functional MR imaging zzso onto zzso anatomical image with zzso and zzso zzso permitted rapid and accurate zzso of the central zzso during zzso
