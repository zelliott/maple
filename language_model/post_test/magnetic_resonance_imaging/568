Recently, repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso has been introduced as an alternative treatment for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic patients that fail to respond to zzso Until now, application of zzso has been at low frequency, and most commonly applied to the left zzso zzso This zzso follow-up pilot study was performed to demonstrate the efficacy of high frequency zzso guided by anatomical and functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso 

Eleven patients with schizophrenia zzso were treated with high frequency (20 zzso zzso delivered over 2 zzso they were then followed for 6 zzso The target area was identified by zzso as the highest zzso cluster along the zzso part of the left superior zzso zzso from the zzso signal of each subject during a language zzso 

A significant reduction in global severity and frequency of auditory hallucinations between baseline and zzso day 12 was zzso zzso hallucinations were entirely relieved at zzso follow-up in 2 zzso The treatment was well tolerated in all zzso 

This is the first study reporting successful treatment of auditory hallucinations with 20 zzso zzso The efficacy at short term, the strength of the clinical response, the persistence of therapeutic effect over a zzso zzso the safety profile, and the short duration of treatment present a considerable therapeutic gain compared to low frequency zzso
