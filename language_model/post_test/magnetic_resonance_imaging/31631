The class of zzso zzso parallel imaging zzso methods has gained attention in recent years due to its ability to achieve high quality reconstructions even under challenging imaging zzso The aim of this work was to perform a formal comparative study of various zzso reconstruction techniques to evaluate their relative merits for certain imaging zzso A total of five different reconstruction methods are presented within a consistent theoretical framework and zzso compared in terms of the specific measures of reconstruction accuracy and efficiency using one-dimensional zzso Cartesian zzso It is shown that by treating the reconstruction process as two discrete zzso a zzso phase and a synthesis phase, the reconstruction zzso can be tailored to exploit the zzso advantages available in certain data zzso A new zzso reconstruction method is presented that performs the zzso phase in zzso zzso zzso and the synthesis phase in a hybrid zzso zzso space, enabling highly accurate zzso neighborhood reconstructions to be performed more efficiently than previously possible with conventional zzso This analysis may help guide the selection of zzso methods for a given imaging task to achieve high reconstruction accuracy at minimal zzso zzso
