zzso intrinsic zzso zzso zzso account for 1-2 % of adult zzso Their biological characteristics are scarcely understood and whether zzso are biologically different from zzso zzso remains to be zzso We analyzed 17 zzso samples for zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, in a subset with sufficient DNA amount, for zzso and zzso zzso zzso status, zzso profiling and zzso promoter zzso zzso A series of zzso adult zzso zzso was used for zzso Median age at diagnosis was 41 years zzso zzso zzso Median overall survival was zzso months zzso months for zzso zzso 16 months for high-grade zzso p zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed two zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso ) out of 7 zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are mostly non zzso in zzso zzso in contrast to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso in zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso ) versus zzso zzso zzso of the zzso high-grade zzso (four zzso zzso and two zzso zzso ) zzso zzso zzso The zzso array showed a higher frequency of zzso arm zzso gain, zzso gain and zzso loss in zzso compared to the zzso high-grade zzso which had a less frequent zzso 7 gain, and a less frequent zzso 10 zzso No zzso amplification was zzso These data suggest that adult zzso differ from adult zzso zzso In particular, zzso genes zzso zzso , zzso zzso ) zzso are frequent in adult zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso are zzso
