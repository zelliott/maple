Band zzso zzso or zzso zzso syndrome is a zzso migration disorder resulting in a diffuse band of zzso zzso matter and variable zzso of the zzso zzso Patients with zzso have a spectrum of zzso delay and zzso Associated zzso syndromes and zzso zzso findings have been zzso but zzso zzso patterns are zzso 

We describe the clinical, zzso and zzso zzso findings in two girls with zzso and intractable zzso 

zzso zzso patterns correlated well with clinical seizure types, and did not have features unique to zzso Similarly, seizure behaviors and zzso zzso findings were typical of those seen in symptomatic generalized zzso 

Despite evidence implicating the zzso zzso matter in seizure zzso we conclude that seizure zzso and associated zzso zzso patterns in zzso are no different from those seen in other causes of symptomatic generalized zzso
