Two cases with severe zzso were studied by means of zzso using surface zzso and also by magnetic resonance zzso zzso The first case was associated with multiple sclerosis and demonstrated a severe zzso zzso zzso and an alternate zzso of zzso muscles in the right zzso The second case, with zzso in the zzso demonstrated a severe zzso at rest and mixed zzso and alternating zzso of zzso muscles in the left zzso MR imaging studies localized zzso possibly responsible for these zzso In the first case a zzso was located in the superior zzso zzso just under the zzso and in the second case a zzso was found between the red nucleus and the thalamus, with possible involvement of both the zzso and zzso zzso The first case zzso with the theory that a zzso located in the zzso nucleus and its projection can cause severe zzso zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated in the second case may be responsible for zzso zzso at zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso
