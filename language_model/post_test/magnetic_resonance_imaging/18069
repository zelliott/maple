zzso zzso functional imbalance and disrupted zzso zzso are plausible mechanisms for zzso depression zzso zzso repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso effective in treating zzso zzso was administered to verify the core mechanisms underlying the zzso to zzso Thirty zzso patients received a zzso course of zzso zzso to the left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Depression scores were evaluated at baseline zzso and the ends of weeks 1, 2, and 14 zzso zzso were defined as those who showed an objective improvement in depression scores zzso after zzso zzso frontal alpha asymmetry zzso was measured by zzso at each time point as a proxy for zzso functional zzso zzso connections at zzso and zzso were assessed by studying zzso between prefrontal alpha waves and zzso zzso metabolism zzso reflecting intact zzso zzso A group of healthy control subjects received zzso at zzso zzso to study whether zzso could have a diagnostic value for zzso or received both zzso and zzso at zzso zzso to confirm the existence of zzso in the zzso zzso We found that zzso changes cannot differentiate between zzso and healthy subjects or between zzso and zzso No zzso were found in the zzso group at zzso whereas zzso of the zzso was demonstrated only in the sustained zzso at zzso and zzso healthy zzso In conclusion, we affirmed impaired zzso functional connections, but not frontal functional zzso as a core deficit in zzso
