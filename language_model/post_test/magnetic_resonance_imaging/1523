The present study was designed to investigate what kinds of adaptation occurred in the canine chronic zzso block model, which has been used to study zzso de zzso zzso Dogs at zzso days zzso zzso and zzso days zzso zzso after zzso block were zzso zzso effective zzso period and zzso action potential duration were prolonged in chronic animals compared with acute zzso zzso the zzso vulnerable period was prolonged in chronic zzso zzso zzso channel blocker zzso (1 and 10 zzso zzso was administered without zzso to estimate the feasibility of zzso zzso In chronic animals, zzso zzso followed by zzso was induced in one dog by the low dose and in all by the high dose, which was not observed in acute zzso MR images indicated increases of diameter and wall thickness of both zzso in chronic zzso The degree of zzso was prominent in the right zzso wall and zzso zzso Heart weight of the chronic animals was zzso times greater than that of normal control zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed zzso cell zzso with parallel increases of collagen fiber and zzso space in chronic zzso These zzso anatomical and zzso adaptations may zzso the chronic zzso block heart to drug-induced zzso zzso with enhanced risk of re-entry and early after zzso leading to the onset of zzso
