The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the results obtained in challenging knee zzso with the implant of an zzso scaffold and zzso treatment of all zzso The secondary aim is to compare the results obtained with those found when a zzso scaffold was zzso 

Patients affected by complex zzso of the knee zzso surface were zzso zzso zzso were defined according to the following criteria: previous clinical history of zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso zzso concurrent knee zzso realignment zzso concurrent zzso scaffold or zzso zzso and multiple zzso surface zzso zzso zzso patients were treated with the zzso of an zzso zzso The results of a homogeneous group of 23 patients previously treated and zzso evaluated after zzso of a zzso scaffold were analyzed and zzso 

zzso zzso score improved significantly from zzso zzso to zzso follow-up zzso zzso with a further improvement at the final evaluation at zzso zzso zzso The same positive trend was confirmed by the zzso and zzso zzso At final follow-up the group treated with the zzso scaffold presented a better zzso zzso score with respect to the group treated with the zzso scaffold zzso 

A zzso procedure to address the entire zzso unit, together with the treatment of all zzso might offer good results also in complex cases otherwise doomed to zzso zzso
