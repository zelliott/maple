zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural zzso in subjects instructed to silently read novels at ordinary and rapid zzso Among the 19 subjects, 8 were experts in a rapid reading zzso zzso pressed a button to turn pages during reading, and the zzso between turning pages was recorded to evaluate the reading zzso For each subject, we evaluated zzso in 14 areas and at 2 instructed reading zzso zzso zzso decreased with increasing reading speed in the left middle and zzso superior zzso area, left inferior frontal area, left zzso area, and the anterior zzso areas of both zzso which have been reported to be active for linguistic zzso while neural zzso increased with increasing reading speed in the right zzso zzso which is considered to reflect zzso zzso Despite the considerable reading speed differences, correlation analysis showed no significant difference in zzso dependence on reading speed with respect to the subject groups and instructed reading zzso The zzso reduction with speed increase in zzso areas was opposite to the previous reports for low reading zzso The present results suggest that subjects reduced linguistic processes with reading speed increase from ordinary to rapid zzso
