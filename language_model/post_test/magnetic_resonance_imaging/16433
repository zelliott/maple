The zzso zzso network refers to cortical areas that are active in the absence of zzso zzso In previous studies, decreased activity in the zzso zzso has always been associated with increased zzso in zzso zzso We show that the induction of hypnosis can reduce anterior default mode activity during rest without increasing activity in other cortical zzso We assessed brain zzso patterns of high and low zzso people while resting in the zzso scanner and while engaged in visual tasks, in and out of zzso High zzso participants in hypnosis showed decreased brain activity in the anterior parts of the default mode zzso In low zzso people, hypnotic induction produced no zzso changes in these regions, but instead zzso areas involved in zzso The findings indicate that hypnotic induction creates a distinctive and unique pattern of brain zzso in highly zzso zzso
