We apply functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso analysis methods to study the coordinate frame in which zzso are represented in the human zzso zzso performed a zzso zzso task in which zzso eye movements were executed from several starting points to various zzso Response patterns during the memory period for zzso zzso were correlated in the frontal eye fields and the zzso zzso zzso indicating a zzso zzso Interestingly, response patterns in the middle aspect of the zzso were also correlated for zzso made to the same destination point, even when their movement zzso was zzso Thus, this region also contains information about zzso destination in (at least) a zzso coordinate zzso This finding may explain behavioral and zzso studies demonstrating that eye movements are also anchored to an zzso or an zzso representation of space rather than strictly to the retinal visual input and that zzso zzso is involved in maintaining these representations of zzso
