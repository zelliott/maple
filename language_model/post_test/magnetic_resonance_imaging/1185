The current experiment examined the neural zzso of response selection, comparing conditions that required participants to make zzso selections from sets of same-sex faces zzso inconsequential zzso to choosing a dinner date from zzso faces zzso consequential zzso In each of these tasks, either a single face zzso no zzso or two or three faces zzso free zzso appeared for zzso The results revealed that regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as an area along the zzso surface of the superior frontal zzso were activated by both consequential and inconsequential decisions, thereby providing evidence for a common selection zzso zzso decisions were further zzso by zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The implications of these findings for current accounts of response selection and zzso functioning are zzso
