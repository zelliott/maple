We determined connectivity of the human brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while subjects experienced auditory stimuli in a zzso zzso zzso The two factors in this study were zzso zzso or different zzso and zzso zzso or different zzso zzso studies allow us to ask how zzso remote brain regions are zzso related given these zzso In the context of this study, we examined how the zzso effect and zzso effect influenced these zzso We applied a zzso connectivity method that determines zzso functional networks of functionally connected brain zzso zzso in these functional networks is determined by conditional probabilities of elevated zzso For example, a brain region that becomes active a zzso of the time of another region is considered ascendant to that brain region in the zzso zzso For each factor level, we found a baseline functional network connecting the primary auditory zzso zzso Area zzso zzso with the BA 42 and BA 22 of the superior zzso zzso zzso We also found a baseline functional network that includes zzso Area zzso 22 zzso zzso and BA 44 for each factor zzso However, we additionally observed a strong ascendant connection from BA 41 to the zzso zzso zzso 30) and zzso Area and a stronger connection from zzso Area to zzso and the zzso zzso while passively listening to different sentences rather than the same sentence zzso Finally, our results revealed no significant zzso effect or interaction between zzso and zzso
