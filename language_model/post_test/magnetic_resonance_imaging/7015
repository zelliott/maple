This study examined the effects of varying the predictability of zzso events on behavior and neural zzso using a rapid zzso functional magnetic resonance imagery zzso zzso Twelve adult subjects were scanned with echo zzso imaging during performance of a visual detection task where the probability of events (target and zzso zzso This task included expected and unexpected zzso events zzso target, unexpected zzso and omission of zzso in a design that closely parallels studies of zzso function and reward processing in the alert zzso We predicted that zzso in zzso areas of the zzso would behave like the animal literature shows that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Specifically, we predicted increased activity in these regions when an unexpected event occurred and decreased activity when an expected event was zzso Two main regions, the anterior zzso and zzso zzso showed this zzso The response in these regions was distinguished by enhanced anterior zzso activity following the occurrence of an unexpected event and greater suppression of zzso activity following the omission of an expected zzso These results suggest that neural activity within specific zzso brain regions can be modulated by violations in the expectation of zzso events and that the direction of the zzso depends on the nature of the zzso
