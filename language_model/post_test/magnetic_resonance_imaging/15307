This study investigated the association of zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and cerebrovascular disease zzso matter zzso zzso zzso zzso with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease zzso among cognitively normal older zzso 

zzso of developing zzso was examined for 155 cognitively normal older adults zzso years, zzso women, zzso zzso The zzso volumes and the presence of zzso and of zzso zzso were determined from brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso at the beginning of the zzso zzso cognitive evaluations zzso zzso zzso identified those who developed zzso 

The presence of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, those participants with both zzso zzso and at least one brain zzso had a zzso increase in the risk of developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to those who had neither of these zzso 

In cognitively normal older adults, markers of zzso (as reflected by zzso zzso and of cerebrovascular disease (as reflected by zzso on zzso independently contribute to the risk to develop zzso
