The aim of this study was to evaluate the regional effects of type 2 diabetes and associated conditions on cerebral tissue volumes and cerebral blood flow zzso zzso 

zzso was examined in 26 diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 25 control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects using continuous zzso spin labeling zzso imaging during zzso zzso and CO2 zzso Regional gray and white matter, zzso fluid zzso and white matter zzso zzso volumes were measured on a zzso inversion recovery zzso echo and a fluid zzso inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging at 3 zzso 

The diabetic group had smaller global white zzso zzso zzso and gray zzso zzso zzso matter and larger zzso zzso P zzso zzso volumes than the control zzso Regional differences were observed for white matter zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the frontal region, for zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso region, and for gray matter zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regional zzso zzso zzso zzso and CO2 zzso zzso zzso zzso were reduced in the diabetic zzso zzso in the frontal region was associated with gray matter zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso was associated with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and greater zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso 

Type 2 diabetes is associated with cortical and zzso zzso involving several brain regions and with diminished regional cerebral zzso and zzso zzso diabetes may further contribute to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood flow zzso that affects zzso frontal and zzso regions may have implications for zzso and balance in elderly subjects with zzso
