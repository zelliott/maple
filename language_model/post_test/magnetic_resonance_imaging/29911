zzso jugular zzso zzso behave differently from zzso arising zzso The differences have important clinical, imaging, and surgical zzso We reviewed the imaging appearances of primary jugular zzso zzso and evaluated them for features that might assist in zzso them from other common jugular zzso zzso 

A retrospective review identified five cases of primary jugular zzso zzso We defined it as primary when it was centered in the jugular zzso and secondary when it was centered in the zzso zzso with secondary extension into the jugular zzso Secondary jugular zzso zzso were excluded from this zzso Eight cases of jugular zzso zzso and 10 cases of jugular zzso zzso were reviewed for zzso 

zzso zzso was characterized by zzso zzso surrounding the skull base zzso a zzso appearance to the bone margins of the jugular zzso zzso and prominent zzso tails zzso zzso voids were absent in all zzso zzso showed localized skull base zzso with zzso zzso spread into the middle ear cavity zzso zzso voids and zzso destruction of the bone margins of the jugular zzso were zzso zzso caused expansion of the jugular zzso with zzso zzso bone margins, without skull base zzso 

zzso jugular zzso zzso is characterized by extensive skull base zzso A zzso pattern of spread, a zzso appearance of the bone margins of the jugular zzso the presence of zzso tails, and an absence of flow voids are particularly important features that assist in zzso primary jugular zzso zzso other more common jugular zzso zzso
