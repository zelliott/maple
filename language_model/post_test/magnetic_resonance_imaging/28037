The authors assessed the capability of magnetic resonance imaging in measuring bone mineral density in zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso technique, the zzso effect zzso was measured in zzso zzso in zzso zzso density was measured with single energy quantitative zzso zzso zzso The values of the zzso effect were correlated with calcium zzso 

A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between signal loss due to zzso zzso and the calcium density in the region of zzso The change in zzso per unit change in density was zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in volunteers and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

To some extent, zzso of bone density is possible using magnetic resonance zzso however, the relatively wide zzso of the zzso effect, plotted against the calcium density in the zzso zzso indicates that other factors, such as the three-dimensional structure of bone zzso may play important roles in determining magnetic resonance zzso
