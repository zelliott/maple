zzso zzso is the most prevalent liver disorder in the developed zzso It is closely associated with features of zzso syndrome, especially insulin resistance and zzso The two most common conditions associated with fatty liver are alcoholic liver disease zzso and zzso fatty liver disease zzso Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for the assessment of liver fat, but there is a need for less invasive diagnostic zzso New imaging zzso are emerging, which could provide more detailed information about zzso tissue or even replace zzso In the present review, available imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso magnetic resonance zzso are presented which are employed to detect or even zzso the fat content of the zzso The advantages and disadvantages of the zzso imaging zzso are zzso Although none of these techniques is able to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso and to reveal all features visible using zzso the proposed diagnostic zzso offer a wide range of additional information such as anatomical and zzso information zzso In particular, magnetic resonance imaging and zzso magnetic resonance zzso are able to zzso the zzso fat content hence avoiding exposure to zzso Except for zzso magnetic resonance zzso all zzso offer additional information about regional fat distribution within the zzso MR zzso which can estimate the amount of fibrosis, also appears promising in the differentiation between simple zzso and zzso
