The aims of this study were to zzso describe the evolution of neurological signs after the zzso period in infants with zzso zzso and abnormal outcome and zzso to establish the relationship between the evolution of neurological signs and patterns of zzso on brain zzso 

Fifteen children with low zzso scores, abnormal neurological signs at the end of the zzso period, and abnormal outcome were examined at 1 - 2 weeks, 5 - 7 weeks, and 6 zzso All the infants had at least one zzso scan performed in the zzso zzso 

All infants had persistent abnormalities on all examinations performed but the severity of neurological impairment was variable and was related to the pattern of brain zzso zzso with severe zzso zzso and white matter zzso showed abnormal zzso and limb tone, movements, and visual function on all the examinations and none achieved independent zzso In infants with moderate zzso zzso zzso and/or severe white matter changes, visual function and feeding improved by 5 - 7 weeks and were still normal at 6 months while limb tone, which was reduced in the first weeks, appeared to be normal at 5 - 6 weeks but was found to be increased at 6 zzso all were able to sit unsupported at 2 years and most of them achieved the ability to walk with zzso 

Our results suggest that the evolution of the neurological patterns after the zzso period in infants with zzso zzso abnormalities depends on their pattern of brain zzso
