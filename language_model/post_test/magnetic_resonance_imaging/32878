The aim of this study was to zzso the magnitude of changes of the apparent zzso zzso zzso relaxation time zzso induced by inhalation of pure oxygen zzso ) or zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso ) versus baseline breathing of room zzso Eight healthy volunteers underwent zzso zzso echo MR imaging at zzso and zzso zzso zzso relaxation time maps were zzso and average zzso was measured in regions of interest placed in the zzso zzso and zzso The largest zzso changes were measured in the zzso zzso with a relative zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as compared to room air for oxygen breathing zzso and zzso and zzso zzso for zzso breathing, respectively at zzso At zzso the corresponding values were zzso and zzso zzso for oxygen breathing and zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso As a result, we showed that zzso zzso zzso times responded strongly to inhalation of zzso zzso which may be attributed to the hypoxic condition of the zzso and subsequent reduction in zzso
