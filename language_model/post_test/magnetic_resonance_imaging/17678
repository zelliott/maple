Previous studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging with late zzso enhancement zzso may identify slowly conducting zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To test the feasibility of zzso simulation based on zzso to estimate zzso targets in zzso 

We conducted a retrospective study in 13 patients who had zzso magnetic resonance imaging for zzso VT zzso We used zzso simulation to induce VT and estimate target regions according to the simulated VT zzso The estimated target regions were zzso with the zzso zzso map and the zzso sites from the zzso map in the standard zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso VT was zzso in 12 zzso zzso All zzso showed zzso propagation patterns, and the zzso zzso of estimated target region that an zzso line should span to prevent VT recurrence was zzso zzso zzso zzso Of 11 patients who underwent zzso the results of zzso simulation and the standard approach were consistent in 9 zzso patients, where zzso within the estimated target region was associated with acute success zzso zzso 8) and zzso outside the estimated target region was associated with failure zzso zzso zzso In 1 zzso case, the results of zzso simulation and the standard approach were inconsistent, where zzso outside the estimated target region was associated with acute zzso 

The zzso simulation can be used to estimate potential zzso targets of zzso zzso The zzso simulation may be a powerful zzso tool for zzso planning of zzso procedures to potentially reduce the procedure time and complication zzso
