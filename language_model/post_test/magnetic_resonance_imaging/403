A UK zzso study compared the performance of contrast zzso resonance imaging with zzso zzso in women at high-risk of breast cancer zzso in zzso zzso criteria were used to identify women with at least zzso annual risk of breast zzso 

Women at high breast cancer risk, with a strong family history and/or high probability of a zzso zzso were recruited from 22 zzso Those not known as gene carriers were asked to give a blood sample, which was tested anonymously for zzso Women ages 35 to 49 years were offered annual screening for 2 to 7 zzso Study eligibility at entry was assessed zzso by detailed examination of zzso and overall eligibility accounting for computer risk assessment and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso women entered for screening were ineligible using the strict entry zzso Thirty-nine zzso were detected in zzso zzso in study zzso 21 per zzso Including zzso further years zzso 28 more breast zzso were identified (12 of zzso zzso rates for zzso eligible women were 22 of 1,000 in study and 13 of 1,000 in total zzso compared with 9 of 1,000 and 4 of 1,000, respectively, in 78 ineligible zzso Breast cancer rates were higher for zzso than zzso after testing zzso samples in this selected population at 65 of 1,000 in study and 36 of 1,000 in total follow-up for zzso compared with 44 of 1,000 and 27 of 1,000 for zzso 

zzso enforcement of study criteria would have minimally improved the power of the study, whereas testing for zzso in advance would have substantially increased the detection zzso
