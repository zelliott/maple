zzso zzso imaging zzso parameters such as mean zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso assess aspects of structural integrity within zzso In zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso abnormalities in normal appearing brain tissue zzso have been shown zzso The evolution of these abnormalities over time is zzso We present a zzso study investigating early zzso zzso zzso The aims were to determine zzso changes over two years and assess the potential of zzso as a zzso quantitative marker at this stage of zzso Fifteen controls and 28 patients with zzso zzso zzso disease duration zzso years; median zzso zzso had zzso yearly for two zzso zzso and whole brain tissue zzso plus zzso zzso and MD zzso zzso At zzso differences in zzso were noted between patients and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak height zzso zzso zzso while at two years differences in MD were observed zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak location zzso zzso zzso However there were no significant zzso differences in zzso rates of change between patients and zzso In conclusion, although subtle zzso abnormalities were detected in early zzso zzso the absence of zzso change suggests a limited role for global zzso assessment of zzso in following the early disease zzso
