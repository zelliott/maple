To zzso evaluate the usefulness of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for differentiation of zzso from benign zzso at zzso zzso 

The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study, and informed consent was zzso Forty patients with zzso underwent zzso zzso MR imaging in addition to zzso and zzso zzso chemical shift imaging techniques, and dynamic zzso MR imaging at zzso MR imaging zzso In each patient, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed with b values of 0 and 800 zzso In each patient, zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso MR imaging was performed at baseline zzso during the zzso phase, and 1, 2, 3, and 5 minutes after contrast zzso Diagnosis was based on zzso findings in surgical zzso Independent samples zzso test was used to compare zzso of benign and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analysis was used to test the ability of zzso in zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso in dynamic zzso patterns between zzso and benign zzso were zzso 

zzso diagnoses revealed that 29 zzso (three from both adrenal zzso of the same zzso were benign and 13 were zzso With b values of 0 and 800 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was larger than that of benign ones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the difference was significant zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso obtained with b values of 0 and 800 zzso were effective for distinguishing zzso from benign zzso zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso A threshold value of zzso zzso zzso zzso permitted distinction with high sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso In dynamic zzso MR imaging, zzso zzso got peak signal intensity earlier (at zzso zzso than benign ones (at 1 minute after contrast zzso 

In our limited study, zzso in zzso imaging with b values of 0 and 800 zzso and dynamic zzso pattern of zzso zzso were significantly different from that of benign ones, suggesting that zzso imaging and dynamic zzso MR imaging may be useful in zzso characterization and prognosis of zzso especially for those without obvious zzso and vascular zzso
