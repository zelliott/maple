The purpose of this work was to characterize the zzso imaging features of Kikuchi zzso 

A search of our hospital records yielded three patients with zzso proven Kikuchi zzso CT, zzso and ultrasound examinations of these patients were reviewed to characterize the imaging features of Kikuchi zzso 

zzso of the neck in one patient, CT of the chest and abdomen in another, and CT and zzso of the abdomen in the third demonstrated zzso enhancing small zzso zzso in larger than normal numbers in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter was usually zzso zzso and was always zzso zzso 

Many small clustered zzso zzso may be a characteristic imaging feature of Kikuchi zzso The abdominal extent of disease may be underreported if zzso imaging is not zzso
