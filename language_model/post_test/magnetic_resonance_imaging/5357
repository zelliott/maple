zzso factors, zzso personality traits such as zzso and brain processing of salient stimuli all can affect individual risk for zzso One of very few confirmed genetic association findings zzso zzso from zzso is with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the association of two of these zzso zzso with measures of alcohol symptoms, zzso and with zzso zzso zzso during anticipation of reward or loss using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In a sample of 173 families zzso zzso 129 of whom had at least one member diagnosed with alcohol dependence or abuse, carriers for the G zzso in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more likely to have alcohol dependence symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso Personality zzso zzso zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a stronger effect in women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso are corrected for family history and zzso A subset of offspring from these families zzso 20 zzso zzso for zzso participated in an zzso study using a monetary incentive delay zzso Increased zzso zzso during reward zzso zzso and loss zzso zzso anticipation was correlated with zzso zzso and further associated with the zzso zzso for both zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso genetic variation is associated with zzso through variation of zzso activity responses, here evidenced during anticipatory zzso
