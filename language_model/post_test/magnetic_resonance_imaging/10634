zzso brain volume may impose constraints, through longer information transfer delays, on the distributed networks supporting zzso Here, we assessed the relative effects of brain volume and other putative zzso of the functional zzso of zzso language areas, as zzso with zzso during both a language comprehension and a language production zzso In the case of language comprehension zzso zzso a linear combination of zzso zzso surface, brain volume and zzso could explain almost zzso of the functional asymmetry observed in the zzso zzso Without brain volume, the goodness of fit was significantly decreased zzso P zzso zzso and zzso the effect of zzso was not detected zzso This was due to the fact that in our sample, left-handers zzso zzso zzso had a significantly larger brain volume as compared to right-handers zzso zzso 8, P zzso zzso As for language production zzso zzso brain volume and the zzso zzso also played a zzso However, in this case, the main predictor of functional zzso was zzso where a greater degree of zzso was associated with larger zzso of left inferior frontal zzso Depending on the language component of interest, these results support different zzso zzso theories on zzso zzso Left specialization for comprehension could be attributed to the constraints of processing speech zzso while a zzso origin of language is mostly supported by the relation we observed between left specialization for production and zzso
