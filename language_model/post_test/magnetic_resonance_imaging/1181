zzso for the analysis of statistical zzso maps zzso can be zzso grouped into three main categories in which different zzso are applied to delineate activated zzso These being type I error control zzso false discovery rate zzso control zzso and zzso probability zzso To better understand the properties of these main approaches, we carried out a simulation study to compare the approaches as they would be used on real data zzso Using default settings, we find that zzso probability zzso is the most powerful approach, and type I error control zzso provides the lowest levels of type I zzso False discovery rate control zzso performs in between the other approaches for both these criteria, although for some zzso settings this approach can approximate the performance of zzso probability zzso Based on these results, we discuss the relative merits of the three approaches in an attempt to decide upon an optimal zzso We conclude that viewing the problem of zzso areas of zzso as a zzso problem provides a highly zzso framework for comparing the zzso Within this zzso we highlight the role of the loss function, which explicitly penalizes the types of errors that may occur in a given zzso
