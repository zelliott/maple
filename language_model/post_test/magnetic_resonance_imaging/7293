Increased zzso zzso groove distance zzso is one potential correcting zzso in patients suffering from lateral zzso zzso It was hypothesized that zzso extension of the knee might influence the zzso distance on MR zzso 

zzso zzso MR images of the knee were acquired at full extension, zzso and zzso zzso of the knee in 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso 3 zzso zzso 256 zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso 150 zzso Two observers independently measured the zzso at all zzso 

Mean zzso for observer 1 was zzso zzso zzso zzso at full extension, zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Mean zzso for observer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at full extension, zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Mean values were significantly different zzso zzso zzso between full extension and zzso as well as zzso zzso for both zzso Mean values were significantly different zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso for observer 1, but not for observer 2 zzso zzso agreement was very good zzso correlation zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The zzso increases significantly at the zzso extension of the zzso zzso the zzso of published zzso values measured on zzso CT and zzso at various zzso angles of the knee are zzso
