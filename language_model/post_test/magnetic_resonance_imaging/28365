A zzso method is presented to zzso electromagnetic fields inside a 2 zzso high resolution, zzso detailed model of a human head for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The method uses the zzso zzso zzso in combination with the fast zzso transform to solve a zzso equation resulting from the zzso of an zzso equation representing the original physical zzso Given the current distribution in an zzso zzso the method can zzso both the electric field zzso the specific energy zzso rate zzso and the magnetic field, also known as the B1 zzso zzso for the zzso and B1 field distribution, excited by a linear and a zzso zzso zzso are calculated and presented at 64 zzso 128 zzso and 256 zzso corresponding to the operating zzso of the zzso zzso 3 T and 6 T zzso zzso It is shown that compared with that at 64 zzso the zzso at 128 zzso is increased by a factor over 5 and the zzso at 256 zzso is increased by a factor over 10, assuming the same current strength in the zzso Furthermore, compared with the linear zzso the average zzso for the zzso zzso is reduced by a factor over 2 and the maximum zzso is reduced by a factor over zzso It is also shown that the B1 field at high zzso exhibits a strong zzso which is attributed to zzso zzso
