zzso intentions are transmitted by many zzso cues, including gaze direction, body zzso and facial zzso However, little is known about how these visual social cues are integrated over time in the brain and, notably, whether this binding occurs in the emotional or the motor zzso By zzso magnetic resonance and zzso imaging in humans, we were able to show that, 200 zzso after stimulus zzso the zzso zzso integrated zzso zzso and emotion displayed by a zzso At earlier zzso emotional content was processed independently in the zzso zzso zzso whereas directional cues zzso direction with pointing zzso were combined at zzso zzso in the zzso and supplementary motor zzso These results demonstrate that the early binding of visual social signals displayed by an agent engaged the zzso zzso and the zzso cortex, possibly to facilitate the preparation of an zzso response to another person's immediate zzso
