zzso imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso are relatively new MR techniques increasingly used in acute zzso During the first hours of stroke evolution, the regions with abnormal zzso are typically larger than the zzso zzso and this mismatch region has been suggested to be zzso at zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso mismatch region in acute stroke patients and find parameters indicative of both zzso progression and functional zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso zzso stroke were zzso with zzso zzso and conventional zzso within 24 hours of symptom onset and after 1 week; in addition, the European Stroke zzso zzso score was zzso With zzso the volumes of regions with zzso zzso delays of zzso 4, 6, 8, and 10 seconds were zzso these volumes were compared with the acute zzso zzso volumes, final zzso size, and zzso zzso 

In zzso of patients the acute zzso zzso was surrounded by regions with abnormal zzso delays zzso zzso A zzso delay of zzso s in the mismatch region was found to be associated with zzso enlargement between the initial and follow-up zzso zzso zzso increased in 9 of 12 patients zzso in whom the area with zzso delay zzso s was larger than the zzso zzso but they increased in only 1 of 8 zzso of the remaining patients, in whom the area with a zzso delay zzso s was smaller than the zzso zzso The volume of the regions with zzso delays of zzso s correlated better with zzso zzso zzso than other zzso (or zzso volumes, which indicated that a zzso delay of approximately 4 s might be the threshold for functional impairment of brain zzso 

Only patients with severe zzso deficits in the zzso mismatch zzso delays of zzso zzso are at high risk of zzso zzso zzso more moderate zzso deficits zzso delays zzso and zzso zzso appear to also contribute to the acute clinical zzso
