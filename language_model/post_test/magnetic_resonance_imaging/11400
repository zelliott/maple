zzso for functional neurosurgery performed using a linear accelerator zzso has not been extensively characterized in zzso zzso In the present study, the properties of a newly designed zzso zzso were evaluated in a dedicated zzso which produced zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso formation was determined in zzso in three animals by examining magnetic resonance zzso images to show the zzso precision of targeting and the geometry and extent of the zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted to determine the extent of zzso zzso zzso 

In three male zzso zzso the zzso nucleus zzso one zzso and the zzso zzso of the lateral zzso zzso zzso two zzso were targeted by a zzso Shaped zzso Surgery System that included a zzso zzso and delivered a maximum dose of 150 zzso zzso resonance images obtained 4, 5, and 9 months zzso were zzso and the animals were killed so that zzso zzso could be zzso 

The generation of precise zzso zzso by a zzso zzso was validated in studies that targeted the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The extent of the zzso created in all animals remained restricted in diameter zzso 3 zzso throughout the duration of the studies, as assessed by reviewing MR zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso were contained within the zzso and zzso target areas and that there were persistent increases in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso for zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso regions of the zzso were suggestive of zzso zzso zzso This zzso approach may be of particular interest for the induction of zzso of the zzso and zzso in studies of experimental zzso as well as for the development of potential zzso treatments for Parkinson zzso
