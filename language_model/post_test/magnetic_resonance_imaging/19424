There is a need for an accurate zzso diagnostic test for zzso zzso disease zzso We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of bilateral zzso high signal on magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the diagnosis of zzso 

zzso from patients with zzso and controls zzso with suspected zzso were zzso zzso were reviewed on two separate occasions by two zzso and scored for the distribution of changes, and likely final zzso zzso from zzso cases were zzso to reach a consensus on all zzso 

We zzso 36 patients and 57 zzso zzso patients were correctly identified based on bilateral zzso high signal in 29 of 36 and 32 of 36 cases on the first assessment by the two zzso and 32 of 36 and 31 of 36 on their second zzso zzso increased zzso signal was identified in one of 57 and one of 57 controls on the first assessment and two of 57 and three of 57 controls on the second zzso These reported changes in controls were graded as zzso in six of seven patients and moderate in one zzso of all control zzso zzso of the assessments in zzso cases were graded as moderate or zzso On consensus review, 28 of 36 cases and none of 57 controls had prominent bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso Other common zzso features of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso matter high zzso and the notable absence of cerebral zzso zzso high signal correlated with zzso zzso 

In the appropriate clinical context the zzso identification of zzso increased zzso signal is a useful zzso test for the diagnosis of zzso
