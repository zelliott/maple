This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso defects in comparison with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

This prospective study included 50 patients zzso age, 66 zzso years; zzso zzso with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent zzso zzso using zzso zzso CT as well as zzso cardiac zzso using a zzso zzso Estimates of diagnostic accuracy in detecting zzso zzso defects were zzso compared with those of cardiac zzso 

The estimates of diagnostic accuracy in detecting zzso zzso defects using zzso were as zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso value, zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso imaging were positively correlated with those of cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Mean effective radiation doses for stress zzso imaging and rest coronary zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging enables detection of zzso zzso However, further technical developments are necessary to reduce artifacts and improve the sensitivity of zzso
