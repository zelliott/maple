In zzso elderly age-related decline in zzso volume has often been observed, but it is not clear if this loss is disproportionate relative to other brain zzso Few studies examined age-related volume loss of the zzso zzso We investigated the association of age with zzso and zzso zzso zzso volumes in a large sample of middle-aged and older persons without zzso Within the zzso study, zzso analyses were performed in 453 zzso subjects zzso age zzso years, zzso zzso with a history of zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes were assessed by manual zzso on three-dimensional fast zzso sequence zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso volumes of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso volumes were divided by zzso volume zzso as well as total brain volume zzso to determine whether age-related differences were disproportionate relative to other brain zzso Total crude zzso volume was zzso zzso and total crude zzso volume was zzso zzso Linear zzso analyses adjusted for sex showed that with increasing age, zzso volume divided by zzso decreased (B per year zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso However, no age-related decline in zzso volume relative to zzso was observed (B per year zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso No age-related decline in zzso volume relative to zzso or zzso was zzso In this population of zzso patients with a history of vascular disease no age-related decline in zzso zzso volume was observed and although zzso volume decreased with age, it was not disproportionate relative to total brain zzso
