The aim of this study was to define the most efficient way of performing cardiac zzso for zzso information in small experimental animals, using a vertical magnetic field with a strength of zzso T zzso zzso This information may be used to improve cardiac zzso in infants and small children, since the size of a rabbit is considered comparable to that of a zzso Experimental zzso cardiac zzso studies were performed in a rabbit under general zzso in order to study the effects on image quality of changing various imaging zzso These are zzso number of zzso zzso number of zzso levels, echo time zzso and repetition time zzso The effects of changing the size of the field of view zzso the slice thickness and the zzso direction were also zzso We found that zzso was crucial and that three zzso TE 16 zzso and zzso vertical zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso slice thickness and zzso 20 zzso were zzso
