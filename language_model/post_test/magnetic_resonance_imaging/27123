The aim of this work was to establish a new, fast, and robust method of zzso zzso for magnetic resonance imaging of zzso zzso zzso The method called zzso measurement with zzso inversion is based on acquiring images from periodically zzso zzso zzso created using the spatial zzso of zzso zzso By measuring the zzso of the area where the zzso was zzso by the spatial zzso of zzso preparation in phase images, the flip angle can be generated using a simple zzso To validate and establish the limits of the proposed method, zzso measurement with zzso inversion acquisitions were simulated and applied to zzso and zzso zzso He zzso Then, the zzso procedure was applied during zzso zzso He magnetic resonance imaging in a healthy zzso The advantage of the zzso measurement with zzso inversion method compared with the conventional method based on the assessment of zzso is that it is free of errors induced by relaxation due to zzso by imperfect zzso slice profile and by any diffusion of zzso He into and out of the zzso Another advantage is that it does not require image processing with external software and therefore can be performed using the implemented tools on the magnetic resonance zzso
