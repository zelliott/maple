We investigated neural zzso of human visual zzso using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso When subjects voluntarily directed attention to a peripheral location, we recorded robust and sustained signals uniquely from the zzso zzso zzso and superior frontal zzso (near the frontal eye field, zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso only, the blood oxygen level dependent signal was modulated by the direction of zzso The zzso and zzso also maintained the most sustained level of zzso during a zzso zzso when subjects maintained attention at the peripheral cued location zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso form a zzso network that controls the zzso allocation and maintenance of zzso zzso A separate right zzso network was activated by the detection of targets at unattended zzso zzso was largely independent of the target's location zzso zzso This network included among other regions the right zzso junction and the inferior frontal zzso We propose that this cortical network is important for zzso to sensory zzso
