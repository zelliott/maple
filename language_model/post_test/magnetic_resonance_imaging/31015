Our concept of computer assisted surgery is based on the combination of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso zzso providing anatomical and functional guidance zzso zzso imaging evaluates the extent of a zzso while the additional use of functional zzso which displays the position of eloquent brain areas in the operative field, prevents increasing neurological deficits, which would otherwise result from extended zzso Up to mid 2001 we performed zzso MR imaging using a zzso zzso zzso scanner in 330 zzso The main indications were the evaluation of the extent of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso MR imaging proved to serve as zzso quality control with the possibility of an immediate modification of the surgical strategy, zzso extension of the zzso Integrated use of functional zzso prevented increased neurological zzso Compared to routine zzso or zzso imaging being performed with zzso machines, zzso image quality and sequence spectrum could not zzso This led to the development of the concept to adapt a zzso MR scanner to the operating environment, preserving the benefits of using standard zzso equipment and zzso zzso guidance with integrated functional data, which was successfully implemented by April zzso Up to the end of 2002, 95 patients were investigated with the new zzso zzso image quality, zzso zzso as well as enhanced sophisticated zzso imaging possibilities are the major benefits of the zzso zzso
