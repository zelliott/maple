The type of contrast enhancement kinetic curve zzso persistently zzso zzso or zzso seen on dynamic zzso zzso zzso of the breast is zzso of zzso zzso estimates of the type of curve are most commonly used for interpretation of zzso The purpose of this study was to compare qualitative and quantitative methods for determining the type of contrast enhancement kinetic curve on zzso 

zzso patients underwent breast zzso The type of zzso kinetic curve was assessed zzso by three zzso on two zzso For quantitative assessment, the slope of the zzso curve was zzso Kappa statistics were used to determine zzso and zzso agreement for the qualitative zzso zzso sample tables, the zzso test, and receiver operating characteristic zzso curve statistics were used to compare quantitative versus qualitative methods for establishing or excluding zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso and 23 zzso were zzso For the qualitative assessment, the zzso and zzso agreement was good zzso zzso zzso with an area under the zzso curve zzso of zzso For the quantitative method, the highest zzso was zzso reflecting significantly higher diagnostic zzso compared with qualitative assessment zzso zzso zzso for the difference between the two zzso 

zzso assessment of the type of contrast enhancement kinetic curve on breast zzso resulted in significantly higher diagnostic performance for establishing or excluding zzso compared with assessment based on the standard qualitative zzso
