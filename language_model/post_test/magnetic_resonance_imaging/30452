The aim here is to show that texture parameters of magnetic resonance imaging zzso data changes in zzso tissue during zzso Ten patients having zzso zzso masses in the abdomen were zzso for chemotherapy response evaluation three consecutive zzso The analysis was performed with zzso texture analysis zzso zzso The best discrimination in zzso zzso texture was obtained within zzso images between the zzso and the second response evaluation zzso zzso proved to be a promising quantitative means of representing zzso tissue changes during medication zzso
