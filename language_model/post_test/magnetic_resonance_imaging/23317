Aging affects various structural and zzso properties of the zzso However, associations among various aspects of brain aging are zzso Moreover, those properties and associations among them may be modified by zzso increase in vascular zzso In this study, we measured volume of brain regions that vary in their vulnerability to aging and estimated local iron content via zzso zzso In 113 healthy adults zzso years zzso we examined prefrontal zzso zzso primary visual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso In some regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso age-related differences in iron and volume followed similar zzso However, in the zzso structures, volume and iron content exhibited different age zzso Whereas age-related volume reduction was mild in HC and absent in zzso iron content evidenced significant age-related zzso In zzso participants significantly greater iron content was noted in all examined zzso Thus, iron content as measured by zzso may be a sensitive index of regional brain aging and may reveal declines that are more prominent than gross anatomical zzso
