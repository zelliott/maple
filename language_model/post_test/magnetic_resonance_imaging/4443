This study was aimed at assessing the MR patterns of transient osteoporosis of the hip and, consequently, the role of zzso in the diagnosis and follow-up of this zzso Even though this condition was originally observed in pregnant women, young or middle-aged men are most frequently zzso There is a spontaneous onset of pain, usually progressing over several zzso The patients have no risk factors for zzso they may have a history of minor trauma and there is a possible relationship to the third zzso of zzso Laboratory values are zzso zzso may be severe enough to cause the patient to limp and to impair joint zzso The possible causes of transient osteoporosis have been debated by many authors and include zzso zzso zzso dysfunction and transient or zzso zzso zzso osteoporosis is a zzso disease which does not require surgical zzso The differential diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip is very important because this condition may simulate cancer, septic arthritis, zzso or avascular zzso We report the initial and follow-up features of transient osteoporosis of the hip on the MR images of 6 patients zzso zzso zzso age: zzso years, zzso zzso zzso The right side was involved in 3 patients, the left side in 2 zzso The patient with bilateral transient osteoporosis was a woman in the 3rd zzso of zzso In all patients, zzso was performed with an zzso T MR zzso The MR changes in our 6 patients were rather uniform and included zzso decrease in the signal intensity of the affected bone zzso on zzso images and increased signal intensity on zzso and STIR images, with no evidence of focal zzso This pattern is known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All the patients received conservative zzso The clinical symptoms and the MR abnormalities zzso completely within 6-10 months, with no late zzso To zzso this follow-up MR study demonstrates the zzso zzso character of transient osteoporosis of the zzso Until the natural history of the zzso pattern is better zzso we suggest a conservative management of this condition, especially in the patients with no risk factors for zzso zzso and MR follow-up is zzso
