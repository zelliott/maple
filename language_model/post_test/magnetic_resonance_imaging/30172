The presence of cerebral white matter zzso zzso on zzso is suggested to be a zzso factor for vascular zzso and zzso To investigate the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso we performed brain zzso to evaluate the presence of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and deep white matter zzso zzso zzso determined the zzso pulse wave zzso zzso as a marker of zzso zzso in 132 elderly zzso subjects zzso men and 83 women, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in 41 zzso and 53 zzso subjects, zzso The zzso values were significantly greater in subjects with zzso than in those zzso zzso also tended to be associated with zzso but the correlation was not statistically zzso In multiple zzso zzso analysis, age and decreased zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso was also detected as an independent factor for the appearance of zzso zzso odds zzso zzso zzso but not zzso These results indicate that the increase in zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso rather than zzso Although further study is needed to clarify the difference between zzso zzso our study suggests that the measurement of zzso is a simple and useful tool for detecting cerebral zzso zzso
