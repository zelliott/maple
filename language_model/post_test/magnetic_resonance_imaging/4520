Previous work has shown that zzso in the lateral zzso involving the zzso nucleus impair both reaching and pinching movements in humans and zzso This study addressed the question of whether disruption of the zzso zzso at the level of the zzso would produce behavioral deficits similar to those seen after zzso zzso We compared the performance of both reaching and pinching movements in patients with lateral zzso zzso and in patients with discrete zzso of the zzso zzso The patients with zzso zzso had minimal or no sensory loss and no zzso signs, suggesting that the abnormal movements were due to disruption of the zzso projection to the zzso We found that zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in impaired pinching movements, but remarkably normal reaching movements with the exception of a slight zzso This is in contrast to the profound pinching and reaching zzso of patients with lateral zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso about the functional organization of zzso output are zzso
