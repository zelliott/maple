49 primary zzso masses were studied by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in an effort to differentiate benign from zzso zzso There were 24 benign and 25 zzso zzso Images were evaluated for the presence of zzso zzso changes in pattern of zzso signal intensity, and margin definition and zzso 20 of the 25 zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and two of the 24 benign zzso zzso also demonstrated this zzso zzso zzso tended to change pattern from being homogeneous on zzso images to being zzso on zzso images zzso zzso zzso maintained their pattern on both sequences zzso Only three of the 24 benign zzso zzso changed from being homogeneous to zzso Our findings suggest that zzso which change pattern, from homogeneous on zzso images to zzso on zzso images, and zzso which have zzso zzso are likely to be zzso zzso benign zzso tend to have well defined margins, and some benign masses have characteristic appearances that aid in their differentiation from zzso zzso
