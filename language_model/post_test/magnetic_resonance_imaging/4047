We used magnetic resonance zzso zzso in ten patients with injuries to the zzso zzso and compared the findings with those obtained by conventional zzso and zzso CT zzso In the presence of complete zzso zzso zzso zzso a post-traumatic zzso was detected by MR zzso In injuries to the upper roots (three zzso MR zzso showed abnormal findings with a high signal intensity in the nerve zzso obliteration of the damaged nerve zzso or enlargement and obliteration of the root zzso No zzso were detected in these zzso injuries by MR zzso and zzso The overall accuracy of detection of damaged nerve roots or root sleeves was better with MR zzso than with conventional zzso and was similar to that of zzso MR zzso is zzso relatively zzso requires no contrast zzso provides imaging in multiple projections, and is comparable in diagnostic ability to the more zzso time-consuming techniques of conventional zzso and zzso
