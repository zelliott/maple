To compare volumes and doses of zzso and zzso at risk with zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging in cervical cancer zzso 

zzso previously zzso patients with cervical cancer suitable for radical treatment were zzso All patients underwent zzso using a magnetic resonance zzso zzso followed by both zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The zzso and zzso at risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso were contoured on zzso zzso using only clinical findings and on magnetic resonance imaging using zzso zzso The volume and doses for zzso and zzso at risk were evaluated using zzso zzso 

When magnetic resonance imaging information is not included in zzso on zzso zzso images, there is significant zzso of zzso height and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso clinical target volume in zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The volumes and doses to zzso 1 and 2 zzso for zzso at risk were also zzso 

zzso resonance imaging remains the gold standard for zzso zzso but zzso zzso with clinical information can give comparable results, which need to be studied zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used comfortably for zzso of zzso at zzso
