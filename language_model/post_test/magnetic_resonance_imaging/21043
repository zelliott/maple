We have employed structural equation models to explicitly distinguish zzso zzso in cognitive task performance zzso zzso from the zzso that is unrelated to a zzso process zzso zzso Together zzso and d comprise zzso zzso Although d represents only a minor fraction of the total zzso in cognitive task performance, it is more strongly associated with zzso severity than is zzso In this analysis, we replicate zzso in a new zzso the University of Kansas Brain Aging Project, and associate it specifically with regional zzso matter zzso by zzso zzso of magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso variable d zzso to elements of the default mode network and related structures in the R zzso
