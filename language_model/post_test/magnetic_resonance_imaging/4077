To zzso by means of MR phase imaging, the effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso motion in the spinal zzso 

zzso pulse sequences with zzso zzso zzso were used to examine 12 patients with cervical zzso and 6 normal zzso zzso phase images at 3 levels zzso middle and zzso were obtained with prospective zzso zzso The middle level was set at the site where the spinal zzso was most severely zzso and the zzso and zzso sections were set where it was not zzso zzso zzso were generated at these 3 levels and focal zzso change was correlated with motor function in the lower zzso 

The zzso showed a higher motion zzso at the zzso level than at zzso zzso This paradoxical increase in zzso was observed in 7 out of 8 patients whose lower zzso motor function was zzso Four patients with normal lower zzso motor function did not demonstrate this increase in zzso An increase in motion zzso was therefore found to correlate with impaired lower zzso motor zzso
