To describe serial changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso in acute human infection from two outbreaks of zzso virus zzso relate these changes to disease zzso and compare zzso encephalitis to reported cases of zzso virus zzso 

The zzso images of three human cases zzso of which were zzso of acute zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso selectivity early in the disease is evident in all three patients, while deep white matter involvement appears to be a late and possibly zzso zzso This apparent early zzso matter selectivity may be related to viral biology or zzso zzso zzso loss is evident at zzso and the rate of progression of zzso abnormalities can predict the outcome of the zzso In both fatal cases, the serial changes in the zzso picture mirrored the clinical zzso 

This is the first comprehensive report of serial zzso findings in acute human cerebral zzso infection from two zzso The cortical selectivity appears to be an early finding while deep white matter involvement a late, and possibly zzso zzso In both fatal cases, the serial changes in zzso mirrored the clinical zzso
