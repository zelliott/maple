We study the zzso trajectory of zzso and function of the superior zzso zzso zzso in children zzso zzso adolescents zzso zzso and young zzso We analyze cortical surface landmarks and functional zzso zzso responses to voices, other natural categories and tones and examine how zzso asymmetry and zzso zzso change across zzso Our results show stable zzso zzso across age groups, including a larger left zzso zzso and a deeper right superior zzso zzso zzso analyses show that a rightward zzso for zzso responses is present in all groups but decreases with zzso Furthermore, zzso responses to voices change from being less selective and more zzso diffuse in children to highly selective and focal in zzso Interestingly, the analysis of zzso landmarks reveals that zzso zzso increases during development in the zzso not in the zzso Similarly, zzso zzso of zzso functional responses to voices, other categories and tones increases with age in the right zzso Our findings reveal zzso zzso changes in brain regions crucial for auditory and voice zzso The age-related increase of zzso zzso in right zzso suggests that anatomy and function of this region are shaped by unique individual zzso zzso
