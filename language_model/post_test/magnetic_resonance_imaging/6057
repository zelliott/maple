This study compares the zzso of the zzso and FAIR zzso zzso spin labeling zzso schemes to form quantitative zzso maps at zzso field, 7 zzso zzso and high field, 3 zzso Phantom experiments were performed to compare the inversion efficiency and profile of the labeling zzso at 7 T and 3 T and to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso weighted zzso signal was measured at a range of zzso delay times and quantitative zzso maps were calculated on a zzso zzso An increase in zzso signal was found with field strength, and together with the increased zzso ratio, this led to improved image zzso and quality of fit of zzso maps at 7 zzso
