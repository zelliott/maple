Spinal zzso surgery is usually not difficult and is commonly associated with good zzso However, advanced age and severe neurological deficit have been considered to be zzso of poor surgical zzso zzso we attempted to assess the surgical outcome of spinal zzso in the elderly and to analyze the role of outcome zzso 

From 1990 to 2006, 32 patients 76 years or older with spinal zzso were operated on in our zzso zzso All patients had zzso Neurological status was assessed using the zzso zzso Neurological evaluations were conducted three months and one year after zzso The mean follow-up was 36 zzso A multiple zzso zzso was applied to establish the relationship between the risk factors and zzso 

The median age was zzso zzso The mean duration of symptoms until surgery was zzso zzso One patient was rated zzso grade I, 11 grade II, 17 grade III and three patients were rated grade zzso zzso tumor removal was performed in 30 patients zzso All zzso were zzso There was no zzso morbidity was zzso and zzso mortality was zzso One year after surgery, all patients had improved, 56 % had recovered zzso Among 20 patients with severe zzso or zzso 30 % had recovered zzso There was no statistical correlation between outcome and various risk factors: age, zzso zzso tumor size, quality of tumor zzso and zzso Only zzso zzso score and duration of symptoms before surgery were statistically zzso 

Surgery is the only treatment of symptomatic spinal zzso Advanced age did not seem to zzso surgery, even in those with severe zzso neurological deficits, because quality of life can be improved in the vast majority of zzso There was a correlation between duration and severity of deficit and zzso
