The purpose of this report was to demonstrate the normal complex zzso anatomy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso using magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso and zzso zzso 

Ten zzso zzso were used according to institutional zzso MR zzso spin echo imaging was performed to demonstrate aspects of the complex zzso zzso insertions of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso on MR imaging were correlated with those derived from zzso and zzso zzso 

Generally, the zzso revealed a low signal in all MR images, except near the level of the zzso zzso where the zzso suddenly changed direction and zzso zzso artifact could be zzso In five out of ten specimens zzso a type I accessory zzso bone was found in the zzso In all cases with a type I accessory zzso bone, the zzso had an altered signal in this zzso zzso and zzso planes on MR imaging were the best in identifying the zzso insertions of the zzso A normal division of the zzso was observed just zzso to the zzso into the zzso bone in five specimens zzso occurring at a maximum zzso distance from its attachment to the zzso bone of approximately zzso to 2 zzso In the other five zzso in which a type I accessory zzso bone was present, the zzso directly inserted into the accessory bone and a slip less than zzso zzso in thickness could be observed attaching to the zzso aspect of the zzso bone zzso zzso inspection confirmed the sites of the zzso insertions of the components of the zzso 

MR imaging enabled detailed analysis of the complex zzso insertions of the zzso as well as a better understanding of those features of its zzso that can simulate a zzso
