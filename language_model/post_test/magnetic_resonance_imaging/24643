Unexpected changes in the location of a target for an upcoming action require both zzso zzso and motor planning zzso In both zzso and human brain, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in both phenomena but its zzso role is still zzso Here we used zzso zzso over the putative human zzso zzso a zzso region in the zzso part of the anterior bank of the zzso zzso during an attention and a reaching task requiring covert shifts of attention and planning of reaching movements toward cued targets in zzso We found that zzso increased zzso to zzso cued but not to zzso cued targets during both the attention and reaching zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso induced a zzso of reaching zzso toward visual fixation and that this zzso was larger for zzso cued zzso The results suggest that zzso signals are used by human zzso area to rapidly update the current motor plan or the ongoing action when a zzso relevant object unexpectedly occurs in an unattended zzso The current findings suggest a direct involvement of the zzso zzso visual stream in zzso zzso and a more specific role of zzso area in the zzso zzso control of reaching zzso
