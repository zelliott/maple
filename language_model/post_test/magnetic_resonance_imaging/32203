zzso resonance zzso imaging provides useful information for characterization of various zzso masses as zzso or zzso and, when zzso on a spectrum from benign to zzso The use of MR imaging for diagnosis of zzso masses includes consideration of zzso characteristics and signal intensity characteristics on zzso and zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso masses, zzso and solid masses, and predominantly solid masses provide important zzso In general, zzso masses represent benign tumors, whereas zzso and solid masses are strongly associated with zzso zzso solid masses include benign, borderline zzso and zzso zzso zzso images provide useful information for characterization because zzso zzso masses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be correctly diagnosed when the mass has high signal zzso zzso low signal intensity in solid masses on zzso images is indicative of zzso and Brenner tumors because extensive zzso tissue produces significant low signal intensity on zzso zzso A strategy for diagnosis of zzso masses with MR imaging incorporates signal intensity characteristics into zzso zzso
