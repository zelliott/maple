zzso resonance imaging zzso and clinical parameters are associated with disease progression in multiple sclerosis zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether adding zzso parameters to a model with only clinical parameters could improve these zzso 

89 patients (55 zzso with recently diagnosed zzso had clinical and zzso evaluation at baseline zzso of zzso and at follow-up after zzso zzso zzso clinical data were available, including disease type zzso or zzso and zzso as measured by the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters included zzso Brain Volume zzso at zzso percentage brain volume change zzso zzso and zzso loads and spinal zzso zzso zzso of disability zzso in zzso of at least 1 point at zzso was the main outcome zzso For a model containing only clinical zzso the added value of zzso parameters was tested using zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso loads at follow-up were significantly higher in the group with zzso Adding zzso to a clinical model improved the model, indicating that zzso parameters added independent information zzso 

The rate of cerebral zzso conveys added information for the progression of disability in patients with early zzso suggesting that clinical disability is determined by neurodegenerative changes as depicted by zzso
