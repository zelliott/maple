zzso zzso zzso matures with age, alongside other markers of increased impulse control, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability to refrain from preference of immediate zzso in zzso of delayed, larger zzso As such, they measure zzso foresight and the ability to delay gratification, functions that develop slowly into zzso We investigated the neural maturation that accompanies the previously observed age-related zzso changes in discounting, from early adolescence into zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of a hypothetical zzso task with monetary rewards delayed in the week to year zzso We show that age-related reductions in choice zzso were associated with changes in zzso in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were specifically associated with zzso reductions in impulsive choice, as part of a more extensive network of brain areas showing age-related changes in zzso including zzso zzso inferior zzso cortex, and zzso zzso The zzso pattern of functional connectivity included strengthening in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and insular zzso during selection of delayed alternatives, and between zzso and VS during selection of immediate zzso We conclude that zzso mechanisms within zzso zzso zzso zzso the observed zzso reductions in impulsive choice with increasing age, and that this effect is dependent on increased zzso zzso within a network of areas associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
