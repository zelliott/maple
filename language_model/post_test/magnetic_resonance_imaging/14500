zzso zzso deposition zzso is commonly observed on brain zzso scans of patients treated for childhood zzso zzso The authors sought to determine the clinical significance of zzso and its relationship to patient age, radiation dose, and cognitive zzso 

A zzso retrospective study of 93 zzso patients at zzso Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford from 1998 to 2011 identified 41 patients with a negative baseline zzso scan and at least 2 zzso zzso scans obtained with zzso zzso recalled echo zzso The number and cumulative rate of zzso zzso by zzso were compared between patients aged 6 years and younger zzso zzso and aged zzso years zzso zzso at the time of zzso zzso and between zzso zzso zzso and high-dose zzso zzso zzso 

The median age at zzso diagnosis was zzso years zzso zzso zzso the median clinical follow-up period was zzso years zzso zzso zzso and the median zzso overall survival was zzso zzso zzso Of 30 zzso children with zzso 21 zzso required special education, and the median zzso of 10 tested patients was 100 zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had zzso after a median zzso of zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso percent zzso of zzso of the zzso arose in the zzso region of the brain, whereas 29 zzso resided in the zzso or the zzso No spinal zzso were observed on routine spine zzso scans using zzso fast spin echo zzso The mean cumulative zzso rate per year was zzso zzso zzso and this rate was higher in older children at the time of zzso compared with younger children zzso vs zzso per year, p zzso zzso but did not differ among different zzso doses zzso zzso zzso A child's zzso or need for special education showed no significant correlation with the rate of zzso development or number of zzso None of the zzso resulted in symptomatic zzso that required surgical zzso 

More zzso was observed in children treated for zzso at the older ages than in those treated at the younger zzso There was no significant association of the zzso of zzso with radiation dose or cognitive zzso and none of the zzso required surgical zzso
