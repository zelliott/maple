Brain zzso during executed zzso and imagined movements zzso of the right and left hand was studied in 10 healthy right-handed subjects using functional magnetic resonance imagining zzso Low zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso of the imagined movements were trained prior to image zzso Regional cerebral zzso was measured by zzso during zzso and IM and compared to resting zzso zzso selected regions of interest zzso were marked zzso over the entire zzso In each zzso activated zzso above a zzso value of zzso zzso were counted and zzso In all subjects the supplementary motor area zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the primary motor zzso zzso showed significant zzso during both zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso was significantly activated only during zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased during IM compared to zzso In the zzso IM and zzso differed in their zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was observed in the anterior lobe zzso zzso H zzso during zzso whereas a lower maximum was found about zzso zzso zzso zzso H zzso during zzso The prefrontal and zzso regions revealed no significant changes during both zzso The results of cortical activity support the hypothesis that motor imagery and motor performance possess similar neural zzso The differential zzso in the zzso during zzso and IM is in accordance with the assumption that the zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of movement execution during zzso
