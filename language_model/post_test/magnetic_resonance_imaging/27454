Members of two seemingly unrelated zzso of Arab zzso origin presented with pronounced early onset zzso zzso of upper and lower zzso mild intellectual zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The authors performed neurological and zzso examinations on the affected zzso The authors conducted whole zzso linkage and zzso zzso followed by sequencing of candidate zzso zzso and protein expression zzso and finally proof of principle investigations on zzso zzso zzso injected zzso 

The authors zzso a novel form of zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of brain and spinal zzso were zzso Within a single significantly linked locus the authors ultimately identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein sorting zzso zzso zzso fully zzso and segregating with the disease in both zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso injected zzso supporting the zzso relationship between zzso in this gene and the zzso described in the patients of this zzso 

The authors provide evidence for the involvement of zzso a member of the zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso system, in upper motor zzso zzso The zzso system has been shown to play a central role in zzso trafficking, in the maturation of zzso bodies and the sorting of zzso membrane proteins into internal zzso zzso Further investigation of mechanisms by which dysfunction of this gene causes zzso will contribute to the understanding of zzso trafficking of zzso by the zzso machinery and its relevance to zzso
