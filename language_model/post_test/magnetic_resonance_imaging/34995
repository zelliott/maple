One of the zzso features of zzso personality disorder zzso is language zzso The focus of this study was to determine whether or not there are also processing abnormalities of pure tones differing in pitch and duration in zzso 

Thirteen zzso male subjects met full criteria for zzso and were zzso on age and parental zzso status to 13 comparison zzso zzso learning was measured with the California zzso Learning zzso zzso zzso volumes were measured using structural zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns in an auditory task of listening to tones including pitch and duration zzso were compared between zzso and control zzso In a second and separate zzso analysis we found that peak zzso in superior zzso zzso zzso zzso Areas 41 and 42, was correlated with verbal learning and clinical measures derived from the zzso zzso 

In the region of the zzso zzso subjects demonstrated more zzso to pitch zzso zzso zzso and to duration zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects also showed more bilateral zzso zzso zzso to duration zzso In no region did comparison subjects activate more than zzso subjects in either zzso zzso correlations for zzso subjects suggest a relationship between peak zzso on the right for zzso tones in the pitch experiment with odd speech and impaired verbal zzso There was no difference between groups on zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso subjects have inefficient or zzso processing of pure tones both in terms of pitch and duration zzso that is not attributable to smaller zzso zzso zzso Finally, these auditory processing abnormalities may have significance for the odd speech heard in some zzso subjects and downstream language and verbal learning zzso
