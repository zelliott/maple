The concept of selective zzso is based on zzso insights into the zzso of the zzso region and the definition of the clinical syndrome of zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging allows correlation of the site of zzso conspicuous tissue with anatomical zzso The highly variable zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso however, definitely zzso the zzso analysis of zzso defined subdivisions of the zzso zzso The goal of this study was to define individual variations in the zzso anatomy on the basis of zzso MR images obtained in patients suffering from zzso 

The authors analyzed zzso MR images obtained in 50 patients for the presence of and intrinsic relationships among the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The surface relief of consecutive sections of 100 zzso zzso was zzso outlined and the resulting maps were used for visual zzso The zzso were characterized by measurement of their depth, distance to the zzso horn, and zzso The anatomical zzso and zzso of zzso patterns were assessed for statistical correlation with patients' histories and the zzso of the seizure zzso 

zzso assessment shows that patient sex is a significant factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso are significantly decreased on the side of the seizure origin, which relates to loss of white matter, a known zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso resonance imaging allows for accurate zzso knowledge of individual zzso patterns and zzso zzso orientation to anatomical zzso
