It is always difficult to interpret zzso zzso But as a research method, zzso magnetic stimulation zzso has so many degrees of freedom that zzso results are often dismissed as zzso We feel that this may be unnecessary, if not zzso zzso results seem to inherently fulfill an important role in brain zzso In fact, without zzso results, zzso as an enterprise would not make zzso We argue that zzso results are similarly important in zzso zzso By itself, zzso research leaves room for doubt concerning whether or not an activated region is actually necessary for intact task zzso zzso methods such as zzso can therefore complement brain research by testing the functional relevance of that zzso However, if then only positive zzso results are taken seriously, the brain interference paradigm seems less zzso than zzso But how can zzso results inform us if they only constitute absence of zzso We suggest that three main arguments contravene interpretation of zzso results in zzso These we call the zzso argument, the neural efficacy argument, and the power zzso We proceed to discuss in turn how, and under which conditions, each of these arguments may be zzso These considerations lead us to value zzso results along a zzso of zzso rather than a zzso This perspective may open up a new range of zzso applications, where research questions about the lack of functional relevance of a particular brain region become zzso In this context we make specific recommendations on zzso and zzso We propose that it is often not only meaningful to interpret zzso results, but also useful to make such findings available to the community, especially now that improved methods and an expanded knowledge base make zzso results more zzso than they have been in the zzso
