zzso disease is caused by expression of a zzso form of zzso protein containing an expanded zzso zzso One possible treatment for zzso disease may be to reduce expression of zzso zzso in the brain via zzso zzso Unless the therapeutic zzso is designed to be zzso both zzso and zzso protein will be suppressed by an zzso interference zzso A key question is whether suppression of zzso as well as zzso zzso in targeted brain regions can be tolerated and result in a net benefit to patients with zzso zzso Whether zzso performs essential functions in the adult brain is zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that the adult zzso brain can tolerate moderately reduced levels of zzso zzso protein for an extended period of zzso A zzso 2 zzso viral zzso zzso for a short hairpin zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso injected into the zzso of four adult zzso zzso Four additional animals received a comparable zzso zzso a scrambled control short hairpin zzso zzso zzso General health and motor zzso were monitored for 6 zzso Upon zzso brain zzso were sampled and assessed blindly for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso Reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels averaging zzso was measured in the zzso of active zzso recipients 6 months zzso A widespread reduction in zzso protein levels was also observed by zzso in these animals, with an average protein reduction of zzso relative to controls measured by western zzso analysis in the zzso of active zzso zzso As with control zzso recipients, no adverse effects were observed zzso and no zzso was found on zzso examination of active zzso zzso Our results suggest that long-term partial suppression of zzso zzso may be safe, and thus if a comparable level of suppression of zzso zzso is zzso then partial suppression of both zzso and zzso zzso may result in a net benefit in patients with zzso zzso zzso
