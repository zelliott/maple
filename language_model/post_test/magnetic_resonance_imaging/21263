The zzso has been reported to exhibit structural and functional zzso in patients with major depressive disorder zzso But functional relationships between this area and other regions remain zzso 

Region of zzso correlation analyses were performed in the zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging data to examine differences in functional connectivity zzso of the zzso between zzso patients with zzso and healthy zzso zzso analyses were done between clinical variables and the strength of zzso in regions showing group zzso 

Positive zzso with the zzso was seen in bilateral zzso system, zzso areas, zzso zzso zzso and inferior prefrontal zzso while negative zzso was observed in bilateral prefrontal cortex, zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso Group comparison showed impaired functional connections of the zzso in zzso with a lack of negative zzso in left zzso to bilateral middle frontal zzso as well as decreased negative zzso in right zzso to right inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso correlations were seen between illness duration and the strength of zzso in the prefrontal and zzso zzso 

An zzso method taking individual zzso of zzso volume into account is merited for the definition of seed regions and zzso of zzso Further studies recruiting subjects with zzso depressive symptoms are zzso 

zzso functional relationships between the zzso and cortical areas may zzso the zzso of zzso
