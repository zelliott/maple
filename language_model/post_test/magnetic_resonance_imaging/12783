Language functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a promising zzso technique for zzso planning in patients whose zzso are adjacent to or within critical language zzso Most language zzso studies in patients use blocked experimental zzso In this study, we compared a blocked design and a rapid zzso design with a zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso for language zzso in six healthy controls, and eight brain tumor patients, using a zzso zzso generation zzso Comparisons were based on visual inspection of zzso zzso maps and degree of language zzso both of which were assessed at a constant statistical threshold for each zzso The results indicated a relatively high degree of zzso between the two task zzso In general, the zzso design provided maps with more robust zzso in the putative language areas than the blocked design, especially for brain tumor zzso Our results suggest that the rapid zzso design has potential for providing comparable or even higher detection power over the blocked design for zzso language function in brain tumor patients, and therefore may be able to generate more sensitive language zzso More patient studies, and further investigation and zzso of language zzso zzso will be needed to determine the utility and zzso of this approach for zzso zzso
