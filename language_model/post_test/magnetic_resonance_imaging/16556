We used computer simulations to investigate finite element models of the layered structure of the human skull in zzso source zzso Local models, where each skull location was modeled differently, and global models, where the skull was assumed to be zzso were compared to a reference model, in which zzso and compact bone were explicitly accounted zzso In both cases, zzso and zzso zzso assumptions were taken into zzso We considered sources in the entire brain and determined errors both in the forward calculation and the reconstructed zzso zzso Our results show that accounting for the local variations over the skull surface is important, whereas assuming zzso or zzso skull zzso has little zzso Moreover, we showed that, if using an zzso and homogeneous skull model, the ratio between zzso and skull zzso should be considerably lower than the commonly used zzso For skull zzso we recommend zzso Local models: if compact and zzso bone can be identified with sufficient accuracy zzso from zzso and their zzso can be assumed to be known zzso from zzso one should model these explicitly by assigning each zzso to one of the two zzso zzso Global models: if the conditions of zzso are not met, one should model the skull as either homogeneous and zzso but with considerably higher skull zzso than the usual zzso zzso or as homogeneous and zzso but with higher zzso skull zzso than the usual zzso zzso and a considerably lower zzso zzso zzso than the usual zzso
