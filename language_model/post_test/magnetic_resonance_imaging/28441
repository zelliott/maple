zzso resonance images were obtained of the zzso spines of three volunteers in neutral, zzso and extended zzso 

To measure migration of the nucleus zzso within the zzso disc during zzso and extension of the spine in living zzso 

zzso of experiments on zzso zzso spines have indicated that the nucleus zzso zzso during zzso and zzso during extension in zzso zzso zzso discs may have faults or fissures that result in abnormal motion of the zzso 

zzso density zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were obtained from the zzso spines of three zzso zzso of the positions of the anterior and zzso margins of the nucleus and of zzso and extension angles were made on zzso of the images corresponding to neutral, zzso and extended zzso 

The observed frequency zzso of 24 zzso at which the margins of the nucleus migrated in the directions predicted by results of zzso studies was significantly greater than the frequency that would be expected by chance zzso zzso zzso The two exceptions may be a result of disc zzso There was a significant zzso zzso zzso linear correlation between the migration of the anterior margin and the zzso angle and a highly significant zzso zzso zzso correlation for the zzso margin and the zzso zzso 

zzso of an zzso disc in a living person tends to be accompanied by zzso directed migration of the nucleus zzso within the zzso Extension tends to be accompanied by an zzso directed zzso
