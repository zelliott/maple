zzso is of increasing importance in the diagnostic evaluation of gastrointestinal diseases, with depiction of zzso enhancement obtained with conventional intravenous zzso zzso clinical use of contrast agents has been carried out using intravenous injection for zzso zzso zzso agents that specifically target the zzso zzso are therefore needed to improve clinical imaging of the zzso zzso 

To zzso a novel contrast agent for zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and observe the zzso of the zzso in the colon wall of healthy rats by MR imaging in zzso 

A contrast agent was successfully zzso by a modified emulsion zzso method, and the resulting agents were characterized in detail by dynamic zzso zzso and zzso coupled plasma zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered to the colon zzso of healthy rats by zzso administration, and zzso scans in zzso were carried out with a zzso T imaging scanner at various time zzso 

The prepared zzso zzso were zzso zzso in diameter with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso indicated little zzso zzso results showed that zzso can be retained in both the stratum zzso and zzso cells of the colon for almost 80 zzso zzso electron zzso images further revealed that zzso zzso were localized inside the zzso cells or zzso space, while tissue from zzso zzso solution administration showed zzso Due to the infusion of zzso zzso the MR signal intensity of colon zzso increased from about zzso to zzso and the contrast enhancement was highest at 20 zzso after zzso 

zzso zzso with high zzso content were successfully prepared for use as a novel zzso contrast zzso All results indicated that zzso administered zzso zzso have the potential for zzso diagnosis of colon zzso zzso
