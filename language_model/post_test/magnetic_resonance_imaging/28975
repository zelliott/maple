The aim of this study was to determine whether associations exist between zzso joint zzso disk zzso and zzso zzso in an adolescent zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images of the zzso were obtained of 119 females between the ages of 10 and 17 zzso Once the effects of age had been considered, associations between zzso internal zzso and zzso zzso were studied in 5 facial regions making use of 5 separate multiple zzso zzso In zzso associations between altered facial zzso and altered disk position were present within each of the facial regions zzso the zzso regions showed the strongest zzso This study shows that functional zzso in zzso disk dynamics may be another factor to consider when zzso growth is zzso for zzso treatment zzso
