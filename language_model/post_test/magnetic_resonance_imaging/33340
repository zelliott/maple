The purpose of our study was to evaluate the burden of alcohol-related injuries on a zzso department at a level 1 trauma zzso 

We linked the trauma registry zzso of zzso Medical Center to billing department data and extracted patient demographic and zzso characteristics and the zzso services zzso zzso negative zzso analysis was used to evaluate the association between blood alcohol concentration zzso and CT and zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso CT and zzso zzso examinations were performed on zzso patients during the study zzso Higher zzso was generally associated with higher zzso rates for all types of CT even after adjusting for potential zzso zzso Compared with patients with a zzso of 0, the greatest increases in zzso were observed in individuals with a zzso of 240 zzso or more for head CT zzso rate ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cervical spine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and maxillofacial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with no increase observed for zzso This association was more prominent in less severely injured patients with zzso rates for head CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abdomen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in individuals with a zzso of 240 zzso or more compared with those with a zzso of zzso 

Higher zzso was associated with increased CT zzso for most body zzso CT scans and was more strongly associated in patients with less severe zzso Any zzso that could potentially decrease unnecessary imaging for patients with zzso injuries would represent a zzso zzso
