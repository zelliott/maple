zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of cortical zzso We describe the clinical zzso and imaging features of a large cohort with zzso zzso 

Participants were recruited through the zzso zzso Project, a zzso collaborative effort to collect detailed zzso data on individuals with zzso We reviewed zzso data from participants with zzso and zzso 

We identified 87 participants, 43 female and 44 male, with zzso and zzso Median age of seizure onset was 3 years zzso zzso month to 37 zzso Most presented with focal zzso zzso some in combination with zzso generalized from onset zzso zzso zzso with zzso features were most common zzso Of those presenting with generalized seizure types, infantile spasms were most prevalent zzso The most common zzso pattern was zzso zzso zzso of which the majority was bilateral zzso zzso zzso presented with an earlier age of seizure onset zzso age of 8 zzso and an increased prevalence of zzso delay prior to seizure onset zzso Of the zzso and zzso bilateral groups where zzso was more involved in one hemisphere, the majority zzso of participants had zzso that zzso to the same zzso as the zzso or the zzso with greater zzso 

Participants with zzso had both focal and generalized onset of zzso Our data confirm the involvement of known zzso patterns of zzso and suggest that more extensive zzso of zzso present with an earlier age of seizure onset and increased prevalence of zzso delay prior to seizure zzso
