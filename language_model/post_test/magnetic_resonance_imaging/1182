Recently, independent component analysis zzso has been widely used in the analysis of brain imaging zzso An important problem with most zzso zzso is, however, that they are zzso that is, their results may be somewhat different in different runs of the zzso Thus, the zzso of a single run of an zzso zzso should be interpreted with some reserve, and further analysis of the zzso reliability of the components is zzso Moreover, as with any statistical method, the results are affected by the random sampling of the data, and some analysis of the statistical significance or reliability should be done as zzso Here we present a method for assessing both the zzso and statistical reliability of estimated independent zzso The method is based on running the zzso zzso many times with slightly different conditions and visualizing the zzso structure of the obtained components in the signal zzso In experiments with zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data, the method was able to show that expected components are zzso zzso it pointed out components whose interpretation was not obvious but whose reliability should incite the zzso to investigate the underlying technical or physical zzso The method is implemented in a software package called zzso
