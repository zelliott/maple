zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso power that are opposite in direction zzso zzso zzso and origin of generation zzso zzso zzso to the locus of zzso are a robust correlate of anticipatory zzso zzso Yet, the neural generators of these zzso zzso their zzso across zzso areas, and their respective contribution to subsequent perception remain zzso To shed light on these questions, we employed zzso while human volunteers performed a zzso cued detection zzso zzso previous findings, we found zzso enhancement zzso to the attended zzso and zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and suppression were generated in 2 distinct brain regions, located in the zzso and zzso visual streams, zzso Moreover, zzso and suppression showed different dynamics and contribution to zzso In contrast to the initial and transient zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was sustained and influenced subsequent target zzso This anticipatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso probably reflects increased zzso in the brain region specialized in processing upcoming target zzso Our results add to current models on the role of zzso in attention zzso by showing that zzso and suppression can be zzso in time, space, and zzso zzso
