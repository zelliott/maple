zzso interface zzso technology captures brain signals to enable control of prosthetic or communication devices with the goal of assisting patients who have limited or no ability to perform voluntary zzso Decoding of inherent information in brain signals to interpret the zzso intention is one of main approaches for developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decoding provides good zzso but surgical complications are one of the major concerns for this approach to be applied in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso is less zzso thus it is theoretically more suitable for long-term zzso although it is unclear whether zzso signals carry sufficient information for decoding natural zzso We successfully zzso continuous three-dimensional hand zzso from zzso signals in Japanese zzso A steady quantity of information of continuous hand movements could be acquired from the decoding system for at least several months, and a decoding model could be used for zzso days without significant degradation in accuracy or zzso The correlation zzso between observed and predicted zzso were lower than those for zzso decoding experiments we previously reported, zzso to a greater degree of chewing artifacts in zzso decoding than is found in zzso zzso As one of the safest invasive recording methods available, zzso provides an acceptable level of zzso With the ease of replacement and upgrades, zzso systems could become the zzso interface for real-life zzso zzso
