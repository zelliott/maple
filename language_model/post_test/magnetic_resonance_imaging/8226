The medical records, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were reviewed in zzso zzso zzso system for staging of zzso zzso zzso was used as a tool for zzso 

One hundred twelve zzso patients zzso males and 35 zzso were recruited in this zzso The distribution of tumor staging in these patients were 39 zzso patients in zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and 19 zzso in T4 by zzso staging before zzso In these 62 patients with normal zzso ventilation before zzso 42 zzso patients returned to having zzso 3 months after zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were most readily zzso In patients with zzso at 3 months zzso advanced tumor stage zzso zzso zzso and smoking habit zzso zzso were the two factors that significantly influence zzso zzso When comparing zzso score with different times after radiation therapy, a trend of decrease in zzso score could be noted from 3 months to 3 years after zzso 

The zzso and severity of zzso was found to be highest at 3 months zzso and decreased gradually with zzso Conservative management with clinical symptom correlation should be attempted first in these zzso In these zzso zzso tumor stage and smoking habit would zzso them to zzso zzso
