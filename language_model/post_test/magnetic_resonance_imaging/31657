The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in Britain has fallen markedly in recent zzso Few studies have investigated the extent to which this decline can be explained by concurrent changes in major cardiovascular risk zzso 

The British Regional Heart Study examined changes in cardiovascular risk factors and zzso zzso over 25 years from 1978 in a cohort of zzso zzso During this time, the zzso hazard of zzso decreased by zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso per zzso which zzso to a zzso decline over the 25 zzso At the same time, after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking zzso mean zzso blood pressure, and mean zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso whereas mean HDL cholesterol, mean body mass index, and physical activity levels zzso No significant change occurred in alcohol zzso The fall in cigarette smoking explained the greatest part of the decline in zzso zzso zzso followed by changes in blood pressure zzso HDL cholesterol zzso and zzso cholesterol zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso of the decline in zzso could be explained by these risk factor zzso Physical activity and alcohol consumption had little influence, whereas the increase in body mass index would have produced a rise in zzso zzso 

zzso favorable changes in the major cardiovascular risk factors appear to have contributed to considerable reductions in zzso zzso This highlights the potential value of zzso measures to reduce exposure to these risk factors in the prevention of coronary heart zzso
