The authors report three cases of cerebral zzso that occurred in young adults with unusual zzso 

All three patients presented with zzso and were treated at Seoul National zzso A zzso diagnosis of zzso was made by a zzso biopsy in all three zzso 

zzso resonance zzso images showed that their tumors were located in the internal capsule and thalamus, and were associated with zzso cerebral zzso and brain stem zzso The zzso slowly progressed and this was accompanied by a zzso zzso in each zzso 

Clinical diagnosis was not easy because of the unusual clinical presentations and zzso MR imaging zzso It is suggested that cerebral zzso should be included in the differential diagnosis of a zzso mass which is associated with cerebral zzso in the thalamus, zzso zzso or internal zzso especially in adolescents or young zzso
