zzso zzso zzso zzso is known for high rate of associated zzso The purpose of this study was to identify zzso zzso findings of zzso zzso We also tried to compare the zzso findings with the MR imaging zzso 

We zzso reviewed zzso and MR images of eight patients with zzso zzso with zzso zzso 6) or without zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso attention was paid to correlate the zzso findings with the MR imaging findings in terms of area distribution of standard zzso values zzso and a convoluted zzso pattern zzso 

In two benign zzso the maximum zzso measured zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso In both tumors, MR images demonstrated a diffuse zzso In six zzso with zzso zzso the maximum zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In these tumors, MR images demonstrated a diffuse zzso in two, a partial zzso in three, and no zzso in zzso A wide zzso was noted between MR imaging and zzso in terms of area distribution of a zzso and zzso 

In zzso zzso with MR imaging features of zzso zzso zzso demonstrating avid zzso zzso does not necessarily imply the presence of zzso zzso In our small series, although zzso containing zzso of SCC had consistently higher zzso than zzso without zzso the limited literature on this subject suggests that PET cannot be used reliably to make the zzso
