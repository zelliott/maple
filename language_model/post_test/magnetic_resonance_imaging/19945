To compare zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso and zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso and image quality at MR zzso 

zzso patients with known or suspected liver zzso underwent zzso MR imaging by using a zzso zzso zzso sequence with and without fat suppression and a zzso zzso zzso sequence with and without fat zzso zzso analysis was made with zzso of the signal intensity of the liver, zzso background noise, and up to three liver zzso as well as calculations of the liver zzso ratio zzso and the zzso zzso ratio zzso for each zzso zzso analysis was made for image quality and the number of zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by using a zzso paired zzso zzso test with a zzso confidence zzso 

zzso and zzso were significantly higher zzso for zzso with fat suppression than for zzso with fat zzso No statistically significant difference was seen in terms of zzso and zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso liver edge zzso and clarity of vessels were superior and zzso was less with the zzso sequences compared with the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso technique is a reasonable alternative in zzso imaging of the zzso
