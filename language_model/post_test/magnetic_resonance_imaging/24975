zzso zzso zzso is a phenomenon zzso a brief exposure to zzso renders a tissue more tolerant to a subsequent sustained zzso zzso Animals of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso rat strains produce cerebral zzso that are larger and more zzso in size than zzso of zzso zzso This study compared the effects of PC in zzso and zzso rats, under the hypothesis that PC may not be as effective in the zzso a strain genetically predisposed to zzso There were two groups per strain, with between eight and ten animals zzso The zzso group zzso had a 10 zzso zzso of the middle cerebral artery on day zzso On the same day the zzso group zzso received sham zzso On day 0, both groups underwent permanent zzso of the middle cerebral zzso The zzso zzso was measured on day 1 using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso PC zzso zzso zzso zzso PC zzso zzso zzso and zzso PC zzso zzso zzso Thus, rats of the zzso strain respond to PC less markedly than zzso zzso Both models may now be used to zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso
