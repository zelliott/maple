Two functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso face viewpoint adaptation experiments were conducted to investigate whether zzso adaptation in high-level visual zzso depends on the duration of adaptation and how different views of a face are represented in the human visual zzso We found adaptation effects in multiple zzso areas, which suggest a distributed, zzso representation of faces in the human visual zzso However, the nature of the adaptation effects was dependent on the length of zzso With long adaptation zzso zzso areas along the hierarchy of the visual system gradually exhibited zzso zzso As the angular difference between the adapter and test stimulus increased, the blood oxygen zzso zzso signal evoked by the test stimulus gradually increased as a function of the amount of zzso zzso zzso With short adaptation zzso however, zzso areas in the zzso pathway, including the lateral zzso zzso and right zzso area, exhibited zzso zzso These areas showed an increase in the zzso signal with a zzso zzso but this signal increase was independent of the amount of zzso Further, the right superior zzso zzso showed little or very weak viewpoint adaptation with short adaptation zzso Our findings suggest that long- and short-term zzso adaptations may reflect selective properties of different zzso zzso
