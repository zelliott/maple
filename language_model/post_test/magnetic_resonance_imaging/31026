Increased zzso relaxation times in the zzso zzso are present in patients with zzso zzso Visual assessment of zzso images of these patients suggests increased signal intensity in the anterior zzso lobe as zzso Our aim was to assess zzso and anterior zzso zzso relaxation times in patients with partial zzso by using a new zzso sequence implemented by using a zzso General Electric imaging zzso 

zzso view zzso maps were generated by using an zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso with an acquisition time of 7 zzso on a zzso General Electric zzso Horizon zzso imaging zzso zzso relaxation times were measured in the zzso and anterior zzso lobe of 30 healthy control volunteers and 20 patients with partial zzso 

For the 30 control volunteers, the mean zzso zzso relaxation time was 98 zzso zzso zzso In all measured areas, the asymmetry index was small zzso For the 15 patients with independent evidence of zzso sclerosis established by zzso zzso and, when available, zzso criteria, mean zzso zzso relaxation times were 118 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side and 101 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso values were also increased in the anterior zzso lobe zzso 82 zzso 6 zzso P zzso zzso 79 zzso 6 zzso P zzso as compared with the values for the control volunteers (75 zzso 3 zzso The five patients with focal cortical zzso had zzso zzso relaxation times that were not different from control zzso 

zzso zzso at 3 T is feasible and useful and confirmed marked zzso zzso signal intensity increase in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso signal intensity change was also present in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso is a sensitive means of identifying abnormalities in the zzso and other brain zzso
