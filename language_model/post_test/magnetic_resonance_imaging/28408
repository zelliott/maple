To evaluate the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting retinal detachment zzso in eyes filled with silicone oil, and to determine the zzso characteristics of silicone oil in zzso 

Seven eyes of seven patients with zzso and eight eyes of eight patients without zzso after silicone oil surgery were included in the zzso All of the patients had clear zzso zzso was performed in these zzso The results of zzso examinations were compared with zzso zzso 

zzso detected six of the seven detached zzso The zzso imaging capability of zzso helped in showing the zzso in various zzso The chemical shift artifact exaggerated the retinal thickness and made the detached zzso zzso Fat suppressed images showed the silicone zzso contact zzso 

zzso is an effective technique for demonstrating zzso in eyes filled with silicone oil and can be used successfully in eyes with opaque zzso
