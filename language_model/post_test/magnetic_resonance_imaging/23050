It is well documented that both cognitive and motor learning abilities decline with zzso zzso Given that cognitive processes such as working memory are engaged during the early stages of motor learning zzso zzso zzso zzso Willingham, zzso & zzso zzso Contributions of spatial working memory to zzso zzso Journal of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age-related declines in motor learning may be due in part to reductions in cognitive zzso The present study examined whether age-related declines in spatial working memory zzso contribute to deficits in zzso zzso Young and older adult participants performed a zzso adaptation task that involved adapting manual aiming movements to a zzso rotation of the visual feedback display as well as an zzso task in an zzso zzso Young adults showed a steeper learning curve than older adults during the early adaptation zzso The rate of early adaptation was correlated with zzso performance for the young, but not older, zzso Both groups showed similar brain zzso patterns for the zzso task, including engagement of the right zzso prefrontal zzso and bilateral inferior zzso zzso However, when the zzso zzso was used as a limiting mask, younger adults showed neural zzso that overlapped with the early adaptation period, whereas older adults did zzso A partial correlation controlling for age revealed that the rate of early adaptation correlated with the amount of zzso at the right zzso prefrontal zzso These findings suggest that a failure to effectively engage zzso processes during learning contributes to age-related deficits in zzso zzso
