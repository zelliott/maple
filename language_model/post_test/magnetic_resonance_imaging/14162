zzso zzso of an imaging plane of interest is often needed prior to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have developed a simple method for accurate and zzso selection of an imaging plane for PET using magnetic resonance zzso zzso This method is useful when optimal sampling of specific brain structures, such as small zzso zzso or when a specific imaging angle is required for the PET zzso An external zzso device, consisting of a series of tubes visible on zzso is affixed to an individually fitted zzso zzso This mask system is worn by the patient during both the MR and PET zzso A plane of interest is planned from the zzso MR image and defined by its relation to the zzso device and to the MR zzso zzso or reference zzso This plane is transferred to the mask by means of a zzso alignment zzso The zzso acquisition of MR and PET images allows individualized analysis of brain zzso zzso Phantom studies demonstrated the accuracy and zzso of imaging plane selection by this method to be within 1 zzso and 1 zzso Application of the zzso protocol in a human subject is also zzso
