We report a severe acute headache that occurred in conjunction with a solitary fresh zzso of multiple sclerosis in the zzso gray region of a 16-year-old zzso This unique natural event supports the recent proposition, based on observations of patients with implanted electrodes, that zzso of the zzso gray region can produce zzso It also suggests that headaches accompanying attacks of multiple sclerosis are due to disturbances in particular regions of the zzso
