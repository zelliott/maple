We examined zzso abnormalities and language function in young patients with zzso apparently confined to the zzso zzso to establish whether impaired performance was attributable to zzso zzso damage per zzso or to additional cerebral zzso zzso stroke patients (10 with zzso and 7 with zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso included zzso imaging and zzso zzso analyses of zzso and diffusion data zzso Language was assessed using the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso scores showed a main effect of presence or absence of stroke, with patients performing more poorly than zzso There was no evidence of differences between the zzso and zzso zzso However individual patients with zzso zzso showed large variations in zzso In the patients with zzso damage, zzso zzso showed significant relationships between language function and gray matter density in cortical language zzso The white matter analyses also showed correlations with language function, and in addition there were zzso abnormalities in cortical language areas in the three patients with poorest language zzso We suggest that language zzso following zzso zzso damage may be attributable primarily to abnormalities in cortical language areas that are too subtle to detect on conventional structural zzso
