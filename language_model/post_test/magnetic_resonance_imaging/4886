zzso imaging 24 hours after zzso zzso injection zzso or 4 hours after IV injection zzso has been used to zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of zzso enhancement with the 2 methods and the zzso zzso difference with the zzso in both sides in patients with unilateral zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso disease or sudden zzso were included in this zzso Thirty-nine patients who underwent the unilateral zzso zzso was diluted zzso with zzso and 22 patients who underwent the zzso (a zzso of zzso zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso zzso body zzso at zzso were analyzed zzso zzso of interest of the cochlear zzso and the zzso zzso were determined on each image, and the zzso ratio between the 2 zzso zzso was subsequently zzso The differences in the CM ratio between the 2 methods zzso zzso zzso and the zzso CM ratio between the affected and unaffected sides in patients with unilateral zzso disease zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso CM ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than the zzso CM ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In patients with unilateral zzso disease who underwent the zzso zzso zzso zzso the CM ratio of the affected side zzso zzso zzso was higher than that of the unaffected side zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In general, the zzso provides higher zzso enhancement than the zzso In the patients with unilateral zzso disease who underwent the zzso the affected side had a higher contrast zzso
