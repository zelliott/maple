zzso zzso assessment of tumor extent and zzso zzso involvement is mandatory for individualized therapy in patients with zzso zzso zzso of the head and neck zzso zzso imaging, zzso zzso PET and zzso were compared with zzso zzso tissue zzso 

Dynamic and zzso PET with 370 zzso zzso up to 60 zzso zzso and zzso were compared zzso in 22 patients with head and neck zzso PET results with and without zzso correction were compared with zzso T and N stages based on zzso zzso 

zzso characteristics and zzso zzso intensity were similar in primary tumors and zzso zzso zzso In both, zzso zzso did not reach a plateau phase 60 zzso zzso There was no statistically significant correlation of zzso zzso with plasma zzso level or zzso zzso All primary tumors were clearly demonstrated by zzso which tended to overestimate tumor zzso The sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual zzso zzso involvement were zzso and zzso respectively, for PET and, thus, significantly higher for zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso N stages were correctly identified by zzso in only 4 zzso PET correctly staged zzso zzso in 15 of 17 zzso Based on zzso zzso the sensitivity and specificity were higher for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso may be helpful in detecting zzso primary tumors with positive zzso zzso
