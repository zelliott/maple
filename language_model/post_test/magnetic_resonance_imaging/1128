We present an zzso study demonstrating that an zzso word highly suggestive of zzso pain, heard by the ear, significantly activates the anterior zzso zzso zzso while hearing zzso words that did not imply affective pain under the same task does not activate this area in zzso We concluded that the zzso would be a pivotal locus for zzso affective pain evoked by an zzso word that implied affective pain closely associated with the zzso of zzso We suggest that the pain affect sustained by pain zzso may depend on zzso cortical interactions that modify cognitive evaluation of emotions associated with zzso zzso
