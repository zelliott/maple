zzso joint zzso discs displaced zzso zzso and zzso are assumed to be zzso However, a pilot study performed with individualized zzso scans on supposedly rotated discs did not show disc rotation zzso The aim of this study was the quantitative evaluation of disc rotation on a larger sample size, assessing the zzso disc geometry and position by the use of a reference system determined by the zzso long zzso 

zzso zzso from 50 subjects were zzso One series of zzso and 1 of 14 individualized zzso magnetic resonance zzso scans were taken for each zzso The zzso disc position was diagnosed by means of the zzso zzso The zzso disc zzso and position were then measured on every zzso zzso The zzso and zzso was zzso for each disc and its zzso from the perpendicular to the zzso long axis was zzso Finally, a statistical analysis was performed to study whether the disc zzso and the direction of the disc zzso varied between discs normally positioned and zzso zzso 

The disc zzso varied significantly more within the zzso displaced discs than within the normal zzso The zzso of the zzso displaced discs deviated more from the perpendicular to the zzso long axis than that of normally positioned discs and was mostly in a lateral zzso The disc zzso also deviated more in the zzso than in the zzso part of the zzso 

Most zzso displaced discs were zzso displaced and showed a larger zzso variation than normally positioned zzso This fact seems to indicate disc zzso
