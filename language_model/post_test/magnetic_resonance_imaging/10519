In humans, zzso is suspected to cause brain zzso and accelerate slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease or zzso However, a direct link between brain injury and subsequent delayed global zzso has remained zzso Here we show that juvenile zzso mice that are given a discrete unilateral zzso of the zzso cortex, develop to adulthood without obvious clinical zzso However, when monitored 3 and 9 months after zzso using high-resolution three-dimensional zzso and zzso testing, the same mice display global neurodegenerative zzso Surprisingly, erythropoietin, a zzso growth factor with potent zzso activity, prevents zzso zzso cognitive dysfunction and brain zzso when given for 2 weeks after acute brain zzso This demonstrates that a localized brain zzso is a primary cause of delayed global zzso that can be efficiently zzso by zzso
