zzso MR scans were performed with the zzso imaging method and the filtered zzso imaging method on 12 patients with multiple sclerosis in acute phase, 4 in a zzso form, and 8 in a progressive form, before, during and after zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso relaxation times, obtained by fitting zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso function within the apparently normal white matter and the areas of increased zzso were zzso With the zzso method it was possible to fit the zzso zzso zzso curve with a zzso function and obtain zzso and zzso relaxation zzso The zzso and zzso relaxation times of the apparently normal white matter were significantly different from those obtained for volunteers, but no significant differences were found before, zzso or after zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of the areas of increased signal were better fitted by a zzso zzso No significant changes in these relaxation times were observed after zzso zzso These results argue against an zzso action of zzso and may suggest that it has an zzso zzso
