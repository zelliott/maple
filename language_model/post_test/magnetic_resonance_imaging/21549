Using magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso of the zzso vessels may be well zzso The comparison between 3 magnetic resonance zzso zzso techniques zzso Echo, zzso Echo zzso zzso zzso Echo zzso zzso and Digital zzso zzso zzso as reference in 50 patients suspicious of zzso zzso proved the high reliability of these zzso zzso in determining the degree of zzso a good correlation between zzso and zzso in zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso could be zzso Since zzso technique may zzso the degree of zzso we didn't observe any false negative result in severe zzso Therefore we think that the zzso technique is a safe technique which enables a good overview of the zzso vessels and could therefore be suitable for zzso
