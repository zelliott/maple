Acute zzso zzso is caused by sudden coronary artery zzso zzso zzso results in necrosis of the zzso tissue supplied by the zzso zzso It has recently been shown that the final size of the zzso is a major predictor of future clinical events, and is, therefore, used as a surrogate outcome in clinical zzso Moreover, it has become clear that the duration of zzso in the main zzso of the success of zzso salvage zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition to minimizing the time between symptom onset and zzso there is considerable interest in finding therapies that can further limit the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and they are the focus of numerous clinical zzso zzso zzso within the first few hours of an zzso is a zzso indication in clinical practice zzso However, early intravenous zzso even before coronary artery zzso is not routinely zzso zzso research has demonstrated that the zzso zzso is able to reduce the zzso size only when administered before coronary artery zzso which indicates that its zzso properties are secondary to its ability to reduce zzso zzso In addition, retrospective studies of zzso suggest that starting intravenous zzso early has clinical benefits zzso lower mortality and better recovery of left zzso zzso in patients without zzso Our general hypothesis is that early administration of zzso zzso zzso before zzso results in smaller zzso than administering the drug orally after zzso The Effect of zzso in zzso during an acute zzso zzso zzso trial will test this hypothesis in patients with zzso zzso zzso
