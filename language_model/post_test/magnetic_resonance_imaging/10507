With the advent of modern zzso imaging techniques, cerebral zzso have been increasingly recognized on zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequences in different zzso However, in clinical practice, their diagnostic value, associated risk, and zzso significance are often zzso This review summarizes the zzso differential diagnosis, zzso and clinical significance of cerebral zzso 

zzso areas of signal loss on GE zzso imaging zzso represent focal zzso deposition associated with previous zzso zzso zzso zzso have been noted in healthy elderly, zzso cerebrovascular disease, zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso and in cerebral zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been associated with older age, hypertension, smoking, white matter disease, zzso zzso previous zzso stroke, or zzso In zzso zzso predict both the risk of zzso zzso zzso and future clinical zzso In patients with zzso cerebrovascular disease, zzso number and location may be associated with executive dysfunction and may predict the occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso 

When cerebral zzso are diagnosed on zzso conclusions regarding their significance and associated risks should be made based on the population zzso Further studies to characterize the associated risks of cerebral zzso in different stroke populations are needed to use this new imaging marker in therapeutic zzso
