zzso exposure to highly addictive substances such as zzso may induce far-reaching deleterious effects on later mental and physical zzso However, little is known about the zzso basis for zzso zzso zzso Here we examined whether having an zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative marker of zzso structural zzso is associated with zzso dependence particularly beginning in zzso 

The overall length of the zzso and the prevalence of abnormal enlargement of the zzso were assessed and compared in 65 zzso subjects (41 zzso zzso users and 24 zzso zzso zzso and 67 healthy zzso 

zzso subjects showed a greater prevalence of abnormal zzso enlargement relative to healthy subjects zzso ratio zzso zzso The overall zzso length of zzso zzso subjects was greater, as compared not only with healthy subjects zzso zzso but also with those who began zzso use during adulthood zzso zzso 

The current findings provide the first evidence that abnormal zzso enlargement, which reflects zzso system zzso of zzso origin, may be linked to later development of zzso zzso In addition, a greater zzso zzso which indicates more severe zzso zzso appears to zzso higher risk for earlier onset of zzso zzso
