The most investigated semiconductor zzso for zzso PET detectors is the avalanche zzso zzso However, the silicon zzso zzso also called the zzso zzso is gaining attention in the development of the next generation of zzso systems because the zzso has much better performance than the zzso We have developed an zzso PET system based on zzso zzso zzso to allow simultaneous zzso 

The zzso PET scanner consists of 12 detector zzso with a ring diameter of zzso zzso and an zzso extent of zzso zzso In each detector zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso (with 4 zzso 4 channels arranged in a 2 zzso 2 array to yield 8 zzso 8 zzso were coupled with 20 zzso 18 zzso zzso (each crystal is zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and mounted on a charge division network for zzso 64 signals into 4 position zzso Each detector module was enclosed in a shielding box to reduce interference between the PET and zzso zzso and the temperature inside the box was monitored for correction of the zzso gain variation of the zzso The PET detector signal was routed to the outside of the zzso room and processed with a field zzso gate zzso data acquisition zzso zzso zzso tests and simultaneous zzso acquisitions were performed inside a zzso clinical zzso system with zzso loop receiver coils that were built into the zzso PET zzso zzso between the imaging systems was investigated, and phantom and mouse experiments were zzso 

No zzso interference on the PET signal or degradation in the energy spectrum and flood map was shown during simultaneous zzso The quality of the zzso scans acquired with and without the operating PET showed only slight zzso The results of phantom and mouse experiments confirmed the feasibility of this system for simultaneous zzso 

zzso zzso was possible with a zzso zzso PET zzso with no zzso interference on PET signals or images and only slight degradation of the zzso zzso
