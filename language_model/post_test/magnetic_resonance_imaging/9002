In contrast to traditional views that consider smooth pursuit as a relatively automatic process, evidence has been reported for the importance of attention for accurate pursuit zzso However, the exact role that attention might play in the maintenance of pursuit remains zzso 

We zzso the zzso activity associated with healthy subjects executing smooth pursuit eye movements zzso during concurrent attentive tracking of a moving sound source, which was either zzso or in zzso to the executed eye zzso Assuming that zzso resources must be allocated to the moving sound source, the simultaneous execution of zzso and auditory tracking in zzso directions should result in increased load on common zzso zzso By using an auditory stimulus as a zzso rather then a visual stimulus we guaranteed that cortical activity cannot be caused by conflicts between two simultaneous visual motion zzso Our results revealed that the smooth pursuit task with divided attention led to significantly higher zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and lateral and zzso frontal cortex, presumably containing the zzso frontal and supplementary eye fields zzso 

The additional cortical zzso in these areas is apparently due to the process of dividing attention between the execution of zzso and the covert tracking of the auditory zzso On the other hand, even though attention had to be divided the zzso resources did not seem to be zzso since the identification of the direction of the auditory target and the quality of zzso were unaffected by the zzso between visual and auditory motion zzso Finally, we found that this form of zzso attention modulated not only the cortical pursuit network in general but also affected zzso specific and zzso attention zzso
