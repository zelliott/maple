During memory zzso increased zzso zzso to reflect the binding of different types of information into unique zzso been shown to correlate with subsequent recollection of those zzso zzso zzso to induce more efficient zzso processing of zzso normally associated with decreased zzso activity and is often assumed to reduce zzso into episodic zzso Here, we used zzso to compare activity to primed and zzso auditory words in the presence of distracting sounds as a function of whether participants subsequently zzso the zzso associations or only had a feeling of familiarity with the word in a subsequent surprise recognition zzso At the behavioral level, zzso increased the zzso of subsequent zzso At the zzso level, zzso reduced activity in the superior zzso zzso zzso but also reversed the traditional increase in zzso zzso activity associated with subsequent recollection relative to subsequent zzso To explain this interaction pattern, further analyses using dynamic zzso modeling showed an increase in connectivity from left zzso to left zzso specific to words that were later zzso These findings show that successful episodic zzso is not determined solely by local zzso activity and emphasize instead the importance of increased functional zzso zzso Such zzso might be a better predictor of subsequent recollection than the direction of local zzso changes per zzso We propose that one consequence of zzso is to zzso zzso zzso resources from processing an item in a noisy context, thereby allowing greater attention to zzso of that zzso
