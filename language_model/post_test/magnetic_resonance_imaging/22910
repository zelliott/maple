To zzso evaluate the accuracy of double contrast zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging depiction of zzso fibrosis, with zzso analysis findings as the reference zzso 

The institutional review board approved this zzso study and zzso the requirement for informed zzso One hundred one patients zzso men, 43 zzso mean age zzso standard zzso 52 years zzso 10) who underwent zzso MR imaging with zzso iron oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences between 2001 and 2004 and had a reliable reference standard for the diagnosis of liver zzso were zzso Two blinded MR zzso zzso scored qualitative zzso zzso and total zzso and quantitative zzso ratio between zzso and zzso liver regions, zzso of variation, and zzso zzso of zzso liver texture features on MR images in zzso The image scores for patients with advanced zzso zzso score zzso 3) versus those for patients with mild zzso score zzso 2) zzso were zzso and receiver operating characteristic zzso were zzso zzso performance values were calculated at the optimal operating zzso zzso U and zzso Student zzso tests were zzso 

zzso and quantitative image scores were significantly higher for patients with zzso zzso scores of 3 or higher than for those with scores of 2 or lower zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso images, differences increased with increasing echo zzso zzso performance for detection of grade 3 or more severe zzso was better with the zzso sequence than with the zzso zzso and qualitative scores had higher diagnostic performance than quantitative zzso The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of qualitative scores on zzso zzso images were higher than zzso 

Advanced zzso zzso can be detected by using zzso MR zzso Although diagnostic performance depended on the sequence and scoring system used, sensitivity, zzso and accuracy values higher than zzso were zzso
