Individual zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso was investigated in symptomatic zzso Eleven patients aged zzso years were studied whose diagnosis was established by medical history, clinical, zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scans were obtained and zzso zzso (five zzso brain zzso one zzso zzso one zzso one zzso zzso of unknown zzso one traumatic brain injury, one zzso and one zzso zzso were outlined on individual zzso zzso zzso to those zzso and in zzso zzso structures, zzso binding was zzso in four pairs of cortical 9 zzso zzso regions of interest zzso placed on zzso and zzso zzso respectively, as well as in the zzso volume and its mirror zzso Percentage asymmetry ratios were calculated and those at or outside the zzso range were zzso defined zzso zzso zzso binding zzso ranged from 70 to zzso zzso zzso from 38 to zzso Only one patient showed no significant change, whilst nine exhibited significant reductions of zzso binding in at least one zzso (3 zzso 1, 4 zzso 2, 1 zzso 3, 1 zzso zzso and significant increases were observed in two zzso of another zzso zzso zzso disturbances of zzso binding are common but variable in zzso Because a close correlation between regional decreases in zzso binding and zzso activity was recently demonstrated in zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso binding may bear some relation to the mechanisms of zzso in symptomatic zzso
