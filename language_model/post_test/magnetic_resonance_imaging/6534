The discrete zzso transform zzso is widely used for zzso analysis and zzso or zzso of zzso time series and spatial zzso zzso are naturally appropriate for analysis of biological data, such as functional magnetic resonance images of the human brain, which often demonstrate scale zzso or zzso zzso We provide a brief formal introduction to key properties of the zzso and review the growing literature on its application to zzso We focus on three applications in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso time series, zzso to 3-D spatial maps and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for signal and noise parameters of time series zzso models assuming the errors are fractional zzso noise zzso and zzso zzso shrinkage in zzso and zzso zzso to support zzso hypothesis testing on zzso extended statistic zzso We conclude that the zzso domain is a rich source of new concepts and techniques to enhance the power of statistical analysis of human zzso zzso
