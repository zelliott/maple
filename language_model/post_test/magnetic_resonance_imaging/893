The locations and zzso of the neural generators of the zzso zzso potential have been well described using zzso zzso However, this invasive method is not adequate for usage in healthy volunteers or psychiatric patients and not all brain regions can be covered well with this zzso With functional zzso a zzso method with high spatial resolution, most of these locations could be found zzso However, the zzso of these zzso can only be roughly determined with this method, even if an zzso zzso design has been zzso zzso we have now tried to zzso the zzso of the zzso using zzso data providing a better time zzso We have used Low Resolution zzso zzso zzso in the analysis of zzso data (27 zzso of healthy volunteers zzso zzso 50) in the time frame zzso zzso and found mainly the same zzso that have been described using zzso recordings or zzso zzso zzso the inferior zzso zzso junction zzso the supplementary motor zzso zzso and the anterior zzso zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso In these selected regions, an analysis of the zzso zzso has been zzso
