To determine serial zzso and CT abnormalities around zzso zzso due to zzso in previously treated patients during periods of seizure zzso 

Some patients with zzso zzso due to zzso have zzso How and why zzso occur in this setting are zzso 

Three patients with known, treated zzso were studied zzso by serial zzso and CT before, zzso and after seizure zzso 

All three patients demonstrated zzso surrounding zzso zzso Two of three patients had repeated episodes involving the same zzso zzso and their symptoms corresponded to the location of the zzso Enhancement was present in the zzso demonstrating zzso but was also present surrounding other zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso surrounding zzso zzso due to zzso occurs in some patients at the time of seizure zzso zzso seizure episodes tend to be associated with the same zzso Although the mechanisms involved are unknown, long-term zzso medication is likely indicated in these zzso Current evidence does not support the use of specific zzso treatment in these zzso
