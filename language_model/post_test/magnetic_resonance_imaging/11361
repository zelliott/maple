zzso functional zzso zzso based on both blood zzso zzso zzso contrast and cerebral blood flow zzso contrast has been developed to study the human brain response to transient zzso A balloon model has been developed and used in understanding the relationship between changes in zzso and in the zzso signal in zzso zzso In this report, the balloon model was used to interpret experimental zzso zzso Using experimental data acquired from zzso zzso as an input function in the balloon model, simulated zzso signal changes were zzso The simulated time course of the zzso signal changes was directly compared with the zzso acquired zzso A zzso zzso test showed excellent correlation between the simulated and experimental data zzso zzso zzso Our results have demonstrated that the balloon model is useful in interpreting the transient features of the experimental data from the zzso zzso
