Brain zzso abnormalities have been reported in several independent investigations of chronic schizophrenic zzso The present study is a prospective zzso follow-up of zzso schizophrenic patients to determine whether some of these abnormalities may be a consequence of regional brain structural change over time after the onset of a first psychotic zzso Whole hemisphere, zzso zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso and lateral zzso were measured in a series of zzso scans taken over a zzso period in 20 patients and five zzso Total volume reduction was noted in both zzso to a greater degree in patients than zzso When adjusted for total brain size, left zzso enlargement occurred in patients, but not controls, over zzso These preliminary data suggest that subtle cortical zzso may be occurring over time after the onset of zzso
