Recent brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso have implicated a zzso network in the zzso control of zzso However, little is known about the timing and sequence of zzso within this zzso To investigate these timing questions, we used zzso electrical brain zzso zzso and a specially designed zzso zzso zzso which were applied as part of a zzso approach that included a closely corresponding zzso zzso study using an identical zzso In the first 400 zzso post zzso zzso and control cues zzso similar general zzso activity, corresponding to the more lateral zzso of the zzso network identified with the zzso Following this, the zzso cues zzso a sustained zzso brain wave that was absent for control zzso This activity could be linked to the more zzso zzso zzso similarly identified in the zzso as specifically involved in zzso zzso zzso both the scalp zzso and the zzso source modeling for this zzso activity indicated an earlier onset of frontal versus zzso contribution ( approximately 400 versus approximately 700 zzso This was then followed ( approximately zzso zzso by zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate an zzso sequence of key components of the zzso brain network, providing insight into their functional zzso More specifically, these results suggest that voluntary zzso zzso is initiated by zzso portions of frontal cortex, which then recruit zzso zzso zzso Together, these areas then implement zzso of zzso zzso zzso to facilitate the processing of upcoming visual zzso
