To compare the clinical relevance of retrograde zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso in evaluating male zzso zzso 

Between January and April 2004, 20 men were referred to our institute for management of zzso zzso The patients were investigated by conventional zzso and zzso MR zzso The patients were examined by zzso under zzso to be followed by definitive zzso or open operative zzso The zzso data were compared by zzso as well as operative findings in all the zzso 

Ten patients were managed by visual internal zzso zzso and two by zzso under zzso two showed normal zzso zzso Four patients required open zzso zzso zzso Two patients underwent radical zzso and zzso diversion because of associated zzso or zzso zzso Although overall accuracy for diagnosis of zzso strictures was equal between both zzso zzso MR zzso provided extra clinical data in seven patients zzso It was superior to zzso in judging the zzso zzso length in three patients, diagnosing a zzso tumor in one, detecting associated zzso mass in one, characterizing the site of zzso zzso in one, and accurately zzso the zzso zzso in the last zzso Unlike zzso MR zzso provided adequate information about the degree of zzso in all zzso 

MR zzso is a promising tool for defining male zzso strictures and can provide extra guidance for treatment planning that cannot be obtained with zzso
