We aimed to devise a rating method for key frontal and zzso brain regions validated against quantitative zzso methods and zzso to a range of zzso zzso 

Four zzso zzso MR images from 36 subjects encompassing controls and cases with Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso After initial pilot studies, 15 regions produced good zzso and zzso zzso We then validated the ratings against manual zzso and zzso zzso zzso and compared ratings across the subject zzso 

zzso against both manual zzso (for both frontal and zzso zzso and against whole brain zzso showed good correlation with visual ratings for the majority of the brain zzso zzso of rating scores across disease groups showed involvement of the anterior zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso pole in semantic zzso while anterior zzso and zzso regions were involved in zzso zzso zzso 

This simple visual rating can be used as an alternative to highly technical methods of zzso and may be superior when dealing with single cases or small zzso
