The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of a number of neurological signs in a large population of patients with vascular zzso zzso and to compare the relative frequency of specific neurological signs dependent on type of cerebrovascular zzso 

Seven hundred six patients with zzso zzso were included from a large zzso clinical trial zzso number zzso At baseline neurological examination, the presence of 16 neurological signs was zzso Based on zzso patients were classified as having large vessel zzso zzso large territorial or zzso zzso on zzso small vessel zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso multiple zzso bilateral zzso zzso on zzso or a combination of both zzso 

A median number of zzso signs per patient was presented zzso zzso zzso asymmetry was the most prevalent symptom zzso zzso was most seldom presented zzso zzso of small vessel disease were associated with an increased prevalence of zzso zzso zzso gait disorder, zzso and zzso and as well to zzso zzso By contrast, in the presence of a cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, zzso dysfunction, zzso zzso and zzso gait disorder were more often zzso 

The specific neurological signs demonstrated by patients with zzso differ according to type of zzso cerebrovascular zzso Even in people who meet restrictive zzso criteria, small vessel disease is often seen with more subtle signs, including zzso signs, whereas large vessel disease is more often related to zzso zzso changes and zzso
