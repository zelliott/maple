The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso in this gene are plausible zzso of brain zzso However, little is known about the potential role of the zzso zzso zzso which has been associated with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso which is itself associated with a high risk of zzso In this study, 43 zzso patients and 30 healthy controls underwent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, and their zzso zzso zzso were evaluated to determine the effect of the risk zzso on regional brain activity and functional networks in these zzso Then, zzso relationships were zzso Compared with the controls, zzso subjects with the higher risk T zzso had more deficits in regional zzso of the right superior frontal zzso zzso while a higher functional connectivity of the zzso was observed in zzso zzso Further zzso analyses revealed that the increase in zzso connectivity was robustly positively correlated with zzso performance in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings are the first to show that a clinically significant proportion of zzso brain function variation in zzso patients may be explained by genetic variation at the zzso locus in ways that are distinguishable from zzso
