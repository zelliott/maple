The aims of this study were to develop a standardized zzso procedure for simultaneous high-resolution zzso of the zzso and bilateral breast zzso and to identify zzso features suggestive of zzso zzso zzso AND zzso We studied 16 women undergoing zzso zzso zzso dissection after combined bilateral breast zzso and high-resolution zzso of the zzso with a maximum zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using a standard double breast zzso and a zzso round flexible surface zzso adapted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso including inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image analysis focused on zzso zzso including size, zzso zzso zzso and zzso appearance, signal intensity, and enhancement zzso zzso zzso findings were compared with the final zzso results from zzso zzso zzso dissection in all zzso Patients were divided into groups according to the final zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso features across the groups were tested using a zzso test for quantitative data and the zzso test or zzso exact test for zzso zzso 

The features of the zzso on high-resolution zzso that best zzso between patients with positive zzso findings and those with negative zzso findings were the presence of zzso with irregular contours zzso zzso zzso high signal intensity on zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso marked zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso and round zzso and abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Breast tissue and zzso zzso zzso both can be analyzed on zzso in a zzso process using a bilateral breast zzso combined with a surface zzso zzso features observed on high-resolution zzso of the zzso can improve the identification of zzso zzso
