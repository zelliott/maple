zzso artery zzso are made from metallic mesh and, therefore, to ensure patient safety, these implants must be evaluated to determine risks associated with zzso Recently, zzso zzso which have metallic zzso have been developed for use in the coronary zzso Because of the metallic materials, these implants may present issues for patients undergoing zzso zzso the objective of this investigation was to assess zzso issues zzso magnetic field zzso zzso heating, and artifacts at 3 zzso for a new zzso coronary artery scaffold with metallic zzso 

A zzso coronary artery scaffold zzso zzso zzso underwent assessments for magnetic field zzso zzso heating, and artifacts at zzso using standard zzso zzso heating was evaluated with the scaffold placed in a zzso phantom and zzso was performed at an MR system reported, whole body averaged zzso of zzso for 15 zzso zzso were characterized using zzso spin echo and zzso zzso pulse zzso 

There were no magnetic field zzso The highest temperature rise was zzso zzso background temperature rise, zzso zzso were relatively small in relation to the size and shape of this coronary artery zzso zzso the zzso of the scaffold could be zzso on the zzso pulse zzso 

The results demonstrated that the coronary artery scaffold is acceptable (or zzso zzso using current zzso labeling zzso for a patient undergoing an zzso procedure at 3 T or zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso coronary artery scaffold that has been evaluated for zzso zzso
