The purpose of our study was to identify the characteristic MR imaging features of intramuscular zzso 

We zzso reviewed the MR imaging features of 20 patients with intramuscular zzso Clinical assessment included the age and sex of the patient and location of the zzso zzso evaluation included the zzso size and shape, border definition, signal on zzso and zzso or zzso MR zzso enhancement pattern, presence or absence of a fat zzso and presence or absence of increased signal in the adjacent muscle on zzso or zzso MR zzso 

The mean age of patients presenting with intramuscular zzso was 61 years zzso zzso years; zzso 64 zzso The mean zzso size was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso fat zzso was present in 13 of the patients zzso with zzso and an increased signal in the adjacent muscle on zzso sequences was present in 11 patients zzso zzso zzso were zzso low in signal intensity on zzso MR sequences in 19 patients zzso with all zzso showing a high signal intensity on zzso or zzso MR zzso Twelve of the zzso had zzso borders, and eight had borders that were partially ill zzso Of the 11 zzso zzso after zzso administration, six zzso showed intense zzso zzso 

zzso of a mass that on MR images shows a zzso fat zzso the signal intensity of fluid, and an increased signal in the adjacent muscle on zzso or zzso MR sequences are strongly suggestive of intramuscular zzso The degree of zzso enhancement varies but is most frequently intense and zzso Although the recognition of these features likely will not zzso biopsy of any individual zzso it will allow more accurate zzso diagnosis and zzso zzso
