We investigated which brain areas show zzso activity during online motor control while errors occur independently from decision zzso During motor tasks, error is a zzso from accuracy or zzso The effect of the accuracy level on zzso brain activity is zzso Using functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso we investigated how zzso brain activity, especially in zzso wall areas, depended on motor accuracy zzso zzso performed a force tracking task with the zzso zzso to continuously follow a moving target on a monitor with a zzso which position was controlled by the force amount produced by the zzso Task difficulty varied with changes in the zzso size (the smaller the zzso the more difficult the zzso We measured the motor accuracy zzso distance between the zzso center and the zzso and the error amount zzso out of the zzso Errors were produced when motor accuracy was low and also when motor accuracy was zzso For zzso data processing, we defined a model based on both the error amount and the motor zzso The results showed that supplementary motor area zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with error and task difficulty independent of the accuracy of motor zzso Interestingly, activity in the zzso part of left zzso only increased with error when the motor accuracy was low, independently from task zzso These results suggest a clear functional zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in error processing which depends on the amount of zzso resources allocated to motor zzso
