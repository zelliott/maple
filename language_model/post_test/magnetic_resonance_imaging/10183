Monitoring of zzso cartilage repair after zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso by a new grading system based on zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso 

In 23 patients, zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed between 76 and 120 zzso In nine of these patients, five zzso examinations were performed at 4, 12, 24, 52 and 104 weeks after zzso zzso The repair tissue was described with separate zzso degree of zzso repair in zzso and zzso signal intensity of the repair tissue and status of the zzso zzso For these variables a grading system with point scale evaluation was zzso 



zzso zzso provides a zzso tool for monitoring the development of cartilage repair tissue following zzso technology, shows a good correlation with clinical outcome and may help to differentiate abnormal repair tissue from a normal maturation zzso
