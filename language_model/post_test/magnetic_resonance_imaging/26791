zzso syndrome involves a severe type of zzso which is caused by defects in the zzso gene zzso We report the case of a female infant with zzso caused by an unbalanced segregation of the parental balanced zzso of zzso with other zzso The zzso presented with facial zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso Most cases of zzso syndrome have a de zzso deletion involving zzso When zzso syndrome is caused by an unbalanced zzso zzso zzso occur according to the extension of the involved partner zzso However, a pure partial zzso derived from a paternal balanced zzso is relatively zzso In this case, the zzso cryptic deletion in the zzso was initially zzso by zzso and zzso analysis did not reveal additional zzso abnormalities such as zzso However, a family history of zzso pregnancy abnormalities strongly suggested familial zzso zzso zzso and FISH analysis of the father's zzso showed that the segment of zzso was attached to the zzso Thus, we report a case that showed resemblance to the findings in cases of a nearly pure zzso zzso derived from zzso and delineated by whole zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso If such cases are incorrectly diagnosed as zzso syndrome caused by de zzso zzso zzso the zzso improper genetic counseling may make it difficult to exactly predict the potential risk of zzso zzso for successive zzso
