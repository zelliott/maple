Prior imaging studies of zzso patients attempted to demonstrate a relationship between plain zzso curve patterns and curve progression and pain, or used magnetic resonance imaging zzso to focus on spinal zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients may differ from zzso patients, yet may still be zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the possible relationship of degenerative disc findings on zzso to zzso patients' zzso This prospective study enrolled zzso and control patients, all of whom had assessment for back pain zzso analog zzso and disability zzso zzso and spinal zzso to identify prevalence and distribution of degenerative disc zzso Specifically, we assessed 60 consecutive pediatric and adult idiopathic zzso patients who had progressed to surgical treatment, 60 zzso and zzso zzso controls, and zzso zzso symptomatic degenerative disc disease patients who had progressed to surgical zzso All subjects had independent analysis of their zzso zzso for disc zzso disc zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory end plate zzso Imaging findings of the zzso patients were compared to those from zzso and symptomatic control zzso Our results found that both pediatric and adult zzso patients had significantly more pain and disability than did zzso controls zzso zzso zzso The adult idiopathic zzso patients had pain and disability similar to those of surgical degenerative disc disease control zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not related to zzso However, in the pediatric zzso patients, those with zzso zzso often had greater pain than those without zzso zzso zzso Adults with painful zzso typically occurring at the zzso of the zzso or at the zzso zzso had a significantly higher frequency of inflammatory end plate changes on zzso than did controls zzso zzso zzso Prior studies have demonstrated a correlation of inflammatory end plate changes to zzso zzso zzso In conclusions, zzso patients who have progressed to surgical intervention, pediatric patients have varying degrees of pain, and those with zzso zzso may be at greater risk for zzso Adult zzso patients have zzso pain of which one component may be related to zzso of the lower zzso discs similar to that in zzso zzso Additionally, adult zzso patients may have zzso findings consistent with zzso pain at the zzso of their zzso most commonly at the zzso zzso zzso
