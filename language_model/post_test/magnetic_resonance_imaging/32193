Memory for past events may be based on retrieval accompanied by specific contextual details zzso or on the feeling that an item is old zzso or new zzso in the absence of contextual zzso There are indications that recollection, familiarity, and novelty involve different zzso zzso lobe zzso but available evidence is scarce and zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we isolated zzso activity associated with recollection, familiarity, and novelty by distinguishing between linear and zzso zzso functions derived from recognition confidence zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso we found a triple zzso among the zzso half of the zzso which was associated with recollection, the zzso zzso zzso which was associated with familiarity, and anterior half of the zzso and zzso regions, which were associated with zzso Furthermore, multiple zzso analyses based on individual trial activity showed that all three memory signals, zzso recollection, familiarity, and novelty, make significant and independent contributions to recognition memory zzso Finally, functional zzso among recollection, familiarity, and novelty were also found in zzso zzso left zzso cortex, and prefrontal zzso zzso This is the first study to reveal a triple zzso within the zzso associated with distinct retrieval zzso This finding has direct implications for current memory zzso
