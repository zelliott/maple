An increased zzso recovery component of the zzso zzso zzso has been commonly observed in Parkinson disease, zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso was reported normal in patients with essential zzso zzso We studied zzso in patients with zzso associated with resting zzso zzso in comparison with patients with zzso 

This was a zzso study investigating zzso at zzso intervals zzso of 100, zzso zzso zzso 400, 500, and 750 zzso in 14 patients with zzso 14 patients with zzso and 16 healthy zzso To compare individual patients, we calculated an zzso recovery index in each subject as the mean of zzso area ratio values at zzso of zzso zzso zzso 400, and 500 zzso All patients and controls underwent zzso 

Patients with zzso differed from those with zzso for the presence of resting zzso associated in several cases zzso with a subtle arm zzso zzso was normal in all patients and zzso All patients with zzso (with and without zzso had an increased zzso while all patients with zzso had a normal zzso comparable to that of control zzso The zzso recovery index was abnormal in all patients with zzso but in none of the patients with zzso 

Patients with zzso showed increased zzso suggesting that this form of zzso may be a zzso zzso rather than a zzso of zzso zzso helps to correctly diagnose zzso patients with resting zzso also in the absence of overt zzso zzso
