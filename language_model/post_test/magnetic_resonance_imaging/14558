Sleep deprivation and daytime zzso impair numerous aspects of physical, zzso and memory zzso However, most studies examining the effect of zzso on brain function focus on acute sleep restriction in young zzso We examine the relationship between chronic daytime zzso and connectivity in six brain networks in both young and elderly subjects using zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso

Compared with young subjects, cognitively normal elderly adults report less daytime zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and display reduced default mode network zzso connectivity zzso zzso zzso Across all subjects, increasing daytime zzso was associated with decreasing functional connectivity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso partial r of zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in the slope of this relationship between young adults and elderly zzso No other cortical networks were correlated with daytime zzso zzso zzso and zzso connectivity were not related to sex, brain structure, or body mass zzso 

These findings suggest that daytime zzso is associated with impaired connectivity of the zzso in a manner that is distinct from the effects of zzso This association is important to consider in any study using zzso connectivity as a zzso Additionally, these results may help identify those subjects at risk for future memory zzso
