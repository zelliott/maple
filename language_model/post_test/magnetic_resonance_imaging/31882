Two regions in the human zzso zzso respond zzso to zzso 'the zzso face zzso zzso and the zzso face zzso zzso Whether these areas have a dominant or exclusive role in face perception, or if zzso responses in other visual areas such as the lateral zzso complex zzso are also involved, is currently zzso To shed light on this issue, we tested normal participants and zzso a well-known zzso patient presenting a zzso perception deficit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mayer, zzso zzso A network of zzso zzso areas besides the right middle zzso zzso is necessary for normal face zzso Brain 126 zzso with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Of particular interest, the right zzso zzso of the patient zzso encompasses the zzso but preserves the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the functional zzso of acquired zzso zzso 35, zzso Using zzso we found a zzso between the coding of individual zzso in the structurally intact zzso which was impaired for faces but preserved for objects in the patient zzso zzso Most importantly, a larger response to different faces than repeated faces was found in the zzso part of the zzso both for zzso and the patient, next to the right zzso zzso Thus, following zzso areas that do not respond zzso to faces such as the zzso part of the zzso zzso may still be recruited for zzso or residual individual face zzso Overall, these observations indicate that several high-level visual areas in the human brain contribute to individual face zzso However, a subset of these areas in the right hemisphere, those responding zzso to faces zzso and zzso appear to be critical for this zzso
