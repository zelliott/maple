Given their importance in language zzso the human zzso zzso and/or some of their component structures might be expected to be larger than zzso predictions for a nonhuman zzso brain of human zzso Whole brain, zzso zzso scans were collected from 44 living zzso primates spanning 11 zzso zzso software zzso Medical Systems, The zzso was used to measure the volume of the entire brain, the zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso and the zzso lobe white zzso The surface areas of both the entire zzso lobe and the superior zzso zzso were also measured, as was zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso of zzso lobe structures on brain volume consistently showed apes and monkeys to scale along different zzso with the monkeys typically lying at a higher zzso than the zzso Within the zzso zzso overall volume, surface area, and white matter volume were significantly larger in humans than predicted by the zzso zzso zzso The largest departure from zzso in humans was for the zzso lobe white matter volume which, in addition to being significantly larger than predicted for brain size, was also significantly larger than predicted for zzso lobe zzso Among the nonhuman zzso sample, zzso have small zzso zzso for their brain size, and zzso and zzso have large superior zzso zzso for their brain zzso The observed departures from zzso might reflect zzso adaptations supporting zzso communication in both humans and old world zzso
