We ask the question whether the coding of zzso versus coordinate spatial relations depends on different neural networks showing zzso specialization or whether there is continuity between these two coding zzso The zzso spatial zzso hypothesis would mean that the two coding types rely essentially on the same neural network consisting of more zzso zzso such as zzso attention, but with a different weighting of these general processes depending on exact task zzso With zzso zzso we have studied right-handed male subjects performing a zzso zzso working memory task inducing zzso and coordinate spatial relations zzso Our data support the zzso spatial zzso hypothesis, indicating that, while based on the same zzso neural network than zzso spatial relations coding, the coding of coordinate spatial relations relies more heavily on zzso and executive zzso which could induce zzso differences similar to those described in the zzso The results also show that zzso working memory consists of a short-term zzso store with a capacity of up to three elements in the zzso and zzso zzso This store depends on the presence of a visible space categorization and thus can be used for the coding of zzso spatial zzso When no visible space categorization is given or when more than three elements have to be zzso additional zzso and executive processes are zzso mainly located in the zzso prefrontal zzso
