As a precursor for investigation of changes in neural activity underlying lapses of zzso we set up a system to simultaneously record functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and continuous zzso response inside an zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal was acquired during a novel zzso tracking task in which participants (10 zzso 10 zzso were cued to either briefly stop tracking and close their eyes zzso zzso or to briefly stop tracking zzso zzso The onset and duration of zzso and stopping were identified post hoc from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed using a general linear model zzso and zzso independent component analysis zzso The zzso analysis identified predominantly increased blood zzso level dependent zzso activity during zzso and stopping in zzso areas, zzso integration areas, and zzso zzso Stopping during tracking zzso increased activity in visual processing areas, zzso integration areas, and zzso zzso zzso separated the zzso pattern of activity into multiple zzso networks including the 1) zzso frontal zzso network, 2) sensory areas, 3) zzso zzso network, and 4) zzso zzso network, which were modulated differently by Stop zzso and zzso The results demonstrate the merits of using simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso recordings to investigate the mechanisms underlying complex human behaviors in the human zzso Furthermore, knowledge of widespread zzso in brain activity due to voluntary zzso or stopping during a continuous zzso task is important for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying zzso behaviors, such as zzso and attention zzso which are often accompanied by brief zzso and/or response zzso
