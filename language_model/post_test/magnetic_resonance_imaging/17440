The aim of this work is to develop a remotely controlled zzso to perform minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the abdominal and zzso zzso with real-time magnetic resonance imaging zzso guidance inside clinical zzso MR zzso The zzso is composed of a three degree of freedom Cartesian motion system, which resides outside the zzso of the zzso and serves as the holder and global zzso of a three degree of freedom arm which extends inside the zzso of the scanner At its zzso end, the zzso zzso can carry an zzso tool such as a biopsy needle, which can be advanced to a desired depth by means of a seventh degree of zzso These seven degrees of freedom, provided by the entire zzso offer extended zzso to the device and a wide envelope of operation to the user, who can select a trajectory suitable for the zzso The device is constructed of zzso and zzso zzso and carbon fiber composite materials, to minimize artifacts and distortion on the MR images as well as eliminate effects on its operation from the high magnetic field and the fast switching magnetic field zzso used in MR zzso A user interface was developed for zzso control of the device using real-time MR zzso The user interface zzso all sensor signals zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso planning, and control command zzso zzso planning is performed with zzso tools for setting the trajectory of zzso of the zzso tool using zzso and/or three zzso MR images which are zzso in real zzso The device control is performed with an embedded computer which runs real-time control zzso The zzso zzso with the MR environment and zzso operation was tested on a zzso T MR zzso
