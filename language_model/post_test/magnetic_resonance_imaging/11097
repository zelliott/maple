A zzso functional zzso zzso study with three levels of task difficulty was performed to determine the effect of practice and zzso load on brain zzso during visual attention zzso zzso practice during repeat zzso scanning (20 zzso did not change performance accuracy or reaction times zzso but decreased zzso zzso in the inferior, middle, and superior frontal zzso superior zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso Increased zzso load decreased performance accuracy but not zzso and increased zzso zzso in the inferior, zzso and superior zzso zzso thalamus, zzso and frontal zzso These changes suggest that practice decreases dependency on thalamus, zzso and the frontal zzso for controlled task processing possibly due to increased efficiency of the zzso zzso Since short-term zzso in the prefrontal zzso may be similar to zzso zzso studies of zzso load need to take practice effects into zzso
