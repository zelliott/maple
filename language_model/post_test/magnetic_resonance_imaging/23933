zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provided clear images of three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of the inner ear in candidates for cochlear zzso In this zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso findings was performed to investigate zzso zzso of the inner ear caused by zzso and zzso zzso 

This was an zzso zzso 

The study was performed in an academic, comprehensive, zzso group zzso 

zzso zzso patients with cochlear zzso The cause of deafness was zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso speech recognition tests were zzso 

zzso findings in the inner ear detected with zzso were found before surgery in zzso of the patients with zzso zzso although the zzso was lower in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were frequently observed in the cochlear zzso turn and semicircular canals more than in the middle and zzso turn in cases with zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso suffered less with a zzso apparatus than did those patients with zzso zzso Regarding the analysis of the inner ear zzso at the implanted side, the zzso speech recognition ability did not correlate to the extent of abnormal zzso findings of the implanted zzso 

Improvement in zzso zzso technology provided an accurate zzso picture of the inner ear zzso In cochlear implant patients with infectious zzso the extent of the inner ear zzso detected with zzso zzso was different among zzso of zzso
