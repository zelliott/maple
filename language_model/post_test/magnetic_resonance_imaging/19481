The increased use of computerized zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso technology has led to an increase in the detection of zzso zzso although the surgical indication for these tumors remains zzso The authors investigated the zzso of zzso zzso and their clinical zzso 

An zzso survey was conducted of primary zzso tumors diagnosed in zzso zzso between 1989 and zzso zzso zzso imaging and clinical studies for zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso tumors were diagnosed in zzso zzso Of these zzso 504 zzso were zzso and of these zzso 196 zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was significantly higher in individuals older than 70 years of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso was significantly higher in female than in male zzso Of the zzso zzso in 196 patients, 87 zzso were surgically removed, whereas 109 zzso were treated zzso Of these conservatively treated patients, 63 received follow-up care for more than 1 zzso In 20 of these 63 cases, the tumors increased in size over the zzso average follow-up period zzso zzso zzso whereas in the other 43 cases, the tumor size did not increase during a zzso average follow-up period zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference with respect to age, tumor size, and zzso ratio between the patient group in which the tumor size increased and the group in which it did not increase during the follow-up zzso zzso zzso that evidenced zzso on CT scans and/or zzso on zzso MR images appear to have a slower growth zzso 

Among patients older than age 70 years who underwent operation for zzso zzso the neurological morbidity rate was zzso it was zzso among younger zzso This indicates that the zzso of surgery in elderly patients with zzso zzso must be considered very zzso
