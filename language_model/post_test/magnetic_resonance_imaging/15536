The difference in the left zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso stimulation and its relation to zzso strain zzso remain zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were recorded in 13 normal subjects at rest and during zzso infusion zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 8 points zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso were manually placed by zzso tissue tracking technique and the movement of these points during a cardiac cycle was zzso after which the rotation angles and zzso were zzso zzso zzso was defined as the net difference between the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso to zzso degrees, zzso whereas zzso was zzso with zzso The zzso zzso was significantly greater than the zzso although no difference was seen between the zzso and zzso in the zzso base throughout the zzso During zzso infusion, the zzso zzso increased zzso to zzso degrees, zzso and these values were greater than those for zzso The zzso zzso increased with the zzso dose zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso initially increased at 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but thereafter showed no further increase at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso of zzso rotation with zzso was clearly observed in the zzso zzso thus causing increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso
