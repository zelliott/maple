To review the current limits on the efficacy of zzso zzso due to technical factors and to assess the potential for major improvements in zzso 

The method of this review was to assess the efficacy of current zzso in general zzso strategies for improving zzso historical record of technological zzso rationale for further reductions of treatment zzso and importance of defining and excluding zzso zzso from the target zzso The basis for the interest in zzso beam zzso is developed, and the relative dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The discovery of the zzso and the first proposal that zzso be used in zzso is zzso This is followed by a brief mention of the clinical outcome studies of zzso zzso zzso technical advances to be integrated into advanced zzso zzso are considered, specifically, zzso treatment planning and zzso Finally, the zzso in cost of some of these developments is zzso 

For definitive zzso dose limits are set by the tolerance of normal zzso adjacent or near to the zzso Using imaging fusion of CT, zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, and other studies will result in improved definition of the target zzso zzso beams are likely to replace zzso beams because of their physical zzso zzso for each beam path, the dose deep to the target is zero, across the target it is uniform, and zzso to the target it is zzso zzso therapy can use as many beams, beam angles, zzso and zzso as well as static, intensity zzso as can zzso zzso The ability for much greater accuracy in defining the target position in space and then maintaining the target in a constant position in the radiation beam despite target movement between and during dose zzso will be zzso The cost of zzso zzso will be modestly higher than comparable high technology zzso zzso 

The technology of zzso is clearly experiencing intense and rapid technical developments as zzso to treatment planning and dose zzso It is predicted that radical dose zzso will move to zzso beam technology and that the treatment will be four zzso (the fourth dimension is zzso The impact will be higher tumor control probability and reduced frequency and severity of zzso zzso
