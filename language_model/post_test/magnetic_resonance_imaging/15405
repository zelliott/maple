To assess the additional value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and ultrasound zzso to physical examination zzso and fine needle aspiration zzso zzso in the zzso determination of the location and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 99 patients with 77 benign and 22 zzso zzso were zzso 82 underwent zzso zzso was performed in 88 zzso On zzso the location of the tumor was zzso zzso patients had zzso and 47 zzso Various characteristics and the presumed diagnosis were zzso Furthermore, the location of the tumor in relation to the facial nerve was zzso The results were compared with the zzso zzso and the location during zzso 

Of the zzso zzso incomplete zzso from normal zzso zzso tissue showed the highest positive zzso value zzso for zzso of zzso Of the US zzso enlarged zzso zzso yielded the highest zzso for zzso of zzso zzso correctly predicted the benign or zzso nature of the tumor in all zzso zzso location was well predicted on zzso with a zzso of zzso slightly better on zzso zzso of zzso and worse on US zzso of zzso 

zzso is the only accurate investigation for zzso a zzso zzso tumor as benign or zzso zzso and zzso are superior to US in predicting tumor zzso Because the results for zzso and zzso are almost equal, zzso should only be reserved for specific cases, and not routinely zzso
