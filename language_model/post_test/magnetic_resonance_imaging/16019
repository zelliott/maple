The purpose of this study is to investigate information processing in the primary zzso system with the help of zzso network zzso Specifically, we consider interactions in the zzso zzso activity between the zzso and the cortical zzso areas zzso and zzso This type of cortical activity occurs after electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves such as the median zzso Our zzso consist of simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso recordings and individual zzso zzso zzso We perform source zzso by means of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso time courses are then zzso by a set of coupled zzso described by linear zzso ordinary delay differential equations zzso In particular, a new model for the zzso activity is included in the zzso zzso The parameters of the zzso system are successfully fitted to the data by a zzso evolutionary zzso zzso To activate the zzso network, an individual input function is used, based on zzso of the zzso stimulation signal at the zzso A significant feedback from the zzso to the zzso could be detected by comparing the network zzso with and without feedback zzso Our finding in humans is supported by earlier animal zzso We conclude that this type of rhythmic brain activity can be zzso by zzso networks in order to zzso feed forward and feedback information zzso
