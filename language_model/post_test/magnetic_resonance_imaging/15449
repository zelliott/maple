To assess image quality and overall accuracy of zzso zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging for diagnostic zzso zzso in suspected zzso zzso 

zzso patients with suspected zzso cancer underwent zzso and zzso zzso pelvic high-resolution MR imaging using a zzso zzso pelvic zzso at zzso Image quality, tumor stage, distance from the zzso margin, and zzso zzso were zzso assessed by two blinded zzso The results were correlated with clinical, zzso and zzso zzso 

In all 23 patients, MR images were of diagnostic quality, and zzso was correctly identified in 21 zzso The accuracy for determining zzso zzso was zzso zzso T stage and N stage were correctly diagnosed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowed correct identification of tumor extension and its relation to surgically relevant pelvic structures including the zzso margin and zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso images compared zzso to all other sequences for the diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso images were valuable for identifying tumor zzso while zzso sections were useful for the detection of zzso tumor zzso 

MR imaging with zzso receiver coils at zzso facilitated both zzso of different zzso conditions of the zzso and accurate determination of tumor stage in zzso zzso Thus, this zzso diagnostic approach appeared highly suitable for the assessment of patients with suspected zzso zzso
