zzso zzso reduces blood loss in patients undergoing surgery for zzso spinal zzso The objectives of this study were twofold: 1) to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in predicting tumor zzso and 2) to assess the effectiveness of zzso zzso in zzso these zzso 

Fifty-one patients with zzso spinal zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso between 1995 and zzso The MR imaging studies were correlated with tumor zzso on zzso zzso was zzso graded on a zzso scale ranging from no zzso zzso zzso to total zzso zzso zzso The zzso grade was correlated with zzso blood zzso The mean age was 57 years, the zzso ratio was zzso and back pain was present in all zzso zzso zzso cell zzso (30 zzso and zzso spine involvement zzso zzso were most zzso The positive zzso value of MR imaging in determining tumor zzso was zzso whereas the negative zzso value was zzso Total zzso zzso zzso was achieved in 34 zzso A shared vascular zzso between a zzso artery zzso and a tumor diminished the likelihood of complete zzso zzso zzso zzso Small zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated in two zzso The mean zzso blood loss was zzso zzso Following Grade D or E zzso zzso bleeding was largely related to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and MR imaging findings are zzso of zzso however, zzso tumors may not be detected by standard MR imaging zzso zzso zzso permits Grade D or E zzso in zzso of zzso Shared blood supply with an zzso is the most important factor zzso complete zzso
