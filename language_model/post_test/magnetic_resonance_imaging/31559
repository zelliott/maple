zzso muscle mass is an essential part of physical therapy assessment, particularly in older adults and in people with chronic conditions associated with muscle zzso The purposes of this study were to examine the relationship between muscle zzso area zzso and volume by use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to compare zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso obtained from zzso 

Twenty older adults who were healthy and 20 people with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso matched for age, sex, and body mass index, underwent zzso to obtain zzso of thigh muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso thickness and thigh zzso were used to estimate zzso zzso 

Muscle volumes were significantly lower in the people with COPD than in the older adults who were zzso zzso to high correlations were found between zzso zzso and volume in both groups zzso zzso zzso tended to overestimate zzso zzso in both the people with COPD zzso zzso actual zzso zzso and the older adults who were healthy zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso actual zzso zzso Furthermore, the estimated zzso zzso muscle zzso were not sensitive enough to detect a difference in muscle size between people with COPD and zzso zzso circumference alone was not different between groups and showed only low to moderate correlations with muscle volume zzso 

Muscle zzso measured from a single slice provides a good indication of volume, but the most representative slice should be chosen on the basis of the muscle group of zzso zzso circumference is not correlated with muscle volume and, therefore, should not be used as an indicator of muscle zzso The development of zzso reference equations for zzso muscle zzso from zzso zzso is zzso
