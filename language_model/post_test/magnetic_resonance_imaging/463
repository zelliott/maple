In a previous PET study on zzso zzso zzso occupancy in the nonhuman zzso brain, the relationship between zzso occupancy and zzso plasma zzso and zzso among different brain regions, were not demonstrated zzso It may therefore be difficult to translate the results to the clinical zzso In the present study, the detailed change of zzso occupancy was investigated among a wider range of doses in a more advanced zzso 

Two zzso monkeys were examined using a high-resolution PET system with zzso under baseline conditions and after zzso infusion of different doses of zzso zzso to zzso zzso per zzso zzso occupancy of the thalamus, zzso and anterior zzso zzso was calculated using zzso obtained with the simplified reference tissue zzso 

zzso occupancy increased regionally and zzso as the plasma concentration of zzso zzso The estimated zzso value (the amount to occupy 50% of zzso in the zzso was 16 zzso 

The results indicate that clinical doses of zzso would occupy zzso almost zzso
