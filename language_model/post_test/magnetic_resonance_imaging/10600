The detection of zzso zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso is rendered uncertain by the tissue zzso that follows surgery or zzso We aimed to evaluate the contribution of PET with zzso zzso in the detection and management of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso were evaluated zzso by zzso either because of biological evidence of active residual zzso or because of zzso demonstration of zzso zzso zzso We studied 24 zzso zzso and nine zzso zzso 

In 30 patients, zzso detected zzso zzso zzso In 14 out of these, zzso did not differentiate between residual zzso and zzso zzso In nine of these 14 cases, major therapeutic decisions were undertaken zzso and zzso In another group of 16 patients, both zzso and zzso detected abnormal zzso In one case, neither zzso nor zzso detected zzso zzso Finally, abnormal tissue was detected in two patients on zzso zzso In these two cases, failure of zzso to reveal the zzso was attributable to zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso and zzso varied as a function of the zzso zzso all zzso zzso were zzso by both zzso while zzso detected all zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso depicted only one of these eight zzso Fifteen out of 17 patients treated by zzso showed clinical improvement after zzso 

We suggest that zzso is a sensitive technique complementary to zzso for the detection of residual or zzso zzso zzso It should gain a place in the efficient management of these zzso
