zzso after zzso of zzso zzso repair is directed to detect timely right zzso zzso dysfunction by following pulmonary zzso and global RV size, with little attention for the effective contribution of regional RV zzso This study investigates the contribution of regional RV dysfunction on exercise capacity after zzso zzso 

zzso patients were investigated with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for regional RV dysfunction in relation to global RV function by functional zzso of the zzso and zzso part of the zzso The impact of regional and global RV dysfunction on clinical status was studied by exercise zzso 

Global RV function was lower than zzso function zzso fraction zzso zzso vs zzso zzso attributable to the adverse influence of right zzso zzso tract zzso dysfunction zzso zzso zzso predicted peak zzso correlated better with the RV zzso ejection fraction compared with the global RV ejection fraction zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso of RV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as significant zzso of exercise zzso zzso exercise performance occurred in zzso of the patients, and was independently determined by the type of repair zzso vs zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso greater zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of the RV components shows that exercise capacity after repair of zzso is better predicted by zzso function of the RV zzso as the extent of zzso dysfunction commonly leads to zzso of global RV zzso This method of differential zzso of regional RV function might be more appropriate than assessment of global RV function during the long-term follow-up of repaired zzso zzso
