zzso nerve root entry zone zzso has been implicated as a cause of zzso zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso and patients with nerve root vascular zzso We have examined the relationship between pathology and treatment outcome in patients with and without zzso treated for intractable zzso by partial sensory zzso zzso 

We reviewed the operative records, electron microscopic biopsy findings and zzso satisfaction and pain scores of 23 zzso and 47 zzso patients who underwent zzso between 1992 and zzso 

The zzso and zzso patients had similar ages of onset of zzso duration of symptoms, age at surgery and proportions with typical and zzso zzso zzso was present in 16 zzso and 23 zzso patients zzso and a zzso vessel in 5 zzso and 23 zzso patients zzso Of those with zzso vascular zzso was documented in 3 zzso and 15 zzso patients zzso zzso and satisfaction scores were similar in both zzso zzso zzso was more commonly associated with a zzso vessel zzso 

zzso is frequently associated with nerve root entry zone zzso in zzso and patients with nerve root vascular zzso The characteristics of the zzso and response to zzso are similar in both zzso zzso vascular zzso increases the risk of zzso zzso after zzso
