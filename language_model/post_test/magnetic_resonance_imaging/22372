zzso deficits affecting memory, attention and speed of information processing are common in multiple sclerosis zzso The mechanisms of cognitive impairment remain zzso Here, we examined the association between zzso test performance and brain zzso in a group of mildly disabled patients with zzso zzso We applied zzso zzso zzso to investigate the distribution of brain zzso in relation to cognitive zzso Patients had lower scores than control subjects on tests of memory and executive function, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a test of short-term verbal memory zzso Among patients, but not healthy controls, performance on the zzso a comprehensive measure of cognitive function and reference task for the cognitive evaluation of zzso correlated with global zzso matter volume as well as with zzso matter volume in regions associated with working memory and executive function, including bilateral prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso as well as right zzso Compared to healthy subjects, patients showed a volume reduction in left zzso and prefrontal cortex, recently identified as areas predominantly affected by diffuse brain zzso in zzso A comparison of low performers in the patient group with their matched control subjects showed more extensive and bilateral zzso and frontal volume reductions as well as bilateral zzso volume loss, compatible with the progression of zzso found in more advanced zzso These findings indicate that zzso deficits in zzso are closely associated with cortical zzso
