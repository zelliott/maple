Recent research into math zzso has identified areas of the brain that are involved in number processing zzso zzso zzso & Cohen, 2003) and complex problem solving zzso zzso Much of this research assumes that participants use a single zzso yet, behavioral research finds that people use a variety of strategies zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso In the present study, we examined cortical zzso as a function of two different calculation strategies for mentally solving zzso zzso zzso The school strategy, equivalent to long zzso involves working from right to zzso The expert strategy, used by zzso mental calculators zzso zzso proceeds from left to zzso The two strategies require essentially the same calculations, but have different working memory demands (the school strategy zzso greater zzso The school strategy produced significantly greater early activity in areas involved in zzso aspects of number processing zzso superior zzso zzso zzso and mental representation zzso zzso cortex, zzso but not in a zzso magnitude area zzso zzso zzso zzso or a semantic memory retrieval area zzso inferior prefrontal cortex, zzso An zzso model of the task successfully predicted zzso responses in zzso and zzso as well as in zzso and zzso
