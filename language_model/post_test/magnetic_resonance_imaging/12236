zzso neurosurgery planning, an zzso three-dimensional zzso is generally performed on the basis of two-dimensional zzso or projection zzso We present extensions to these conventional approaches that use zzso digital zzso zzso three-dimensional volume rendered zzso zzso or magnetic resonance images, or a combination of these zzso The zzso zzso images are zzso zzso on a 3-D zzso This system employs a zzso polarizing shutter to display alternate zzso and zzso views to a user wearing polarized zzso zzso planning operations may be performed on the basis of the zzso alone, or in conjunction with zzso images of the zzso We also describe the procedures used to produce zzso three-dimensional images from MR and CT zzso as well as the methodology for combining the zzso zzso with the zzso anatomical zzso
