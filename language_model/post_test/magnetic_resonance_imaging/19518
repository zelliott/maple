This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between long-term prognosis of functional status after stroke and the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings as well as complications in the zzso A total of 98 patients with initial cerebral zzso were zzso and 65 patients surviving 5 years after the event, were studied in terms of cognitive function and activity of daily living zzso Mean age at registration (3 months after the zzso was zzso zzso and 44 were zzso zzso findings were divided into eight categories including the size and zzso of zzso in addition to six categories as previously zzso The presence of zzso was identified according to the zzso and the zzso zzso and the extent of zzso assessed with the zzso scale, was divided into 3 zzso none, mild, and zzso The extent of zzso status was also graded into 3 zzso independent, partially dependent, and completely zzso zzso of stroke, pneumonia, and motor disorders zzso joint zzso were counted as complications during the zzso At zzso zzso was identified in 44, consisting of 30 mild and 14 severe zzso During 5 years, 11 cases with mild zzso showed zzso and 1 case without zzso developed mild zzso At zzso there were 46 cases with partially dependent zzso status and 22 cases completely dependent, while deterioration of zzso was seen in 17 during 5 zzso Multiple zzso analyses showed that diffuse zzso and pneumonia were zzso factors to the development of zzso while zzso pneumonia and motor disorders were risk factors for deterioration of zzso These findings suggested that in patients with cerebral zzso especially in patients with diffuse zzso pneumonia and motor disorders should be taken care of in order to prevent functional zzso
