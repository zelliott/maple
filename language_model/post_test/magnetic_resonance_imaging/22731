zzso suppression refers to the phenomenon that prior processing of stimuli (or stimulus zzso decreases zzso zzso by processing subsequent stimuli with identical zzso We present two complementary approaches to identify regions that show repetition suppression for subsequent sentences with either zzso zzso sentence forms or zzso zzso The first zzso approach simply compares sentences that are presented in zzso and Different zzso The second zzso approach zzso defines repetition suppression as decreased zzso for the subsequent zzso stimulus relative to its preceding zzso To account for zzso time zzso this approach tests for a repetition zzso condition zzso or zzso zzso Surprisingly, the two approaches revealed different zzso Only the zzso analysis detected sentence repetition effects in multiple regions within a bilateral zzso system that has previously been implicated in sentence zzso These discrepancies might be due to the different efficiencies with which the particular contrasts were estimated or zzso differences in stimuli or zzso set that could not be entirely controlled within a single zzso Finally, we combined the two approaches in a zzso zzso conjunction zzso
