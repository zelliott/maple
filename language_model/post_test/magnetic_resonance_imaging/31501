We study the zzso of zzso suspensions, a zzso particle system that exhibits zzso zzso From magnetic resonance imaging zzso and classical zzso it follows that as a function of the applied stress the suspension is first solid zzso zzso then liquid, and then solid again when it zzso zzso For the onset of zzso we find that the smaller the gap of the zzso cell, the lower the zzso rate at which zzso zzso zzso zzso can then be interpreted as the consequence of zzso the system under flow wants to zzso but instead zzso a jamming transition because it is zzso as confirmed by measurement of the zzso of the suspension as a function of the zzso zzso
