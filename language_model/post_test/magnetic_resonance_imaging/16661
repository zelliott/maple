In this article, zzso imaging is applied to human ex zzso knee cartilage, and correlations of the zzso imaging parameters with zzso content in zzso cartilage are zzso We show that, unlike the more commonly used zzso transfer ratio, the bound pool zzso the zzso rate zzso and the zzso relaxation time zzso vary with depth and can therefore provide insight into the differences between the top and bottom layers of zzso zzso Our zzso imaging model is more sensitive to zzso content in the top layers of cartilage, with bound pool fraction showing moderate correlations with zzso content, and k and zzso exhibiting moderate correlations with zzso
