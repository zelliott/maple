After unilateral stroke, the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the intact zzso is often more active during movement of an affected zzso Whether this contributes to motor recovery is zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to investigate short-term reorganization in right zzso after zzso magnetic stimulation zzso disrupted the dominant left zzso which is specialized for action zzso Even when 1 zzso left zzso zzso had no effect on behavior, there was a zzso increase in activity in right zzso and connected zzso zzso zzso This activity was specific to task periods of action selection as opposed to action zzso zzso zzso changes were both functionally specific and zzso zzso the same pattern was not seen after zzso of left zzso zzso zzso zzso of the reorganized right zzso did disrupt zzso Thus, this pattern of functional reorganization has a zzso role in preserving behavior after zzso zzso
