To report a case series in which the zzso features of the subcutaneous use of calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso are described for the first zzso 

Five patients with facial zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso were identified on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who gave a history of facial injections to augment physical zzso zzso with additional imaging studies was zzso 

All cases had subcutaneous high zzso material on CT zzso zzso which was zzso avid on zzso with a standardized zzso value zzso range of zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso demonstrated a zzso intermediate signal intensity subcutaneous zzso with enhancement zzso in one zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is zzso on CT, zzso on zzso imaging, of intermediate signal intensity on zzso and is a potential cause of a zzso imaging zzso
