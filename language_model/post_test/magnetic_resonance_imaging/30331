zzso zzso zzso are characterized by rapid growth, extensive local tissue zzso and the resulting overall dismal clinical zzso zzso any additional insights into the complex interaction between this aggressive brain tumor and its zzso is therefore zzso Currently, the standard imaging zzso to investigate the crucial interface between tumor growth and invasion in zzso are light and zzso laser scanning zzso While immensely useful in cell culture, zzso these zzso with this zzso clinical imaging method of choice, zzso zzso is a zzso zzso However, this integration is necessary, should advanced zzso modeling be able to zzso these in zzso data to eventually predict growth zzso in zzso We therefore argue that employing the same imaging zzso for both the experimental setting and the clinical situation it represents should have significant value from a data integration zzso In this case study, we have investigated the feasibility of using a specific form of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso or zzso to study the expansion dynamics of a zzso tumor zzso in a collagen type I zzso 

An zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso containing approximately zzso cells was generated and zzso into a collagen I zzso The sample was then zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso echo pulse sequence on a zzso zzso scanner over a period of 12 hours with a zzso resolution of 3 hours at room zzso Standard zzso was performed on the zzso sample, as well as on control zzso 

We were able to acquire three-dimensional MR images with a spatial resolution of 24 zzso 24 zzso 24 zzso Our zzso data successfully documented the zzso growth dynamics of an zzso in a collagen I gel over the 12-hour zzso The zzso results confirmed cell viability in the zzso sample, yet displayed distinct patterns of cell proliferation and invasion as compared to zzso 

In this study, we demonstrate that a specific form of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso or zzso can be used to study the dynamic growth of a zzso tumor zzso zzso with a single cell scale spatial resolution that approaches the level of light zzso We argue that zzso can be employed as a complementary zzso tool to characterize microscopic zzso expansion, and thus, together with zzso zzso zzso may allow bridging of the experimental and clinical scales more zzso
