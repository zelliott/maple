Working memory zzso the active maintenance of currently relevant information, is a flexible system allowing for fast and frequent zzso changes of rehearsed zzso zzso zzso maintenance prevents interference from distracting stimuli while allowing new zzso information to update the contents of zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that when zzso contents were zzso regardless of stimulus type zzso or zzso a zzso network showed transient increases in zzso Some of these regions are highly similar to those identified in studies of shifting attention, supporting the idea that updating zzso involves a change in the zzso priority afforded to the current zzso zzso A region within the zzso prefrontal cortex, near the junction of the inferior frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso that has previously been implicated in cognitive control, demonstrated transient increases in activity during updating as well as sustained maintenance zzso A more anterior prefrontal region, middle frontal zzso previously implicated in protecting the contents of zzso from interfering stimuli during zzso demonstrated transient increases in activity during zzso The current study suggests that updating zzso results from a combination of increased attention to the visual stimulus and a change in the system's interference protection zzso
