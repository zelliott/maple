zzso PET imaging was used to investigate zzso zzso binding in zzso cerebral zzso in stroke zzso 

zzso stroke patients zzso age 50 zzso 31 zzso with right zzso zzso 9) or left zzso zzso 8) chronic stroke zzso or anterior cerebral artery zzso underwent zzso PET and MR zzso The distribution volume of the zzso binding at equilibrium zzso was determined in the zzso cortical zzso The results were compared with those obtained in 14 zzso zzso In addition, we investigated the effect of the side of the stroke, zzso volume and its zzso 

After removing the age effect by zzso analysis, we found a significant zzso decrease in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso The changes were similar in patients with left and right stroke and did not correlate with the volume of the zzso However, the zzso of the stroke affected the topography of zzso zzso When the zzso did not extend more zzso than the internal zzso zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso lobe zzso p zzso zzso but not in the frontal lobe zzso p zzso zzso zzso when the zzso extended zzso in the zzso region, close to the zzso zzso was reduced in both zzso zzso p zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

This study confirms that stroke may alter zzso receptors in large zzso cortical areas and that the changes depend on the zzso extent of the zzso
