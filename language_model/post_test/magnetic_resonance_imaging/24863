Executive dysfunction is one of the core symptoms of zzso zzso zzso studies have suggested an association between deficits in zzso the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and executive dysfunction, but zzso from the zzso to the whole brain remains zzso Studies investigating the zzso from the zzso to the whole brain in unaffected but genetically liable family members are zzso In this study, we report zzso zzso deficits correlated with executive dysfunction and family history of schizophrenia using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Using seed regions in zzso we examined zzso functional connectivity in 25 patients with zzso 25 unaffected first-degree relatives zzso and 25 healthy control zzso zzso zzso patients and zzso have impaired connectivity from zzso to its coordinated regions zzso zzso zzso These coordinated brain regions are distributed in the bilateral zzso left zzso frontal zzso left zzso zzso and right zzso The individual functional connectivity strength between the left zzso and its coordinated regions was correlated with individual executive function performance among whole zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings support that distributed zzso zzso deficits reflect a genetic risk for schizophrenia and that these deficits are present, to a lesser degree, in unaffected first-degree zzso Our findings also support that zzso might correlate with a patient's executive function zzso
