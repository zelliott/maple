We aimed to correlate early imaging data with motor outcomes in a large, zzso cohort of infants with zzso zzso before 29 days of life) zzso zzso stroke zzso 

From a prospective cohort of 100 children with zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso studies performed within the 28 first days of life for 80 infants evaluated at 2 years of zzso The relationships between zzso location and zzso tract zzso involvement and motor outcomes were studied 

zzso zzso involved the middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Of those, 50 were superficial zzso 5 deep zzso and 18 mixed zzso The zzso was involved in 24 zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso developed zzso Mixed zzso zzso and zzso involvement zzso were highly zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso of children with isolated superficial zzso zzso did not exhibit zzso 

zzso prediction of motor outcomes can be obtained from early zzso scans after zzso zzso The absence of involvement of the zzso resulted in normal motor development in zzso of zzso zzso involvement resulted in zzso zzso in zzso of zzso
