Eleven patients who had undergone cardiac surgery were studied by means of zzso MR imaging zzso zzso Six patients had had zzso root and valve replaced with a zzso zzso composite zzso zzso graft zzso for acute dissection of ascending zzso In the other 5 patients with rheumatic zzso zzso disease, the valve had been replaced with a zzso zzso As a whole, zzso studies were zzso Previous evaluations of magnetic field effects had seem carried out ex zzso on both zzso valves and zzso composite zzso on surgical zzso clips zzso and zzso and on stainless wires for zzso zzso In 4 patients (2 zzso composite zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso diagnosed chronic dissection of both arch and descending zzso In 1 of them, with a zzso zzso associated localized acute dissection of ascending zzso was zzso In 3 patients with zzso composite zzso zzso revealed zzso (including a zzso one) at the graft zzso In one case zzso was repeated 4 times and was very helpful in monitoring the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in 2 patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a case with zzso zzso In one patient with zzso valve zzso MR revealed severe zzso zzso No adverse reactions were demonstrated on MR images of prosthetic zzso zzso artifacts were insignificant with the zzso technique, while the zzso technique showed clear image distortion at the valve zzso
