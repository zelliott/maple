The relationship between tumor mass and vascular involvement as seen on MR imaging was examined in 11 patients with masses in the zzso region, and the findings were correlated with CT and zzso In six cases, MR was superior to CT and zzso in depicting the relationship of the tumor to adjacent blood zzso In these cases, MR demonstrated tumor surrounding the blood vessel without changing the diameter of its zzso zzso did not reveal zzso in these zzso In four cases, both MR and zzso showed signs of vascular zzso with narrowing of the zzso zzso In two cases, MR was zzso while zzso revealed vascular zzso in one case and was negative for zzso in the zzso CT was less sensitive than MR in defining vascular zzso since there is usually little contrast between an enhancing tumor and the major blood zzso zzso scanning appeared to be the best plane of imaging and correlated well with the zzso zzso We propose that MR is the method of choice for evaluating zzso zzso by tumors and may zzso the need for zzso in those cases in which MR is positive for a zzso zzso
