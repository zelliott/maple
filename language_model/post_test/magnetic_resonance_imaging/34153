To assess the relevance of the signal intensity time course for the differential diagnosis of enhancing zzso in dynamic magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso 

Two hundred zzso breast zzso were examined with a two-dimensional dynamic MR imaging series and zzso zzso zzso intensity zzso of the zzso were obtained and classified according to their shapes as type I, which was steady zzso type II, plateau of signal zzso or type III, zzso of signal zzso Enhancement rates and curve types of benign and zzso zzso were zzso 

There were 101 zzso and 165 benign zzso The distribution of curve types for breast zzso was type I, zzso type II, zzso and type III, zzso The distribution of curve types for benign zzso was type I, zzso type II, zzso and type III, zzso The zzso proved significantly different zzso 2 zzso zzso P zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso for signal intensity time course were sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso for the enhancement rate were sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic zzso zzso 

The shape of the zzso intensity curve is an important criterion in zzso benign and zzso enhancing zzso in dynamic breast MR zzso A type III time course is a strong indicator of zzso and is independent of other zzso
