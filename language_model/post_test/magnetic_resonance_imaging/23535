The technology of musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging is advancing at a dramatic zzso zzso resonance imaging is now done at medium and higher field strengths with more specialized surface coils and with more variable pulse sequences and zzso techniques than ever zzso These zzso technical advances are advantageous because they lead to an increased zzso ratio and increased variety of soft tissue contrast zzso However, at the same time, they potentially produce more imaging artifacts when compared with past zzso zzso technical advances have considerable clinical challenges in musculoskeletal zzso such as zzso patient imaging, cartilage zzso and molecular zzso In this review, we consider technical advances in hardware and software of musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging along with their clinical zzso
