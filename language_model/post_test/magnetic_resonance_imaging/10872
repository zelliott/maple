Recent progress in zzso imaging zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso terms of improvements in achievable zzso ratio zzso and spatial resolution, has led to specialized zzso zzso referred to zzso and zzso that now enable zzso and quantitative analysis of zzso bone architecture in zzso in animals and zzso We have during the past decade been dedicated to the development of acquisition and processing methods permitting quantitative characterization of the complex architecture of zzso and cortical bone from zzso data obtained in the limited spatial resolution regime inherent to zzso performed in zzso Fundamental to achieving such a goal is an image acquisition strategy that ensures faithful retrieval of the structural features, which includes appropriate imaging pulse sequences and control of and correction for zzso subject zzso zzso of the raw images results in zzso zzso images representing maps of bone volume zzso which are zzso (a method for reducing partial volume blurring with zzso to yield images in higher spatial zzso From the zzso and zzso images the three-dimensional zzso of the network can be retrieved allowing each zzso to be characterized as belonging to a surface, curve or junction between the fundamental zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso counterparts of plates and rods for better differentiation of bone zzso
