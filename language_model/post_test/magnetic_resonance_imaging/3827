zzso of external motion tracking devices is an emerging technology in head motion correction for zzso However, zzso between the reference frames of the external tracking device and the zzso scanner can be tedious and remains a challenge in practical zzso In this study, we present two hybrid methods, both of which combine zzso zzso motion correction with retrospective zzso zzso to remove residual motion zzso Our results revealed that in the presence of zzso errors between the optical tracking device and the MR zzso application of retrospective correction on zzso corrected data significantly improves image zzso As a result of this hybrid prospective and retrospective motion correction approach, the requirement for a high-quality zzso scan can be significantly relaxed, even to the extent that it is possible to perform external prospective motion tracking without any prior zzso step if a crude approximation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the motion tracking system, which is used to reduce the zzso of the zzso problem, benefits the retrospective approach at the same zzso
