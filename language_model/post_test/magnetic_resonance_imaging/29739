This paper presents a newly developed method to estimate, in magnetic resonance zzso images, the temperatures reached within the volume of an zzso produced by a zzso zzso Building on the direct zzso of the MR signal intensity and its correlation with independent temperature variations at the phase transition from liquid to solid, the zzso information embedded in the images was zzso The volume and diameter of the growing zzso were estimated from a time series of MR zzso Using zzso over the volume in the time and zzso zzso this method predicted the zzso temperatures beyond the range of sensitivity of the MR signal zzso We present a validation of this method in samples of gelatin and ex zzso pig zzso zzso predictions are shown to agree with independent zzso readings over a range extending from 20 degrees C down to zzso degrees C, with an average error of less than 6 degrees zzso
