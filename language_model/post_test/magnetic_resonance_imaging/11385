To study changes in zzso zzso disc heights in an zzso Jordanian sample relative to age, sex, zzso level and zzso zzso 

A total of 153 zzso patients zzso zzso age range zzso years; mean zzso and 66 zzso age range zzso years; mean zzso were selected during the study zzso All underwent zzso magnetic resonance imaging to measure the zzso disc height and zzso height of all zzso zzso zzso were statistically analyzed to obtain the significance of differences in the means of zzso disc heights at different levels in every age group and among other age zzso The relative height zzso for every zzso level in each age group for both males and females were zzso 

The results showed that a highly significant zzso zzso increase sequence of zzso disc heights is zzso where maximum values are reached at zzso 3/4 level in the younger age groups and at zzso zzso 1 level in older zzso In relation to age, zzso disc heights displayed a zzso alternating zzso pattern, which was of higher magnitude and statistically significant in zzso but less evident and statistically insignificant in zzso zzso values were reached during the 6th decade in males while during the 5th decade in zzso The relative height zzso were similar in both sexes and remained fairly constant between age groups at all zzso 

The zzso and zzso patterns could be termed zzso and interpreted as adaptation of the zzso spine to changing functional zzso The utility of the relative height index is zzso
