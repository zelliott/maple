zzso surgery for zzso zzso of the brain stem is considered a hazardous zzso and morbidity of varying degrees cannot be avoided even with partial removal or zzso The main causes of morbidity relate to direct damage during removal of the zzso selection of an entry route into the brain zzso and the direction of brain stem zzso The authors examined the possibility of making a zzso incision and retracting the brain zzso taking into account the zzso and surgical zzso and found two safe entry zones into the brain stem through a zzso approach via the floor of the fourth zzso These safe entry zones are areas where important neural structures are less zzso One is the zzso zzso which is bordered zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the facial nerve (which runs in the zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso The second is the zzso zzso which is bordered zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso by the facial zzso In order to minimize the zzso damage to important zzso structures, the brain stem should be zzso either zzso or zzso in the zzso triangle approach and only zzso in the zzso triangle zzso Three localized zzso zzso zzso were treated surgically via the safe entry zones using the zzso approach in two and the zzso approach in zzso The cases are described and the approaches zzso Both approaches are indicated for focal zzso zzso located unilaterally and zzso to the zzso zzso in the lower zzso to the zzso zzso resonance imaging is useful in selecting these approaches, and zzso zzso is helpful to confirm the exact location of a zzso before a zzso incision is zzso These approaches can also be used as routes for aspiration of zzso zzso as well as for tumor zzso
