To zzso investigate signal zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with delayed zzso following CO zzso as seen on gray matter zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

This prospective study was approved by the local institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all zzso Thirteen patients with delayed onset of zzso zzso zzso men and four zzso mean age, zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso patients without zzso and 13 zzso healthy volunteers were examined with zzso zzso MR zzso The signal intensity of the zzso zzso was zzso to the adjacent zzso white matter in the zzso zzso followed by semiautomatic zzso into zzso middle, and lateral parts by using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses and zzso rank correlation test were performed to examine the relationships between zzso Clinical severity was assessed with the modified zzso and zzso rating zzso 

The zzso signal ratios in the middle and lateral segments of the zzso zzso were significantly higher in those with zzso zzso compared with those with CO intoxication without zzso or normal volunteers zzso For the zzso zzso the ratios showed no significant differences among the zzso The zzso signal ratios of zzso zzso were correlated with the severity of zzso particularly in the lateral segments zzso zzso 

CO toxicity to the zzso zzso plays a role in zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging is a useful tool in depicting zzso zzso injury following CO zzso
