When we observe an action, we know almost immediately what goal is pursued by the zzso zzso this applies also to pretend action zzso which provides relevant information about the manipulation itself but not about the manipulated zzso The present zzso study addressed the issue of goal zzso from pretend action as compared with real zzso We found differences as well as zzso for the brain zzso of zzso goals from both types of zzso They differed with regard to the weights of the underlying action observation network, indicating the exploitation of object information in the case of real actions and manipulation information in the case of zzso However, goal zzso from manipulation information resulted in a common network for both real and pretend zzso Interestingly, this latter network also comprised areas that are not identified by action observation and that might be due to the processing of scene zzso and to the evaluation of fit of putative action zzso These findings suggest that observation of pretense emphasizes the requirement to internally simulate the observed act but rule out fundamental differences of how observers cope with real and pretend zzso
