The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of magnetic resonance imaging zzso patterns in a large population sample of children with cerebral zzso zzso and to examine associations between zzso patterns, and zzso and zzso zzso 

Data were retrieved from the Victorian zzso Register for zzso children zzso zzso zzso zzso born between 1999 and zzso zzso zzso was classified for 594 zzso For zzso children zzso zzso 234 zzso for whom zzso was to a single zzso pattern, the frequency of each variable was compared between patterns and with the population zzso 

White matter injury was the most common zzso pattern zzso followed by zzso matter injury zzso normal imaging zzso zzso zzso focal vascular insults zzso and zzso patterns zzso zzso birth zzso level of zzso care, zzso score, and time to established zzso varied between zzso patterns zzso zzso was most strongly associated with focal vascular zzso whereas zzso was associated only with zzso Grey matter injury was not associated with birth in a zzso unit, but was strongly associated with severe zzso zzso The frequency of zzso zzso and of nursery admissions was lowest among children with zzso 

As known risk factors for zzso are zzso associated with specific zzso patterns, future exploration of zzso pathways might be facilitated when performed in zzso defined zzso
