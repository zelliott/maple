A fundamental question about the nature of cognitive control is whether performing two tasks successively or simultaneously activates distinct brain zzso To investigate this question, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study that compared zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that performing two tasks successively or simultaneously activated a common zzso neural network relative to performing each task zzso More importantly, we found that the anterior zzso and the lateral prefrontal zzso were differently activated in zzso and zzso zzso When performing two tasks zzso as compared to performing them in succession, zzso was found in the zzso anterior zzso zzso In contrast, switching between two tasks, relative to performing them zzso activated the left lateral prefrontal zzso and the bilateral zzso zzso zzso We interpret these results as indicating that the zzso anterior zzso zzso serves to resolve conflicts between zzso associations when performing two tasks zzso while the lateral prefrontal zzso zzso selects the neural pathways needed to perform a given task during task zzso
