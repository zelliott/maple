zzso imaging studies of spatial attention regularly report zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso including the frontal eye fields zzso in tasks requiring overt or covert shifting of zzso In contrast, zzso studies of patients with spatial neglect - a syndrome characterized by severe zzso of spatial attention - show that the critical damage concerns more zzso regions, zzso the inferior zzso zzso the zzso junction zzso and the superior zzso zzso We performed zzso zzso mapping of 29 zzso stroke patients, using several performance zzso derived from a zzso task as measures of spatial zzso In contrast to previous studies, we focused our analyses on eight regions of interest defined according to results of previous functional imaging zzso A direct comparison of neglect with control patients revealed that neglect was associated with damage to the zzso the middle frontal zzso and the zzso zzso The latter region was also a significant predictor of the degree of zzso slowing of target detection and the extent to which zzso zzso captured attention of neglect zzso Finally, damage to the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the tendency of neglect patients to orient attention toward zzso relevant zzso These findings support the results of functional imaging studies of spatial attention and provide evidence for a network account of zzso according to which zzso selection of relevant environmental stimuli and the zzso of attention result from dynamic interactions between the zzso the zzso zzso cortex, and the zzso
