Despite the increasing interest in knee cartilage volume as an outcome measure in studies of zzso zzso it is unclear what components of knee cartilage will be most useful as markers of structural change in the zzso zzso This study was undertaken to zzso compare changes in zzso and zzso cartilage volume in patients with zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with knee zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso cartilage volumes zzso and lateral zzso zzso were determined from zzso zzso magnetic resonance images of the knee from zzso zzso 

The study population was followed up for a mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso joint, the mean zzso zzso loss of cartilage was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cartilage and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso In the lateral zzso joint, the average loss was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso cartilage, zzso There was a significant correlation between the degree of loss of zzso cartilage and the degree of loss of zzso cartilage, in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso at the lateral zzso zzso 

zzso changes in zzso cartilage and those in zzso cartilage are strongly related to one zzso This suggests that in zzso disease, measuring zzso cartilage alone may be adequate, given the facts that zzso of the total zzso cartilage are less zzso and there are difficulties inherent in identifying the most appropriate component of zzso cartilage to zzso
