Popular zzso shield designs aim to provide coverage of the true zzso which is presumed to be the probable location of the zzso Shields are frequently placed zzso especially in children, obscuring important zzso landmarks on pelvic zzso We aimed to identify the position of the zzso and zzso how this may vary with age and the degree of zzso zzso We aimed to identify the position of the zzso and zzso how this may vary with age and the degree of zzso zzso 

Using zzso examinations of the pelvis in women and children, we located 594 zzso in zzso female patients aged from birth to 59 zzso 

This study provides new evidence that zzso filling affects zzso zzso A lower than expected number of patients had both zzso within the pelvis if the zzso contained more than a moderate volume of zzso zzso zzso should be achieved wherever practical if a shield is zzso In children under the age of 7 years, more than half zzso had at least one zzso outside the true zzso There was a significant association between age and zzso position, with the percentage of patients with one or both zzso outside the true pelvis decreasing with age zzso zzso 

The zzso descent of the zzso into the pelvis would appear to continue after birth, well into zzso Current popular shield designs are therefore inappropriate for use in young zzso Given the high risk of obscuring critical landmarks, coupled with the new evidence that even accurate placement will not necessarily protect the zzso the use of pelvic shields in girls should be zzso
