zzso connectivity between brain regions, measured with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, holds great potential for understanding the basis of behavior and zzso zzso Recently it has become clear that correlations between the blood zzso level dependent zzso signals from different areas vary over the course of a typical scan zzso zzso in zzso though the changes are obscured by standard methods of analysis that assume the relationships are zzso Unfortunately, because similar zzso is observed in signals that share no zzso information, it is unclear which dynamic changes are related to underlying neural zzso To examine this question, zzso data were recorded simultaneously with local field zzso zzso from zzso primary zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso signals were converted into zzso power zzso signals including zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso between signals from zzso zzso was performed in sliding windows to produce signals of correlation over time for zzso and each zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso signals showed large changes in correlation over time and the changes in zzso were significantly correlated to the changes in zzso The strongest relationship was seen when using the zzso beta and gamma zzso Interestingly, while zzso zzso and zzso correlate with the global zzso zzso dynamic zzso becomes more like dynamic zzso after the global signal is zzso As zzso sliding window connectivity is partially reflecting underlying zzso changes, the present study suggests it may be a valuable method of studying dynamic changes in brain zzso
