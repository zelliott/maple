zzso and zzso are considered a period of a high risk of stroke responsible in a part of the morbidity and mortality in zzso Imaging is the pivotal tool to zzso and zzso 

To investigate the clinical and imaging features cerebrovascular complications during pregnancy and in post zzso zzso 

We report a retrospective analysis of zzso four patients zzso 2002 - October zzso admitted in the intensive car department of the national institute of neurology for zzso complications during pregnancy and in post zzso zzso 

zzso imaging zzso included cerebral zzso zzso zzso with and without contrast in zzso of cases, magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso of cases completed by zzso zzso zzso in zzso of cases and zzso zzso of Willis polygon in zzso of cases and by cerebral zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso is diagnosed in zzso % of cases followed by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and finally cerebral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of cases each zzso The zzso complications are zzso in zzso % of the cases during the zzso and were associated with the zzso or zzso in zzso % of the cases zzso zzso showed typical zzso of zzso in 23 zzso It confirms the presence of zzso in the 13 patients with zzso and find zzso zzso in one case with zzso zzso zzso show direct zzso zzso and indirect signs of zzso zzso confirms the diagnostic of zzso when done (11 of 12 zzso and show cortical zzso cortical zzso signal on zzso and zzso and zzso signal on zzso zzso zzso was normal in one zzso It shows zzso zzso in the 2 cases of zzso zzso in the cases of zzso and zzso zzso in the cases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso done within 48 hours from admission were decisive for early diagnostic and for fast and adequate zzso 

Early recognition of stroke in zzso zzso by cerebral imaging is of paramount importance for prompt diagnosis and treatment to improve maternal morbidity and zzso
