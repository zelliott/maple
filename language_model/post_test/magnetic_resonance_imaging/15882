zzso exposure to maternal cigarette smoking zzso may affect brain development and behavior in adolescent zzso 

To evaluate the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso the relationship between zzso and substance zzso 

zzso analyses from the zzso Youth Study aimed at evaluating the effects of zzso on brain development and behavior among zzso zzso adolescents were matched with adolescents exposed zzso to cigarette smoking by maternal educational zzso 

A French Canadian founder population of the zzso region of zzso zzso The behavioral data set included zzso adolescents zzso zzso zzso years of age), half of whom were exposed in zzso to maternal cigarette zzso Analysis of cortical thickness and zzso were performed using available data from 314 zzso 

The likelihood of substance use was assessed with the zzso zzso Schedule for Children zzso zzso The number of different drugs tried by each adolescent was assessed using another zzso zzso of the zzso was estimated from zzso magnetic resonance images using zzso zzso 

zzso exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is associated with an increased likelihood of substance zzso Among exposed zzso the likelihood of drug zzso zzso with the degree of zzso zzso In zzso zzso the thickness of the zzso increases as a function of the number of drugs zzso The latter effect is moderated by a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso 

We speculate that zzso interferes with the development of the zzso and, in turn, increases the likelihood of drug use among zzso In contrast, we suggest that, among zzso zzso drug zzso influences the zzso thickness via processes akin to zzso zzso
