zzso processing deficits in schizophrenia have been documented for several decades, but their underlying zzso zzso are still poorly zzso In the visual system, the pattern of zzso reported in several studies is suggestive of dysfunction within the zzso visual zzso beginning in early sensory zzso or even zzso The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate further the zzso bases of visual processing deficits in schizophrenia and in particular the potential role of zzso stream zzso zzso zzso systematically varying in spatial frequency content were presented to subjects at low and high levels of contrast to zzso bias activity in zzso and zzso pathways based on well established differences in zzso response zzso zzso responses zzso by different spatial zzso were mapped over the zzso lobe and then over the entire zzso zzso mapping was used to zzso the zzso zzso with respect to the boundaries of visual areas zzso and zzso which were demarcated in each zzso Relative to control subjects, schizophrenia patients showed markedly reduced zzso to low, but not high, spatial zzso in multiple regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with impaired functioning of the zzso visual zzso and further suggest that these sensory processing deficits may contribute to zzso cognitive deficits in working memory, executive zzso and zzso
