The diagnostic accuracy and zzso for zzso zzso diagnosis are zzso 

To characterize zzso and zzso features in pediatric zzso zzso and to determine whether they had an impact on zzso 

We zzso reviewed a series of 96 pediatric zzso zzso All zzso samples were blindly and independently reviewed and classified according to World Health Organization 2007 and zzso zzso zzso features were reviewed zzso zzso analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between clinical, zzso and zzso features and zzso 

zzso median age was zzso years; median follow-up was zzso zzso zzso involved cerebral zzso or zzso zzso in zzso of cases and zzso in the remaining zzso After zzso review, zzso zzso and zzso tumors were excluded zzso zzso zzso The World Health Organization zzso was not able to demonstrate differences between groups and patients zzso The zzso zzso identified a zzso survival rate difference between the zzso zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso zzso tumors, and zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso tumor was the only zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso zzso location was significantly associated with zzso survival rate zzso zzso zzso zzso attachment was the only zzso criteria associated with longer survival zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was better able to distinguish pediatric zzso zzso in terms of survival compared with the World Health Organization zzso In this series, neither of these 2 zzso zzso provided a zzso zzso of the zzso
