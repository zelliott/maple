In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso is related with zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent zzso to evaluate zzso scars in zzso zzso Furthermore, late potential obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both well-known parameters for predicting lethal zzso 

To investigate whether the pattern of zzso zzso tissue zzso by delayed enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is associated with late potential and zzso zzso we measured late potential and zzso zzso in 27 patients zzso zzso 8 years old) with a prior zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was also obtained using a zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso and delayed enhancement was analyzed in the short axis of the left zzso By conducting this, we tried to determine whether the pattern of zzso zzso tissue predicts lethal zzso zzso zzso zzso scores were identified as the mean zzso score and the maximum zzso score in each zzso There were 9 patients with a positive late potential and 18 patients with a negative late zzso Patients with positive late zzso had significantly larger mean zzso zzso zzso and maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso scores than patients with negative late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with the number of slices showing delayed enhancement, which reflects the size of zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that the pattern of zzso zzso tissue zzso by delayed enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was correlated to the zzso zzso of lethal zzso zzso
