zzso lateral sclerosis zzso has been regarded as a rare, extreme form of zzso lateral sclerosis zzso Like zzso it is a clinical diagnosis without established zzso We sought to explore loss of cerebral zzso in relation to clinical features, including cognitive zzso in cases of both ALS and zzso A novel zzso sequence zzso sensitive to water pools within zzso and zzso and zzso spaces was applied to 23 ALS patients, seven zzso patients and 12 healthy controls, with zzso follow-up in 15 ALS and four zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso patients were distinguished by widespread cerebral zzso water fraction zzso independent of disease duration and clinical upper motor zzso zzso ALS patients showed a significant increase in zzso and zzso water, indirectly linked to zzso zzso Limited measures of cognitive impairment in the ALS group were associated with zzso changes within the anterior corpus zzso and frontal lobe zzso zzso changes were only significant in the zzso zzso In conclusion, in this exploratory study, zzso imaging has potential to distinguish zzso from zzso and may have value as a marker of zzso zzso zzso may be a more active cerebral pathological process than its rate of clinical deterioration zzso
