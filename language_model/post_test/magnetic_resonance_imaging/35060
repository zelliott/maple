The authors are using a zzso difference model zzso to zzso evaluate image quality of the thousands of test images which can be created when zzso fast magnetic resonance zzso imaging strategies and reconstruction zzso In this validation study, they compared human evaluation of MR images from multiple zzso and from multiple image reconstruction zzso to zzso and similar zzso The authors found that zzso compared very favorably to human observers in zzso zzso scale and functional measurement theory studies over a large range of image zzso The zzso threshold for zzso differences in a zzso forced choice study varied with the type of image under study, but was approximately zzso for diffuse image effects, providing a rule of zzso zzso the image quality evaluation models, we found in overall zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Image zzso 13, zzso zzso zzso mean squared error zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The authors conclude that zzso is very useful in MR image evaluation but that one should probably restrict studies to similar images and similar processing, normally not a limitation in image reconstruction zzso
