The International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple zzso first incorporated abnormalities demonstrated by brain and spinal zzso zzso into the diagnostic criteria zzso zzso for multiple sclerosis zzso which were later revised in zzso In 2006, zzso and colleagues modified the zzso criteria to simplify and speed the zzso 

The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of two sets of criteria (the revised McDonald zzso criteria and zzso modified zzso to predict conversion from clinically isolated syndrome zzso to clinically zzso multiple sclerosis zzso from baseline zzso zzso 

zzso patients presenting with zzso suggestive of multiple sclerosis were recruited from 2001 to 2006 and followed up for at least 2 zzso Their baseline brain and spinal zzso zzso studies were zzso zzso The patients who developed zzso during follow-up were treated as positive zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso negative zzso value zzso and accuracy of the two zzso zzso criteria were zzso 

Thirty patients zzso converted to zzso The sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso of the revised McDonald criteria were 53, 100, 100, 71 and 78, respectively, while those for zzso modified criteria were 60, 100, 100, 74 and zzso 

In conclusion, zzso modified criteria are more sensitive and accurate (but not significantly zzso However, zzso criteria are simpler to use and have equally high specificity and zzso
