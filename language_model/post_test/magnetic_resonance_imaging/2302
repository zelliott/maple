There is only limited experience with zzso among the zzso community so zzso We evaluated such a zzso system in order to define indications for its zzso future use and to adjust it to daily clinical zzso We have employed an infrared zzso computerized system zzso zzso for zzso planning and zzso navigation according to digitized zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is used for zzso Forty-eight patients zzso zzso 26 zzso aged zzso zzso with a total of 53 zzso zzso are included in the zzso Fourteen zzso were smaller than 2 zzso zzso 33 were 2-4 zzso zzso and 6 were greater than 4 zzso zzso The documented accuracy was in the range of 3 zzso or better in 33 patients throughout the whole operation and in an additional 7 through the most important surgical steps, with satisfactory results in all types of patient positioning except for the sitting zzso In one patient the accuracy level decreased too early to perform useful zzso zzso Technical dropouts early in the series led to abortion of the navigation in 7 instances but would currently no longer lead to zzso There was no additional surgical morbidity associated with the use of the zzso With more convenience in instrument design and development of techniques for real-time zzso zzso this kind of navigational device will play an increasingly important role for assistance during zzso zzso It proved to be helpful for planning of the zzso zzso guidance on occasions of limited exposure and narrow visual field, zzso and zzso of small zzso in critical areas, and border definition of large zzso and for pure image guided zzso of previously marked zzso
