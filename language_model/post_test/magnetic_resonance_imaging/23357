zzso zzso is a partial zzso at zzso zzso zzso receptors that has been evaluated clinically for treatment of zzso This study examined the effects of zzso on default network activity as a zzso for drug effects on zzso brain function associated with zzso 

zzso and two doses of zzso were administered in a random, zzso crossover design during a Phase 2 study of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 16 zzso patients with schizophrenia while they performed a simple eye movement zzso Independent component analysis was used to identify the default network zzso zzso network changes were evaluated in the context of a zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was previously found to be associated with zzso 

Compared with zzso both 150 and 75 zzso twice daily zzso altered default network activity, including a reduction in zzso cingulate, inferior zzso cortex, and zzso frontal zzso activity and an increase in zzso zzso The most robust difference, zzso zzso activity reduction, was affected by zzso zzso 

The observed zzso changes are consistent with improved default network function in zzso zzso analysis indicates mediation of the effect through the zzso zzso These results further zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in the disease and suggest that default network activity may be a useful indicator of biological effects of novel therapeutic zzso
