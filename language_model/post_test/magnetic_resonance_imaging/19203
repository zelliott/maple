zzso meaning from speech requires the use of zzso semantic, and zzso zzso A central question is: Does the processing of these different types of linguistic information have common or distinct zzso zzso We addressed this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure neural activity when subjects listened to spoken normal sentences contrasted with sentences that had either zzso zzso zzso semantic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso violations zzso All three contrasts revealed robust zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in this area was also observed in a combined analysis of all three experiments, suggesting that it was modulated by all three types of linguistic zzso Planned statistical comparisons between the three experiments revealed zzso a greater difference between conditions in zzso of the zzso zzso for the pragmatic experiment than the zzso zzso zzso a greater difference between conditions in zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the semantic experiment than in the zzso zzso and zzso no regions activated to a greater degree in the zzso experiment than in the semantic zzso These data show that, while zzso and zzso regions may be zzso involved in processing pragmatic and zzso information within sentences, the zzso zzso is involved in processing all three types of linguistic zzso We suggest that this region may play a key role in using zzso semantic zzso zzso and zzso information to construct a higher representation of meaning of zzso
