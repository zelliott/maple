zzso are notoriously difficult to zzso Surgeons must weigh the risks of aggressive zzso against the long-term challenges of zzso Because of their zzso location, often extending well beyond the zzso these tumors challenge vision and zzso and zzso zzso New techniques are needed to improve outcomes in patients with these tumors while decreasing treatment zzso An zzso expanded zzso approach zzso is one such technique that warrants understanding and zzso The authors explain the techniques and approach used for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and introduce a tumor zzso zzso 

The techniques and approach used for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is explained, including the introduction of a tumor zzso zzso This scheme is helpful for understanding both the appropriate expanded approach as well as relevant involved zzso 

The zzso scheme divides tumors according to their zzso zzso Type I is zzso Type II is zzso zzso into the zzso Type III is zzso extending behind the zzso and zzso and has 2 subdivisions zzso extending into the third zzso and zzso extending into the zzso zzso and Type IV is isolated to the third zzso and/or zzso recess and is not accessible via an zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso requires a thorough understanding of both zzso and skull base zzso Moreover, in its application for zzso an understanding of tumor growth and extension with respect to the zzso zzso and zzso is critical to safely approach the zzso via an zzso zzso
