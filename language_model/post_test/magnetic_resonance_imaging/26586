During the resting state, in the absence of external stimuli or zzso mental tasks, some functionally related discrete regions of the brain show complex zzso fluctuations in the blood zzso level dependent zzso Here we developed a novel zzso zzso statistical framework to obtain the zzso patterns of functionally specialized brain networks in the resting zzso Under this zzso the zzso method is proposed and used to detect the spatial zzso patterns of functional zzso This approach overcomes several major problems of the traditional zzso data analysis methods such as zzso correlation and linear zzso zzso By using simulation and real zzso experiment, we have found that the zzso method is shown to be more sensitive in detecting the zzso based zzso connectivity even at a very low functional zzso ratio zzso and this method can achieve much better performance in mapping the zzso patterns of functionally specialized brain networks compared to the traditional zzso
