zzso trial in zzso was a zzso control trial to assess whether partial blockade of sodium channels has a zzso zzso The current study was an additional study to investigate the value of zzso zzso and other zzso in predicting prognosis and/or response to zzso 

zzso patients who attended the zzso or the Royal Free Hospital, zzso eligible for inclusion were invited to participate in the zzso zzso zzso outcome was whether zzso would significantly reduce zzso serum zzso at zzso zzso and zzso months compared to zzso Other zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso 

Treatment effect by comparing absolute changes in zzso between the zzso and zzso group showed no difference, however based on serum zzso adherence there was significant decline in zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso walking times, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cerebral zzso and zzso Other zzso explored in this study were not found to be significantly zzso aside from that of plasma zzso 

The relations between zzso and clinical scores of disability and zzso measures of zzso and disease burden support zzso being a potential surrogate zzso zzso zzso in zzso trials and sample sizes for such trials are presented zzso We did not observe a reduction in zzso levels between the zzso and zzso arms, however, the reduction in serum zzso levels based on zzso adherence points to a possible zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso
