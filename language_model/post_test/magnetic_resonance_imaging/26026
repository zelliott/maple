Patients with third zzso zzso zzso typically are diagnosed when they develop symptoms related to zzso fluid zzso obstruction at the zzso of zzso However, the clinical and zzso characteristics related to symptom development are poorly zzso 

From January 1974 to June 1998, 155 patients with newly diagnosed zzso zzso were managed at our zzso zzso patients zzso were thought to have zzso symptoms, and they underwent surgery zzso zzso zzso 74; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had zzso zzso thought to be zzso and observation with serial zzso was zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the association of patient and tumor characteristics with the development of zzso zzso 

zzso analysis comparing symptomatic and zzso patients revealed four factors associated with zzso zzso 1) younger patient age (44 zzso versus 57 zzso P zzso zzso 2) zzso size (13 zzso versus 8 zzso P zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and 4) increased signal on zzso magnetic resonance images zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso All four variables remained significant in a zzso zzso zzso model: patient age zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso and increased signal on zzso magnetic resonance images zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso The most significant variable was zzso zzso versus zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were further zzso by zzso size zzso or zzso 10 zzso versus zzso 10 zzso For patients with enlarged zzso zzso zzso zzso patient age zzso or zzso 50 zzso versus zzso 50 zzso was the most important zzso Patients older than 50 years also were split with respect to zzso size; patients aged 50 years or younger with enlarged zzso were not affected by zzso zzso The percentage of patients with zzso symptoms was 12, 50, and zzso in the three final patient classes, zzso zzso analysis including the patient classes resulted in removal of the other significant variables from the model, whereas the patient classes remained significant zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso for predicting patients with zzso zzso 

The patient and zzso characteristics of the different patient classes support a theory on the natural history of zzso zzso Patients with third zzso zzso zzso become symptomatic when the tumor zzso zzso causing zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Some zzso enlarge more zzso however, allowing the patient to accommodate the enlarging mass without disruption of zzso flow, and the patient remains zzso In these cases, if the zzso stops growing, the patient can maintain a steady state between zzso production and zzso and may not require zzso zzso
