The purpose of this study was to measure and to clarify the diagnostic contributions of zzso features in zzso benign from zzso and zzso from zzso liver zzso 

Six experienced abdominal zzso each read images from 146 cases (including a contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso scan and zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso following a zzso requiring them to rate zzso each of as many as 131 image features and then reported on each of the two zzso The diagnostic value of each feature was zzso and linear zzso analysis was used to develop statistical prediction rules zzso for merging feature data into computerized zzso zzso For the two zzso accuracy zzso under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso was then determined for the zzso readings by themselves and for each of three zzso 

zzso candidate features had diagnostic value for each of the two zzso (a slightly different feature set for zzso zzso performance at both zzso was excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso Performance of the zzso that operated on the features from all zzso together was better than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso but this difference was of marginal statistical significance zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso CT each made significant zzso contributions to accuracy compared with zzso MR imaging zzso 

Many zzso and MR zzso features have diagnostic value in zzso benign from zzso and zzso from zzso liver zzso zzso could also benefit from the fully informed zzso zzso zzso
