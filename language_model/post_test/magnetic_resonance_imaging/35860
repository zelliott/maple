To determine whether the motion of zzso fluid zzso in the zzso spine degrades zzso magnetic resonance zzso images, a spine zzso three healthy volunteers, and a prospective series of 20 patients suspected of having zzso spine disease underwent MR imaging with and without zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso as low as 3 zzso zzso the zzso range of human zzso zzso zzso reduced image quality on conventional images but not on zzso zzso Similar findings were observed in two volunteers and 11 zzso The magnitude of the artifacts was zzso they could impair zzso of the zzso decrease contrast or reduce the sharpness of the zzso zzso zzso and cause focal regions of reduced zzso signal intensity adjacent to bulging zzso Image quality was most improved when peripheral gating was combined with zzso zzso In the patient group, the use of zzso techniques increased the zzso zzso ratio by an average of zzso zzso less than zzso this resulted in improved contrast between the zzso and zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso motion compensation is clinically useful during zzso MR imaging of the zzso zzso
