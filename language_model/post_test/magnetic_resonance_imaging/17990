zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been considered for development as a zzso and zzso tool for evaluation of Parkinson's disease zzso Here we zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine changes in intrinsic neural zzso in 72 patients with zzso Two different frequency bands zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso band, zzso patients compared with controls had increased zzso values mainly in the zzso and several zzso regions, as well as decreased zzso values in the zzso and the zzso zzso Additionally, in the zzso band, zzso patients relative to controls exhibited reduced zzso value in the thalamus, zzso and several zzso zzso Together, our data demonstrate that zzso patients have widespread abnormal intrinsic neural zzso in the zzso network in line with the zzso of zzso and further suggest that the abnormalities are dependent on zzso frequency zzso Thus, frequency domain analyses of resting state zzso signals may provide a useful means to study the zzso of zzso and the physiology of the zzso zzso zzso
