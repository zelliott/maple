We have applied a novel zzso model of the distribution of contrast media to dynamic zzso zzso data from patients with zzso zzso The model uses data collected during the passage of a zzso of contrast medium and allows zzso image zzso The aims of the study were to investigate the feasibility of zzso mapping using the first pass technique and zzso acquisitions, and to examine the zzso of the technique and the effect of the zzso dual vascular supply on the assumptions of the zzso Imaging was performed in 14 patients with zzso zzso Dynamic data clearly demonstrated differences in the timing and shape of the contrast medium zzso course curve in the systemic zzso and portal zzso zzso zzso of the arrival time zzso of contrast medium allowed identification of tissue supplied by the zzso arteries and portal zzso zzso zzso all showed typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso surface area product zzso and relative blood volume zzso performed in five patients, showed excellent zzso with zzso ratios zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of enhancing zzso volume was also highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and this was further improved by the use of zzso maps to identify zzso supplied by the zzso artery zzso zzso zzso Estimates of zzso and zzso in normal zzso tissue supplied by the portal vein were highly inaccurate and these zzso were identified by use of the zzso zzso and excluded from the zzso In conclusion, dynamic zzso contrast enhancement combined with a zzso model of the distribution of contrast media in the first pass allows us to produce highly zzso zzso maps of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso that are supplied by the zzso zzso system using zzso zzso
