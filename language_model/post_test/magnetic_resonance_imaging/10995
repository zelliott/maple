The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between cognitive zzso whole brain magnetic transfer ratio zzso imaging, zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging zzso and conventional zzso and zzso imaging in a zzso sample of zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent a single zzso imaging session that obtained zzso zzso images and zzso zzso was obtained on 14 of these zzso Patients underwent a zzso battery, which was used to create an integrated measure of cognitive zzso zzso impairment was the dependent variable in two zzso multiple zzso analyses in which zzso zzso load, zzso zzso load, and zzso or zzso were entered zzso 

zzso was significantly related to cognitive functioning zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after accounting for zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was not significantly related to cognitive zzso 

zzso dysfunction may act as a clinical marker of normal appearing brain tissue pathology in multiple zzso
