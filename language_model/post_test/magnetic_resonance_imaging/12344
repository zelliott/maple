zzso for zzso zzso disease zzso propose zzso zzso plaques to initiate zzso within zzso zzso However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with zzso without concurrent zzso zzso Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that zzso precursors zzso zzso neurodegenerative zzso zzso To examine relationships between zzso and zzso factors as well as zzso within zzso regions in cognitively normal older zzso The study zzso neurodegenerative abnormalities using imaging zzso and examined zzso relationships with zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso a marker of cerebrovascular zzso and cognitive zzso 

zzso study in a community-based convenience sample of 72 cognitively normal older individuals zzso zzso age, zzso zzso years; 48 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso years of education) of the Berkeley Aging zzso 

Each individual underwent a standardized zzso test session, magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For each individual, 3 zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso volume, zzso zzso and gray matter zzso the latter 2 sampled from cortical zzso zzso To zzso neurodegenerative zzso each zzso was age zzso zzso into a normal or abnormal status zzso zzso thresholds derived from an independent zzso zzso and summarized into 0, 1, or more than 1 abnormal neurodegenerative zzso Degree and zzso patterns of neurodegenerative abnormalities were assessed and their relationships with cognitive functions, zzso volume, and zzso deposition zzso using carbon zzso Pittsburgh compound B zzso zzso zzso 

Of our cognitively normal elderly individuals, zzso zzso zzso 29) displayed at least 1 abnormal neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of whom had no evidence of elevated Pittsburgh compound B zzso In those people who were classified as having abnormal cortical zzso degree and zzso specificity of neurodegenerative abnormalities were similar to patients with zzso zzso of neurodegenerative abnormalities was related to poor memory and executive functions as well as larger zzso volumes but not elevated Pittsburgh compound B zzso 

Our study confirms that a substantial proportion of cognitively normal older adults harbor zzso without zzso zzso zzso of neurodegenerative abnormalities with cerebrovascular disease and cognitive performance indicate that neurodegenerative pathology can emerge through zzso pathways within regions most affected by zzso
