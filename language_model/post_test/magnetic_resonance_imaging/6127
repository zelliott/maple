The aims of this study were to examine the clinical feasibility and zzso of zzso MR imaging with respect to changes in T zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used a flexible knee zzso which allows acquisition of data in different positions from 40 degrees zzso to full extension during MR zzso The zzso of T zzso zzso was evaluated for zzso and zzso zzso and determined as a zzso of variation zzso for each volunteer and zzso Three different volunteers were measured twice and regions of interest zzso were selected by three zzso at different time zzso To prove the clinical feasibility of this method, 20 subjects (10 patients and 10 zzso and zzso zzso were enrolled in the zzso zzso zzso ranged from 2 to 9 and from 2 to zzso in the deep and superficial zones, zzso Mean zzso zzso was zzso for both zzso Different T zzso values were observed in the superficial cartilage zone of patients compared with zzso Since repair tissue showed a different behavior in the contact zone compared with healthy cartilage, a possible marker for improved evaluation of repair tissue quality after zzso zzso zzso transplantation zzso may be available and may allow zzso assessment of cartilage zzso
