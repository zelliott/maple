To evaluate in a zzso study whether the zzso characterization of focal liver zzso can be improved using zzso and to compare this method with zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

One hundred and thirty four patients with one focal liver zzso detected in baseline ultrasound zzso were examined with conventional zzso zzso US zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso and/or dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were classified as zzso benign or indeterminate and the type of zzso was zzso The final diagnosis based on the combined information of all imaging zzso clinical information and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Comparisons were made to see whether the addition of zzso US led to the improvement of the characterization of doubtful focal liver zzso 

In comparison with zzso zzso zzso markedly improves sensitivity and specificity for the characterization zzso of focal liver zzso In comparison with CT and/or dynamic zzso zzso zzso applied for characterization of focal liver zzso was zzso more sensitive in the recognition of zzso and zzso more specific in the exclusion of zzso and overall zzso more zzso In the zzso with zzso zzso available zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and specificity was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso for the identification of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso resulting in an accuracy of zzso 

zzso zzso emerges as the most sensitive, most specific and thus most accurate imaging zzso for the characterization of focal liver zzso
