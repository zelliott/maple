Current zzso theories of schizophrenia highlight the role of altered brain functional and anatomical zzso The cognitive division of anterior zzso zzso zzso is a commonly reported abnormal brain region in schizophrenia for its importance in cognitive control zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the functional and anatomical connectivity of zzso and its cognitive and clinical manifestation significance in schizophrenia by using the zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the diffusion zzso imaging zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso health controls were zzso zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity analysis and zzso zzso Statistics zzso were performed on 30 patients and 30 controls, and 24 patients and 29 controls, zzso The zzso correlation was performed between the imaging measures and the zzso performance and scores of the Positive and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly abnormal in the functional connectivity and its zzso asymmetry of the zzso with multiple brain areas, zzso decreased positive connectivity with the bilateral zzso and zzso increased negative connectivity with the left zzso zzso zzso zzso increased asymmetry of connectivity strength with the zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso The zzso of the right anterior zzso was significantly decreased in patients group zzso The abnormal functional and structural connectivity of zzso were correlated with zzso performance and the severity of the symptoms in zzso 

Our results suggested that the abnormal connectivity of the zzso might play a role in the cognitive impairment and clinical symptoms in zzso
