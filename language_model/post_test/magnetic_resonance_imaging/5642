zzso and zzso brain zzso patterns were compared during zzso and recognition tasks in mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso and normal controls zzso zzso Deep zzso zzso zzso and shallow zzso zzso black and zzso decisions were made at zzso and pictures from each condition were presented for zzso recognition 20 zzso zzso zzso showed less inferior frontal zzso during deep zzso only) and superficial zzso zzso and in both zzso zzso zzso zzso When performance was equivalent zzso of words zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar for the two groups, but during recognition testing of deeply zzso items NC showed more zzso in both prefrontal and left zzso zzso In a region of interest analysis, the extent of zzso during deep zzso in the zzso zzso and in left zzso correlated with subsequent recognition accuracy for those items in controls but not in zzso which may reflect the zzso of zzso responses in conjunction with different degrees of pathology burden and progression status in the zzso zzso
