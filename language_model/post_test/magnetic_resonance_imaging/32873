We used zzso magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction to generate models of the pelvic floor zzso in classic zzso zzso allowing for statistical analysis of changes seen in the anatomy after primary zzso 

Patients with classic zzso zzso underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging before and after primary zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were mapped and measured in zzso zzso In addition, zzso angles and zzso were used to make a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the pelvic floor before and after zzso 

A total of 19 cases of classic zzso zzso were included in the study, with 12 closed as newborns without zzso and 7 closed later with zzso In both groups the zzso zzso pelvic floor in the zzso plane was zzso and after closure it had a more inward zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso muscle remained relatively unchanged in both zzso The zzso zzso muscle group, with and without zzso was redistributed into the anterior compartment of the pelvis after zzso zzso a successfully closed zzso had the zzso positioned deeply within the zzso After closure the zzso zzso muscle regained the expected smooth contoured zzso 

zzso closure of zzso zzso 1) zzso the pelvis from a zzso zzso to a more inwardly rotated zzso 2) redistributes a significant portion of the zzso zzso muscle into the anterior compartment and 3) zzso a smooth uniform zzso to the pelvic zzso zzso the zzso pelvic ring by zzso zzso in the newborn or by zzso in an infant produces similar changes in the pelvic zzso
