The human brain has been described as a large, zzso complex network characterized by efficient zzso properties, which assure that the brain generates and zzso information with high zzso Many previous zzso studies have provided consistent evidence of zzso zzso among the brain regions in zzso however, little is known about whether or not this dysfunctional connectivity causes disruption of the zzso properties of brain functional zzso To this end, we investigated the zzso properties of human brain functional networks derived from zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Data was obtained from 31 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy zzso then functional connectivity between 90 cortical and zzso regions was estimated by partial correlation analysis and zzso to construct a set of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrated that the brain functional networks had efficient zzso properties in the healthy zzso whereas these properties were disrupted in the patients with zzso Brain functional networks have efficient zzso properties which support efficient parallel information transfer at a relatively low zzso More importantly, in patients with schizophrenia the zzso zzso properties are significantly altered in many brain regions in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings are consistent with a hypothesis of dysfunctional integration of the brain in this zzso Specifically, we found that these altered zzso zzso correlate with illness duration in zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso could prove helpful for understanding the zzso mechanism as well as for evaluation of the severity of zzso
