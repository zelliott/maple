zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies of individuals with zzso disease were analyzed to determine whether the pattern of abnormalities corresponded to the zzso 

This was a retrospective, zzso zzso zzso diagnosed with zzso disease submitted medical records and magnetic resonance imaging discs for central zzso Institutional review board zzso zzso were zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed by two zzso and a child neurologist according to zzso early infantile zzso zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso late infantile zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso later onset zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso adolescent zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso and adult (21 years or zzso zzso three zzso Local interpretations were compared with central zzso 

zzso resonance imaging abnormalities differed among zzso Early infantile patients had a predominance of increased intensity in the zzso white matter as well as changes in the deep cerebral white zzso Later onset patients did not demonstrate involvement in the zzso white matter but had extensive involvement of the deep cerebral white matter, zzso region, and zzso corpus zzso Late infantile patients exhibited a mixed zzso zzso had zzso white matter involvement while all had involvement of the deep cerebral white zzso zzso patients demonstrated isolated zzso tract zzso Local and central reviews primarily differed in interpretation of the early infantile zzso 

Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging in a large cohort of symptomatic patients with zzso disease demonstrated imaging abnormalities zzso to specific zzso zzso of these patterns along with typical clinical zzso should promote earlier diagnosis and facilitate zzso
