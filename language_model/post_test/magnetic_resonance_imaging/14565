Low back pain is frequently caused by nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso engineering is a powerful therapeutic strategy which could restore the normal zzso motion of the human zzso Previously we reported that a new zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso which is loaded with zzso and growth factor embedded zzso zzso via a zzso system, was an effective cell carrier in zzso for zzso tissue zzso This study aimed to investigate whether the zzso of zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso into the rat zzso disc could zzso the zzso zzso Changes in disc height by plain zzso zzso signal intensity in magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression were evaluated in normal controls zzso (without zzso a zzso control zzso group (with needle zzso injected only with zzso modified zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso treatment group (with needle zzso zzso zzso only zzso and zzso zzso loaded with zzso treatment zzso group (with needle zzso zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso for a zzso zzso The results showed that at 24 weeks zzso the PM and zzso groups regained disc height values of zzso and zzso and zzso signal zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, compared to the NC zzso zzso zzso and gene expression analysis also indicated the restoration of zzso zzso in the discs of the PM and zzso zzso However, there was almost no restoration of zzso zzso in the discs of the DC group compared with the PM and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso zzso could partly zzso the zzso disc in zzso after zzso into the rat degenerative zzso zzso
