To assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in assessing zzso progression into synthetic zzso zzso implants inserted in zzso zzso of children submitted to zzso 

We studied 23 zzso zzso implants in 23 children who underwent zzso for zzso Each patient was examined by zzso within to 9 to 69 weeks after implant zzso zzso 34 weeks, median 30 zzso No patient had received chemotherapy or zzso at zzso zzso From each zzso zzso enhanced zzso examination, the image depicting the center of the implant was zzso Enhancement was evaluated using a zzso zzso Additionally, possible associated zzso and zzso zzso and implant migration or zzso were zzso 

All patients showed areas of enhancement of the implant consistent with the presence of zzso zzso There was no grade 1 enhancement in our zzso Grade 2 was observed in 1 patient zzso grade 3 in 7 patients zzso grade 4 in 11 patients zzso and grade 5 in 4 patients zzso During follow-up there were no cases of clinically evident zzso infection, implant migration, or implant zzso No second zzso zzso nerve invasion, zzso extension, tumor zzso or zzso brain seeding were zzso 

In this series, enhanced zzso showed satisfactory zzso zzso of zzso implants since the 13th week after zzso spheres zzso with a trend towards progressive enhancement during the following zzso The data also confirm the advice to wait at least 5-6 months after zzso to perform drilling and peg zzso
