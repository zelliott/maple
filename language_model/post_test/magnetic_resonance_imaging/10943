zzso infants are at increased risk for cognitive disorders, including zzso in recognition zzso This study evaluated the effects of extreme zzso on the neural zzso for auditory recognition memory using zzso zzso zzso a zzso technique widely used in cognitive zzso zzso were recorded at term zzso age in 35 zzso infants born at less than 32 zzso gestation zzso zzso 13 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal brain ultrasounds, compared with 40 healthy, term newborns (1 to 3 days of zzso 20 zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because infants must be able to detect and discriminate sounds before recognizing them, two zzso were used to assess these zzso The first evaluated the detection and discrimination of speech zzso The second tested recognition of the mother's voice compared with a zzso zzso showed significantly different patterns of speech sound discrimination in zzso infants compared with term zzso No evidence of maternal voice recognition was zzso from the zzso zzso No specific patterns of auditory detection or discrimination were associated with patterns of recognition memory, suggesting that the function of multiple neural pathways may have been altered in this group of zzso zzso These results provide a functional corroboration of magnetic resonance imaging studies showing effects of zzso on early brain development, even among zzso infants with normal zzso zzso
