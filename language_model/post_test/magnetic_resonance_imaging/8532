For a long time, cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis patients has been considered less important than, for instance, physical zzso This is no longer true because of the crucial role that cognitive deficits play in the good day-to-day adjustment of zzso This review highlights recent progress made in this zzso A special focus lies on studies investigating the neural zzso of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis patients as zzso by zzso quantitative and functional magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso of zzso speed appear to be the most robust and sensitive markers of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis zzso Recent studies demonstrate that single, predominantly zzso cognitive tests may be superior to extensive and time-consuming test batteries in screening overall cognitive zzso zzso zzso findings suggest the extent of subtle tissue damage in zzso white and zzso matter to correlate best with the severity of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis zzso 

From zzso test data, and findings from magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging it is evident that cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis is not just the result of tissue destruction, but rather a balance between tissue destruction, tissue repair, and zzso functional zzso
