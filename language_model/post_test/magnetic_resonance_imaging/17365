To determine the reliability and correlation of plain zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was assessed using the lateral zzso angle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Thirty patients who had zzso and zzso for zzso syndrome were zzso Six blinded observers assessed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Neither zzso assessment technique demonstrated a positive correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between X-ray and zzso Both techniques were reliable zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso when measured zzso by experienced zzso 

The zzso and the zzso are both reliable zzso assessment techniques on X-ray and zzso when measured zzso and by experienced zzso
