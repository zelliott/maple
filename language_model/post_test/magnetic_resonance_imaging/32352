Half pulse zzso plays an important role in imaging with zzso echo times zzso zzso of the order of TE zzso 100 zzso Based on half zzso this method was theoretically modeled and zzso applied in 1991 for the first zzso Following this work, zzso of slice profiles produced by half zzso were performed and results were compared to the slice profiles produced by the original full zzso Furthermore, the hypothesis was tested that short zzso zzso may be of advantage in minimizing the relaxation effects during the zzso Within the scope of these zzso no dependency of slice profile on the pulse duration could be zzso
