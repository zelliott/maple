zzso resonance imaging of the coronary arteries is a particularly difficult task because of the small size of the vessels and the motion of the heart during the cardiac and respiratory zzso The authors developed a zzso three-dimensional zzso technique to accomplish this zzso Imaging was performed with zzso sizes of zzso zzso This allows for excellent zzso reconstruction to view the coronary arteries from any zzso The short echo time usually makes blood zzso with surrounding tissue since inflow enhancement is weak with a zzso zzso zzso This problem is overcome by applying fat zzso and zzso transfer contrast techniques to suppress the signals of fat and zzso surrounding the coronary zzso Respiratory motion artifacts are reduced by taking four acquisitions and averaging the zzso The authors acquired the first zzso zzso of both the left and right coronary arteries in most cases in zzso minutes with single slab zzso Acquisition of multiple zzso should further increase the length of coverage of the coronary zzso Further improvements will occur when respiratory gating is zzso
