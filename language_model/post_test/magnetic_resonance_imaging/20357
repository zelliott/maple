The purpose of this study was to zzso a novel family with very slowly progressive pure zzso zzso zzso caused by a deletion in the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene on zzso zzso This is a detailed clinical, zzso and zzso description of the zzso zzso in zzso have been shown to cause zzso in six families to zzso A further Japanese family has been identified with an zzso point zzso The exact prevalence is as yet unknown, but is probably higher than previously zzso The clinical zzso of the family is zzso and videotaped clinical examinations are zzso zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging studies were carried out on one affected individual, and genetic analysis was performed on several family zzso zzso analysis confirmed the zzso zzso zzso subjects display a remarkably slow, almost pure zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging shows moderate zzso zzso with mild inferior zzso and zzso cortical volume zzso zzso analysis shows a deletion of zzso zzso in zzso (the second largest zzso deletion reported to zzso suggesting zzso is due to a loss of zzso zzso Western zzso of zzso cell line protein confirms reduced zzso protein zzso zzso is a slowly or zzso pure zzso zzso which appears to be caused by a loss of zzso function and a reduction in the translated zzso Patients with zzso or slowly progressive zzso should be screened for zzso zzso
