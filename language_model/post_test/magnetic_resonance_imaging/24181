zzso of zzso is important in the diagnosis and management of a variety of zzso zzso We evaluated the sensitivity of the following sequences for depicting chronic zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso echo zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, and segmented zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, no previous comparison has been made with these techniques in the same zzso 

Fifty patients with suspected chronic zzso were examined zzso with the above six zzso zzso ratio zzso sensitivity to detection of zzso zzso of internal architecture, and sensitivity to small zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso were found in 35 zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the number of small zzso zzso detected was 85, 96, 44, 22, two, and one, respectively, for the zzso white zzso 70, 40, 19, four, zero, and zero, respectively, for the zzso zzso zzso and 73, 50, 26, 37, zero, and zero, respectively, for the zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence was best for detecting zzso zzso associated with chronic zzso zzso zzso while comparable to zzso in the zzso zzso was reduced in its sensitivity near the skull base, and may be used as an alternative to zzso in zzso zzso zzso or claustrophobic zzso zzso should not be used in screening for zzso zzso
