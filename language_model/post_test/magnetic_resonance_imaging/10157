The recent zzso of interest in contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, of zzso zzso for medical zzso and lately, for optical imaging of cells has generated an impressive momentum for the coordination and zzso chemistry of zzso zzso zzso We shortly review the synthetic methods allowing the introduction of these zzso zzso with fascinating optical and magnetic properties into elaborate zzso and zzso zzso We then illustrate these methods by selected examples describing the use of zzso a zzso to produce zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso element zzso zzso zzso for the production of zzso with high zzso and for zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso processes for producing functional zzso zzso
