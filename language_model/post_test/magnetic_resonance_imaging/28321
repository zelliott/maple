zzso zzso imaging is one of the less common zzso imaging zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso zzso is characterized by some remarkable features: the zzso zzso power is at least two orders of magnitude lower in comparison to conventionally zzso zzso imaging zzso Thus, the technique is of interest for imaging of large zzso The systematic noise inherent in images obtained with random noise zzso has been eliminated by using zzso noise together with zzso transformation for data zzso Data acquisition times are comparable to those of zzso imaging zzso For slice selection, zzso zzso is destroyed outside the slice region with specially designed low power zzso Thus, zzso switching times are only limited by zzso and not zzso Images are reconstructed by the zzso zzso We have set up a zzso imaging procedure on a conventional zzso zzso 300 zzso and have drawn a comparison between images obtained by the zzso noise zzso and by conventional zzso zzso
