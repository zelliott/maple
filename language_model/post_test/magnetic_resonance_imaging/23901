An automatic method for identifying zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso images obtained from patients with clinical evidence of zzso lobe zzso zzso is zzso The method is based on the analysis of image intensity differences between patients and controls within a volume of interest zzso zzso on the zzso The core of the method is a fully automatic signal zzso zzso image registration zzso In particular, a global zzso registration to a reference image is performed, followed by a local zzso registration within the zzso A mask produced by manual zzso of the mean zzso for 30 control subjects enabled investigations to be restricted to a specified region of the zzso approximately corresponding to the zzso zzso variations of zzso signal intensity were zzso from images obtained for the 30 control zzso The manual method of zzso zzso currently an important component of the zzso evaluation of patients with clinical evidence of medically intractable zzso is used to determine the lower 1st zzso limits of normal zzso zzso zzso with volumes below this limit are defined as zzso We investigated whether the automatic method can correctly distinguish between 15 patients with significant zzso zzso according to absolute volumes and a further 14 zzso zzso zzso enabled evaluation of sensitivity and specificity in respect of an intensity zzso zzso specificity is required when determining suitability of patients for zzso resulting in levels of 50% and zzso sensitivity in detecting zzso in the right and left zzso zzso We propose that the method can be developed as an automatic screening zzso
