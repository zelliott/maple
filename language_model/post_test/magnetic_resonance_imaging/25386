Researchers are not in complete agreement over the extent to which specific language functions are zzso by certain brain zzso The purpose of this article was to determine zzso zzso of zzso following cerebrovascular zzso 

The participants included 50 stroke patients with a single zzso zzso and residual mild to severe zzso zzso assessed by the Boston zzso zzso zzso zzso was affected to various degrees by a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the brain were acquired with zzso zzso (20 zzso of zzso zzso on a zzso gamma camera equipped with zzso high-resolution zzso zzso between reduced cerebral zzso and the zzso score was zzso 

The most prominent zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso as determined by the zzso index, were found in the frontal zzso and to a lesser degree, the zzso lobe and zzso whereas the most prominent deficits in zzso zzso were found in the left zzso and zzso zzso In global zzso zzso images evidenced the most extensive damage throughout the zzso region of the left zzso 

There is need for reinterpretation of the anatomical correlation of selected zzso zzso especially classic zzso and zzso zzso The present study highlights the zzso role of some zzso structures in language and speech zzso The results support the usefulness of regional cerebral blood flow zzso imaging as a diagnostic aid in the zzso zzso
