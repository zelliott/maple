zzso patients underwent zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso 7 to 21 days after acute zzso zzso (10 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The success rate of zzso of zzso evaluated independently by a qualitative score (from 0 to 4) based on the brilliance of the zzso signal after taking steps to eliminate the zzso of zzso fat and zzso flow signals, was zzso zzso zzso in anterior zzso (10 out of 10) and zzso zzso zzso (4 out of 7) in inferior zzso zzso less than zzso The diagnostic sensitivity was increased when images of the third echo were used (13 out of 17) compared to those of the second echo (8 out of 17, p less than zzso The value of the 3rd echo is explained and zzso zzso zzso signals were not recorded in a control group of 10 patients under similar conditions of zzso zzso Finally, significant correlations were observed between peak zzso zzso and the zzso score zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and between peak zzso and the number of sections in which the zzso signal was observed zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso this may open the day to zzso of zzso necrosis by zzso
