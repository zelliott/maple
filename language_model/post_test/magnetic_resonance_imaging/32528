Classic identity negative zzso zzso refers to the finding that when an object is ignored, subsequent naming responses to it are slower than when it has not been previously ignored zzso zzso zzso The negative zzso effect: zzso zzso by ignored zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is unclear whether this phenomenon arises due to the involvement of abstract semantic representations that the ignored object zzso zzso Contemporary zzso models propose a key role for the anterior zzso zzso in the representation of abstract semantic knowledge zzso zzso zzso Rogers, zzso zzso The parallel distributed processing approach to semantic zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso suggesting that this region should be involved during performance of the classic identity zzso task if it involves semantic zzso Using zzso (4 zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed increased zzso responses in the left zzso zzso zzso including the zzso pole that was directly related to the magnitude of each zzso zzso effect, supporting a semantic zzso Additional signal increases were observed in the supplementary eye fields zzso and left inferior zzso zzso zzso
