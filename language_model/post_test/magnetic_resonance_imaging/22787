Recent guidelines define chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso as a preventable and zzso disease characterized by zzso limitation and systemic zzso zzso limitation in COPD worsens over years as assessed by the forced zzso volume in one second zzso Regardless, while it is likely that cardiovascular and other systemic components also zzso as COPD progresses, there are no accepted or validated outcomes to measure such zzso changes as they relate to COPD disease zzso It is clear that health status in COPD is more closely related to levels of patients' physical functional capacity than it is to changes in zzso Furthermore, the relative contributions of zzso changes such as small airways zzso and pulmonary zzso to declining zzso remain zzso These features may even progress at different rates in the same zzso Although stopping smoking is the only intervention shown to alter the relentless progression of zzso the zzso slowing of zzso decline takes several years to zzso and requires at least 1,000 subjects to demonstrate annual therapeutic benefits of as little as 20 zzso The zzso cannot distinguish between zzso zzso and zzso and it is feasible that, as techniques are developed and zzso lung imaging zzso may become important and sensitive outcomes measures of zzso and zzso lung structural changes in zzso The development of zzso of lung damage, pulmonary zzso and systemic disease will be essential to our further understanding of the natural history of COPD and the discovery of new, effective treatments for its zzso
