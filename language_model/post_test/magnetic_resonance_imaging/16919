A theoretical method for direct imaging of neural activity is presented zzso It is based on a mechanism of random zzso along the magnetic field generated by active zzso zzso conditions are fulfilled in a rotating frame whose properties are determined by the zzso and frequency of neural field zzso This technique can be implemented on scanners commonly used for blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso
