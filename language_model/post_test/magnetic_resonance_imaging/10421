We sought to compare zzso cartilage volume and thickness measurement between zzso and zzso fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso image data at zzso zzso 

One knee each of 6 healthy adults was examined by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed with a zzso flow angle shot zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso sequence zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage volume and zzso thickness were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined from 3 consecutive data sets acquired for each volunteer and zzso 

zzso cartilage volume and thickness as well as zzso was slightly but not significantly lower for the zzso data than for the zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable for both sequence zzso 

At zzso zzso the zzso sequence showed tendency to be slightly superior to the zzso sequence considering robust and valid assessment of quantitative cartilage parameters in young healthy adults, although there was found no significant statistical difference between both imaging zzso However, in patients suffering from zzso zzso the zzso sequence might prove advantageous for monitoring of disease progression and evaluation of therapy success, particularly because the substantially higher signal to noise zzso to noise ratio values might allow for higher spatial resolution and hence for improvement of the accuracy of zzso process especially at the zzso zzso
