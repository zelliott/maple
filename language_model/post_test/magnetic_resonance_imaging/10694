The objective of this study was to determine the value of zzso invasion by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso typing and grading by zzso zzso and the zzso evaluation of both parameters by frozen section in the evaluation of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso records of 180 patients with zzso cancer were used to compare the zzso zzso zzso the zzso invasion by zzso and the zzso frozen zzso with the final zzso zzso The zzso zzso biopsy gave us the tumor zzso type and zzso zzso gave us the depth of zzso zzso The evaluation of zzso frozen sections gave us the tumor zzso type, the tumor grade, and also the zzso zzso Patients were classified as low risk zzso 1 and 2, and zzso invasion zzso and high risk zzso 3 or zzso invasion zzso Standard statistical calculations were zzso zzso of the tumor grade by zzso biopsy has a sensitivity and a specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the tumor grade by zzso biopsy has a sensitivity and a specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the depth of zzso invasion with zzso has a sensitivity and a specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the depth of zzso invasion with zzso frozen sections has a sensitivity and a specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of all four of the parameters together has a sensitivity and a specificity of zzso and zzso respectively with a zzso of zzso In our opinion, the combination of zzso biopsy and zzso frozen section is the best way to decide whether a zzso is necessary with a low rate of zzso zzso zzso would have a fringe benefit in these zzso
