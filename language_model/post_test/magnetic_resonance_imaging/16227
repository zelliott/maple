Although the normal adult human zzso disc is considered to be zzso zzso cellular zzso tissue can be found in pathological conditions involving the disc such as disc zzso Whether zzso vessels form a component of this zzso tissue is not known as the presence or absence of zzso in zzso and normal disc tissue is not zzso We examined spinal zzso and zzso specimens for the presence of zzso 

The examination used zzso to identify the specific zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso 

zzso vessels were not found in the nucleus zzso or zzso zzso of intact, zzso zzso and zzso discs but were present in the surrounding zzso zzso of zzso tissue was seen in zzso of zzso disc specimens of which zzso contained zzso + zzso zzso zzso vessels were not seen in the zzso and zzso or zzso of four zzso zzso but they were noted in surrounding zzso fat and zzso tissue at the edge of the zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso vessels are not present in the normal adult zzso disc but that, when there is zzso of disc material into surrounding soft zzso there is zzso of zzso zzso tissue containing zzso zzso Our findings also indicate that zzso a zzso of zzso origin, spreads to regional zzso zzso via zzso in zzso soft zzso
