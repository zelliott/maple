Our ability to judge the consequences of our actions is central to rational decision zzso A large body of evidence implicates zzso prefrontal regions in the regulation of this zzso It has proven extremely difficult, however, to separate functional areas in the frontal zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate complementary and zzso roles for the human zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso in monitoring the outcome of zzso zzso levels in these regions were zzso zzso with zzso increasing in the zzso and decreasing in the zzso when the selected response was the result of the zzso own zzso The pattern was reversed when the selected response was guided by the zzso rather than the zzso These results indicate that the neural mechanisms underlying the way we assess the consequences of choices differ depending on whether we are told what to do or are able to exercise our zzso
