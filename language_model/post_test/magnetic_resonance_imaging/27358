zzso life encompasses a critical phase of human brain development, but zzso consequences of zzso differences in prenatal growth among zzso zzso remain largely zzso Here, we combine the power of a zzso twin study design with zzso zzso methods that parse zzso components of structural brain development between ages 3 and 30 zzso to show that subtle variations of the in zzso environment, as zzso by mild birth weight zzso variation within zzso pairs, are accompanied by statistically significant zzso differences in zzso intelligence zzso zzso and zzso zzso of brain anatomy that persist at least into late zzso Greater zzso within the normal range zzso a sustained and generalized increase in brain volume, which in the cortical sheet, is specifically driven by altered surface area rather than cortical zzso Surface area is zzso sensitive to zzso variation within cortical regions implicated in the biology of several mental disorders, the risk for which is modified by zzso zzso zzso We complement this zzso test of prenatal environmental influences on human brain development by replicating anatomical findings in zzso twins and unrelated zzso Thus, using over 1,000 brain scans, across three independent samples, we link subtle differences in prenatal growth, within ranges seen among the majority of human zzso to protracted surface area zzso that zzso impact zzso zzso zzso important for higher zzso By mapping the sensitivity of zzso human brain development to prenatal zzso our findings underline the potency of in zzso life in shaping zzso outcomes of zzso and public health zzso
