Some patients with brain zzso zzso zzso present with focal neurological deficits zzso unrelated to clinically zzso seizure activity or zzso The aim of this study is to determine demographic and zzso zzso characteristics associated with zzso 

The 735 patients of the prospective Columbia zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso statistical models were used to test the association of demographic zzso zzso and zzso characteristics zzso size, zzso location, zzso supply, zzso drainage pattern, zzso zzso with the occurrence of zzso at the time of initial zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso presented with zzso The zzso zzso zzso model revealed an independent association of zzso with increasing age zzso zzso zzso zzso female gender zzso zzso zzso zzso deep brain location zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso location zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No association was found for zzso size, zzso location, zzso supply and zzso drainage zzso 

zzso zzso deficits unrelated to zzso or zzso are a rare initial presentation of zzso The predominance of zzso among zzso and deeply located zzso and the lack of a significant association of zzso size with zzso indicate selective white matter zzso vulnerability, the association with patient age a time dependent zzso The higher frequency of zzso among women suggests zzso of brain tissue zzso
