zzso zzso depiction of zzso anatomy is not always adequately accomplished by imaging techniques in living donor liver transplantation zzso We present the results of a prospective study designed to evaluate the ability of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso for this purpose in a series of 25 adult living liver donors zzso We also analyze if a simple or a more complex surgical procedure can be preoperatively suggested for zzso reconstruction in the zzso zzso on zzso were compared with operative zzso zzso A conventional distribution with a right zzso duct zzso longer than 1 zzso anticipated a simple procedure zzso zzso or zzso zzso A shorter zzso or any zzso were zzso of a more complex surgery zzso zzso or multiple zzso zzso between zzso and OC in assessing the zzso anatomy was measured using the zzso zzso and differences between the kind of surgery predicted at zzso and the zzso zzso performed were evaluated with zzso exact zzso zzso zzso were present in 16 zzso 25 donors zzso zzso was accurate in depicting the pattern of zzso duct distribution observed at OC in 22 zzso 25 zzso donors zzso zzso zzso and correctly predicted the complexity of zzso zzso in the recipient in 22 zzso 25 zzso zzso No significant differences were observed between complexity of zzso surgery proposed at zzso and the final surgery performed zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is highly accurate in depicting the zzso duct anatomy and can be used preoperatively for surgical planning in zzso
