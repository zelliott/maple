The aim of this study was to examine the potential of accurate image registration for detecting subtle changes in the zzso 

zzso zzso volume images were obtained in 10 normal subjects and five patients on two or more occasions (including zzso and zzso zzso The images were segmented and a zzso rigid body translation and rotation technique was used with zzso zzso to precisely match the images using a zzso zzso The registered images and the zzso images produced from them were used to detect changes in signal intensity, sit, shape, and size of the zzso 

Small changes due to differences in orientation of the head, growth, and development as well as inhalation of oxygen and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in normal zzso Changes were also observed in patients with minor head zzso a zzso an zzso and multiple zzso zzso due to contrast enhancement and surgery and/or zzso were also zzso 

With use of zzso zzso subtle changes in the brain were detected in a variety of zzso and clinical situations where differences have zzso been difficult or impossible to zzso
