zzso zzso contrast agents may allow the zzso of specific zzso such as tumors by magnetic resonance imaging zzso In this report the preparation and in zzso characterization of zzso zzso particles zzso are zzso zzso of uniform size zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared from an alkaline solution of zzso and zzso zzso and isolated by differential zzso The resulting zzso suspension is stabilized in buffer using a zzso coat to which a zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso was zzso attached at the hinge zzso The resulting zzso zzso have a zzso radius of less than 50 zzso and specifically bind to zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso present on a cell surface in very low density as expected for tumor zzso or zzso may be achieved due to the high zzso zzso of 300 L zzso of the contrast agent described zzso Furthermore, the zzso coat chosen provides an ideal platform for the attachment of biological zzso needed for the reduction of the zzso and blood clearance rate of zzso zzso
