The powerful emotion inducing properties of music are well-known, yet music may convey differing emotional responses depending on environmental zzso We hypothesized that neural mechanisms involved in listening to music may differ when presented together with visual stimuli that conveyed the same emotion as the music when compared to visual stimuli with zzso emotional zzso 

We designed this study to determine the effect of auditory zzso and sad instrumental zzso and visual stimuli zzso and sad zzso zzso or zzso for emotional content on audiovisual processing using zzso blood zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The experiment was conducted in the context of a conventional zzso zzso A block consisted of three emotional ON zzso music alone zzso or sad zzso face alone zzso or sad zzso and music combined with faces where the music zzso was played while presenting either zzso emotional faces or zzso emotional zzso 

We found activity in the superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be zzso modulated by music and faces depending on the zzso of emotional zzso There was a greater zzso response in zzso when the emotion signaled by the music and faces was zzso Furthermore, the magnitude of these changes differed for happy zzso and sad zzso zzso the zzso of zzso when happy music was presented with happy faces was greater than the zzso seen when sad music was presented with sad zzso In contrast, zzso stimuli diminished the zzso response in zzso and zzso greater signal change in bilateral zzso zzso testing supplemented these findings by showing that subject ratings of emotion in faces were influenced by emotion in zzso When presented with happy music, happy faces were rated as more happy zzso and sad faces were rated as less sad zzso When presented with sad music, happy faces were rated as less happy zzso and sad faces were rated as zzso zzso 

zzso zzso across zzso may enhance activity in auditory regions while zzso appears to impact the perception of visual zzso leading to increased zzso in face processing regions such as the zzso We suggest that greater understanding of the neural bases of zzso zzso across zzso can shed light on basic mechanisms of affective perception and experience and may lead to novel insights in the study of emotion regulation and therapeutic use of zzso
