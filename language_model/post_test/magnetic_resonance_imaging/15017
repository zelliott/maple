zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso leg zzso occurring in standing zzso zzso zzso has an unknown zzso zzso It is thought to be sporadic but siblings with OT from 3 unrelated families were zzso No zzso have been reported in zzso We describe a patient with OT carrying a zzso zzso zzso to highlight the possible association of OT with zzso dysfunction and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A man in his late 60s had zzso and zzso on standing for 30 years, followed by development of progressive external zzso zzso recordings revealed an zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed evidence for a mild zzso and associated mild zzso zzso peripheral zzso Muscle biopsy revealed ragged red zzso mild cerebral zzso was evident by magnetic resonance zzso zzso analysis revealed a novel zzso zzso zzso at an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

Although the incidental association of OT and zzso zzso zzso is possible, the simultaneous onset of OT and zzso zzso at a much younger age than usually observed for OT raises the possibility of zzso dysfunction and loss of zzso DNA integrity in the zzso of zzso
