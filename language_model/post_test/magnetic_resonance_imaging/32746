The clinical relevance of improved detection of cerebral zzso by using zzso MR imaging techniques remains zzso As part of the zzso Rotterdam zzso zzso we compared whether participants whose zzso were only demonstrated on a high-resolution MR imaging sequence differed with respect to risk profile and risk of new zzso from participants whose zzso were also depicted on a conventional MR imaging zzso 

Two hundred participants zzso age, zzso zzso underwent both conventional zzso zzso MR imaging and high-resolution zzso zzso MR imaging at zzso zzso risk factors, zzso zzso status, and markers of small vessel disease and risk of incident zzso were compared for zzso status by using zzso zzso models adjusted for age and zzso 

There were no significant associations between any of the factors and zzso presence in participants whose zzso were only demonstrated on a high-resolution MR imaging zzso However, the estimates in these participants were more similar to those in participants whose zzso were also depicted on a conventional MR imaging sequence than to those in participants without zzso Moreover, significantly more participants whose zzso were only demonstrated on high-resolution MR imaging developed new zzso during follow-up compared with participants without zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso detection of zzso may contribute to more accurate identification of persons with underlying zzso pathology in the general elderly zzso Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and firmly establish the role of improved detection of zzso in the identification of persons with zzso
