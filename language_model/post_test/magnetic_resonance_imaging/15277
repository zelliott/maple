The spatial zzso of the electric fields induced in the human body by switched magnetic field zzso in zzso have been calculated zzso using the commercial software package, zzso and the zzso zzso body model that comprises 31 different tissue zzso The variation of zzso zzso and zzso resulting from exposure of the body model to magnetic fields generated by typical zzso zzso zzso and zzso coils has been zzso for three different body positions zzso zzso and zzso The magnetic field varied at 1 zzso so as to produce a rate of change of zzso of 100 T zzso zzso at the zzso of each zzso A highly zzso pattern of induced electric field and current density was found to result from the smoothly varying magnetic field in all cases, with the largest induced electric fields resulting from application of the zzso in agreement with previous zzso By applying simple statistical analysis to electromagnetic quantities within zzso planes of the body model, it is shown that the induced electric field is strongly correlated to the local value of zzso and the induced current density exhibits even stronger correlation with the local zzso The local values of the switched magnetic field are however shown to bear little relation to the local values of the induced electric field or current zzso
