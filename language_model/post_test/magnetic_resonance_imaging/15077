To evaluate bone zzso changes on knee magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with 3- to zzso period of zzso 

zzso knee examinations were performed in 30 patients zzso men, 16 zzso aged zzso zzso at baseline and zzso weeks after zzso of the zzso lower zzso zzso of patients were examined at additional zzso Ten volunteers (4 men, 6 zzso aged zzso zzso were studied as control cohort at two zzso Bone zzso signal abnormalities were zzso according to: zzso severity, zzso signal zzso relative to zzso cartilage, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in the knee joint and zzso zzso zzso zzso rank correlation test zzso and Kendall's zzso zzso were used to compare individual zzso 

All 30 patients presented abnormal bone zzso findings after zzso which reached a peak at zzso weeks zzso zzso These findings decreased within 1 year zzso High scores of severity were associated with zzso and zzso patterns of bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso 

Signal abnormalities of the bone zzso related to unloading are consistent findings and most prominent zzso weeks following zzso when both zzso and zzso zzso patterns are zzso
