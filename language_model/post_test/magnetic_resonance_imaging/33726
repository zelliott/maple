The purpose of this study was to determine what changes might be detected on MR images of patients with chronic lateral zzso zzso zzso that could explain why some cases are resistant to zzso 

Seven consecutive patients with chronic lateral zzso were zzso The diagnosis was based on symptoms and signs characteristic of the disease, as determined by each patient's orthopedic zzso Three volunteers with normal elbows were control zzso All patients had MR imaging of the involved elbow, and control subjects had MR imaging of the zzso zzso Short zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was chosen because of its sensitivity to changes in the water content of muscle and its suppression of the fat zzso The images were analyzed visually and on an MR zzso to measure the signal intensity of the elbow zzso 

In all seven patients, MR images showed increased signal intensity of the zzso zzso This increase in signal intensity was not observed in the control subjects, and to our knowledge it has not been reported zzso 

Increased signal intensity of the zzso muscle on MR images in patients with chronic lateral zzso suggests involvement of the zzso Increased signal intensity is seen with zzso zzso zzso and zzso which may explain the findings in this zzso Our results are zzso as to whether this increased signal intensity contributes to the zzso of patient zzso or is associated with abnormal elbow motion because of the zzso
