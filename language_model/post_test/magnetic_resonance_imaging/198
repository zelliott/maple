zzso was hypothesized to be involved in the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso through its various zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was shown to be a strong zzso zzso 

We analyzed zzso fluid zzso and serum zzso zzso in 30 zzso patients and 20 controls with zzso neurological diseases zzso and correlated these findings with demographic and clinical characteristics of zzso zzso Disease activity was assessed by brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as an indicator of the state of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were found to be significantly lower in zzso patients compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower in zzso patients as compared to controls, as well as in patients with active zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in comparison to patients with inactive zzso or controls, but these differences were not statistically zzso zzso correlation was found between zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients, but not in zzso and between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso but not in zzso 

Our results support the significance of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso serum zzso zzso in zzso patients might be due to both zzso reduced zzso capacity and increased zzso consumption in zzso zzso zzso zzso may not be a reliable marker of disease activity in zzso since its concentration is dependent on leakage of zzso molecules from serum through the damaged zzso and the balance between zzso within the central nervous system zzso
