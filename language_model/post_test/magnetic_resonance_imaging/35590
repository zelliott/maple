The pattern of zzso accompanying an zzso provides a powerful cue as to a speaker's emotional state of zzso Most prior zzso studies have demonstrated that the zzso point for decoding these zzso emotion cues is zzso by zzso auditory zzso in the right zzso lateral zzso zzso However, functional zzso has brought with it increasing attention to the equivalent left zzso region in this zzso This study used zzso to zzso assess the hypothesis that involvement of the left zzso lateral zzso lobe depended on the linguistic load or verbal complexity of the zzso emotion zzso zzso contrast data was acquired on a zzso scanner whilst 16 healthy young adults identified the zzso emotion in three conditions: zzso comprised of words, a repeated zzso and a single prolonged syllable zzso zzso analyses were performed using zzso and supplemented by zzso lateral zzso lobe region of interest zzso zzso The zzso analyses appeared to show bilateral zzso lobe zzso across the conditions, however, the zzso analyses indicated a highly significant decrease in activity in the left zzso as verbal complexity zzso Changes in right zzso activity were not statistically zzso Our results indicate that the likelihood of observing a notable left zzso lobe response in functional zzso studies of emotional zzso comprehension depends on the verbal complexity of the zzso emotion zzso Despite the right zzso dominance underlying this task, the left zzso region may be zzso in its attempt to extract zzso information from the acoustic stimuli whether or not the stimuli contain meaningful zzso zzso
