To determine the types, relative zzso clinical features, and zzso characteristics of zzso of cortical development zzso occurring in a cohort of children referred to a zzso pediatric zzso 

Original MR images were reviewed by two investigators, who were blinded to clinical details, to determine the zzso imaging features of each zzso and to label these zzso according to an existing system of zzso Clinical information was collected by a review of hospital zzso 

A total of 109 children with zzso were zzso There were 58 boys and 51 girls, age 8 days to 18 years at initial imaging zzso age, 5 zzso zzso were present in zzso zzso delay or intellectual disability in zzso abnormal zzso findings in zzso and zzso anomalies apart from the zzso zzso in zzso The main zzso identified were zzso gray matter zzso cortical zzso zzso focal cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Eight patients had features of more than one zzso Most zzso were zzso zzso with the frontal lobe being the most common lobe involved zzso A total of zzso of patients had other cerebral zzso including zzso zzso or zzso zzso and abnormalities of the corpus zzso zzso 

This study illustrates the spectrum of zzso in a pediatric cohort and highlights some of the differences between pediatric and adult zzso Patients with zzso presenting in childhood have a wider spectrum of zzso and more zzso often more zzso clinical zzso The zzso are frequently zzso or generalized and many are associated with zzso zzso brain zzso
