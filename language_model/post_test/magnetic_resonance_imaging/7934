The aim of this study was to analyze our clinical and neurological results of surgically treated patients suffering from cervical zzso with focusing particularly on the surgical methods used and to review the zzso 

We present a series of 21 patients operated with cervical zzso between 1998 and zzso Basic demographic data, zzso the zzso segments involved, the surgical strategy with special consideration of the material used and the clinical outcome were evaluated zzso 

The mean age of 6 female and 12 male patients was 65 years zzso zzso zzso The mean follow-up was zzso years ranging between 4 weeks and 9 zzso The leading symptom was neurological deficits rather than zzso The segments C zzso zzso and C zzso zzso were most frequently zzso Different surgical methods depending on the location, anatomical and pathological condition and extension of the zzso were zzso 

In conclusion, cervical zzso could effectively be treated in the presented patient cohort by surgical zzso zzso and zzso or bone graft implants followed by long term zzso zzso The presented surgical reconstruction technique with zzso might be a feasible alternative to the use of bone graft or zzso The promising clinical results warrant future prospective studies to further investigate this zzso
