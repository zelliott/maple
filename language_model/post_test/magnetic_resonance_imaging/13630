Recently, the technique of zzso zzso was introduced, which allows the assessment of zzso responses to single task executions zzso zzso zzso or zzso In this study, zzso zzso was used to examine regional differences in the zzso consistency zzso of brain activity related to the processing of a dynamic zzso imagery zzso For every single trial, a zzso assessing zzso zzso was calculated and zzso at a zzso of P zzso or zzso zzso The percentage of trials with zzso above the threshold was used to assess differences in the consistency of brain activity in zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal regions of zzso While most of these regions showed zzso which was highly consistent across trials, the consistency of zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso prefrontal zzso We zzso that the consistency of zzso across trials may be interpreted as an indicator of the functional relevance of a brain region for processing and solving a cognitive zzso Thus, the analysis concept presented here has the potential to provide new insights into the zzso mechanisms of human information zzso In addition, the results of this study confirm that averaging across trials might result in a significant loss of information about functional zzso zzso which are active in some trials only, which show only weak activity increases, or whose activity is not constant and zzso might not show up in averaged zzso maps and could thus erroneously be interpreted as irrelevant for task zzso
