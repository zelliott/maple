To assess exercise capacity and left zzso function using magnetic resonance imaging zzso among patients with chronic heart failure zzso to a residential rehabilitation zzso at baseline and six years after zzso 

zzso controlled zzso 

Residential cardiac rehabilitation zzso and community zzso 

One month of intensive exercise and risk reduction therapy including educational sessions, a low-fat diet, and 2 hours of individually prescribed exercise zzso Control subjects received usual zzso zzso were evaluated at zzso after completing the one-month residential zzso and six years zzso 

From an original study group of 50, 16 patients (8 exercise, 8 zzso with chronic heart failure were alive and available for evaluation after six zzso 

zzso exercise test responses and zzso size and function using zzso 

Peak zzso was zzso and zzso higher after the rehabilitation zzso and six years later, respectively, whereas minimal changes were observed among zzso Left zzso mass and volumes tended to decrease among subjects in the exercise group, whereas left zzso mass and volumes tended to increase among control subjects after six zzso zzso fraction increased approximately zzso in both zzso 

Six years after participation in a concentrated residential rehabilitation zzso exercise capacity was preserved and no significant changes were observed in zzso size or zzso These findings provide further support for exercise rehabilitation in chronic heart zzso
