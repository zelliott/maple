Combined zzso is a relatively new, hybrid imaging zzso A human zzso zzso system consisting of a zzso zzso Trio MR and brain PET insert was installed and tested at our zzso Its present design does not offer measured zzso correction zzso using traditional transmission zzso This study is the development of zzso tools including zzso zzso for zzso in combined zzso for brain zzso 

The developed zzso tools include image zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These components were integrated into a single scheme for processing zzso zzso The zzso method is zzso and based on the zzso transform of brain MR zzso It was developed to segment the skull on zzso MR zzso A modified fuzzy zzso zzso scheme was developed to zzso brain tissue into gray matter, white matter, and zzso zzso zzso tissue is assigned an zzso zzso so that zzso factors can be zzso PET zzso data are then reconstructed using a three-dimensional ordered sets expectation zzso method with the zzso zzso zzso Ten subjects had separate MR and PET zzso The PET with zzso was acquired using a high-resolution research zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with transmission zzso zzso on the zzso zzso volumes of interest were drawn manually on each subject image to compare the PET activities between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

For skull zzso the overlap ratio between our segmented results and the ground truth is zzso zzso zzso zzso correction results from the ten subjects show that the difference between the MR and zzso methods was zzso 

zzso zzso compared favorably with conventional zzso zzso zzso tools including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been developed for use in combined zzso
