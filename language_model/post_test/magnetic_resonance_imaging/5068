zzso zzso can serve as an ultrasound contrast agent, and has the potential for magnetic resonance imaging zzso Due to the relatively low effect of zzso on zzso it is necessary to develop new zzso that are more suitable for zzso In this study, we evaluate the properties of zzso and custom-made zzso zzso zzso in terms of contrast agents for zzso zzso and zzso 

A total of 20 zzso zzso nude mice were randomly assigned to 2 groups zzso zzso mice each group), one for US test and the other for zzso zzso Within each group, two tests were performed for each zzso The contrast agent for the first test is zzso and the second is zzso US was performed using a zzso US system zzso zzso with a zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso The data of zzso ratio zzso from the zzso of each US and MR image was calculated by zzso (National Institute of Health, zzso In group 1, enhancement of zzso was significantly higher than zzso on US zzso In group 2, negative enhancement of zzso was significantly higher than zzso on zzso zzso The time to peak showed no significant differences between US and zzso both of which used the same zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the enhancement process reveals a strong negative correlation in both cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso 

It might be important to change the zzso shell structure and/or the imagining strategy of US to improve the imaging quality of zzso on zzso As an intriguing prospect that can be detected by US and zzso zzso are worthy of further zzso
