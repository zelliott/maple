The ability to read patient identification zzso relies on the use of zzso zzso Since zzso zzso also form an integral part of the magnetic resonance imaging zzso process, the possibility of loss of microchip function during zzso scanning is of zzso Previous clinical trials have shown microchip function to be unaffected by MR imaging using a field strength of 1 zzso and zzso As veterinary zzso scanners range widely in field strength, this study was devised to determine whether exposure to lower or higher field strengths than 1 zzso would affect the function of different types of zzso In a phantom study, a total of 300 International zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each of three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 zzso were tested in a low field zzso and a high field scanner zzso zzso A total of 50 zzso of each type were tested in each zzso The phantom was composed of a zzso freezer pack onto which a plastic pillow and a cardboard strip with affixed zzso were zzso Following an zzso scan protocol simulating a head study, all of the zzso were accurately zzso Neither zzso nor 3 zzso imaging affected microchip function in this zzso
