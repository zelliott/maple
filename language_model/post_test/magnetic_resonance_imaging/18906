To evaluate the potential role of carotid artery zzso plaque magnetic resonance zzso zzso as magnetic resonance imaging zzso marker, ex zzso MR images were acquired at zzso parameters on zzso zzso animal zzso for zzso tissue zzso by carotid zzso zzso and corresponding zzso analysis was zzso 

For imaging, zzso zzso of size 2-6 zzso long and zzso zzso zzso were transferred to 15 zzso zzso laboratory culture tubes containing either zzso zzso in zzso zzso saline (PBS) or in 50% zzso in zzso Imaging protocol was set at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for total sample size zzso zzso Soon after imaging done, carotid artery zzso were cut into zzso segments and processed for zzso section for successive zzso zzso To compare zzso of 5 zzso thin zzso section with that of 1 zzso MR zzso registration was obtained between zzso sections and MR zzso zzso and magnetic resonance relaxation characteristics were zzso 

Total carotid artery area zzso by MR imaging was correlated with areas determined from zzso sections zzso zzso For the zzso area, the correlation between MR images and zzso area was zzso zzso zzso times and zzso zzso images of different plaque components were zzso for contrast zzso zzso parameters were zzso for zzso cap and zzso zzso parameters were characteristic for comparison at zzso and zzso MR zzso 

The observed correlation validated MR zzso to assess zzso features of carotid artery plaques and contrast resolution highlighted the potential of in zzso MR imaging as zzso zzso marker to monitor carotid artery plaque zzso and plaque zzso
