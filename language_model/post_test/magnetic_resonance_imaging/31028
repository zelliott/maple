A significant proportion of patients with zzso zzso experience zzso deterioration after zzso However, no clinical examination has been established for prediction of the progress of zzso To determine the zzso zzso of such zzso we performed zzso CT to zzso assess cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso and mean transit time zzso of patients with zzso zzso in the territory of the zzso zzso 

We performed MR imaging and zzso CT of 26 patients with zzso zzso within 24 zzso after zzso On the zzso map on zzso CT scans, a round small region of interest was set at the region, with decreased zzso in the territory of the zzso artery zzso of interest zzso Another region of interest was set in the mirror position to region of interest 1 in the zzso zzso zzso of interest zzso Using these two regions of interest, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso All patients underwent zzso and MR imaging follow-up while receiving equivalent medical zzso 

zzso deterioration after onset was shown in 13 patients zzso group), whereas no zzso deterioration was shown in the other 13 patients zzso zzso In the progress group, zzso zzso were enlarged on follow-up MR zzso The ratio of region of interest zzso of interest 2 showed significantly lower zzso and higher zzso in the progress group than in the control zzso 

These results suggest that progressive zzso zzso in the territory of the zzso artery could be predicted with a higher zzso ratio zzso and a lower zzso ratio zzso on zzso CT scans obtained within 24 zzso after zzso
