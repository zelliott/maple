zzso between the neural zzso of short-term memory zzso and attention have been actively studied in the visual zzso domain but much less in the verbal zzso zzso Here we show that the same attention mechanisms that have been shown to shape the neural networks of visual zzso also shape those of verbal zzso Based on previous research in visual zzso we contrasted the involvement of a zzso attention network centered on the zzso zzso supporting zzso attention and a zzso attention network centered on the zzso junction supporting zzso zzso We observed that, with increasing zzso load, the zzso attention network was activated while the zzso attention network was zzso especially during early zzso zzso zzso in the zzso attention network increased in response to zzso stimuli briefly presented during the maintenance phase of the zzso trials but only during zzso zzso conditions, which were associated with the lowest levels of activity in the zzso attention network during zzso and early zzso By demonstrating a zzso between zzso and zzso attention networks during verbal zzso this study highlights the dynamics of zzso processes involved in verbal zzso
