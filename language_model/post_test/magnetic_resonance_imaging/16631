Falling asleep is paralleled by a loss of conscious awareness and reduced capacity to process external zzso Little is known on zzso changes of spontaneously synchronized anatomical networks as detected by zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We employed functional connectivity analysis of zzso series obtained from 25 healthy participants, covering all zzso eye movement zzso sleep zzso We focused on the default mode network zzso and its zzso network zzso that are involved in internal and external awareness during zzso Using independent component analysis, zzso analysis zzso and zzso dynamic network zzso we found significant changes in zzso integrity throughout the zzso zzso With increasing sleep depth, contributions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso to the zzso zzso zzso revealed a breakdown of zzso functional zzso particularly between the zzso and anterior zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso and the zzso Dynamic tracking of the zzso from zzso into slow wave sleep in a single subject added insights into zzso network zzso zzso resonate with a role of the zzso for the regulation of zzso We further submit that preserved zzso synchronization could represent a prerequisite for maintaining internal and external zzso
