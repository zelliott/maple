This study aims to compare zzso with zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The final analysis included 26 patients, who underwent 3 consecutive days of zzso zzso Day 1 consisted of anatomical zzso and zzso images, and zzso zzso was acquired using zzso zzso zzso On Day 2, the same zzso sequences were obtained with zzso zzso zzso and on Day 3, the anatomical images were repeated to detect delayed zzso signal zzso The zzso images were evaluated zzso and zzso for enhancement volume and signal intensity zzso changes; zzso data were used to estimate the relative cerebral blood volume zzso All 26 zzso showed 24-hour zzso zzso zzso 16 also had zzso zzso In 6 patients, zzso signal changes were noted in areas with no zzso zzso zzso greater zzso zzso zzso changes were seen with zzso and qualitative analyses zzso border zzso internal zzso contrast zzso also showed significant preferences zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso for this zzso There was no significant difference in zzso enhancement volumes between contrast zzso The zzso values were significantly higher zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso provides important information about tumor biology that zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso indicate areas of tumor undergoing rapid growth, whereas the 24-hour scans mark the presence of inflammatory zzso Both of these functions provide useful information about tumor response to zzso We suggest that dynamic and anatomical imaging with zzso warrant further assessment in brain tumor zzso
