zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are associated with memory impairment in both humans and experimental zzso The zzso zzso is thought to contribute to memory function by providing zzso zzso to critical memory structures such as the zzso and zzso In previously reported clinical cases of zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso regions have been damaged, preventing identification of the minimal critical zzso necessary to produce an zzso zzso We describe a patient who developed persistent, global zzso and retrograde zzso following zzso of a zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed a small discrete zzso zzso in the right diagonal band of zzso that included the zzso area, the anterior zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the cell bodies of the nucleus zzso of zzso appeared to have been zzso as were other structures in the zzso zzso lobe and zzso Our case provides critical support for the independent contribution of the zzso zzso in particular the diagonal band zzso in memory zzso We propose that our patient's zzso resulted from zzso of pathways between the diagonal band zzso and the zzso region, zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
