The aim of this study was to compare different oral delivery systems based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and to provide evidence for the zzso of the hypothesis that zzso zzso provide better zzso in zzso To achieve dry zzso application, a new, experimental dosage form named zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso capsule has been zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to zzso the point of release of the zzso zzso from the application forms via the positive magnetic resonance signal from a zzso complex zzso In zzso zzso was determined by zzso the residence time of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso after 3 zzso zzso showed that in comparison to conventional application forms the zzso capsules led to zzso higher zzso properties of zzso when compared to application with a conventional zzso zzso and to zzso higher zzso when compared to administration with an zzso tablet of the zzso The findings of this study should contribute to the understanding of zzso and zzso influencing parameters in zzso and should therefore be of considerable interest for the development of future zzso oral drug delivery dosage zzso
