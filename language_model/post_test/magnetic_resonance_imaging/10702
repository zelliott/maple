In acute zzso stroke, the zzso but viable tissue is the main therapeutic zzso In clinical routine, zzso zzso maps are frequently used to estimate the zzso compromise and to calculate the mismatch zzso We evaluated the accuracy of zzso maps to identify zzso flow by comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso and PET were performed in 11 patients with acute zzso stroke zzso 8 hours after stroke zzso 60 minutes between zzso and PET zzso The volumes defined by increasing zzso thresholds zzso zzso delay of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared with the volume of zzso zzso zzso g per zzso assessed by zzso zzso In a zzso analysis, each zzso sensitivity, zzso and zzso values were zzso 

The median zzso volume was zzso zzso Low zzso thresholds included large parts of the zzso but also large parts of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and vice versa zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso seconds best identifies zzso zzso The positive zzso values increased with the size of zzso 

This first comparison of quantitative zzso with zzso maps in acute zzso human stroke indicates that the zzso threshold is crucial to reliably identify the tissue at zzso zzso zzso seconds best identifies zzso zzso and zzso maps overestimate the extent of true zzso compromise depending on the size of zzso Only if zzso restrictions are kept in mind, relative zzso maps are suitable to estimate the mismatch zzso
