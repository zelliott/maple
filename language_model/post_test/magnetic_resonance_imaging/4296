zzso changes in cerebral blood zzso were measured using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso covering visual zzso areas in zzso zzso During dynamic imaging, healthy subjects silently viewed zzso single false zzso or zzso strings of the same false zzso The paradigm consisted of a zzso zzso of an zzso and a control zzso With zzso as zzso vs single false zzso as control, responses were seen mainly in zzso zzso zzso These responses disappeared when zzso were zzso with false font strings as the control and zzso when false font strings instead of zzso served as zzso and were zzso with single false zzso The zzso contrast alone, therefore, is sufficient to account for the zzso pattern observed in zzso visual zzso when zzso stimuli are contrasted with single zzso
