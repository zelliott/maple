We assessed the age-related changes in zzso transfer ratio zzso value and the ratio of water content in rat brain zzso lobe and zzso during normal zzso All studies were done on 42 normal zzso zzso zzso was calculated by using the equation zzso where zzso and Mon were the measured signal zzso on the conventional and zzso zzso images, zzso The ratios of water content were measured by comparing the wet weight with the dry weight of the frontal lobe and the zzso which were extracted from a rat brain soon after zzso zzso The ratio of water content was calculated by using the equation 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso weight zzso The ratio of water content decreased markedly during the first 30 days, but the decrease was very slight there after both in the frontal lobe and the zzso The change in zzso was similar to that of the ratio of water content, though the direction of change was zzso zzso significant inverse relationships existed between zzso and the ratio of water content both in the frontal lobe and the zzso zzso could be a new zzso with which to assess brain zzso
