The zzso zzso 1935) is a frequently used zzso test, with poor performance typically interpreted as indicative of zzso and frontal lobe zzso This study tested those interpretations by examining relationships between zzso performance, behavioral zzso and frontal lobe zzso 

Participants were 112 patients with mild cognitive impairment or zzso recruited through zzso Memory and Aging zzso Participants received comprehensive zzso evaluations including structural zzso zzso testing, and informant zzso zzso a zzso zzso program, was used to analyze zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1994) zzso zzso The sample zzso zzso zzso mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso years, education was zzso zzso zzso zzso years, and zzso State zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso were used for data zzso 

Controlling for age, zzso and color naming, zzso performance was not significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso controlling for age, zzso color naming, zzso volume, and zzso and zzso zzso examined whether left or right zzso regions predict zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso best predicted poorer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso right: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Of frontal regions, only zzso prefrontal zzso zzso predicted poorer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso left and right anterior zzso zzso zzso predicted better zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso right: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

These findings suggest zzso performance is a poor measure of behavioral zzso and frontal lobe zzso even among a relatively high-risk zzso
