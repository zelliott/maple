To evaluate previously described primary and secondary zzso signs of disruption to anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso in surgically proven zzso 

We zzso analyzed MR images of 48 patients zzso age 29 zzso with clinically suspected zzso graft zzso All patients had surgical confirmation of the zzso zzso The zzso analyzed the cases blinded to the surgical results and assessed each of the primary and secondary zzso signs of graft disruption zzso zzso a final impression of the graft integrity based on a comprehensive assessment of all of the primary and secondary findings was zzso 

zzso a comprehensive assessment of previously described primary and secondary MR findings of zzso graft zzso the blinded zzso were able to identify correctly zzso graft tears with test accuracy of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso Individual assessment of the primary finding of graft fiber zzso had sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, negative zzso value, and accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso Other individual primary and secondary findings were less zzso however, the primary findings of marked zzso thinning of the graft and markedly abnormal graft orientation, and the secondary findings of bone zzso in the lateral compartment and large joint zzso had high specificity and positive zzso zzso Of the four missed cases, two had associated zzso 

The comprehensive assessment of previously described primary and secondary zzso findings of zzso graft disruption has high test specificity and moderately high test zzso The presence of graft fiber zzso is the most reliable primary or secondary finding when assessed zzso zzso zzso thinning of the graft and abnormal fiber orientation, and the presence of bone zzso in the lateral compartment and large joint zzso are less reliable overall but are highly suggestive of zzso graft tear when zzso
