zzso zzso zzso belong to the category of zzso strain zzso They differ from a classic rotator cuff tear by the following features: zzso attachment remains intact and the acute initial stage typically zzso an intense muscular zzso zzso 6 to 12 months later, by complete and permanent fatty zzso of this zzso 

Between 1993 and 2007, we zzso identified 59 zzso zzso of the zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso percent of these patients were zzso The average age at presentation was 50 years zzso zzso was non traumatic in zzso of these zzso zzso patients were seen at the acute zzso stage with pain and, on zzso fat saturated zzso zzso muscular zzso A second group of 30 patients presented with a stage 4 fatty zzso of the zzso muscle associated with a zzso zzso zzso patients underwent zzso testing which was normal in all zzso None of these patients had a full thickness tear of the rotator cuff zzso zzso of the patients presenting in the acute phase had a partial thickness tear of the zzso which increased to zzso in patients presenting in the chronic phase suggesting a more degenerative zzso zzso zzso was seen in zzso of zzso 

zzso patients underwent surgery, while the remaining 35 were treated zzso The average zzso for all of them, was 46 months zzso The zzso score increased from zzso to zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the operated and the zzso groups zzso All the patients seen at the acute painful zzso stage progressed to stage 4 complete fatty zzso irrespective of selected zzso None of the patients who underwent surgery had any zzso of their fatty zzso 

Early diagnosis of this zzso can be made using zzso fat saturated zzso zzso We zzso that early zzso repair which restores muscle tension in the zzso may halt the progression of this entity and prevent complete functional loss of this zzso
