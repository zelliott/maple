A zzso network, zzso bilateral zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso is thought to play a role in recruiting relevant brain regions for the processing of sensory zzso Here, we present a functional network connectivity zzso analysis of spatial networks identified during zzso performed to test the hypothesis that zzso network connectivity is disturbed during information processing in zzso 19 zzso individuals with schizophrenia and 19 matched healthy controls participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 100 zzso zzso stimuli were presented to the right index fingertip while zzso blood zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso images were zzso Six spatial components of interest were identified using group independent component analysis: zzso bilateral zzso superior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso left zzso frontal and zzso zzso zzso central executive network zzso zzso right zzso frontal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and angular zzso zzso zzso correlation was examined between all zzso combinations of zzso zzso reduced zzso was observed in schizophrenia compared to controls between: zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso There was no evidence of increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso network connectivity during information processing in schizophrenia suggests zzso to the system which effects changes between zzso functional brain zzso This zzso may provide a zzso explanation of several clinical features of the zzso
