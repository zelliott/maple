zzso pulse zzso in diverse pulse schemes lead to the reduction of the magnitude of the zzso zzso due to zzso and zzso effects during the zzso zzso This paper presents an analysis of the steady state signal in the presence of relaxation effects during zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso echo zzso It is shown that minor zzso of the zzso zzso can have dramatic consequences on the measured zzso and may thus entail a loss in zzso benefits at high zzso magnetic fields if a careful analysis is not zzso It is emphasized that it is the zzso zzso zzso trajectory that matters for these effects and not only the pulse zzso Some experimental results obtained on a phantom at zzso verify this zzso
