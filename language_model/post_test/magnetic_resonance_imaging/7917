zzso arm amputees usually are excellent foot zzso To explore the plasticity of the primary motor zzso in zzso amputees and to determine if the acquisition of special foot movement skill is related with the bilateral hand zzso we studied the primary motor zzso by using combined task and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We investigated 6 bilateral arm amputees with or without special foot movement zzso In the task zzso study, we found that toe tapping of all the amputees activated the bilateral hand area, including cases without special foot zzso In addition, cases without special foot skill mainly activated the zzso zzso which differed from those with more adept foot motor skill who activated both the zzso and zzso zzso To further understand the plasticity of the hand area, the resting state functional connectivity was investigated between the foot and hand zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the connections between two areas became significantly stronger in the zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that hand region of the zzso does not remain zzso after bilateral arm zzso but rather is recruited by other zzso such as adjacent or nonadjacent zzso to process motor information in a functionally relevant zzso From the data zzso it seems that the bilateral arm amputees have a strong potential to develop new skills in their remaining zzso and practice may further enhance this zzso
