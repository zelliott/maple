We report first results of a zzso zzso study on the zzso mechanisms underlying auditory sequential zzso with the focus on the impact of visual sequences on zzso ambiguous tone sequences which can either be perceived as two separate zzso or one alternating zzso We combined two zzso experiments performed on humans and monkeys with two human brain imaging experiments which allow to obtain complementary information on brain zzso with high spatial zzso and high zzso zzso zzso The same acoustic paradigm based on the pairing of tone sequences with visual stimuli was used in all human studies and, in an adapted version, in the zzso study on zzso Our zzso approach provides experimental evidence that the pairing of auditory and visual stimuli can reliably introduce a bias towards either an integrated or a zzso perception of ambiguous zzso Thus, comparable to an explicit zzso this approach can be used to control the zzso zzso organization of an ambiguous sound sequence without the need for the subject to directly report zzso This finding is of particular importance for animal studies because it allows to compare zzso responses of auditory zzso zzso to the same acoustic stimulus sequence zzso either a zzso or integrated zzso
