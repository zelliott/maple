To evaluate the correlations between zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and pathological findings in soft tissue zzso 

zzso soft tissue zzso in 47 patients were zzso The correlations between the degree of zzso zzso pathological type and grade, and zzso signal intensity and/or enhancement pattern were zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the maximum standardized zzso value zzso 

Thirty-one zzso were zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The difference between zzso in the zzso and benign groups was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and well differentiated zzso showed low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed low zzso zzso while zzso zzso tumors showed high zzso zzso and the difference between zzso in the benign and zzso zzso was statistically significant zzso In a zzso zzso patient who had multiple zzso tumors, zzso could distinguish zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors from other benign zzso with similar zzso zzso 

zzso is useful for zzso zzso from benign soft tissue zzso but zzso soft tissue zzso may show various patterns on zzso and zzso may be helpful for a differential zzso
