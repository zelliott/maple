Currently available zzso techniques for measuring blood flow zzso are constrained by limited view zzso zzso zzso or limited time resolution zzso resonance imaging, zzso We describe an zzso technique for measuring flow zzso in real time at arbitrary zzso within a zzso volume or zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso 

The technique was implemented on a standard zzso clinical zzso zzso with no special hardware and was tested on zzso and human zzso The beam can be fired at rates up to 60 times per second, allowing zzso on a time scale that is appropriate for zzso cardiac zzso In zzso steady flow zzso were measured with the beam aligned along the direction of flow, and the measured zzso correlated well with the actual zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso in zzso under constant flow conditions was also zzso In humans, flow of blood in the descending zzso of normal and zzso zzso subjects was zzso zzso zzso of blood because of zzso zzso was readily zzso 

The zzso zzso technique is capable of acquiring clinically relevant real-time blood flow information from any desired angle of view with no zzso at bone or zzso zzso
