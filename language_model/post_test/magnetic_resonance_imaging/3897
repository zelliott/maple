The development of right zzso zzso zzso in zzso is accompanied by involvement of the left zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Our objective was to study the relation between RV zzso and zzso ejection fraction in zzso by means of zzso 

Ten zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso capacity zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso control subjects were zzso zzso criteria were any history of systemic hypertension, zzso or zzso heart disease, or episodes of zzso and/or zzso cardiac zzso 

Rapid scout imaging was used to measure RV and zzso wall mass, wall zzso and zzso zzso Stroke volume was derived from the main pulmonary artery zzso RV wall volume, RV wall zzso and the ratio of RV to zzso wall thickness were significantly larger in the patient group than in the control group zzso Furthermore, patients had significantly lower values of zzso ejection fraction zzso than the control zzso A zzso or zzso displacement of the zzso zzso during zzso was zzso In addition, our study showed an increase of zzso ejection fraction zzso with the RV wall thickness zzso zzso in severely zzso zzso 

These data are in support of the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso zzso explains the relatively normal zzso ejection fraction in zzso patients with severe RV zzso
