This study used zzso zzso zzso to investigate brain structural zzso related to trait zzso and its relationship with post-traumatic stress disorder zzso 

zzso subjects either developing (N zzso zzso or zzso (N zzso 17) zzso underwent zzso scanning and were assessed with the zzso Experience zzso zzso zzso for pathological zzso and zzso trait zzso zzso and other clinical zzso Gray matter volume zzso was analyzed using zzso as implemented in zzso zzso and zzso subjects were compared to assess brain zzso related to zzso pathology, whereas correlation analyses between zzso measures and zzso were performed on the whole sample (N zzso zzso irrespective of zzso diagnosis, to identify zzso related to trait zzso 

As compared to traumatized controls, zzso subjects showed reduced zzso in the prefrontal cortex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso measures zzso zzso and zzso consistently showed increased zzso in the zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso seem to be associated with opposite zzso patterns in the prefrontal zzso zzso zzso appears to involve increased zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with negligible differences between pathological and zzso zzso
