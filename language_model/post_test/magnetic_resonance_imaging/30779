We report a case of zzso zzso cavernous zzso which was initially found at a zzso age of 34 weeks in zzso as a mass zzso associated with zzso After birth, the patient was treated for zzso first by external drainage and then by zzso zzso zzso The natural course of the mass zzso was observed until the age of 8 months when the zzso diagnosis confirmed the cavernous zzso after tissue was obtained by zzso CT scans repeated monthly during this period demonstrated that the zzso continuously decreased in zzso There was no evidence of zzso in the zzso on serial CT zzso The zzso revealed zzso of cavernous vessels with zzso changes in the zzso 

The mechanisms of the decreasing size of the cavernous zzso have often been discussed in relation to spontaneous zzso and zzso The present case suggests a mechanism in which the spontaneous formation of a zzso might be the dominant factor for the decrease in zzso zzso formation may result from low zzso due to the large size of the zzso
