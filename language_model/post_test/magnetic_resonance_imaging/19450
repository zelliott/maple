The anterior zzso zzso zzso has been pointed out to play an important role in the cognitive process of selection underlying zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso of zzso relevant zzso However, it is still unclear in cognitive process of selection that the zzso can be activated by zzso stimuli as zzso relevant zzso To determine whether the zzso is activated by zzso zzso of zzso stimuli surely without effects of motor acts as behavior, zzso normal subjects performed elaborately designed tasks of selection while receiving zzso stimuli on their toes of the right and left feet under three different conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to be zzso zzso zzso zzso in selection and finger movement as motor acts, and zzso in selection and counting (without motor zzso whereas there was no zzso in zzso The present zzso study demonstrates that the zzso is activated by zzso zzso following zzso stimuli surely without subsequent motor zzso
