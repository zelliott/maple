Our goal was to compare the sensitivity of CT and three MR sequences in detecting and zzso early zzso zzso zzso transformation zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive patients with zzso zzso stroke zzso zzso without MR signs of cerebral bleeding at admission were zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso A standardized follow-up zzso performed 48 hours after admission, combined brain CT scan and MR examination zzso zzso including fast zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso echo zzso zzso zzso Both CT scans and MR images were obtained within as short a time span as possible between techniques zzso zzso 64 zzso CT scans and MR images were independently rated as negative or positive for bleeding and zzso for bleeding severity (five zzso by two blinded zzso zzso of positive cases, zzso and zzso agreement, and shifts in bleeding categorization between respective zzso and sequences were zzso 

Twelve patients zzso were rated positive for zzso on the basis of findings of at least one technique or zzso From this subset of bleeding patients, seven zzso had positive CT findings, nine zzso had positive zzso and zzso zzso findings, and 12 zzso had positive zzso zzso zzso CT had lower zzso and zzso agreement for zzso than did MR zzso Among the seven patients with positive CT and MR findings, only two had zzso ratings for bleeding category based on findings of two zzso The five remaining had upward grading from CT to zzso which varied according to pulse zzso 

MR imaging depicted more zzso and had higher zzso and zzso agreement than did zzso The zzso zzso sequence demonstrated highest zzso zzso upward shifts in bleeding categorization were observed from CT to MR imaging and between MR zzso
