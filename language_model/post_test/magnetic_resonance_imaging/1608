To establish guidelines for normal zzso and pelvic zzso zzso size at magnetic resonance imaging zzso by correlation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Twelve patients previously studied with zzso and zzso CT to determine normal pelvic zzso zzso size zzso 1 ] were examined with zzso All were on surveillance for stage I zzso zzso zzso follow-up 10 zzso Three observers recorded blind the site, size and number of zzso in the zzso and pelvis at 11 zzso The results were validated with previous CT zzso 

Eight hundred and zzso zzso in 12 patients were visible on the zzso initially, and a further 44 zzso were identified after comparison with zzso zzso More zzso were seen on zzso than on zzso The 95th zzso values for maximum short axis diameter zzso of pelvic zzso zzso were common zzso and zzso 4 zzso external and internal zzso 5 zzso and zzso 6 zzso In the zzso the 95th zzso zzso values were zzso high left zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso 4 zzso and low left zzso 5 zzso 

zzso criteria for normal zzso and pelvic zzso zzso size are zzso zzso of these recommendations may improve the sensitivity of zzso for the detection of zzso zzso
