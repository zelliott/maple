We previously used exploratory analyses across the entire zzso to determine that mild zzso disease zzso is reliably associated with a cortical signature of thinning in specific zzso and association zzso Here we investigated whether the cortical signature of zzso thinning is present in individuals with questionable zzso zzso zzso and whether a greater degree of regional cortical thinning predicts mild zzso zzso 

Participants included 49 older adults with mild impairment consistent with mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the time of structural zzso zzso zzso thickness was measured in nine regions of interest zzso identified previously from a comparison of patients with mild zzso and zzso 

zzso clinical follow-up revealed that 20 participants converted to mild zzso zzso zzso while 29 remained stable zzso approximately zzso years after zzso At zzso zzso participants showed a milder degree of cortical thinning than typically seen in mild zzso and zzso zzso correlated with thickness in zzso and zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the thickness of an zzso measure of these regions predicted progression to mild zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso in specific cortical areas known to be affected by zzso disease zzso is zzso in individuals with questionable zzso zzso zzso and predicts conversion to mild zzso zzso This method could be useful for identifying individuals at relatively high risk for imminent progression from zzso to mild zzso zzso which may be of value in clinical zzso
