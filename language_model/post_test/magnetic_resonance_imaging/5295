zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has emerged as a promising zzso zzso to characterize zzso vessel wall changes on a zzso and molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso has recently been recognized to play an important role in the progression of zzso This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of zzso and zzso zzso detection using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, zzso in a mouse model of zzso 

Male zzso mice zzso were fed a high fat diet zzso for one to three zzso zzso of the zzso artery was performed prior to and 90 zzso after the administration of zzso zzso per zzso zzso to noise ratios zzso and zzso relaxation rates zzso of plaques were determined and compared to ex zzso zzso density zzso on zzso sections stained with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso measured by zzso coupled mass zzso zzso 

zzso zzso after zzso administration demonstrated a significant increase zzso in contrast agent zzso in zzso artery zzso In zzso zzso zzso were in good agreement with ex zzso zzso density zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Late stage zzso plaques displayed the strongest increase in zzso zzso ex zzso zzso zzso and zzso concentration zzso 

This study demonstrated the feasibility of zzso and zzso zzso imaging using zzso zzso in zzso zzso detection and zzso could be useful for characterization and staging of coronary and carotid zzso zzso which may aid diagnosis and zzso
