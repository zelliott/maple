The relationships between cerebral zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso were investigated mainly in patients with carotid zzso We aimed to study the relationship in zzso elderly subjects without large artery zzso zzso 

A total of 33 elderly individuals zzso age was zzso zzso who were free from neurological deficit or cognitive impairment were zzso zzso mean blood flow zzso was measured in the middle cerebral artery using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system together with intravenous administration of zzso as zzso zzso zzso on a zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence of zzso were classified into two zzso zzso deep white matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso in each category were then divided into three grades zzso zzso grade II, grade zzso according to the zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso associated with the extent of zzso and zzso The differences in zzso were statistically significant among different severity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso in grade zzso zzso zzso in grade II, and zzso zzso in grade III, P zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in grade zzso zzso zzso in grade II, and zzso zzso in grade III, P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is related to the extent of zzso in zzso elderly individuals without large artery zzso The findings in our study suggest that dysfunction of cerebral vascular zzso might be an important factor in the development of zzso in the zzso elderly without large artery zzso zzso
