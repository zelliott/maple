zzso autopsy provides additional diagnostic information in a significant proportion of cases but parents and relatives frequently decline traditional zzso zzso examination, partly due to the zzso of the zzso effects of large incisions and concerns regarding organ zzso We present a novel minimally invasive autopsy method for fetal and zzso zzso which includes PM magnetic resonance imaging zzso for assessment of anatomy and zzso internal examination to allow direct organ zzso and targeted tissue zzso 

zzso retrospective feasibility report of the first 10 zzso cases undergoing zzso minimally invasive zzso 

A minimally invasive autopsy zzso approach based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso autopsy with tissue biopsy is feasible and effective with minimal zzso consequences compared to traditional PM zzso zzso examination with tissue biopsy provided additional diagnostic information to PM zzso alone in the majority of zzso 

zzso zzso is a feasible and potentially more acceptable approach to zzso autopsy and provides an additional option for parents who do not agree to a traditional PM zzso This approach could result in increased zzso of investigations after death in this group of zzso
