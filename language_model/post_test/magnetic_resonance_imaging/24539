The purpose of the study was to determine significant imaging features to differentiate between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and eight zzso were zzso We evaluated the difference in imaging findings and apparent diffusion zzso zzso between the two zzso We compared zzso image zzso and zzso phase zzso in terms of the clarity of the zzso outer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed zzso margin, while focal zzso showed either straight zzso or irregular margins zzso zzso All zzso zzso had intact or bulging zzso and all focal zzso showed zzso zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso and two focal zzso showed zzso enhancement zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso Satellite zzso were noted in 10 zzso zzso In terms of outer margin clarity, zzso zzso showed a more distinct margin on zzso than on zzso zzso while these two sequences were not significantly different in focal zzso zzso 

zzso improved the imaging characteristics of zzso zzso allowing it to be distinguished from focal zzso zzso zzso showed lower zzso values than focal zzso zzso zzso zzso bulging, enhancement pattern, associated satellite zzso and portal vein zzso were still found to be highly suggestive MR findings for zzso zzso
