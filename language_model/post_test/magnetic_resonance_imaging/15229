zzso cortical zzso zzso regulates various executive cognitive functions, including attention and working zzso Efforts to enhance zzso zzso which have focused on zzso stimulant drugs, have been zzso Recently, the demonstration that a functional zzso in the zzso zzso gene impacts prefrontal zzso raises the possibility of a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of prefrontal lobe executive zzso To explore in a proof of concept study the effects of zzso a zzso zzso specific zzso zzso we performed a randomized, double blind, zzso controlled, and crossover design of this drug in normal subjects zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined in peripheral zzso zzso normal volunteers with no family history of psychiatric disorders underwent zzso testing and 34 of those subjects underwent zzso measurement of prefrontal information processing assessed by blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We found significant drug effects on measures of executive function and verbal episodic memory and a significant drug by zzso interaction on the latter, such that individuals with zzso zzso improved, whereas individuals with zzso zzso worsened on zzso zzso revealed a significant zzso improvement in the efficiency of information processing in prefrontal zzso during a working memory zzso This study demonstrates enhancement of prefrontal cortical function in normal human subjects with a zzso drug having zzso zzso zzso Our results are consistent with data from animal studies and from zzso models of the effects of selective enhancement of zzso signaling in the prefrontal zzso
