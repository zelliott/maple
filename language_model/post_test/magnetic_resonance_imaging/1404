The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of zzso of the zzso head was compared with that of other diagnostic methods in current zzso plain zzso bone-marrow pressure zzso zzso zzso and zzso examination of zzso bone zzso In the first phase of the study, zzso patients zzso zzso who were at high risk for avascular necrosis were zzso zzso patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with those seen in zzso were found in all hips that were suspected of having zzso zzso or 3 changes on the basis of zzso evidence of the zzso zzso patterns on magnetic resonance imaging that were characteristic of avascular necrosis were also observed in 17 per cent of the hips that were suspected of having zzso zzso changes and in 64 per cent of those that showed zzso changes, all with no zzso zzso In the second phase of the study, zzso of the zzso hips that were suspected of having zzso necrosis of the zzso head but showed slight or no zzso changes were studied by repeat zzso zzso functional evaluations of bone, core zzso of the zzso head, and magnetic resonance zzso Of the zzso hips, zzso (78 per zzso had positive changes on magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso per zzso had positive zzso evidence of zzso and zzso zzso per zzso had positive findings by bone-marrow pressure studies and zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso results were observed with magnetic resonance imaging, the zzso results of this study suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for the early diagnosis of avascular zzso
