Animal studies indicate that zzso pathways in the zzso zzso code for the motivational zzso of both rewarding and aversive zzso but evidence for this mechanism in humans is less zzso We have developed a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso model which permits examination of the neural processing of both rewarding and aversive zzso 

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the neural processing of rewarding and aversive stimuli in healthy zzso 

We studied 30 healthy participants who were randomly allocated to receive a single dose of zzso zzso or zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We used zzso to measure the neural response to rewarding zzso or sight of zzso and aversive stimuli zzso of zzso strawberries or unpleasant zzso taste) zzso after drug zzso 

Relative to zzso zzso reduced blood zzso zzso responses to chocolate stimuli in the zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso also reduced lateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the taste and sight of the aversive zzso 

These results suggest that acute zzso zzso blockade zzso zzso and zzso neural zzso in response to both rewarding and aversive stimuli in healthy zzso This effect may be relevant to the effects of zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of psychosis and may also have implications for the possible zzso properties of zzso
