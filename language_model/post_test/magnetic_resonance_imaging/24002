A method for collecting zzso data on a set of rotated zzso that begin at the center of zzso is zzso It is theoretically slightly faster, slightly less susceptible to zzso and zzso phase, and produces images with slightly better zzso ratio than methods using zzso spiral zzso particularly for a short sampling zzso It also produces more accurate images than those of projection reconstruction methods, which are significantly zzso zzso This method may be most useful when imaging areas with large zzso zzso near metallic zzso short zzso species, or high turbulence zzso gas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
