Naming an object zzso a number of processing zzso including retrieval of a target zzso concept and zzso of its zzso word zzso We investigated these stages using the zzso interference task in an zzso zzso Participants named target pictures in the presence of zzso presented zzso zzso zzso zzso or unrelated zzso words or in zzso We observed zzso signal changes in zzso regions associated with zzso and zzso processing, including the zzso lateral zzso zzso However, these zzso responses zzso as signal reductions for all zzso conditions relative to naming zzso Compared with unrelated words, zzso related zzso showed further signal zzso whereas only the zzso zzso of the left inferior frontal zzso showed a selective reduction in response in the semantic zzso We interpret these findings as indicating that the word forms of zzso competitors are zzso zzso and that competition during zzso selection is reduced by zzso related zzso Since the extended nature of auditory presentation requires a large portion of a word to be presented before its meaning is zzso we attribute the zzso signal reductions observed for zzso related and unrelated words to lateral zzso mechanisms engaged after target name selection has occurred, as has been proposed in some production zzso
