In neurodegenerative disorders, neural damage can trigger zzso mechanisms that minimize zzso zzso Here, we aimed at characterizing cerebral compensation during motor imagery in Parkinson's disease zzso while controlling for altered motor execution and sensory zzso We used a zzso design to compare the most and least affected hand in 19 right-handed zzso patients with markedly zzso zzso We used a motor imagery zzso task in which the patients were required to judge the zzso of hand images, rotated either in a lateral or in a zzso orientation with respect to the body zzso zzso This design allowed us to compare cerebral activity zzso zzso evoked by zzso of each hand zzso while zzso monitoring task zzso zzso times and zzso activity increased in a similar manner as a function of stimulus rotation during motor imagery of left and right zzso However, patients were markedly slower when judging images of the affected hand in lateral zzso and there was a corresponding increase in activity in the right zzso body area zzso and zzso zzso during mental rotation of the affected zzso Furthermore, these regions increased their connectivity towards the left zzso for right zzso hands in a lateral zzso We zzso that, in strongly zzso zzso patients, motor imagery of the zzso hand exploits additional resources in zzso visual zzso These findings characterize the cerebral bases of the increased dependence on visual information processing during the generation of motor plans in zzso pointing to its zzso zzso
