Animal models of brain zzso are essential to reveal the full aspects of cerebrovascular zzso The perfect animal model that reflects every aspect of stroke zzso does not exist, hence there is a need for a proper selection of the animal model in order to interpret properly the results from experimental zzso 

To characterize and compare the zzso evolution of three common models of focal brain zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Thirty zzso rats were distributed into three groups, each of them submitted to one of the following surgery zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each rat was subjected to an zzso study at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 zzso zzso weighted images were obtained in order to calculate both zzso volumes and zzso 

zzso volume and zzso were zzso for the zzso model zzso of mean 297 zzso zzso zzso and mean 17 zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso 62 zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso model, although yields in the highest mortality rate zzso it is the more suitable for long term studies, mainly because of the absence of zzso In the zzso model a non zzso zzso region is observed which leads to an abnormal zzso evolution as compared with the other two zzso
