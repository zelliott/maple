There are a number of zzso networks in the brain zzso zzso or zzso zzso motor zzso zzso that despite having a clear role in motor function have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso In this project we test for the involvement of these networks in a zzso judgment task that zzso visual zzso visual spatial processing and requires the ordering of zzso zzso zzso Unlike previous studies examining zzso sequencing, we directly compare both zzso and motor versions of our zzso judgment zzso In addition, we examine zzso uniquely associated with correct task zzso The findings provide evidence for the role of cortical not zzso structures in the sequencing of zzso material apart from any motor output zzso Our results suggest that the inferior zzso zzso zzso 7, 40) and zzso frontal regions zzso 6, 8, 9 including the zzso are instrumental to the zzso Based on these results, we propose a zzso network plays a role in the zzso of a zzso mechanism that makes accurate comparisons along the dimension of interest, holds the information in working memory, and then zzso of whether the information is correct or zzso generates a tag or abstract code that assigns the information a place in an ordered zzso Most important, the information involved can be zzso and zzso (not just zzso in zzso
