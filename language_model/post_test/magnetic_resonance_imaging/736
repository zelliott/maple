The objectives of this study were to register the brain locations in a consecutive series of zzso zzso zzso and compare these zzso with the locations of de zzso zzso zzso that were collected during the same period in an effort to analyze whether zzso are situated in preferential areas and to review the zzso hypothesis of such a zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with zzso and 102 patients with zzso who were followed zzso between 1996 and 2003 by the authors were zzso whatever their zzso Using zzso three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging, the location of each tumor was analyzed accurately according to a zzso system based on the proximity of eloquent areas previously reported by the zzso 

One hundred nine zzso zzso compared with 55 zzso zzso were situated within functional regions zzso zzso zzso More specifically, 36 zzso zzso compared with 11 zzso zzso were localized in the region of the supplementary motor area zzso zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso zzso compared with 11 zzso zzso were located within the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The current findings suggest that zzso are located zzso in zzso functional areas zzso near the so-called primary eloquent zzso especially within the zzso and the insular zzso This preferential zzso may be explained by zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso A better knowledge of the zzso mechanisms underlying preferential zzso locations may improve understanding of the genesis and natural history of these tumors and, zzso their zzso
