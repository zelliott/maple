zzso zzso zzso are generally considered useful for zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso such as zzso digital zzso zzso and zzso computerized zzso zzso are still insufficient because the resulting images fail to delineate neural zzso Complex zzso procedures are mostly performed in the zzso fluid zzso space of the zzso zzso where vessels and neural structures are present along with the zzso The magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso constructive interference in zzso zzso imaging displays the margin between the zzso and neural structures, vessels, and zzso mater in detail, in a two-dimensional zzso The authors know that zzso zzso zzso images would be more useful for surgery than conventional zzso Although the usefulness of zzso MR image zzso was reported zzso the zzso view is different from the operative field because of the perspective being zzso zzso to simulate surgical views, the authors made zzso zzso from a zzso zzso MR sequence by using an advanced computer zzso After generating volume images, a cutting method was used in the desired plane to zzso the zzso with reference to a zzso zzso zzso The authors call these zzso zzso zzso images, and they are more comparable to the operative zzso This newly developed method of producing a real zzso zzso image was used in 30 cases and contributed to the understanding of the relationship between a zzso and surrounding structures before attempting zzso procedures, with minimal zzso to the zzso
