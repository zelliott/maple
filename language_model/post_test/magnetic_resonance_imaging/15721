The complexity of cancer, where a single genetic zzso can have multiple functional effects, makes it a fascinating but zzso disease to study, and the necessity of investigating it in its entirety is more imperative than ever zzso Advances in zzso technology have made it possible to create cancer cells, or mice with specific genetic zzso and the application of an array of both functional and molecular zzso MR methods to these transgenic cancer cells and mice to characterize their zzso traits is zzso our understanding of zzso With the establishment of zzso molecular imaging centers within barrier or zzso facilities, zzso and zzso imaging of transgenic mouse models of human cancer are becoming increasingly zzso In this review, we outline some of the methods currently available for generating transgenic mice and cancer cell zzso We also present examples of the application of MR methods to transgenic models that are providing novel insights into the molecular and functional characteristics of cancer and are leading to an era of zzso zzso of the effects of specific molecular zzso in zzso
