zzso processing depends on zzso zzso and is modulated by factors affecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso We used zzso and a guessing task sensitive to zzso zzso in the prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso to study how individual variation in genes contributing to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation zzso zzso influences reward zzso zzso activity, evoked by anticipation of reward irrespective of reward probability and zzso was zzso zzso Volunteers zzso for the Met zzso associated with lower zzso activity and presumably greater zzso zzso showed larger responses compared with volunteers zzso for the Val zzso A similar zzso effect was observed in the zzso zzso As reported zzso the zzso zzso was also found to code zzso expected value, zzso the product of reward magnitude and gain zzso Individual differences in zzso zzso sensitivity for value were in part explained by an zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso Although most zzso combinations exhibited the expected activity increase with more likely and larger zzso two zzso combinations zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were associated with blunted zzso zzso zzso In view of a consistent relationship between reduced reward sensitivity and addiction, our findings point to a potential genetic basis for vulnerability to zzso
