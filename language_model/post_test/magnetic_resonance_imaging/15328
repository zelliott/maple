The status of imaging findings in the clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso remains zzso while they may be supportive of a diagnosis of zzso zzso they are not zzso Our aim was to assess patterns of zzso zzso in a large sample of clinically zzso zzso zzso patients using a magnetic resonance image zzso rating scale, to zzso determine whether imaging findings warrant a more prominent position in zzso diagnosis and zzso correlate the extent of zzso zzso with clinical zzso 

We adapted a recently devised post zzso rating scale for zzso to rate zzso zzso on zzso zzso The areas rated included the frontal zzso and both anterior and zzso zzso regions zzso All available brain scans from all patients seen in the Cambridge zzso Clinic zzso zzso zzso diagnosed as having zzso together with controls zzso zzso zzso were used to assess the reliability of the zzso A subset of these zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso zzso 

The scale proved quick and reliable zzso zzso k zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were abnormal in the majority of patients zzso with focal zzso present in zzso of semantic zzso zzso zzso By contrast, nearly half zzso of the patients with clinical zzso zzso zzso had scans within the normal zzso zzso cases with normal scans generally had fewer cognitive deficits and milder functional impairment than those with abnormal scans, yet displayed a clinically indistinguishable zzso zzso They were not, however, simply at an earlier stage of the zzso 

zzso findings should form part of the diagnostic criteria for zzso the absence of zzso on zzso in many zzso cases raises the prospect that the zzso syndrome of zzso is not specific for patients with a neurodegenerative zzso
