The aim of this study was to identify distinguishing characteristics of uncommon zzso of the zzso angle zzso and internal auditory canal zzso in order to attain the correct diagnosis and thus formulate an appropriate therapeutic zzso 

A retrospective chart analysis was performed on all patients with surgically managed zzso of the zzso and zzso referred to zzso from January 1985 to April zzso 

All patients were treated by New York University faculty at a zzso referral zzso 

Among zzso surgical cases identified, zzso patients zzso with acoustic zzso and 18 patients zzso with zzso were zzso The remaining 24 cases, involving 17 women and seven men with a median age of 34 years, were zzso 

Most patients underwent zzso evaluations, as well as magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and all patients underwent zzso surgery as part of their management zzso 

zzso patient zzso zzso imaging, and surgical findings often identified distinguishing characteristics of unusual zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso identified at the zzso and zzso zzso four zzso four zzso two facial zzso two zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso one zzso zzso one zzso one lymphoma, one cholesterol cyst, one zzso one zzso zzso one cavernous zzso and one zzso zzso 

zzso tumor differentiation based on the patient history, physical examination, zzso testing, CT, and zzso help the surgeon to formulate an appropriate treatment zzso
