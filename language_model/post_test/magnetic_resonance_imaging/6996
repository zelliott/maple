Making predictions about future rewards is an important ability for zzso and its zzso mechanisms have been studied zzso One important approach is to identify neural systems that process errors related to reward prediction zzso areas that register the occurrence of zzso rewards and the failure of expected zzso In monkeys that have learned to predict zzso rewards during zzso behaviors, zzso zzso reliably signal both types of prediction zzso The mechanisms in the human brain involved in processing prediction error for monetary rewards are not well zzso Furthermore, nothing is known of how such systems operate when rewards are not contingent on zzso We used zzso zzso to zzso responses to both classes of prediction zzso zzso were able to predict a monetary reward or a zzso on the basis of a prior visual zzso On occasional trials, zzso zzso were reversed zzso rewards and failure of expected zzso zzso were not required to make decisions or zzso We compared each type of prediction error trial with its corresponding control trial in which the same prediction did not zzso Each type of prediction error evoked activity in a distinct zzso zzso Unexpected reward failure evoked activity in the zzso zzso and frontal pole zzso zzso zzso rewards evoked activity in the zzso cortex, the frontal pole, zzso cortex, and zzso zzso zzso to prediction errors in zzso circuits suggests that they are involved in zzso the associations between visual cues and monetary rewards in the human zzso
