Recent studies reported contrasting results with respect to the presence of zzso protein zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso and their relation with disease zzso This may be due to the zzso specificity of zzso in zzso and the inability of most methods to detect zzso relevant zzso Here, zzso particles were used to detect zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso their relation with zzso parameters was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined in the zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinically isolated syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso using a novel flow zzso based zzso In addition, the zzso of patients with other neurological diseases zzso zzso zzso 17), inflammatory neurological diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

Compared with controls, increased zzso zzso zzso zzso was most frequently found in the zzso of patients with zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso zzso zzso together zzso zzso of all positive zzso zzso In contrast, elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in a minority of zzso patients zzso marginally present in controls zzso and absent in zzso patients zzso Most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was related to the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso on brain zzso in zzso and zzso onset zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso are promising specific zzso in zzso and zzso onset zzso and correlate with MR measures of disease zzso
