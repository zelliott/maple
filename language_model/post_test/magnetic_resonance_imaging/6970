We present a threads and zzso representation for interactive volume rendering of zzso structure and describe a number of additional components that combine to create effective zzso of zzso zzso scientific zzso After filtering linear structures, such as flow lines, into a volume zzso we use a zzso volume rendering approach to simultaneously display this derived volume along with other data zzso We demonstrate the utility of threads and zzso in clarifying depth relationships within dense renderings and we present results from two scientific zzso zzso of zzso zzso valued magnetic resonance imaging zzso data and simulated zzso fluid flow zzso In both application areas, the zzso of the zzso proved to be important to the domain zzso Finally, we describe a zzso zzso of our framework along with domain specific transfer functions, including an exploratory data zzso zzso that enable fast data zzso
