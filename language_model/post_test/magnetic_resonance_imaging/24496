zzso design and develop of targeted contrast agents binding to zzso proteins will achieve more accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis by magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso specifically homes to zzso complexes abundantly expressed in tumor zzso In this study, we developed and evaluated a zzso zzso targeted zzso zzso probe zzso for MR imaging of breast zzso zzso and zzso bearing zzso was attached to a zzso zzso scaffold via zzso and zzso click chemistry, zzso zzso has a zzso structure with a molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso at room temperature and 3 zzso Fluorescence imaging showed high binding specificity of zzso to a zzso breast tumor model in mice while it was not found for the scrambled zzso zzso The zzso zzso contrast agent resulted in greater contrast enhancement than the corresponding zzso agent and the zzso contrast agent zzso in tumor at a dose of zzso zzso zzso in female zzso mice bearing zzso breast zzso zzso This small molecular contrast agent was easily zzso from body after imaging indicated low zzso The targeted zzso contrast agent has a potential for specific cancer molecular imaging with zzso
