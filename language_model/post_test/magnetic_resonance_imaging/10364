The aim of the study was to evaluate zzso the technical feasibility and discomfort of two different injection techniques for MR zzso of the zzso zzso consecutive patients undergoing MR zzso of the hip zzso zzso were randomly injected either at the zzso head zzso zzso or the zzso neck (32 zzso The patients rated discomfort during and zzso h after zzso using a visual analogue scale zzso zzso not feel zzso zzso The volume injected, the distance between the needle tract and the zzso zzso the duration of the procedure and the zzso contrast leakage were zzso No significant differences were found for the volume injected, the distance between the needle tract and the zzso zzso or the procedure zzso Volume of zzso contrast leakage was statistically significantly different zzso zzso zzso neck zzso zzso zzso The zzso score for needle advancement was significantly different zzso zzso neck zzso zzso No significant differences were found for the zzso score regarding delayed zzso Before the examination the zzso discomfort was overestimated by zzso zzso correctly anticipated by zzso zzso and underestimated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso discomfort was overestimated by zzso zzso correctly anticipated by 57% zzso and underestimated by zzso zzso of the zzso Both hip puncture techniques were well zzso The neck injection technique produced less discomfort and was associated with greater zzso contrast zzso
