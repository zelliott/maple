zzso zzso treatment of the zzso zzso nerve is used to relieve the pain of zzso zzso The mechanism of the zzso effect is not zzso 

Two adult zzso underwent zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso using a gamma zzso A single zzso zzso was targeted to each zzso zzso zzso just anterior to the zzso to deliver a zzso dose of 80 or 100 zzso zzso of four zzso A zzso zzso brain and nerves served as control zzso Six months after treatment, magnetic resonance imaging was again performed and the brains and nerves were studied using light and electron zzso 

zzso resonance imaging indicated a zzso area of contrast enhancement at the target site in each zzso All zzso nerves exhibited zzso zzso and mild zzso at the target, with remnants of some zzso zzso Large and small zzso and zzso fibers were zzso No inflammation was zzso Nerve necrosis was identified after zzso zzso The zzso zzso appeared zzso 

zzso at 80 zzso causes focal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso At higher doses, partial nerve necrosis is zzso We think that these effects influence the zzso features of zzso zzso
