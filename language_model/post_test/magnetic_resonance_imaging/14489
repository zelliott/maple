The resting state zzso of zzso fluctuations zzso in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is believed to reflect spontaneous cerebral neural zzso The zzso of zzso zzso which is characterized by motor symptoms and also sensory symptoms, remains zzso The present study aims to zzso possible cerebral functional abnormalities in zzso patients using resting state zzso and explore their possible associations with clinical zzso zzso analysis was used to characterize the difference of zzso between zzso zzso patients and zzso matched healthy zzso Separate correlation analyses were conducted to explore the possible association between zzso values of significantly different areas and clinical measures including onset age, disease zzso symptom severity evaluated by zzso rating scale zzso and presence of zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicated that the zzso group had significantly decreased zzso in the left zzso while increased zzso in the left zzso areas extending from middle frontal zzso to inferior frontal zzso The mean zzso in the left zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso total score zzso zzso A borderline positive correlation was detected between the mean zzso in the left zzso area and disease zzso zzso Our findings suggest zzso integration is abnormal in zzso and dysfunctional activity of zzso may be used to measuring symptom severity in zzso zzso
