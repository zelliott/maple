To evaluate the anomalous zzso of the zzso minor zzso with absence of the zzso ligament on MR zzso and to demonstrate the associated findings seen with this anatomical zzso 

We zzso reviewed the 335 MR zzso of the shoulder joint zzso age zzso zzso performed from March 2000 to February zzso Images were evaluated with attention to anomalous zzso of the zzso minor zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso minor zzso was demonstrated in 5 out of 335 shoulders zzso The zzso minor zzso crossed over the zzso process and attached directly to a zzso joint zzso and the zzso ligament was absent in these 5 zzso In these patients, injected contrast material was noted to extend over the zzso process along the course of the zzso minor zzso Among 5 patients, 3 patients zzso were diagnosed with SLAP zzso zzso anterior to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso minor zzso to the zzso joint capsule and associated absence of the zzso ligament is well demonstrated on MR zzso It is an unusual zzso of the zzso minor muscle zzso and may be a possible contributing factor in the development of a SLAP zzso
