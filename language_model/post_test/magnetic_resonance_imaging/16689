The human motor system continuously adapts to changes in the environment by comparing differences between the zzso predicted outcome of a certain behavior and the observed zzso This zzso signal triggers a zzso error and it is assumed that the zzso is a key structure in updating this error and associated zzso zzso Using zzso the aim of the present study was to determine the main zzso structures that are involved in the processing of zzso errors and in updating zzso commands when simply catching a falling ball without displacement of the zzso zzso only zzso the ball with their fingers when receiving it in their zzso By contrasting functional imaging signal obtained in conditions in which it was possible and impossible to predict the weight of the ball, we aimed to highlight zzso error processing which we expected to be more marked in the conditions without prediction (less accurate zzso process or more important feedback zzso with respect to conditions with prediction (more accurate zzso process or less important feedback zzso When catching a falling ball and the possibility of prediction about the ball weight was manipulated, our results showed that both the right and left zzso is engaged in processing zzso zzso It may also be involved in updating zzso motor commands, perhaps on a trial by trial zzso In addition, when subjects were blindfolded, we observed a similar network but centered in a more anterior portion of the right zzso and we noted the presence of a zzso network that may be involved in cognitive prediction (rather than sensory zzso about ball zzso
