To analyze the zzso management for neurosurgery using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso tumor received zzso for zzso safety screening and the operation was performed with general zzso and support by zzso zzso The operative time, frequency and duration of zzso zzso time (from the preparation for zzso to the beginning of the zzso time delay by zzso body temperature at the initial zzso and special issues related to the scanning and zzso zzso were zzso 

Thirty patients successfully completed the operations without any incidents related to zzso or zzso The mean frequency of zzso was zzso the mean duration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso time was zzso zzso zzso zzso the time delay zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the body temperature was significantly higher at 2 h after zzso than that after zzso 

In the zzso management for neurosurgery with zzso the zzso should focus on the safety precaution and zzso zzso according to the special environment and procedure of zzso
