To investigate individual changes in fetal lung volume zzso in fetuses with isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso and to calculate weekly growth rates of the zzso using serial MR examinations during zzso 

zzso was measured in 89 fetuses with zzso All fetuses received two zzso A mean weekly growth rate of the zzso was determined for each fetus and compared with the growth rate of healthy zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso zzso measured at the first zzso was zzso and zzso at the second zzso In zzso of all fetuses zzso the zzso zzso decreased during pregnancy, zzso zzso showed an increase in the zzso zzso and 13 % zzso had stable zzso First and last zzso zzso values were significantly associated with mortality and zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso requirement with a higher zzso accuracy of zzso zzso near zzso Patients with zzso had lower weekly lung growth rates than healthy zzso There was a significant difference in the mean weekly growth rate between survivors and zzso and patients with and without zzso zzso 

Individual development of zzso in patients with zzso during pregnancy is extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso before deciding upon zzso and zzso therapeutic zzso 

zzso Lung development in zzso zzso zzso zzso during pregnancy is extremely zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that lung growth rate is reduced in fetuses with zzso zzso The final zzso fetal lung volume provides the best zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso before deciding upon therapeutic zzso
