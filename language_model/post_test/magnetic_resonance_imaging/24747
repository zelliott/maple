zzso of infant brain development is a critically important goal given the enduring impact of these early processes on various zzso including later zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso growth rates have long been available, regional growth rates have not been reported zzso zzso relatively less is known about the dynamics and organization of typically developing infant zzso Here we report global and regional zzso growth of zzso zzso and zzso with gender zzso in 33 zzso scans, over 3 to 13 months, using zzso zzso zzso zzso echo images and detailed zzso brain zzso Except for the zzso and lateral zzso all absolute volumes of brain regions showed significant growth, with 6 different patterns of zzso zzso When zzso to the whole brain, the regional increase was characterized by 5 differential zzso The zzso zzso zzso and total zzso were the only regions that showed positive growth in the zzso zzso Our results show zzso patterns of zzso change and contribute to the systematic understanding of infant brain zzso This study greatly expands our knowledge of normal development and in future may provide a basis for identifying early zzso above and beyond zzso variation that might signal higher risk for neurological zzso
