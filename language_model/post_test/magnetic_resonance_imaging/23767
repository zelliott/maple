The complex three-dimensional zzso features of the brain and its vulnerability to surgical intervention make the surgical treatment of zzso tumors zzso We evaluated the surgical treatment of zzso tumors using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso which provides real-time guidance, allows zzso of zzso tumors and their margins, and zzso continuous assessment of surgical zzso 

Sixty patients underwent zzso for tumor treatment in the General Electric zzso zzso unit at the Brigham and Women's Hospital zzso zzso during a zzso zzso The patients selected were those with zzso tumors that were considered difficult to zzso because of their locations or previous incomplete zzso zzso zzso and 19 high-grade zzso 8 zzso zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso were zzso 

zzso were accurately localized and targeted, and the extent of zzso as well as any zzso zzso could be immediately assessed during zzso zzso brain shifting occurred during the procedures, and repeated zzso imaging allowed surgical accommodation for this zzso In more than one-third of the cases, zzso imaging showed residual tumor when zzso appeared complete on the basis of surgical observation zzso 

zzso zzso is a revolutionary tool for the surgical treatment of brain tumors, providing observation of the procedure as it is being zzso With zzso zzso tumor zzso is safer, the extent of zzso can be directly zzso and zzso complications can be noted if they zzso Outcomes after zzso depend on minimizing injury to normal brain tissue and achieving zzso tumor zzso The use of zzso zzso directly affects these zzso
