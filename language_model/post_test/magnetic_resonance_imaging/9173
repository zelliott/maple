Automatic extraction of vertebra regions from a spinal magnetic resonance zzso image is normally required as the first step to an intelligent spinal MR image diagnosis zzso In this work, we develop a fully automatic vertebra detection and zzso system, which consists of three zzso zzso zzso vertebra zzso detection refinement via robust curve fitting, and vertebra zzso by an zzso zzso cut zzso In order to produce an efficient and effective vertebra zzso a statistical learning approach based on an improved zzso zzso is zzso A robust zzso procedure is applied on the detected vertebra locations to fit a spine curve, thus refining the above vertebra detection zzso This refinement process involves removing the false zzso and recovering the zzso zzso Finally, an zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to segment the precise vertebra regions from the detected vertebra zzso In our zzso the proposed zzso detector is trained from 22 spinal MR volume zzso The experimental results show that the proposed vertebra detection and zzso system can achieve nearly zzso vertebra detection rate and zzso zzso accuracy on a variety of testing spinal MR zzso Our experiments also show the vertebra detection and zzso zzso by using the proposed zzso are superior to those of the previous representative zzso The proposed vertebra detection and zzso system is proved to be robust and accurate so that it can be used for advanced research and application on spinal MR zzso
