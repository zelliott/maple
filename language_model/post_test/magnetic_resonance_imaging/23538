During the past two decades, stem cells have created enthusiasm as a zzso therapy for zzso heart zzso zzso of bone zzso stem cells, skeletal zzso and zzso zzso cells has shown to improve zzso function after zzso Recently, attention has focused on the potential use of embryonic stem cells and induced zzso stem cells because they possess the capacity to differentiate into various cell types, including cardiac and zzso zzso Clinical trials have shown positive effects on the functional recovery of heart after zzso zzso and have answered questions on timing, zzso and cell delivery route of stem cells such as those derived from bone zzso Despite the current advances in stem cell research, one main hurdle remains the lack of reliable information about the fate of cell zzso survival, and proliferation after zzso This review discusses the different cell types used in cardiac cell therapy as well as molecular imaging zzso relevant to survival zzso
