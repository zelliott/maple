To investigate the diagnostic and clinical value of zzso reconstruction zzso with spiral zzso zzso for zzso nerve injury during zzso zzso 

From April 2007 to April 2009, 10 patients with zzso nerve injury during zzso fracture admitted to the zzso zzso Hospital of China Medical University were included in this study; of these, seven were men and three were women, aged around 30 years to 55 zzso Hospital admission time from injury was around 1 day to 30 days for these zzso zzso of injury included six cases of car crashes, three cases of fallen heavy objects, and one case of crush zzso To evaluate fracture status of the zzso zzso and relative position of fractured bone to the root of zzso entire zzso of zzso nerve was observed by zzso technique at zzso position zzso zzso coronary position and zzso zzso zzso zzso under which the fracture condition of zzso zzso could be clearly displayed for further clinical zzso 

According to the 1990 standard zzso for spinal injury by the National Spinal zzso zzso Association and the International Spinal zzso Society, with consideration of the clinical manifestations, clinical diagnosis of all patients were as zzso six cases of injury to zzso zzso two cases of injury to zzso zzso two cases of injury to both zzso and zzso roots, three cases of penetration of zzso zzso by fractured bone after zzso at zzso position, one case of injury to zzso zzso and two cases of penetration of both zzso and zzso zzso by fractured zzso Diagnosis of last six patients was confirmed by surgery zzso zzso of zzso and zzso nerves by fractured zzso In addition, after removal of zzso causes, symptoms of the patients were significantly improved, and patients completely recovered in an average of 12 zzso After the zzso examination at zzso position, the remaining four patients (3 cases of injury to zzso and 1 case of injury to zzso did not show penetration of fractured bones to zzso zzso considering the diagnosis of simple neural zzso These patients recovered well after an average of zzso conservative zzso 

zzso zzso at zzso position can be used as a routine examination for patient with zzso zzso which is of great significance in determining the cause of injury to zzso zzso Furthermore, it can also provide zzso zzso to analyze the need for surgical zzso
