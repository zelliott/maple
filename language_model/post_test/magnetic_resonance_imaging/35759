To determine the role of MR imaging in the assessment of pancreatic transplant zzso we zzso obtained 13 MR scans in nine transplant zzso The presence of rejection was verified zzso by pancreatic transplant zzso in five zzso In two additional patients, rejection was proved by zzso zzso transplant biopsy as well as by compatible clinical and laboratory zzso In the remaining two patients, in whom no biopsy was done, clinical and laboratory data showed no evidence of zzso The mean zzso of the seven zzso undergoing rejection was significantly elevated zzso zzso compared with the mean zzso of the two transplants not undergoing rejection zzso zzso zzso less than zzso These preliminary results suggest that MR may be useful in the zzso diagnosis of pancreatic zzso
