To evaluate the significance of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso value analysis in patients with iron overload and compare it with other clinical zzso 

A total of 53 patients with suspected iron overload were recruited from four Beijing hospitals from December 2010 to December zzso Their liver and heart zzso values were calculated and their serum zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso volume and other clinical parameters were recorded and zzso 

There were 37 males and 16 females with a medium age of 50 zzso zzso Their zzso included zzso syndromes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anemia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 patients with high zzso values were found on regular health zzso Among them, there were zzso history zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sign of iron overload zzso zzso 10), abnormal liver function zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value analysis showed that 10 patients had no evidence of iron overload, 43 patients had liver iron overload zzso mild, 22 moderate and 7 zzso and 2 patients had heart iron overload (1 zzso with heavy zzso history and 1 AA with heart zzso No relations existed between zzso value and zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso value and zzso volume zzso zzso zzso , and liver zzso value and heart zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso value is an accurate way of quantitative detection of iron zzso It provides a comprehensive understanding of patients with iron overload in zzso with zzso zzso value and other clinical zzso
