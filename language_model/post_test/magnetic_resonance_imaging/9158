zzso gene zzso are the most common cause of Leigh syndrome zzso a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder of zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso leading to death before the age of 4 zzso Most of the reported zzso create premature termination zzso whereas zzso zzso are zzso The aim of the study was to characterize the natural history of zzso patients carrying at least one zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso such patients (8 own cases and 11 reported in the zzso were compared with a reference group of 20 own zzso zzso patients, and with other zzso cases described in the zzso Disease onset in the studied group was zzso Acute failure to thrive and hyperventilation episodes were rare, respiratory failure did not appear before the age of 4 zzso zzso motor zzso and eye movement zzso developed zzso The number of patients who survived 7 years of life totaled 9 out of 15 zzso in the zzso zzso and 1 out of 26 zzso patients with zzso leading to truncated zzso 

zzso The presence of a zzso zzso in the zzso gene may correlate with a milder course and longer survival of Leigh patients, zzso normal magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings, normal blood zzso value, and only mild decrease of zzso c zzso zzso activity are not sufficient reasons to zzso zzso zzso analysis in differential zzso
