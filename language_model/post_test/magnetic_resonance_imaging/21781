zzso zzso zzso patients were studied for site, extent and severity of zzso Three patterns were observed each having distinct clinical, zzso and zzso features: 1) focal zzso zzso zzso zzso with long tract signs and good zzso 2) ascending zzso zzso from zzso to zzso with upper and lower motor zzso signs (not necessarily spinal zzso zzso and poor zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso scattered throughout the zzso with subtle signs in spinal zzso distribution, above and below the zzso level and moderate zzso Severe zzso dysfunction, zzso of zzso muscles, zzso zzso on imaging and often (but not zzso the absent zzso evoked zzso carried poor zzso In conclusion zzso zzso is a better term to describe zzso zzso as the zzso extends to a large vertical zzso Further zzso into 3 zzso may improve understanding of anatomical and zzso dysfunction and prediction of zzso
