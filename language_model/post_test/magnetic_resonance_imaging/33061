The perception of zzso relationships is crucial to understanding and interacting with our physical and social zzso However, whether the same or different neural processes are involved in zzso physical and social causality is zzso zzso this study is focused on zzso and differences in the neural zzso of causality perception in both zzso During zzso zzso participants judged zzso relationships of objects in two types of animated video clips zzso with similar zzso of zzso and spatial stimulus zzso Four conditions were analyzed in a zzso design zzso zzso zzso physical zzso zzso social zzso zzso social zzso zzso We found that higher angles and longer time delays led to decreasing judgments of causality in the physical context, whereas the same zzso led to increasing judgments in the social zzso Instead of a common network for zzso judgments zzso we found a reversed zzso pattern for the factors context and zzso PC and zzso zzso produced zzso in the bilateral zzso the right angular and inferior frontal zzso and the zzso supplementary motor zzso PNC and SC zzso produced activity in zzso zzso left superior zzso and anterior zzso brain zzso Our data suggest, that the same brain regions contribute to the impression of physical and social zzso However, they demonstrate a reversed zzso pattern that reflects the stimulus characteristics of the respective zzso Thus, specific stimulus characteristics are crucial for the perception of zzso
