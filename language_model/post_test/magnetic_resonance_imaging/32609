To characterize the pattern of cognitive deficits in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso and zzso zzso psychosis and to examine the relationship between zzso deficits and zzso transfer zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso and zzso psychosis were compared to 20 zzso zzso zzso Patients were matched with respect to zzso zzso age and conventional zzso zzso A battery of zzso tests was zzso The zzso tests which showed significant group differences were used for zzso analysis with zzso transfer ratio zzso which provides a quantitative measure of zzso structural zzso 

Patients with zzso psychosis were significantly more impaired on executive and semantic memory tasks than the zzso zzso zzso zzso test scores correlated significantly with zzso reduction in the left zzso zzso in the psychotic but not the zzso zzso 

In this study, patients with zzso and zzso psychosis were more cognitively impaired than zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the cognitive deterioration in these patients may occur as the illness zzso and the causes for this are probably zzso Our study also provides further evidence that zzso may be useful in investigating structural zzso of cognitive zzso
