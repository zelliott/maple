zzso imaging studies have provided evidence of an initial increase in zzso following the onset of zzso zzso and demonstrated that this initial increase could be zzso more specific to the site of zzso zzso These studies also raised the possibility of improving the specificity of zzso by selective mapping of this early zzso Previous MR studies reported the observation of this early response but were limited in scope and not in full zzso This paper presents a more extensive study that zzso demonstrates the initial signal decrease in individual subjects and zzso examines its dependence on stimulus duration and zzso zzso visual stimulation experiments were performed on 14 subjects using zzso imaging zzso with high zzso zzso An initial signal decrease was consistently observed in regions that were more localized than those displaying the delayed positive zzso In agreement with previous zzso and optical imaging findings, the maximum signal decrease was zzso and occurred at approximately 2 s after the onset of the zzso depending on the zzso For stimulus longer then zzso zzso the zzso dynamics and the amount of signal change of the early response was essentially independent of the stimulus zzso while the delayed response and the zzso zzso increased both in terms of magnitude and rise time as the duration of the stimulus zzso this observation is zzso with the recent optical imaging zzso
