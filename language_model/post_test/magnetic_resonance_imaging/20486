zzso has been suggested to have a zzso influence during the migration of neural cells from the zzso zones to the zzso during the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of zzso zzso infections in a cohort of children with neurological disability and cerebral cortical zzso recognized by zzso 

Twenty-six children with neurological disability and cerebral cortical zzso were investigated zzso for zzso zzso infection by zzso the dried blood spot samples for zzso zzso acid using qualitative zzso chain zzso 

zzso DNA in the dried blood spot samples was found in four out of 26 zzso Two of these four had severe disabilities with mental zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso and zzso A third child had zzso and unilateral cerebral zzso while the fourth had a mild motor coordination dysfunction and hearing zzso 

In our study, the number of zzso zzso infections in children with cerebral cortical zzso was higher zzso than expected with reference to the birth prevalence zzso of zzso zzso infection in zzso We thus conclude that zzso zzso infection should be considered in children with cortical zzso of unknown zzso
