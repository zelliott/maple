zzso gestures require the integrity of the neural networks involved in storage, zzso and execution of motor zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso frequently produce deficits during performance of zzso zzso more than zzso The zzso stream links object information with object action, suggesting that mechanical knowledge of tool use is stored zzso in the zzso Using zzso zzso we explored activity during zzso zzso and zzso hand zzso The comparison between zzso and execution of gestures demonstrated a zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior to superior zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso gestures established a functional specificity within the zzso stream for mechanical zzso zzso demonstrate that not only zzso but also the zzso acts in the processing of zzso information during zzso This might be the zzso underlying selective deficits in zzso zzso zzso
