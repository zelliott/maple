To monitor repair of bone zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso arthritis zzso during zzso combination zzso 

The study population comprised 29 zzso patients zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso starting zzso combination therapy with zzso zzso drugs zzso and completing the zzso study period with the same zzso Clinical and laboratory assessments and zzso of the hand were performed at baseline and at 1 zzso zzso findings were scored by two readers using the zzso Arthritis zzso zzso System zzso Both readers were blind to the zzso order of the zzso scans, the identity of the patients, and clinical and other imaging zzso zzso was also zzso The zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso were zzso along with the sensitivity to change with the smallest zzso difference zzso zzso of zzso was defined as a zzso score of at least 1 point lower than zzso 

The mean zzso score for zzso did not change but all other inflammatory zzso parameters decreased zzso In 19 patients, the zzso score for zzso remained unchanged after 1 zzso In five patients the score decreased after 1 year, although the decrease exceeded the zzso in only one patient zzso 

zzso combined with zzso stopped the progression of zzso as measured by the zzso in zzso of our zzso patients and occasional repair of bone zzso occurred after 1 year of zzso
