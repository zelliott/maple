Essential zzso is a common neurological disorder characterized by motor and cognitive symptoms including working memory zzso zzso research has shown that patients with essential zzso are at a higher risk to develop zzso relative to zzso zzso this demonstrates that cognitive zzso reflect specific, although poorly zzso disease zzso zzso of the zzso has been implicated in the zzso of essential zzso zzso however, whether zzso zzso relate to cognitive abnormalities is zzso We addressed this issue using functional zzso in 15 patients with essential zzso compared to 15 zzso zzso and zzso healthy controls while executing a verbal working memory zzso To remove zzso effects, patients with integrity of the zzso zzso no zzso and zzso from medications altering zzso were zzso We tested whether patients displayed abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and other areas typically engaged in working memory zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso zzso differences in the interactions of these regions were also assessed with functional connectivity zzso Finally, we determined whether individual differences in zzso and clinical measures modulated the magnitude of regional brain responses and functional connectivity data in patients with essential zzso Despite similar zzso performances, patients showed greater zzso response zzso zzso zzso compared to controls during zzso working memory trials zzso zzso zzso They also displayed altered functional connectivity between zzso zzso VI and regions implicated in focusing attention zzso control circuit including zzso prefrontal cortex, inferior zzso zzso zzso and in generating distracting zzso thoughts zzso mode network including zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings were modulated by the zzso in zzso zzso patients with low cognitive scores displayed reduced connectivity between zzso zzso VI and the zzso prefrontal zzso and enhanced connectivity between zzso zzso VI and the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is likely that zzso zzso underlying essential zzso is reflected in abnormal communications between key regions responsible for working memory and that zzso mechanisms zzso response of zzso zzso zzso occur to limit the expression of cognitive zzso The connectivity imbalance between the executive control circuit and the default mode network in patients with essential zzso with low cognitive scores may represent a dysfunction, driven by the zzso in suppressing task irrelevant thoughts via focused zzso Overall, our results offer new insights into zzso mechanisms of zzso in essential zzso and suggest a primary role of the zzso in zzso abnormal interactions between the executive control circuit and the default mode zzso
