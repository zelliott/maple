To describe the zzso findings of a zzso zzso zzso in the liver of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and to correlate it with zzso zzso 

Between August 1990 and November 2007, 144 BA patients underwent liver transplantation zzso at our zzso The zzso computer zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings were reviewed and correlated with the zzso pathological zzso 

Nine tumor zzso in 7 patients were diagnosed in zzso zzso The zzso pathological findings showed that all the zzso were zzso without zzso zzso No small zzso was detected by either zzso or zzso Of the 8 zzso zzso 6 zzso were in the central part of the liver, 5 zzso were larger than 5 zzso 5 zzso had zzso zzso structures, 3 zzso showed enhancing zzso zzso 3 zzso had zzso enhancement in CT, one zzso showed enhancement in zzso and one zzso had internal zzso 

Although varied in zzso appearance, zzso can be differentiated from zzso zzso zzso in most of BA patients awaiting zzso The presence of an zzso zzso does not imply that zzso is withheld solely on the basis of presumed zzso by imaging zzso Liver biopsy may be required in aid of diagnostic imaging to exclude zzso
