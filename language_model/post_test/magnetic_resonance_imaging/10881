In this study, we compared magnetic resonance zzso results with hip zzso findings to assess the diagnostic value of this imaging technique in evaluating zzso zzso tears and concurrent zzso hip zzso One hundred one consecutive patients zzso zzso with a clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso tear were assessed using magnetic resonance zzso and had hip zzso after failing to improve with zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso detected 71 of 93 zzso zzso zzso tears zzso zzso with five false positive studies in five patients zzso zzso cartilage findings diagnosed by magnetic resonance zzso were confirmed by zzso in 64 hips in 64 patients zzso With respect to zzso pathology, magnetic resonance zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso negative zzso value of zzso and accuracy of zzso With respect to zzso cartilage pathology, magnetic resonance zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso negative zzso value of zzso and accuracy of zzso Although magnetic resonance zzso is an excellent positive predictor in diagnosing zzso zzso tears and zzso cartilage zzso it has limited zzso A negative imaging study does not exclude important zzso pathology that can be identified and treated zzso
