zzso of the zzso occurs in elderly individuals with and without zzso yet individual variation exists in the degree and rate of zzso zzso zzso the factors that influence individual variation in the magnitude and rate of zzso zzso may help promote lifestyle changes that prevent such deterioration from taking zzso zzso fitness and exercise are effective at preventing cortical zzso and cognitive impairment in older adults and zzso studies suggest that physical activity can reduce the risk for developing zzso However, the relationship between zzso fitness and zzso volume in elderly humans is zzso In this study, we investigated whether individuals with higher levels of zzso fitness displayed greater volume of the zzso and better spatial memory performance than individuals with lower fitness zzso Furthermore, in exploratory zzso we assessed whether zzso volume zzso the relationship between fitness and spatial zzso Using a zzso analysis on magnetic resonance images in 165 zzso older adults, we found a triple association such that higher fitness levels were associated with larger left and right zzso after controlling for age, sex, and years of education, and larger zzso and higher fitness levels were correlated with better spatial memory zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso volume partially zzso the relationship between higher fitness levels and enhanced spatial zzso Our results clearly indicate that higher levels of zzso fitness are associated with increased zzso volume in older humans, which translates to better memory zzso
