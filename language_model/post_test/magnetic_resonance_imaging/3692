Mouse models of zzso disease zzso that zzso some of the zzso features of human zzso play a crucial role in investigating disease mechanisms and testing potential therapeutic zzso zzso studies of these models can yield valuable insights into the zzso course of disease progression and the effect of drug treatments on the progressive zzso zzso of the brain, particularly the zzso is a characteristic zzso of human zzso is known to begin long before the onset of motor symptoms, and zzso strongly with clinical zzso zzso the spatial and zzso patterns of zzso in HD mouse models is important to characterize the zzso of these models, as well as evaluate the effects of zzso treatments at specific time frames during disease zzso In this study, three zzso in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and automated zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to zzso the spatial and zzso patterns of brain zzso in the zzso and zzso mouse models of zzso Using an established zzso brain zzso and zzso modeling of zzso zzso we report the rates of progression and zzso of brain zzso in the two zzso Further, the zzso analysis approach was used to evaluate the effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatments on progressive zzso in the zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in significant slowing of zzso especially in the zzso and frontal zzso regions, while no significant effects of zzso treatment were zzso Progressive cortical and zzso zzso in the zzso mice showed significant positive correlations with measured functional zzso The findings of this report can be used for future testing and comparison of potential zzso in mouse models of zzso
