zzso tears and zzso zzso frequently zzso but to our knowledge, no data exist to identify who will benefit from zzso partial zzso zzso versus zzso zzso Our objective was to evaluate the capability of zzso information to predict zzso outcomes in zzso 

Using a mathematical model and published data, we combined 2 clinical zzso symptoms and pain zzso and 2 magnetic resonance imaging zzso type and bone zzso zzso indicators into 36 possible combinations and ranked each combination according to the likelihood of having primarily zzso versus zzso pain in individuals ages zzso years with knee pain, zzso and zzso zzso By considering alternative thresholds for performing zzso we identified the zzso rank that zzso the overall population International zzso Documentation Committee zzso score zzso zzso 

Rank 1 zzso displaced zzso zzso increased pain, no bone zzso zzso represented the highest likelihood of zzso zzso rank 36 zzso zzso zzso no mechanical symptoms, zzso pain, severe bone zzso zzso represented the lowest likelihood of zzso zzso zzso middle ranks included individuals with mixed findings zzso 2 findings consistent with high and 2 with low likelihood of zzso zzso zzso thresholds between ranks 17 and 23 resulted in zzso of the population receiving treatment producing the greatest possible zzso improvement, with mean incremental gains in zzso score of zzso zzso zzso were robust across a broad range of indicator zzso but were sensitive to outcome zzso 

Among individuals with degenerative zzso tears and zzso easily zzso clinical information can differentiate those who are more likely to benefit from zzso
