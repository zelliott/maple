zzso behavior is common during zzso Although zzso functional changes in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been reported in adults, the neural zzso of aggressive behavior in zzso particularly in the context of structural zzso are zzso We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure the blood zzso zzso signal and cortical zzso In a zzso experiment, zzso old adolescents imagined aggressive and zzso interactions with a zzso We show reduced zzso zzso associated with imagined aggressive behavior as well as enhanced zzso zzso and cortical thinning in the zzso with increasing zzso Changes in zzso zzso were also associated with judgments of the severity of aggressive zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with greater aggression indicating its normal function is to exert zzso control over aggressive zzso zzso zzso zzso likely reflects foresight of harmful consequences that result from aggressive zzso The correlation of zzso zzso changes and cortical thinning demonstrates ongoing maturation of the zzso during adolescence towards a refinement of social and cognitive information processing that can potentially facilitate mature social behavior in aggressive zzso
