The characteristics in flow dynamics of zzso zzso valve implanted in zzso position has been reported using zzso zzso and beneficial results have been demonstrated in zzso Because some disturbed flow characteristics were seen clinically with existence of pressure zzso the nature of zzso characteristics was evaluated in patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso using new three-dimensional zzso zzso In 19 patients after zzso with zzso zzso zzso study was conducted using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso flow profiles were zzso The zzso techniques were zzso zzso in 10, root inclusion zzso in 6, and full root zzso in 3 zzso These results were compared to 4 zzso with zzso zzso and 4 healthy zzso In 3-D flow zzso profiles, there were variations from almost normal pattern to some disturbed flow zzso All patients of zzso showed the zzso flow pattern nearly equal to normal zzso Over half of the patients with SC and zzso showed disturbed flow pattern with increased pressure zzso Although zzso acceptable, zzso zzso zzso showed some degree of flow zzso in zzso or inclusion method with increased zzso zzso that may cause late problems, and these findings evaluated by 3-D method should be implicated in surgical zzso
