Respiratory organ motion has a significant impact on the planning and delivery of zzso zzso treatment for lung zzso Currently widespread techniques, such as zzso zzso zzso cannot be used to measure zzso of this motion from one cycle to the zzso In this paper, we describe the use of fast magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques to investigate the zzso and zzso zzso of respiratory motion and also to estimate the level of errors that may be introduced into treatment delivery by using various zzso imaging strategies during lung zzso zzso A reference model of respiratory motion is formed to enable comparison of different breathing cycles at any arbitrary position in the respiratory zzso This is constructed by using zzso images from the inhale phase of a single breathing cycle, then zzso the images, and thereby tracking zzso This reference model is then compared to alternative models constructed from images acquired during the exhale phase of the same cycle and the inhale phase of a subsequent cycle, to assess zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of organ zzso The reference model is also compared to a series of models formed from zzso data at exhale and zzso zzso of these models is carried out on data from ten healthy volunteers and five lung cancer zzso zzso models show good levels of zzso and zzso zzso across the tidal breathing zzso Mean zzso errors in the position of organ surface landmarks of zzso zzso for volunteers and zzso zzso for zzso zzso measures of zzso zzso across this range are zzso zzso for volunteers and zzso zzso for zzso As expected, models based on zzso sequences do not represent normal tidal motion as well as those based on zzso data, with mean errors of zzso zzso for volunteers and zzso zzso for zzso Errors are generally larger still when using a single zzso image at either exhale or inhale to represent the zzso This indicates that account should be taken of zzso and zzso respiratory motion zzso and that zzso methods of obtaining data for zzso planning may potentially introduce large zzso This approach to analysis of motion and zzso has potential to inform decisions about treatment margins and zzso zzso zzso
