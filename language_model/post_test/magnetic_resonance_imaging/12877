The abduction moment arms of 4 shoulder muscles were calculated in clinically important positions to evaluate the best test situation for the zzso based on its mechanical zzso arms of the zzso zzso and middle and anterior zzso in 18 individuals were zzso using individual magnetic resonance imaging data and a zzso design tool for zzso Three tests with the arm in the neutral position zzso hanging on zzso at 90 of zzso at 90 of zzso and full internal zzso rotation zzso zzso were zzso The zzso a greater mechanical advantage vs the other tested muscles in the neutral arm zzso In the zzso position, the zzso abduction moment arm is reduced with increased internal zzso zzso these results with the literature indicates that this new method is adequate for calculation of moment arms and may be used in any desired joint zzso
