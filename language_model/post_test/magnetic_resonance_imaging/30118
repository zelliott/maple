Using a number of interesting cases, we illustrate how attention to vascular zzso features and blood flow patterns can facilitate the diagnosis of an zzso zzso True vascular zzso can be differentiated from zzso zzso and normal zzso of the zzso blood flow pattern can be differentiated from zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso diagnosis can be improved by an understanding of zzso vascular anatomy and blood flow patterns and with optimal use of imaging zzso
