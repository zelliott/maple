zzso preserved rat zzso were studied with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso under zzso zzso zzso relaxation zzso zzso relaxation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Relative signal zzso zzso of the liver to distilled water in terms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso during 12 h zzso (4 degrees zzso preservation with zzso while these parameters did not increase during preservation with University of Wisconsin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment before the harvesting increased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the subsequent 12-hour preservation with zzso solution did not improve the increased zzso These results suggest that zzso has potential application in evaluating the zzso changes of water molecules in the liver zzso which were measured by placing the harvested liver in a plastic bag under a magnetic field at a low zzso
