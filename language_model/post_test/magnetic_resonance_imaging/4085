zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging is a hybrid of zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso One scan consists of several spin echoes zzso zzso factor, zzso each of which consists of a number of zzso echoes zzso factor, zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate different combinations of zzso and zzso in zzso imaging and to test its usefulness in musculoskeletal zzso 

On a zzso T MR unit, 11 zzso sequences with different combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in phantom studies with respect to zzso zzso ratio, zzso of images, and geometrical zzso From this study, the optimal zzso was applied to 25 patients with different joint zzso and compared to a zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overall image quality, and artifacts were zzso analyzed by two observers independently of each zzso 

With respect to zzso ratio, signal zzso and geometrical zzso the zzso sequence with zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso distortion 1 zzso proved to be superior to the other zzso sequences within a scanning time of less than 120 zzso In a clinical study, the zzso sequence proved superior to zzso zzso (without fat zzso in the zzso of bone-marrow and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso injuries, although the image quality was zzso
