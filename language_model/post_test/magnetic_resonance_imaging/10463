The zzso formation is damaged early in Alzheimer's disease zzso An association between zzso lobe volume and cognitive function has been shown in several zzso Increased zzso zzso axis function has been suggested to be related to zzso zzso and cognitive zzso Our hypothesis was that there is a clear link between zzso volume -- notably of the zzso region -- memory zzso and zzso and decreased feedback sensitivity in the zzso axis in zzso 

Sixteen zzso zzso with mild to moderate zzso were zzso zzso volume was measured with magnetic resonance zzso zzso suppression tests were performed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three different components in the zzso battery -- zzso 15 item memory test, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment zzso zzso word recall and spatial span from zzso Adult Intelligence zzso - zzso zzso instrument zzso zzso -- were found to represent episodic and zzso zzso 

Low zzso zzso volume and high zzso cortisol levels in combination were significantly associated with zzso 15 item memory and spatial span test zzso No association was found between zzso feedback and zzso zzso 

Low zzso volume and a disturbed negative feedback in the zzso axis link to specific cognitive zzso in Alzheimer's zzso
