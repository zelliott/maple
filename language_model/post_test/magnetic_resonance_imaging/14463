We developed a method for calculating zzso areas from zzso body scans by zzso imaging zzso The method is based on an inversion recovery experiment zzso time 820 zzso inversion delay time 300 zzso and echo time 20 zzso zzso areas and zzso areas were calculated by this method and by zzso zzso zzso from abdominal scans taken in seven male zzso The SEE ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso areas to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso of measuring fat areas with zzso was assessed in seven other volunteers (four zzso three zzso The average errors of the method for different fat areas were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso areas, zzso We conclude that CT and zzso may yield different absolute values of fat areas (especially visceral zzso but that the ranking of individuals on the basis of their fat areas will be similar by both zzso
