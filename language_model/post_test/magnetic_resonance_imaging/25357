We combined complementary zzso brain imaging techniques with zzso measures to investigate the anatomy and time course of brain activity associated with semantic zzso in a zzso zzso Participants viewed pairs of zzso and decided whether the second item was a real word or zzso There were two zzso the semantic relationship between the prime and the target zzso or zzso and the zzso between the onset of prime and target zzso or 1000 zzso to vary the degree of semantic expectancy that was possible during task zzso zzso results zzso the well-established finding that identification of the target is facilitated by a preceding zzso related zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso identified two brain areas involved in the zzso zzso zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso was diminished when target words were primed by zzso related words, suggesting involvement of this brain region during active semantic association or zzso In contrast, activity in the left zzso zzso in the zzso junction was enhanced for target words primed by zzso related zzso Brain areas influenced by the zzso between prime and target words, and by the interaction between word zzso and semantic zzso were also zzso A parallel experiment using zzso zzso zzso unveiled a striking difference in the time course of semantic zzso as a function of zzso In line with previous reports, the primary effect of semantic zzso on zzso was the zzso of the zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso effect started significantly earlier in the zzso zzso zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to contribute to the zzso zzso a finding that links the zzso results obtained with zzso and zzso zzso
