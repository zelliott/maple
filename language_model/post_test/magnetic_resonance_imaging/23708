To study the clinical significance of zzso zzso as measured in zzso with zzso MRS in the zzso of patients with zzso disease zzso 

zzso zzso MRS was performed on the zzso zzso of 10 HD patients (4 zzso gene carriers and 6 zzso zzso and 5 zzso healthy zzso zzso zzso was performed by referring the areas of the respective spectral zzso to that of water in the analyzed zzso The zzso findings were correlated with motor and cognitive performance in several specific tests and with the length of the zzso repeat expansion zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were reduced markedly in both groups of patients, particularly in the advanced group zzso zzso but the decrease was also significant in zzso patients zzso zzso whose motor and cognitive performances were within the normal zzso Both zzso correlated highly with the motor score of the zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso and with zzso zzso of zzso and tapping zzso zzso reduction was also well correlated with performance in cognitive timed tasks and with the length of zzso expansion zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso signal appears to be an interesting marker for progression in HD and could be useful in assessing therapeutic outcome, particularly during the initial stages when most clinical zzso are still within the normal zzso
