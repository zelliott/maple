zzso zzso and zzso are zzso that share a similar distinctive tissue component of dense zzso zzso We sought to describe the zzso features of these zzso and to determine if the zzso component shows distinctive zzso Fourteen patients in whom MR images performed with zzso and zzso images and who subsequently underwent surgery for zzso of zzso zzso or zzso were identified from two zzso Five patients had zzso zzso and nine patients had zzso zzso zzso MR studies used zzso spin echo and zzso zzso zzso images, with fat zzso zzso fast zzso zzso images in seven zzso Studies were reviewed for findings of low zzso equal to skeletal zzso signal intensity solid components on zzso images, characteristics of zzso enhancement, and associated zzso zzso Images were obtained ex zzso from three zzso surgical specimens with an zzso field of view and correlated with zzso All five of the zzso showed predominantly very low signal intensity, similar to skeletal muscle, on zzso zzso Two of five zzso were in patients with zzso zzso and increased amounts of fluid in the zzso Thirteen zzso were zzso masses with bands of very low signal intensity ranging from 2 to 20 zzso in the wall of the mass, and one was predominantly solid zzso zzso zzso correlation with zzso images showed that the low signal intensity material was the zzso zzso component of the zzso zzso components of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by MR as solid components representing zzso tissue of very low signal intensity on zzso zzso
