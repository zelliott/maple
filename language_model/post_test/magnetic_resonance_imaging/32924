zzso findings have shown that the zzso is critically implicated in a broad range of cognitive processes including executive zzso Of note, zzso symptoms and a number of cognitive deficits have been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso This study investigated for the first time the role of zzso symptoms in modulating the neural networks associated with a cognitive task broadly used in zzso patients zzso Visual zzso zzso Test zzso Twelve zzso zzso zzso patients with prevalent zzso signs and symptoms zzso 15 zzso patients without zzso manifestation zzso and 16 zzso controls were examined during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We tested whether the zzso patients displayed abnormal zzso within zzso zzso regions and other areas typically engaged in working memory and tightly connected with the zzso Despite similar behavioral performances during zzso zzso patients displayed, relatively to both zzso patients and controls, significantly greater responses in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients also displayed reduced functional connectivity between the left zzso zzso I and the right superior zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the presence of the zzso signs drastically impacts on the zzso networks underlying working memory in zzso The altered communication between the zzso and a cortical area implicated in short-term zzso and storage of relevant information, offer new insights into the zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso
