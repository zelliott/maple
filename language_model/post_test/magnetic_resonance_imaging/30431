Our purpose was to assess the short-term results and describe the technique of zzso repair of zzso rotator cuff tears by use of a zzso zzso zzso Medical Technology, Arlington, zzso 

Between March 2003 and February 2004, 16 patients with massive, zzso immobile rotator cuff tears were treated with zzso placement of a zzso zzso by a single zzso Patients were followed up for 1 to 2 zzso All were evaluated preoperatively and zzso by use of the modified University of California, Los Angeles scoring system, zzso score, and zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed zzso at 3 months and 1 zzso 

At a mean follow-up of zzso months zzso 12 to 38 zzso 15 of 16 patients were satisfied with the zzso The mean University of California, Los Angeles score increased from zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso score increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significant improvements were seen in pain, forward zzso and external rotation zzso Thirteen patients had full incorporation of the graft into the native tissue as documented on magnetic resonance zzso There were no complications in this cohort of zzso 

Our study supports zzso zzso as a viable solution for surgical salvage in select cases of massive, zzso rotator cuff zzso This treatment option may provide patients with decreased pain and increased function despite a previously zzso rotator cuff zzso 

Level IV, therapeutic case zzso
