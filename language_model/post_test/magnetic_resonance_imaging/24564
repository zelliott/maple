zzso is a zzso medication that produces improvements in functions associated with multiple zzso zzso To investigate the potentially distributed effects of zzso on the zzso intrinsic network architecture, we coupled resting state imaging with zzso pattern zzso In a zzso zzso zzso randomized, zzso zzso design, 32 healthy human volunteers received either zzso or zzso prior to two zzso resting state scans separated by approximately one zzso zzso state zzso were generated by placing regions of interest at regular intervals throughout the brain, and these zzso were submitted for support zzso machine zzso We found that zzso produces a distributed, reliably zzso zzso neural zzso zzso effects were evident across multiple resting state networks, especially zzso zzso and default zzso zzso reduced zzso within visual and zzso zzso In addition, default network exhibited decoupling with several task positive networks, consistent with zzso zzso of the competitive relationship between these zzso These results suggest that connectivity changes within and between large-scale networks are potentially involved in the mechanisms by which zzso improves attention zzso
