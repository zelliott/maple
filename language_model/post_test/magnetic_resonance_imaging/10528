We assessed zzso corpus zzso size in zzso cell disease zzso and its relationship to zzso volume, zzso location, and cognitive zzso zzso children with zzso and 16 demographic controls completed magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso Corpus zzso zzso size was smaller for children with silent zzso zzso zzso 8) or overt stroke zzso zzso 8) than for those without visible zzso zzso zzso zzso or control zzso zzso volume was a robust predictor of zzso and other cognitive zzso total zzso size did not typically add explanatory power for these zzso The size of the zzso body of the zzso however, independently predicted measures of zzso zzso production, and working zzso zzso zzso size was also decreased among many of the children with zzso even in the absence of visible zzso in this zzso Brain zzso appears to provide additional information about zzso effects on the brain above and beyond visible zzso
