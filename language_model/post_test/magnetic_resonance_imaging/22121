The use of cerebral blood volume zzso maps generated from dynamic zzso studies tracking the zzso passage of zzso contrast agents strongly depends on the zzso ratio zzso of the zzso The authors present a zzso model for the noise in zzso maps and introduce zzso and zzso Carlo techniques for determining the effect of experimental parameters and processing strategies upon zzso zzso increases as more points are used to estimate the baseline signal zzso For typical injections, maps made with 10 baseline points have zzso more noise than those made with 50 baseline zzso For a given peak percentage signal drop, an optimum TE can be chosen that, in general, is less than the baseline zzso However, because zzso is relatively insensitive to TE around this optimum value, choosing TE approximately equal to zzso does not sacrifice much zzso for typical doses of contrast zzso The zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately equal to zzso whereas as short a zzso as possible should be used to maximize zzso zzso In general, zzso is zzso for a given dose of contrast agent by selecting as short an input zzso duration as zzso For image zzso exceeding zzso the zzso procedure adds little extra noise compared with simple zzso zzso However, for zzso input images, can be the case for high resolution zzso images, the zzso parameters of the zzso fit broaden the distribution of the zzso estimate and thereby decrease zzso The authors compared the zzso noise predicted by their model with that of actual patient data and found that the zzso model accounts for roughly zzso of the measured zzso of zzso within white matter regions of zzso
