A zzso phase II study of zzso intravenous zzso in newly diagnosed zzso primary zzso zzso was conducted in the New zzso to Brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso (8 zzso was initially administered every 2 zzso The primary end point was zzso zzso or zzso as defined by standard zzso criteria, and secondary end points were survival and drug-related zzso 

Twenty-five patients were enrolled with a mean age of 60 years and median zzso Performance zzso of zzso Three of 14 patients who underwent zzso puncture had zzso cells on zzso zzso and five of 25 patients had zzso zzso Two patients could not be evaluated for the primary end point because of the absence of measurable disease in one and death before zzso imaging in zzso All patients have completed the treatment program or zzso Among 23 patients, there were 12 zzso zzso five zzso zzso one zzso with stable disease, and five zzso zzso while on zzso Seven patients died of tumor zzso and two died of other zzso Median zzso survival was zzso zzso Median overall survival for the entire group had not been reached at zzso zzso The toxicity of this regimen was modest, with no grade 3 or 4 toxicity in 13 of 25 patients, grade 3 toxicity in eight of 25 patients, and grade 4 toxicity in four of 25 patients after zzso cycles of zzso 

These results indicate that high-dose zzso is associated with modest toxicity and a zzso response proportion zzso comparable to more toxic zzso
