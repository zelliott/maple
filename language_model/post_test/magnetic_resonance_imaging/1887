We used zzso to investigate zzso changes in brain zzso during a zzso zzso interference zzso A positive correlation was observed between age and zzso zzso zzso zzso 30) in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, the left anterior cingulate, and the left zzso and zzso zzso No regions showed a negative correlation between zzso and zzso We further investigated age-related differences by zzso the sample into three age groups: children zzso zzso adolescents zzso zzso and young adults zzso zzso Young adult subjects zzso zzso zzso displayed significant zzso in the inferior and middle frontal zzso zzso the left anterior cingulate, and bilateral inferior and superior zzso zzso zzso comparisons revealed that young adults had significantly greater zzso than adolescent subjects zzso zzso zzso in the left middle frontal zzso and that young adults showed significantly greater zzso than children zzso zzso 8) in the anterior zzso and left zzso and zzso regions, as well as in the left middle frontal zzso Compared to children, both adult and adolescent subjects exhibited significantly greater zzso in the zzso zzso Adult and adolescent groups, however, did not differ in zzso for this zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso zzso functional development of the zzso lobe occurs by zzso In contrast, prefrontal zzso function contributing to the zzso interference task continues to develop into zzso This zzso process may depend on increased ability to recruit focal neural resources with zzso zzso from this study, the first zzso zzso investigation of the zzso interference task, provide a template with which normal development and zzso disorders of prefrontal zzso function can be zzso
