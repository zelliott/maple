The study compares the rate of positive zzso using an automated versus a manual zzso injection devise and compares the pressure and volume values at various pressures and initial evoked pain and zzso or greater evoked zzso 

A retrospective study zzso collected patient study data used in a prior prospective study and with zzso collected data which is routinely collected per our institutional standardized audit zzso Two zzso disc zzso zzso injection speed zzso manual injection speed zzso were zzso employed during provocation zzso in 510 discs of 151 consecutive zzso Two hundred zzso discs of 67 patients with chronic low back pain were evaluated using the automated zzso zzso zzso and 273 discs of 84 patients were evaluated with a manual zzso zzso zzso 

No significant differences in positive zzso rates were found between the automated and manual groups zzso vs zzso per disc, respectively, zzso No significant differences in zzso positive zzso rates were found zzso vs zzso per disc, automated group versus manual group, respectively, zzso However, there were significantly increased volumes and lower pressures at initial and zzso pain zzso 

The study results found equivalent positive zzso rates following a series of zzso zzso using either an automated or manual pressure zzso There were, however significant increases in volume at both initial onset of evoked pain and at zzso pain when using the automated injection devise that may have caused the observed lower opening pressure and lower pressure values at initial evoked zzso Assuming increased volumes are innocuous, automated injection is inherently more controlled and may better reduce unintended and often unrecorded zzso high dynamic pressure zzso thereby reducing conscious and unconscious operator zzso
