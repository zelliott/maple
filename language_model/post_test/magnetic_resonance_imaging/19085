This paper describes a zzso method for three-dimensional registration of brain zzso A finite element approach is used to obtain a maximum a zzso estimate of the deformation field at every zzso of a template zzso The zzso used by the zzso estimate zzso unlikely zzso and enforce a continuous zzso zzso The zzso are assumed to have some form of zzso in that zzso describing the probability distribution of the zzso should be identical to those for the zzso zzso zzso brain A to brain B should not be different zzso from zzso B to zzso A zzso descent zzso is presented for zzso the optimum zzso
