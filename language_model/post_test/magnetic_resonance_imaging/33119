zzso of an association between inflammation and spinal zzso has been zzso Until the advent of zzso prospective study was not possible due to zzso of zzso Recent studies using zzso have described an association between the presence of bone zzso at zzso corners on zzso and the subsequent development of zzso at the corresponding zzso corners on zzso Although reports have also highlighted the development of new zzso where the baseline zzso shows no zzso zzso has limited sensitivity for detection of spinal inflammation that is clearly evident on zzso There are also crucial zzso challenges because zzso assessment is limited to the anterior corners of the cervical and zzso spine while zzso zzso in the cervical spine are often small while zzso inflammatory signal is common in the zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation in two independent studies has also shown that inflammatory zzso that resolve after zzso therapy are more prone to develop into zzso It may be possible that very early inflammatory zzso resolve completely without zzso if zzso therapy is introduced before new bone formation becomes largely zzso For an individual patient the overall development of new bone during zzso therapy may therefore depend on the balance between the number of early and more mature inflammatory zzso Clinical trials of zzso agents in early zzso together with prospective zzso studies will allow more detailed testing of this hypothesis as a major priority for the research agenda in zzso
