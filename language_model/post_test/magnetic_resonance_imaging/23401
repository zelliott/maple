Several recent behavioral studies have shown that the zzso of a small number of items (a process termed zzso depends on the availability of zzso resources and is not a zzso process as previously zzso Here we studied the neural zzso of visual zzso under different zzso loads in a zzso paradigm using zzso Relatively intact zzso under low zzso load compared to impaired zzso under high zzso load was associated with an increase in zzso signal in the right zzso junction zzso zzso zzso modulated response in the zzso was specific to small set sizes (up to 3 zzso and did not occur at larger set sizes zzso zzso This result has two zzso zzso zzso involves part of the zzso network for zzso attention providing neural evidence against zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is zzso zzso Together with similar evidence from studies probing visual short-term memory, this result suggests that zzso zzso might reflect the zzso ability to attentively handle small set zzso Thus, the zzso may play an important role for the emergence of a capacity limit in both zzso and visual short-term zzso
