The objective of the study was to evaluate cortical development parameters by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso fetuses and normally grown zzso 

A total of 52 zzso and 50 control fetuses were zzso using a zzso zzso scanner at 37 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso anatomical acquisitions were obtained in 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso depth corrected by zzso zzso brain zzso and asymmetry zzso were assessed by means of manual zzso and compared between cases and zzso 

zzso zzso fetuses had significantly deeper zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso and right zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and significantly lower zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso brain zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso and left zzso volumes zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso fetuses showed significantly higher right insular asymmetry zzso 

zzso zzso fetuses had a different pattern of cortical development assessed by zzso supporting the existence of in zzso brain zzso zzso development could be useful to define fetal brain zzso characteristic of zzso
