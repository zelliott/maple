zzso deficits have been identified in cerebral zzso zzso but associated cortical brain activity in zzso remains poorly zzso zzso zzso was used to measure blood zzso zzso zzso responses during three tactile tasks in 10 participants with zzso zzso zzso age: zzso years, zzso zzso years; 5 zzso and 10 zzso controls zzso age: zzso years, zzso zzso years; 5 zzso zzso stimulation involved zzso translation of smooth or embossed surfaces across the right index finger zzso the discrimination tasks with embossed surfaces involved judging whether zzso paired shapes were similar or different, and zzso a zzso set of horizontal zzso preceded or followed a zzso zzso zzso and duration of surface translation was identical across all zzso In addition, an zzso design revealed response dynamics per trial in both zzso Compared to controls, individuals with zzso zzso had significantly reduced spatial zzso in activated cortical areas and smaller zzso response zzso in cortical areas for zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results provide mechanisms for the widespread zzso deficits in zzso The reduced zzso noted across multiple cortical areas might contribute to motor deficits in zzso
