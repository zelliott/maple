Despite the fact that the zzso zzso zzso is a crucial brain structure as it contains the primary auditory zzso zzso relatively few structural zzso studies have concentrated upon zzso We propose that this may be attributed in part to the considerable zzso of this structure and, most importantly, to the lack of unified criteria for defining the extent of the zzso along the zzso landmarks of the zzso which ultimately affects the reliability and zzso of these zzso This review highlights three aspects: first, the standard and zzso anatomy of the zzso and zzso with particular focus on zzso definition of these zzso second, the importance of studying the zzso and zzso in health and disease using structural zzso and, third, the problem of zzso zzso of the zzso The scientific community should be aware that the zzso and its included zzso are not zzso Additionally, zzso to the great complexity and zzso of these regions, future zzso studies should be cautious when using single zzso zzso or maps generated by simply averaging across individuals to zzso these zzso Instead, and while waiting for future in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso the use of zzso and functional maps is advantageous but not without zzso
