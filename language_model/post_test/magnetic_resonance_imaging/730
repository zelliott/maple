zzso zzso positively affect zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso and other conditions, but no controlled functional zzso studies have examined where their effects occur in the zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and brain activity in patients with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso a diagnosis associated with a high risk of developing zzso Nine older adults with zzso were compared with nine healthy, demographically matched zzso At zzso patients showed reduced zzso of zzso regions relative to controls during a working memory zzso After stabilization on zzso zzso zzso zzso weeks at 10 zzso patients showed increased frontal activity relative to zzso controls, which was positively correlated with improvement in task performance zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as baseline zzso volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The patients' overall cognitive function was stable or improved throughout the zzso zzso treatment with a zzso inhibitor appears to enhance the activity of frontal zzso in patients with zzso and this increase appears to be related to improved zzso and to baseline integrity of the zzso These relationships have implications for understanding the mechanisms by which zzso medications exert their effects on brain function and for the use of functional zzso in early detection and treatment monitoring of zzso and zzso
