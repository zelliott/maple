zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has recently gained interest as a possible means to facilitate the learning of certain zzso However, zzso is limited by processing speed and available software, and continued development is needed for zzso to progress further and become feasible for clinical zzso In this work, we present an zzso zzso system for zzso powered by a novel zzso zzso Unit zzso accelerated motion correction strategy as part of the zzso Suite project ( zzso zzso Our system contributes to the development of zzso by presenting a motion correction zzso that provides an estimate of motion with essentially no processing delay as well as a modular zzso system zzso Using empirical data from zzso scans, we assessed the quality of motion correction in this new zzso The present zzso performed comparably to standard zzso zzso zzso methods and outperformed other real-time methods based on zero order zzso of motion zzso The modular approach to the zzso system allows the system to be flexible to the experiment and feedback design, a valuable feature for many zzso We illustrate the flexibility of the system by describing several of our ongoing zzso Our hope is that continuing development of zzso zzso zzso and software will make this new technology more accessible and zzso and will thereby accelerate its application in the clinical and cognitive zzso
