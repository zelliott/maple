Both zzso zzso cortical dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso are regarded as fundamental zzso features of zzso However, although animal models of psychosis suggest that these two abnormalities are zzso their relationship in humans has yet to be zzso 

We used a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso zzso during an episodic memory task and local zzso levels in 22 individuals with an zzso mental state for psychosis and 14 healthy zzso 

We observed a significant zzso difference in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with local zzso zzso In control subjects, zzso zzso zzso during episodic zzso was positively associated with zzso zzso zzso However, in the clinical population, zzso zzso zzso was reduced, and the relationship with zzso was zzso 

In individuals at high risk of zzso zzso zzso dysfunction seemed related to a loss of the normal relationship with local zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence that links zzso zzso dysfunction with the central zzso system in humans and is consistent with evidence that drugs that zzso zzso transmission might be useful in the treatment of zzso
