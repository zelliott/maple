There is a necessity for an imaging method during zzso to get a three-dimensional access to the zzso In this study we evaluated zzso zzso laser therapy of the liver under magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Five domestic pigs underwent zzso in an zzso magnetic resonance zzso Under simultaneous real-time magnetic resonance imaging zzso laser therapy was applied to the zzso zzso resonance images, zzso aspects of the zzso and light microscopic findings were zzso 

The interventions could be safely zzso There was no image artifact caused by instruments or by the carbon zzso Dynamic zzso imaging proved to significantly predict the zzso volume of the laser zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso laser therapy of the liver combines the advantages of minimal invasive surgery and magnetic resonance zzso Further development should focus on zzso instruments and temperature sensitive zzso
