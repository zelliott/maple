The objectives of the study are to review the female pelvic floor anatomy relevant to childbirth simulations, to discuss available methods for clinical evaluation of female pelvic floor function, and to review the variation in pelvic floor changes after zzso zzso A high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso data set from an zzso zzso was used to illustrate the MR anatomy of the female pelvic zzso Manual zzso was performed and three-dimensional reconstructions of the pelvic floor structures were generated, which were used to illustrate the zzso anatomy of the pelvic zzso Variation in the post zzso appearance of the zzso zzso muscles is illustrated using other zzso MR data sets, which depict unilateral and bilateral disruptions in the zzso portion of zzso zzso as well as shape variations, which may be seen in the post zzso zzso The clinical evaluation of the pelvic floor is then zzso The female pelvis is composed of a zzso scaffold, from which the pelvic floor muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso fits in a zzso groove in the zzso zzso The zzso is suspended across the zzso attaching zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso supports the zzso and zzso MR studies have demonstrated disruptions in zzso zzso attachments after zzso zzso Such disruptions are rare in women who have not given birth zzso Changes to the zzso apparatus of the pelvic floor can also be demonstrated after zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso and neurological injury to the pelvic floor may be associated with pelvic floor dysfunction zzso These changes are difficult to study in zzso but may be studied through zzso zzso consideration of clinical anatomy is important in these zzso
