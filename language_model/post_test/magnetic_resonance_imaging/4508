Wall thickness zzso zzso derived from MR images are subject to considerable measurement zzso This study determines the effects of zzso zzso filtering of zzso on functional parameters derived from the zzso peak rate of wall thinning zzso and time to zzso zzso The zzso standard zzso zzso of zzso changed from zzso to zzso and the zzso of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso between neighboring segments decreased from zzso to zzso mean zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that filtering of MR zzso zzso contributes to a better representation of zzso wall zzso
