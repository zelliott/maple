zzso therapies are the current most plausible drug candidates for zzso and zzso following prolonged zzso Given that zzso zzso is widely considered to be zzso for outcome following status zzso the zzso agent zzso is sometimes used in clinic for alleviating cerebral zzso In this study we perform zzso magnetic resonance imaging in order to assess the contribution of zzso on cerebral zzso and subsequent zzso following status zzso zzso was used to induce status zzso in zzso Following status zzso rats were either zzso with saline or with zzso sodium zzso zzso or zzso Brain zzso was assessed by means of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used as a marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed prior to, 48 h and 96 h following status zzso Volume zzso were performed between 18 and 21 days after status zzso zzso cerebral zzso was worse in rats that were treated with zzso compared to zzso Furthermore, zzso treated rats had lower zzso volumes compared to controls 3 weeks after the initial zzso The zzso zzso at 2 days and 4 days in the zzso correlated with zzso volumes at 3 zzso Finally, the mortality rate in the first week following status zzso increased from zzso in zzso rats to zzso and zzso in rats treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso can exacerbate the acute cerebral zzso and brain injury associated with status zzso
