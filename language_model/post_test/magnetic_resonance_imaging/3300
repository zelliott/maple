zzso and zzso zzso are common zzso zzso The extent of slipping of the zzso vertebra is considered a major zzso for prognosis and further zzso zzso zzso is a common finding associated with zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso bodies in patients with zzso and in the general population and to zzso the impact of the findings on the measurement and grading of zzso 

140 patients with 141 levels of zzso identified by zzso were included in this zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso body and the size in the zzso zzso image were measured and zzso In addition, a zzso control group was evaluated to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso bodies can also be found in the general zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were found in 50 patients with zzso and none was found in the control zzso These shortened zzso zzso zzso and in 19 patients the zzso zzso the zzso thus mimicking zzso although only zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso vertebra is common and may mimic zzso In order to define and measure zzso the zzso of the zzso vertebra has to be taken into zzso
