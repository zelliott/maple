The need to improve zzso efficacy against head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is well zzso In this study, we investigated the potential of targeting the established tumor zzso in combination with chemotherapy in head and neck zzso 

Experimental studies were carried out in multiple human zzso zzso models to examine the activity of the vascular zzso agent zzso zzso acid zzso in combination with zzso zzso imaging zzso resonance imaging, zzso in conjunction with drug delivery assessment zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis was performed to characterize tumor response to zzso zzso treatment outcome was assessed using zzso end points of zzso 

zzso of tumors with zzso prior to administration of chemotherapy increased zzso drug delivery and treatment zzso Enhancement of therapeutic efficacy was dependent on the dose and duration of zzso treatment but was independent of the zzso agent zzso Combination treatment resulted in increased tumor cell kill and improvement in zzso survival and overall survival in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our results show that zzso of the tumor zzso with an zzso agent zzso the tumor zzso and results in enhancement of zzso delivery and efficacy in zzso Further investigation into the activity of zzso agents in combination with chemotherapy against zzso is zzso
