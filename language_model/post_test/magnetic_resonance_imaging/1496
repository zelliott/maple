zzso compliance and pulse wave zzso zzso are important zzso of heart load, and are clinically useful zzso of cardiovascular zzso Most direct methods to derive them require invasive pressure zzso In this work a zzso technique to evaluate zzso compliance and zzso using zzso is zzso zzso magnitude and phase images to measure area and flow in the ascending zzso were acquired in a group of 13 young healthy zzso Assuming that the early zzso part of the wave was zzso and zzso zzso was determined as the ratio between flow and area variations at early zzso Our results were compared to pulse wave zzso derived from a direct transit time, and to one using ascending zzso area and peripheral zzso pulse zzso The new method proved to be accurate and in good agreement with the transit time method, as well as with previously published zzso
