Positive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by selective positive zzso zzso zzso has shown to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso To determine whether this benefit can be extended beyond zzso pain, the present study examined the zzso activity and adverse effect profile of zzso zzso and zzso in a variety of zzso models in zzso The effect of the combined therapy on drug-induced brain activities was also determined using pharmacological magnetic resonance zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso shift of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso In the paw skin incision model of zzso pain, zzso of zzso similarly induced a zzso zzso shift of zzso zzso zzso 153 zzso In zzso induced knee joint pain, zzso of zzso enhanced the potency of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In pharmacological zzso zzso of zzso was shown to lead to a zzso shift of zzso zzso for cortical zzso zzso induced zzso adverse effects were not exacerbated in presence of an zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso Acute challenge of zzso produced no cross zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that selective positive zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity across zzso and zzso zzso pain models without zzso zzso adverse effects, suggesting that selective positive zzso of zzso zzso by zzso may represent a novel zzso zzso
