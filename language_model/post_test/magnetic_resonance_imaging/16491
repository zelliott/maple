zzso is a zzso zzso hypnotic that binds at the zzso binding site on specific zzso receptors to enhance fast zzso zzso The behavioral and zzso pharmacology of zzso has been studied zzso but little is known about its zzso zzso in zzso In the present zzso zzso and zzso study, blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso at 3 zzso was used to assess the effects of zzso within the zzso Healthy participants zzso were scanned 60 zzso after acute oral administration of zzso zzso 5, 10, or zzso and changes in zzso signal were measured in the visual zzso during presentation of a flashing zzso Heart rate and oxygen zzso were monitored continuously throughout the zzso zzso (10 and zzso reduced the robust visual system zzso produced by presentation of this zzso but had no effects on zzso activity during the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signal within the visual zzso is consistent with the abundant distribution of zzso receptors localized in this region, as well as previous studies showing a relationship between increased zzso zzso zzso and a reduction in zzso zzso
