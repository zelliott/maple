zzso and functional cardiac zzso can potentially benefit greatly from the recent advent of commercial zzso zzso and above) zzso zzso However, conventional hardware zzso at lower field using a zzso for homogeneous transmission are not available at these field zzso zzso zzso systems have been shown to be able to image the human heart at zzso but such systems are currently not widely zzso In this paper, we zzso zzso the design of a simple zzso zzso for cardiac imaging at zzso The size, zzso and position have been chosen to produce a zzso field with no zzso signal voids within the zzso Standard zzso echoes for gating were adapted for operation at the zzso zzso directly along the zzso zzso Using this setup, conventional and high-resolution zzso functional imaging have been successfully performed, as has zzso imaging of the right coronary zzso
