To extend the concept of deflecting the tip of a zzso with the magnetic force created in an zzso system through the use of an array of independently zzso steering coils located in the zzso tip, and to present methods for zzso of the zzso and/or surrounding areas while the zzso is zzso 

An array of steering coils made of zzso wire was built over a zzso zzso zzso zzso fiber braided zzso Two of the coils were 70 turn zzso coils separated by 1 zzso and the third was a zzso square side zzso that was 2 zzso 4 zzso Each zzso was driven independently by a pulse zzso zzso zzso current source controlled by a zzso that received commands from a zzso routine that zzso set current zzso and direction for each zzso The zzso was immersed in a water phantom containing zzso zzso that was placed at the zzso of a zzso T zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tip were measured from zzso data obtained with a real-time radio frequency zzso zzso zzso echo sequence zzso The small local magnetic fields generated by the steering coils were exploited to generate a zzso signal at the zzso tip by using a modified zzso sequence that did not include zzso zzso zzso Imaging and zzso modes were implemented by zzso the zzso of the steering zzso array with the scanner by ensuring that no current was driven through the coils during the data acquisition zzso this allowed zzso of the surrounding tissue while not affecting the desired zzso zzso 

zzso as large as zzso zzso were measured when exciting the steering coils zzso with a 100 zzso maximum current per zzso When exciting a single zzso zzso the zzso was half this value with zzso higher zzso A zzso zzso tip useful for zzso tracking was obtained by imaging with the modified zzso zzso Clear zzso of the areas surrounding the zzso was obtained by using the zzso and imaging mode even with a repetition time zzso as small as 10 zzso 

A new system for zzso steering is presented that allows large zzso through the use of an integrated array of steering zzso Additionally, two imaging techniques for tracking the zzso tip and zzso of surrounding areas, without interference from the active zzso were zzso Together the demonstrated zzso zzso control system and the imaging techniques will ultimately contribute to the development of a zzso system for zzso zzso zzso
