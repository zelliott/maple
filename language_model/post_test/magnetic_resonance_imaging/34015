In a previous study, we used magnetic resonance zzso imaging to zzso zzso zzso zzso heart valve zzso cusp zzso zzso results using three valves indicated that accelerated testing induced changes in zzso shape, including focal regions of high zzso Since for zzso shell structures, such as the zzso zzso zzso changes can affect the stress distribution independently from changes to mechanical properties, shape changes might have adverse effects on zzso zzso 

The MR technique was applied to an expanded valve database to explore more fully shape change with zzso The spatial zzso distribution was compared across valves subjected to a range of accelerated test zzso 

zzso confirmed our initial findings that zzso zzso undergo a zzso zzso deformation with accelerated zzso This deformation resulted in an increase in the portion of zzso surface exhibiting high zzso zzso In one cusp we mapped structural information obtained by zzso light scattering back to the three-dimensional zzso surface using an zzso zzso zzso from the mapped cusp demonstrated a strong spatial correlation between elevated zzso and structural zzso 

The observed changes in zzso shape accelerate zzso damage due to an increase in zzso strains induced by an increase in zzso reversal during operation, rather than an increase in tension during zzso
