In this experimental study, various foreign bodies were inserted into fresh bovine eyes, in different zzso zzso magnetic and zzso foreign bodies, dimensions of which varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso to zzso zzso 6 zzso 7 zzso were tried to detect by zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso In addition, further zzso were applied to check the zzso damage attributable to movement of the foreign zzso zzso foreign bodies have been shown to move in the eye and the risk of zzso forces being applied to the zzso foreign body seemed to cause zzso complications during zzso zzso All of the foreign bodies that were implanted in bovine eyes were recognized on CT zzso except zzso zzso As a general rule, metallic foreign bodies produced zzso artifacts, but these artifacts did not cause any problem in detecting the zzso of foreign zzso
