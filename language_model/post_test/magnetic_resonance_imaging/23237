To assess the accuracy of zzso of liver iron concentration zzso by zzso using the zzso University zzso zzso 

In the overall study period zzso the zzso in zzso patients was calculated with the zzso model and the results were compared with zzso measured by liver zzso 

The biopsy showed that 107 patients had no overload, 38 moderate overload and 26 high zzso The correlation between zzso and biopsy was zzso zzso correctly classified 105 patients according to the various levels of zzso zzso accuracy was zzso with a tendency to overestimate zzso zzso of patients with no overload were diagnosed as having overload, and zzso of patients with moderate overload were diagnosed as having high zzso The sensitivity of the zzso method for high overload was zzso and the specificity for the absence of overload was zzso zzso values greater than 170 zzso zzso revealed a positive zzso value zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso below 60 zzso zzso had a negative zzso value zzso of zzso for zzso zzso The diagnosis in 44 patients with intermediate values remained zzso 

The assessment of zzso with the zzso method was useful in zzso of the patients to rule out or to diagnose high iron zzso The method has a tendency to overestimate overload, which limits its diagnostic zzso
