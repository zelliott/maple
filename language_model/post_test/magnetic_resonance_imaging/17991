There are two current models of zzso functioning with regard to identification of emotional zzso Classic models propose that the zzso contributes to emotional expression recognition and empathy by zzso the level of threat or distress, and as such, responds greatest to more potent fearful zzso However, recent evidence suggests that the zzso directs attention to relevant object features to zzso the stimulus zzso the eyes of a fearful zzso The present study used zzso to investigate zzso functioning during the perception and identification of emotion in complex visual zzso Participants later rated the images on levels of fear, disgust and zzso These ratings were used to identify stimuli that were zzso zzso and zzso for each zzso A zzso and zzso approach was used to identify the nature of the zzso response to visual zzso zzso activity was associated with higher levels of fear in stimuli and was found to reflect the level of zzso in complex visual zzso In contrast, no activity was observed that would indicate that the zzso was modulated by emotional ambiguity when discriminating between fearful and disgusting visual zzso These results are consistent with models that zzso the zzso in the evaluation and representation of the intensity of fear, and imply that the functional contribution of the zzso to deciphering threat in visual scenes likely extends beyond the search for emotionally salient zzso The results also suggest that using attention to remedy emotion recognition abnormalities in zzso populations with zzso dysfunction may not address all key deficits associated with contributions of the zzso to emotion and zzso
