The hypothesis tested was that, in zzso corpus zzso size would be reduced, particularly in the region responsible for communication between both zzso zzso This is supported by knowledge of: zzso anatomical zzso and functional specialization of zzso within the corpus zzso zzso evidence linking structural and functional deficits of the corpus zzso and left zzso lobe with zzso and zzso that zzso lobe zzso zzso pass through the middle region of the corpus zzso Brain area and corpus zzso areas, zzso and length were measured on zzso zzso scans using a computer outlining zzso zzso from 30 zzso and 44 normal subjects were zzso zzso brain area, corpus zzso area, length and anterior zzso were reduced in the schizophrenic group compared with zzso A significant area difference between zzso and controls was seen in the zzso zzso which communicates between the zzso zzso including the superior zzso zzso In zzso corpus zzso area reduction was not accounted for by brain area shrinkage zzso zzso between the two groups were accounted for by comparisons between males zzso These findings support the hypothesis and the possibility that localized abnormalities of zzso connected brain regions might have secondary effects on their zzso distributed zzso within the corpus zzso
