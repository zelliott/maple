In this study we investigated the functional connectivity in 23 zzso zzso zzso patients with and without memory complaints using resting state zzso in the zzso stage of injury as well as a group of control zzso zzso indicate that zzso patients with memory complaints performed significantly worse than patients without memory complaints on tests assessing memory from the zzso zzso Assessment zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity was observed between the three groups between the default mode network zzso and the zzso of the task positive network zzso zzso functional connectivity was also observed between both the zzso and zzso and zzso associated with the zzso Network zzso Following zzso there is a reduction in zzso networks for both those with and without memory complaints for the zzso but only a reduction in the zzso network in zzso patients with memory complaints for the zzso Furthermore, an increased functional connectivity between the zzso and zzso appears to be associated with reduced performance on memory zzso zzso the results suggest that a disruption in the segregation of the zzso and the zzso at rest may be zzso through both a direct zzso of increased zzso between various zzso of the zzso and zzso and through an indirect zzso that links the zzso and zzso through zzso of the zzso This disruption between networks may cause a zzso impact on memory functioning following zzso supporting the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the context of zzso related memory zzso
