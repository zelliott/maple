To zzso characteristics of benign and zzso liver zzso in dynamic and zzso MR imaging with the zzso MR contrast medium zzso 

All 30 patients were examined on a zzso zzso MR unit zzso 63 SP, zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso density zzso weighted zzso zzso a zzso SE, and a zzso zzso D zzso echo zzso sequence before, during and after the application of zzso Dynamic imaging was performed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flip angle zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 600 zzso zzso revealed benign liver zzso in 8 patients and zzso zzso in 22 zzso 

Dynamic zzso sequence revealed an early loss of signal intensity in normal liver zzso zzso signal intensity loss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by 16 zzso zzso in the zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the first minute after application of zzso In two of 4 cases with zzso a short drop in signal intensity was immediately observed after the application, whereas signal intensity remained unchanged in all other zzso liver zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed an improved detection and zzso of zzso liver zzso versus plain MR zzso 17 liver zzso of a size lower 10 zzso were additionally detected in zzso zzso zzso in 4 zzso 

Dynamic and zzso versus plain MR imaging of primary and secondary liver zzso is markedly improved by the zzso contrast material zzso especially in case of intravenous zzso application of this zzso contrast zzso
