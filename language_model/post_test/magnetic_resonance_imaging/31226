Four rare cases of central nervous system solitary zzso tumors zzso are zzso This tumor has not previously been reported in children or in deep cortical zzso Three of these tumors occurred in the zzso zzso Only four cases in the zzso zzso have been described zzso Nine years after its zzso from the zzso zzso one tumor zzso to the spine, zzso and zzso Only one such aggressive zzso has been described zzso 

A 7-year-old child had had 1 year of zzso weakness at zzso zzso resonance imaging scans revealed a left zzso zzso zzso A zzso woman and a 30-year-old man presented after experiencing headaches for zzso zzso resonance imaging scans in these patients revealed a tumor in the fourth zzso and right jugular zzso zzso A 55-year-old man had zzso liver, and lung dissemination of a previous zzso zzso tumor at zzso 

All four patients underwent zzso for zzso or zzso removal of the zzso zzso observations noted solid zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso in all four zzso 

zzso are rare central nervous system, typically zzso zzso They frequently are overlooked in the differential diagnosis of solid central nervous system zzso Our findings suggest that these tumors can occur at any age and in most locations, regardless of proximity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the cells of origin are not zzso but rather the zzso of the cerebral zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging was notable for areas of zzso and of zzso best described as zzso or a zzso appearance in all zzso Delayed zzso zzso may be zzso
