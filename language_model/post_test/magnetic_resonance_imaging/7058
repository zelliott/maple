Small cell zzso zzso is a zzso with zzso deceptively bland zzso that often is zzso as zzso zzso 

To zzso its zzso and genetic features, the authors studied 71 adult patients zzso age, 57 zzso including 22 patients who were identified from a set of 229 zzso zzso that had been characterized previously by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also were analyzed by zzso in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso copy zzso 

zzso 37% of tumors that were not selected for grade showed minimal to no zzso Similarly, zzso of tumors had no zzso zzso or necrosis zzso qualifying only as zzso zzso zzso zzso using World Health Organization zzso Nevertheless, such tumors progressed zzso with mortality rates that were indistinguishable from their Grade IV zzso The median survival for 37 patients who were followed until death was 11 zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso although zzso zzso spaces were zzso No small cell zzso had zzso zzso whereas zzso amplification and zzso deletions were present in zzso and zzso of small cell zzso zzso The tumors expressed zzso and zzso more commonly than zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Small cell zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso that behaved like primary zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso Despite considerable zzso overlap with zzso zzso zzso and genetic features were zzso Fifty percent of small cell zzso expressed the zzso activated zzso zzso form of zzso and molecular testing for zzso deletion improved the diagnostic sensitivity over zzso zzso
