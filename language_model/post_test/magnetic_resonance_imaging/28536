To confirm the structure of the fiber connection between zzso ligament and the superior wall of the orbit, ten orbits from five Japanese zzso were examined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso signal at the fiber zzso zzso fat was prominent and the fibers originating from zzso ligament were fused at the lower face of the capsule of the zzso fat in four zzso zzso originating from the upper face of the fat were attached to the superior zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso The fifth zzso had very little zzso fat and few zzso These zzso differences may be within the normal range of zzso The fibers may support zzso ligament and may help to retract zzso fat during zzso muscle contraction as the eye zzso
