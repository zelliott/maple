To estimate the frequency and clinical zzso of contact and zzso of the zzso zzso nerve by the zzso carotid artery in zzso zzso 

In a retrospective study, we identified zzso patients who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging with sequences that could be used to evaluate the relation between the zzso zzso nerve and the carotid zzso These patients underwent zzso evaluations for reasons unrelated to loss of vision, zzso zzso or carotid artery zzso The relation between the zzso nerve and carotid artery was graded in a standardized zzso The effect of a number of clinical zzso on the risk of zzso was evaluated using multiple zzso zzso 

The zzso of some of the zzso relationships included contact of one or both zzso nerves in 70 zzso of 100 zzso bilateral zzso in 12 zzso of 100 zzso and unilateral zzso with no zzso contact or zzso on the opposite side in five zzso of 100 zzso The estimated odds of zzso were significantly increased as the diameter of the carotid artery zzso 

Among zzso patients, zzso carotid artery contact with the zzso zzso nerve occurs zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, especially when zzso occurs zzso The risk of zzso zzso of the zzso nerve is directly zzso to the diameter of the carotid zzso
