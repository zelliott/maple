The 2 major zzso cortical regions in the human brain, zzso area and zzso area, are connected via the fibers of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we compared this zzso in adults and children and its relation to language processing during zzso zzso of fiber properties demonstrated lower zzso in children's zzso arguing for an immature status of this particular zzso with conceivably a lower degree of zzso Combined diffusion zzso imaging zzso data and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data indicated that in adults the termination of the zzso fiber projection is compatible with functional zzso in zzso area, that is zzso zzso In children, zzso in zzso area extended from the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso revealing an alternative connection to the zzso lobe zzso zzso via the zzso projecting extreme capsule fiber zzso zzso and zzso data zzso to indicate that adults make use of a more confined language network than children based on ongoing maturation of the structural zzso Our data suggest relations between language development and brain maturation and, moreover, indicate the zzso plasticity to adjust its function to available structural zzso
