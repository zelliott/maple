The brain is frequently confronted with sensory information that elicits conflicting response zzso While much research has addressed the top down control mechanisms associated with detection and resolution of response competition, the effects of response competition on sensory processing in the primary visual zzso remain zzso To address this question we modified a typical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso so that the effects of response competition on human early zzso visual zzso could be zzso Healthy human participants were scanned using zzso while making a zzso choice response that classified a target object image into one of two categories zzso zzso zzso An irrelevant zzso image that was either zzso zzso image as zzso zzso zzso from opposite category as zzso or neutral zzso from zzso category, zzso household zzso was also present on each trial, but in a different zzso of the visual field relative to the zzso zzso zzso areas responding to the target stimuli showed increased response to targets in the presence of zzso zzso to zzso zzso A negative correlation with behavioral response competition effects indicated that an increased primary visual cortical response to targets in the zzso zzso zzso trials is associated with a reduced response competition effect on zzso These results suggest a novel conflict resolution mechanism in the primary visual zzso
