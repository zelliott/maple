zzso E zzso zzso zzso has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease morbidity or zzso This appears to be zzso by an zzso increase in cardiovascular zzso Given the similarities between risk factors for heart disease and risk factors for stroke, a positive association between zzso and stroke would be zzso Since age-related brain zzso and the extent of white matter zzso zzso share similar risk factors, we examined the combined effect of zzso and history of vascular disease on brain volume, zzso and zzso evidence of zzso 

zzso were the surviving members of the National Heart, zzso and Blood Institute Twin zzso This is a zzso study of the effects of cardiovascular disease risk factors in zzso male zzso The fourth and final examination of this cohort included cerebral zzso and was completed in zzso zzso E zzso zzso quantitative measures of brain volume, zzso and the presence of stroke on zzso were obtained from the zzso participants in the final zzso The presence or absence of a history of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral zzso disease, and zzso zzso were determined for each zzso 

Of the zzso men, 88 zzso had at least 1 zzso zzso zzso was not associated with differences in age or zzso While the prevalence of vascular disease was generally greater in the zzso group, this was only significant for coronary heart disease zzso in subjects without zzso versus zzso in subject with zzso zzso zzso subjects had significantly smaller brain volumes zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence of stroke was detected in 88 zzso of the zzso The distribution of zzso zzso was marginally different between subjects with zzso stroke compared with those zzso Further analysis revealed that the zzso of cerebrovascular disease and zzso was associated with significantly greater brain zzso and zzso than either zzso or cerebrovascular disease zzso Similar relations were seen for coronary heart disease and peripheral zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso enhances the extent of brain abnormalities in the presence of various vascular zzso We speculate that this effect may be zzso by an increased zzso to brain injury or impaired repair mechanisms associated with zzso
