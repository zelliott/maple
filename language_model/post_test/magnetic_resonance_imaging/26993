The purpose of this article is to compare in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cartilage specimens using zzso zzso spiral and zzso zzso prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso snapshot zzso zzso 

Six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 each) and 10 zzso sliced zzso specimens from five zzso donors were scanned at 3 zzso zzso images were acquired using zzso spiral and zzso zzso prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso snapshot zzso zzso of interest were analyzed to measure zzso values centrally within zzso to evaluate effects of pulse sequence and zzso zzso In zzso zzso regions of interest were analyzed to measure zzso values with respect to zzso location (the zzso and lateral zzso and the median zzso in deep and superficial halves of the zzso as well as location that exhibited magic angle effect in zzso zzso images, to evaluate the effects of pulse zzso zzso location, and magic zzso 

In zzso zzso values were similar zzso zzso zzso between sequences but decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso as zzso concentration increased from zzso to zzso In cartilage zzso zzso values were also similar between sequences zzso zzso zzso but were significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in the superficial layer zzso zzso compared with the deep layer zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of human zzso cartilage specimens and zzso zzso using zzso spiral and zzso zzso prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso snapshot sequences gave similar zzso Lower zzso values for zzso with higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are higher in deeper layers of cartilage than in superficial layers suggest that our method is sensitive to concentration of zzso in zzso zzso
