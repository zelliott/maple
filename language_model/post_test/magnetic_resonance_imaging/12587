It is well established that zzso zzso in the zzso provide automatic control of breathing for zzso zzso and zzso During waking spontaneous breathing, cognitive and emotional demands can zzso the intrinsic zzso respiratory zzso However the neural zzso zzso this zzso is zzso Studies of zzso influences on the control of breathing have implicated zzso circuitry, but these studies have been limited to either invasive surgical zzso methods or zzso during substantial respiratory zzso Here we zzso the zzso zzso for zzso neural activity during zzso spontaneous breathing at rest as well as during a challenging cognitive task zzso random number zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with simultaneous zzso monitoring zzso rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume, zzso zzso was acquired in 14 healthy subjects during each zzso The cognitive task produced expected increases in breathing rate, while zzso zzso and heart rate did not significantly differ between zzso The respiratory cycle served as the input function for zzso zzso zzso zzso image analyses in zzso Main effects analyses zzso zzso demonstrated the first evidence of coordinated neural activity associated with spontaneous breathing within the zzso zzso zzso amygdala, anterior zzso and anterior insular zzso zzso paired zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso within this network localized to the zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that the identified zzso zzso plays a significant role in cognitive and emotional zzso of spontaneous zzso
