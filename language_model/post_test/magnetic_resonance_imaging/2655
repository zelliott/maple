In this study we evaluated and compared the zzso zzso in detecting enhancing zzso in patients with zzso after injection of a standard dose zzso and a triple dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso were obtained in 15 patients, consisting of zzso images 5 to 7 zzso after the injection of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and, after an zzso of 6 to 24 zzso 5 to 7 zzso after the injection of the TD zzso zzso An additional scan 1 h after the TD injection zzso zzso was obtained in 11 zzso The scans were independently evaluated in a random order by four zzso zzso were counted and scored according to size and zzso The level of zzso observer zzso was very high for reporting the total numbers of enhancing zzso their sizes and sites for the three experimental zzso No significant differences were found in zzso zzso in reporting the total number of enhancing zzso and their location in different brain sites in the three zzso Our data indicate that the gain in sensitivity in detecting enhancing zzso in zzso with the TD is not zzso by a loss in zzso This is important in planning clinical trials in which the number of enhancing zzso is used as a measure of zzso
