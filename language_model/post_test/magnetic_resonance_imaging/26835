zzso processing depends on zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso both known to be disturbed in zzso disorder zzso Some investigations suggested zzso in zzso processing zzso and zzso in childhood and adult zzso 

In the present study we investigated zzso function zzso zzso of 29 adult patients with zzso (17 combined, 11 zzso and 1 zzso zzso and 29 controls matched for sex, zzso age, intelligence, and zzso Additionally, we measured zzso zzso and zzso cortical activity during zzso zzso This was performed with functional zzso zzso zzso during presentation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in two zzso zzso 

Adult patients with zzso and controls did not differ in sensitivity for and discrimination and identification of zzso zzso zzso brain imaging measures with zzso generally revealed diminished zzso in zzso brain regions in patients with zzso Only for a high concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients were similar to controls zzso increase in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in active brain regions positively correlated with zzso symptoms during childhood and trait zzso These effects were carried for the zzso with combined zzso 

Although we could not replicate altered clinical performance in zzso our zzso findings suggest an association of cortical zzso processing with zzso and zzso in adult zzso
