We investigated the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings and duration of symptoms in patients with transient osteoporosis of the hip zzso 

The study included nine patients (7 men, 2 zzso mean age 45 years; range 31 to 54 zzso with zzso whose symptoms disappeared after conservative zzso zzso scans of the patients were zzso and independently reviewed twice by two zzso to assess the presence of a zzso zzso fracture line, to calculate the area of zzso zzso and to zzso the extent of bone zzso zzso into four groups as A, B, C, and zzso zzso of symptoms before and after zzso was recorded and associations between symptom duration and zzso findings were zzso 

The zzso and zzso correlation zzso showed an excellent agreement for both zzso A zzso fracture was detected in seven zzso of whom, bone zzso zzso corresponded to group B, C, and D in 2, 2, and 3 patients, and the mean fracture areas were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mean symptom duration in these patients before zzso was zzso months zzso 1 to 4 zzso and relief of symptoms after zzso took 4, 5, and zzso months in groups B, C, and D, zzso In the presence of a similar extent of bone zzso zzso the occurrence of zzso fracture and increase in the fracture area were associated with delayed relief of zzso zzso fracture area was also correlated with the extent of bone zzso zzso Two patients without a zzso fracture had bone zzso zzso of group A and D, and the symptoms disappeared in one month and three months following zzso zzso 

Our results show that the extent of involvement of the zzso zzso may vary in zzso and that time to clinical improvement may be closely related to the presence and size of zzso zzso and the extent of bone zzso zzso
