We describe a very rare case of mature zzso zzso zzso in an adult who presented with zzso findings consistent with a zzso zzso A zzso zzso scan showed a zzso mass in the zzso magna with zzso and a zzso tract in the zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed a zzso to zzso mass without contrast zzso The zzso picture showed a zzso zzso and a zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso examination showed a tumor with components of all the three germ zzso zzso a diagnosis of mature zzso was zzso The zzso differentiation between zzso and zzso zzso is very valuable for ruling out the presence of zzso or zzso components that would require further zzso zzso Thus, we here present a rare case of zzso zzso zzso mimicking zzso zzso and emphasize the importance of zzso differentiation between these zzso
