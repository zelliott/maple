zzso zzso technique has been used for the measurement of the water content distribution in zzso of zzso zzso rats and zzso zzso rats, as well as for the study of water and zzso transport in rat zzso The water content in the lens zzso is significantly higher than in the zzso the spatial zzso of the water content becomes steeper with zzso No difference in the water content distribution has been found between zzso and zzso rat zzso of matching ages, although cataract onset in the zzso rat lens occurs much earlier due to the enhanced generation of zzso oxygen species associated with zzso zzso This finding implies that cataract development does not lead to significant changes in water content distribution inside the zzso The water transport in rat zzso slows down with age, and in zzso zzso it is somewhat faster than in zzso of zzso rats, probably due to the zzso response to zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso for the monitoring of zzso penetration into a lens has been performed for the first zzso It is found that zzso transport in a lens is significantly slower than that of zzso
