zzso a core feature of panic disorder, is linked to function of the zzso Volume zzso in the brain of patients with panic disorder have previously been reported, but there has been no report of zzso volume association with zzso 

Volumes of zzso and zzso were manually measured using magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 27 patients with panic disorder and 30 healthy comparison zzso In addition the zzso was focused on, applying small volume correction to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso Personality zzso zzso were also used to evaluate zzso 

zzso volumes in both zzso were significantly smaller in patients with panic disorder compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 55, P zzso zzso right: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 55, P zzso zzso zzso showed that structural zzso in the panic disorder group occurred on the zzso nuclear group within the right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Z score zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The state anxiety was zzso correlated with the left zzso volume in patients with panic disorder zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These findings suggested that the smaller volume of the zzso may be associated with anxiety in panic zzso Of note, the smaller zzso in the zzso estimated on zzso could zzso to the zzso nuclear group including the central nucleus, which may play a crucial role in panic zzso
