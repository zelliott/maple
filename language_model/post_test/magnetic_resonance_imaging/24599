Although brain zzso levels are typically low and difficult to measure, a few previous investigators have reported that brain zzso levels are elevated in patients with bipolar zzso The present study investigated the distribution of zzso in bipolar and healthy brains using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging on a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the concentration of zzso to zzso and of zzso to total zzso were significantly higher in bipolar than in healthy zzso zzso signals were primarily localized to the bipolar subjects' zzso and anterior zzso zzso components of the zzso circuit, suggesting that affective zzso may be related to zzso abnormalities in this zzso
