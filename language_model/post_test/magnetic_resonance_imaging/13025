To compare initial brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso characteristics of children and adults at multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of features of first brain zzso available at zzso onset in patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

A pediatric and an adult zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated initial and second (when zzso brain zzso scans obtained at the time of first zzso symptoms for zzso that were zzso zzso and well zzso large zzso or zzso or zzso 

We identified 41 patients with zzso zzso and 35 patients with zzso zzso Children had a higher number of total zzso zzso 21 vs 6; P zzso zzso and large zzso areas zzso 4 vs zzso P zzso zzso than zzso Children more frequently had zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and enhancing zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso than zzso On the second brain zzso children had more new zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso Except for corpus zzso involvement, zzso was not strongly associated with disease burden or zzso location on the first zzso although other associations cannot be excluded because of the zzso of the confidence zzso 

While it is unknown whether the higher disease burden, zzso zzso involvement, and rate of new zzso in zzso zzso are explained by age alone, these characteristics have been associated with worse disability progression in zzso
