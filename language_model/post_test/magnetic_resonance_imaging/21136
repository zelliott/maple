Because of the zzso symptoms and zzso zzso findings, zzso zzso zzso fractures zzso have a high rate of missed diagnosis, and the treatment of these fractures has rarely been discussed in the zzso We investigated diagnostic key factors of such zzso zzso and evaluated the effects of cement zzso in these zzso 

A total of 225 patients with zzso treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso zzso All patients have taken preoperatively magnetic resonance imaging zzso including zzso images and short zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso and 45 patients met the inclusion zzso Clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing visual analog scale zzso and zzso disability index zzso values zzso zzso and at the final zzso 

zzso zzso and STIR zzso showed bone zzso zzso in all fresh fractures including zzso zzso and zzso zzso five patients showed no zzso signal in their zzso sequences of zzso zzso While 40 patients underwent zzso and five patients underwent zzso We did not find delayed collapsed fractures in the zzso zzso zzso in both groups after zzso Both groups had significant improvement in pain and functional activity after the intervention zzso 

The presence of previous or zzso zzso leads to further imaging examination, which helps identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso examination especially zzso and STIR sequences plays a vital role in the early diagnosis of zzso zzso Except for significant pain relief and functional improvement, VP and zzso can effectively prevent delayed zzso collapse of zzso zzso comparing to previous reported zzso
