The zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso changes in cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso has been achieved through zzso zzso increases in cerebral blood flow zzso zzso zzso has been traditionally implemented through zzso in the fixed inspired fractional zzso of carbon dioxide zzso without otherwise controlling zzso partial pressures of carbon dioxide zzso or oxygen zzso There are several shortcomings to the use of this manual HC method that may be improved by using precise targeting of zzso while maintaining zzso Similarly, precise control of blood gases can be used to induce zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso zzso zzso and thus increase zzso signals, without appreciably altering zzso or zzso The aim of our study was to use precise zzso targeting to compare the zzso of zzso signals under an zzso zzso protocol zzso zzso in zzso to zzso 240 and 340 zzso zzso from zzso to that of an zzso zzso protocol zzso zzso in zzso of 3, 5, 7 and 9 zzso zzso from zzso Nine healthy volunteers were zzso at zzso while monitoring zzso gas zzso and simultaneously measuring zzso and zzso signals, via zzso spin labeling zzso during graded zzso and zzso alternating with zzso states in a blocked experimental zzso The zzso of the zzso constant obtained under zzso zzso was zzso that of the zzso one zzso In addition, zzso with precise gas targeting zzso and zzso were less than those reported in studies using traditional zzso and zzso methods zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that precise controlled gas delivery markedly improves zzso for zzso studies of oxygen metabolism with both the zzso and the more precise zzso
