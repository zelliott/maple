The present review has been compiled to highlight the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and MR zzso zzso for the investigation of cerebral zzso in the animal experimental field of basic zzso We have focused on stroke investigations analyzing the zzso of the disease evolution and on new advances in both nuclear MR zzso methodology or genetic engineering of transgenic animals for the study of complex molecular relationships and causes of the zzso Furthermore, we have tried to include zzso and genetic aspects, as well as the application of functional imaging, for the investigation of the zzso or zzso of functional brain zzso under pathological conditions as relates to controlled animal zzso
