zzso causes pain, zzso and zzso deficits, and is zzso more prevalent in patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso than in the general zzso For the last century, descriptions of zzso zzso have been primarily limited to case zzso In contrast, zzso cohort studies have revealed that zzso occurring in the idiopathic zzso diseases zzso multiple sclerosis versus zzso zzso represents distinct zzso This study was undertaken to determine whether zzso zzso similarly encapsulates distinct zzso 

We analyzed a cohort of 22 patients with zzso and zzso Patients were assessed for zzso variables related to zzso and for clinical and zzso features of zzso zzso resonance images of the spine, zzso fluid profiles, and zzso profiles were zzso 

Eleven patients presented with signs of gray matter dysfunction zzso zzso and zzso whereas 11 patients presented with signs of white matter dysfunction zzso zzso and zzso Patients with gray matter dysfunction were more likely to have irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso despite presenting with a zzso versus zzso course zzso zzso zzso higher levels of zzso activity zzso zzso Disease zzso Index zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and a zzso fluid profile indistinguishable from bacterial zzso Prior to irreversible zzso these patients presented with zzso of fever and urinary zzso but were zzso by physicians of different specialties as having urinary tract zzso Patients with white matter dysfunction were more likely to meet criteria for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were also more likely to have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso zzso encapsulates 2 distinct and previously zzso syndromes that can be distinguished clinically by gray matter versus white matter zzso zzso of fever and urinary retention as zzso of irreversible zzso may allow earlier diagnosis and treatment in zzso patients presenting with gray matter zzso
