To investigate the relationship between zzso differences in the circle of Willis and the presence and location of white matter zzso zzso 

Two hundred zzso consecutive patients with clinical manifestations of zzso disease underwent zzso of the brain and MR zzso of the circle of zzso 

zzso with a fetal zzso of the circle of Willis demonstrated a decreased load of small zzso zzso zzso and medium zzso zzso zzso deep zzso compared with subjects with a zzso zzso of the zzso part of the circle of zzso 

A fetal zzso of the zzso part of the circle of Willis may be an important protecting zzso in the zzso of white matter zzso
