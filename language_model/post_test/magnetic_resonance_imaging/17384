The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso should be considered different entities, the latter being part of the zzso Their zzso and dimensions correlate to some extent with those of the contained zzso zzso and have, for this reason, attracted the interest of zzso and zzso With the application of zzso however, these data are of limited use in the diagnosis of zzso disorders, although they remain valuable with regard to a zzso approach to the zzso The proposed zzso method was applied to 20 dry zzso We first made casts of the corresponding zzso Their volumes were then measured by zzso The frontal section of each zzso zzso was obtained through its deepest point and zzso The Cartesian zzso of the zzso of the section were used to evaluate the corresponding area and zzso The volume of each zzso was finally obtained by the use of zzso zzso applied to zzso of zzso The volumes of the zzso obtained as above ranged from 460 zzso to zzso zzso with a mean value of zzso zzso These figures are comparable to those reported from previous zzso To our knowledge the method described has enabled a close approximation of the volumes of the zzso zzso to be made for the first zzso These volumes ranged from 24 zzso to 300 zzso with a mean value of 157 zzso Similar zzso methods might be zzso in zzso by the use of MR zzso
