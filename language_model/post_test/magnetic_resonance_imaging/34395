After more than a decade of investigation, the chemical nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso zzso into the source of this high signal have included relaxation of water by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that if the zzso zzso observed in this structure were caused by zzso zzso this interaction could be modulated by the use of zzso transfer zzso zzso 

Twenty-five normal subjects were recruited over a 2 month period who were identified on routine zzso zzso head images to have zzso bright spots with zzso area of zzso 2 zzso Thin section (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained both with and without the use of an zzso suppression pulse zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were made of the zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso of corpus zzso and zzso with zzso ratios zzso calculated for each zzso 

Relatively low (and zzso zzso were observed in both parts of the zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso test analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the zzso of the anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of signal was noted in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of both portions of the zzso differed significantly from those of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The high signal of the zzso zzso zzso suppresses only slightly on zzso images, having a behavior similar to that in the anterior lobe but significantly different from the rest of the zzso These findings suggest that direct zzso zzso or zzso interactions are not likely to be responsible for the appearance of the bright zzso The experimental results are more consistent with water interacting with a zzso substance or low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso
