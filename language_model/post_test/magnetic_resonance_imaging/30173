The objectives of this study were to describe the zzso and tissue distribution of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso stabilized with zzso zzso and investigate its potential in detecting liver zzso as a newly developed magnetic resonance zzso contrast zzso zzso and tissue distribution of zzso were investigated in zzso zzso The results showed that zzso was eliminated rapidly from serum with the zzso of zzso h at zzso zzso zzso and accumulated zzso in liver and zzso with a total percentage of more than zzso of dose after intravenous zzso The studies of zzso and distribution of zzso in rats indicated the MR contrast agent, based on zzso mainly accumulating in targeting zzso that contain zzso cells, zzso liver and zzso The zzso in detecting zzso zzso zzso of rat with primary liver cancer and zzso liver zzso of rabbit were investigated before and after injection of zzso The signal intensity of liver zzso in rabbit with zzso tumor after injection of zzso was reduced sharply resulting in a significant contrast between liver zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso in rat model was also zzso The present study provides evidence that zzso might have the ability to improve the detection of liver tumors as an MR contrast agent, and the efficacy is associated with the zzso specifically located in zzso cells in zzso zzso
