The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso of zzso iron overload in children after bone zzso transplantation by reviewing their magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

We reviewed the abdominal MR studies of 13 children after zzso bone zzso zzso Nine of the children had also undergone MR prior to zzso Iron deposition in the liver, zzso and bone zzso was graded zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and number of blood units given after bone zzso transplantation were zzso 

None of the zzso MR studies revealed iron zzso After bone zzso zzso three children showed normal liver and zzso Iron overload in the liver was noted in ten patients zzso zzso six of whom also showed iron overload in the zzso zzso zzso and five in the bone zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso iron overload was correlated significantly and zzso iron overload was correlated zzso with the number of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), but neither was correlated with the serum zzso zzso 

Iron overload commonly accompanies bone zzso zzso The observed pattern of iron deposition, in which the zzso was zzso in 40 % of patients demonstrating iron overload, is not typical of zzso zzso
