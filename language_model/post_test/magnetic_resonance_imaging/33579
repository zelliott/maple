MR imaging using the conventional spin each technique along with diffusion weighted imaging and zzso imaging was performed in 16 patients with zzso lateral sclerosis zzso 20 normal subjects, and 113 controls with other neurological zzso zzso weighted images in the patients with ALS and the controls disclosed a high signal band from the zzso area to the zzso zzso The high signal band on the diffusion weighted images corresponded to the zzso tract in the anatomical zzso described by zzso The zzso and zzso times, zzso density, diffusion zzso and diffusion zzso were measured at the points where high signal bands appeared on the diffusion weighted zzso The zzso images revealed high signal areas on the zzso limbs of the internal capsules in all the patients with zzso zzso of the normal subjects, and zzso of the disease zzso The zzso images disclosed high signal areas on the zzso limbs in zzso of the patients with zzso but not in any of the normal subjects and the disease zzso The zzso weighted images disclosed high signal areas on the zzso limbs in all the patients with ALS and zzso of the disease controls, but not in any of the normal zzso Analysis of diffusion weighted images revealed no significant difference between the patients with ALS and the normal subjects in diffusion zzso and diffusion zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of MR parameters zzso and zzso times and zzso zzso showed that the zzso density at the zzso limbs increased in zzso zzso images using the method of Dixon revealed abnormal signals in the water zzso These signal abnormalities were more prominent in the internal capsule than in the zzso zzso Our findings confirm that there is an increase in water molecules that have normal diffusion zzso and diffusion zzso values in patients with zzso
