The authors report findings in a 9-month-old male infant with zzso brain tissue in the orbit, and compare and contrast the characteristics in this patient with the few other descriptions of such zzso in the zzso 

zzso biopsy of the growth was undertaken by means of an anterior zzso 

A 9-month-old male infant had a history of zzso left zzso and a slowly growing mass in the left zzso An zzso scan revealed an zzso mass with solid and zzso zzso zzso study of the excised tissue was performed and revealed a zzso arrangement of zzso brain tissue with zzso primitive zzso including pigmented zzso There was no connection between the orbit and zzso zzso 

The mass must be considered a rare example of zzso brain tissue in the orbit and is the only instance we could find in the literature in which a formed eye was absent but in which a scattered primitive zzso structure could be zzso
