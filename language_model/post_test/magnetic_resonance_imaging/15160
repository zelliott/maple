The concept of plasticity describes the mechanisms that rearrange cerebral organization following a brain zzso During the last century, plasticity has been mainly investigated in humans with acute zzso It was then zzso zzso that the brain is organized into highly specialized functional areas, often designated zzso areas and zzso that a zzso within the eloquent area gives rise to major zzso zzso However, in sharp contrast with these zzso it was recently found that patients with zzso zzso were able to undergo massive cerebral zzso without zzso functional zzso In this paper, we tackle this puzzling observation and address the idea that brain plasticity cannot be fully understood and fruitfully studied without considering the zzso pattern of the injury inflicted to the zzso To achieve this goal, we first review experimental evidence showing that functional recovery is considerably better in the context of zzso injuries than after acute zzso Both human and animal data are zzso In a second step, we emphasize that slow and acute zzso involve very different patterns of zzso In agreement with this idea, we show that the recruitment of remote brain areas in the zzso and zzso zzso is much more efficient in slow growing than acute zzso Finally in a last section, we briefly discuss the main implications of these zzso
