zzso vulnerability to zzso has emerged as a critical correlate to risk of adverse coronary events but there is as yet no clinical method to assess plaque stability in zzso In the search to identify zzso of vulnerable plaques an association has been found between zzso and plaque zzso density and pattern of zzso zzso in zzso is indicative of probability to zzso In very unstable zzso zzso are found in high zzso and concentrated in the plaque zzso zzso the ability to map zzso in plaques could allow zzso assessment of plaque zzso We use a zzso imaging approach to zzso map the distribution of zzso in zzso The use of multiple zzso allows us to combine the complementary strengths of each zzso to better zzso features of zzso Our combined use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Imaging zzso allows high sensitivity PET screening to identify putative zzso in a whole body view, and high resolution zzso for detailed mapping of zzso expression in the zzso 

zzso and zzso contrast agents targeted to zzso were developed and tested in three different mouse and rat models of zzso in which inflamed vascular plaques form spontaneously and/or are induced by zzso For zzso zzso the zzso were designed to contain zzso zzso zzso or iron oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso PET imaging was zzso to identify regions of zzso zzso these regions were further zzso by zzso to zzso zzso distribution at high zzso In both PET and MR images the zzso enhanced contrast at sites of vascular zzso but not in normal vessel zzso zzso was able to identify discrete sites of inflammation that were blurred together at the low resolution of zzso zzso content in the zzso was confirmed by zzso 

The zzso imaging approach allowed zzso and high-resolution mapping of zzso distribution and may lead to a clinical method to predict plaque probability to zzso
