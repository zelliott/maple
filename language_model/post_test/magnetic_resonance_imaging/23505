in this prospective study, we evaluated mutual relationships amongst zzso zzso zzso zzso and neurological deterioration in patients with their first acute zzso zzso 

based on zzso image findings, we recruited 206 patients with their first acute zzso zzso Those without a zzso scan were zzso Small (a maximum zzso diameter of 15 zzso areas of zzso gray and white matter with increased signals were considered as zzso zzso zzso images were obtained within 24 h of the onset of stroke zzso zzso blood was sampled at base line zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso neurological scales and free, active zzso levels were compared between patients with and without zzso Neurological deterioration was defined as an increase in more than two points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso baseline 14 days after the onset of zzso zzso 

of the patients, 79 zzso had zzso and 48 zzso showed neurological zzso Free, active zzso and zzso protein zzso levels were significantly increased amongst patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased free, active zzso zzso zzso zzso per 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified as independent risk factors for neurological deterioration after adjusting for potential zzso 

zzso levels of active zzso and the existence of zzso might be useful in predicting the deterioration following an initial acute zzso zzso
