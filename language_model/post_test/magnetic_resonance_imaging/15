zzso spectrum disorder zzso is a frequent zzso disorder characterized by variable clinical zzso Core symptoms are zzso impaired communication and social behavior, highly restricted interests and repetitive zzso Although recent work on genetic zzso in zzso has shed light on the zzso of the disease, zzso it essentially as a zzso no treatments are available to zzso To develop and test novel zzso treatment approaches, validated and zzso animal models are zzso Of particular interest, in this context are zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso protein zzso and point zzso in its zzso zzso zzso that were found to cause certain forms of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here, we show that zzso mice display a behavioral zzso reminiscent of the lead symptoms of zzso reduced ultrasound zzso and a lack of social novelty zzso The latter may be related to an zzso zzso observed in the zzso zzso Interestingly, such zzso zzso is also present in a zzso of human zzso zzso Tests for learning and memory showed no gross abnormalities in zzso zzso Also, no zzso were found in time spent in social interaction, zzso zzso seizure propensity and zzso zzso As often seen in adult zzso patients, total brain volume of zzso zzso mice was slightly reduced as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Our findings show that the zzso knockout mouse represents a useful animal model for understanding zzso events in zzso zzso zzso and for developing novel treatment strategies in this devastating human zzso
