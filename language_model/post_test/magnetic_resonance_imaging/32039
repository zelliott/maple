Progress in zzso suggests a need to combine information from zzso and functional imaging in diagnosis and zzso It is not always possible to establish a correct diagnosis using zzso imaging techniques alone, especially in the case of zzso brain zzso It is suggested that the results of different imaging techniques should be combined especially in these zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of fused post zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso images for planning zzso zzso 

19 patients with a zzso diagnosis of zzso brain zzso were zzso zzso was performed after zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and post zzso MR images were obtained on a peripheral console zzso zzso using a self developed zzso zzso MRS was performed on a zzso T scanner with the single zzso zzso technique using zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso 2000 zzso and zzso TE 136 zzso 2000 zzso zzso 

zzso MRS with a volume of interest positioned in the most metabolically active areas on fused images, gave a more accurate diagnosis of tumor type and grade that was clinically relevant in 3 zzso 

The authors conclude that planning zzso MRS with the use of fused zzso and zzso images improves the zzso
