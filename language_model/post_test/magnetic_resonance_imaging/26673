Cell based zzso are emerging as powerful zzso To better understand the migration and proliferation mechanisms of implanted cells, a means to track cells in living subjects is essential, and to achieve that, a number of cell labeling techniques have been zzso zzso with their superior physical properties, have become the materials of choice in many investigations along this zzso zzso to inherent magnetic, optical or acoustic zzso these zzso can be detected by corresponding imaging zzso in living subjects at a high spatial and zzso zzso These features allow implanted cells to be separated from host zzso and have advantages over traditional zzso methods, as they permit zzso real-time tracking in zzso This review attempts to give a summary of progress in using zzso to monitor cell zzso We will focus on direct cell labeling techniques, in which cells zzso zzso that bear traceable signals, such as iron oxide or quantum zzso zzso and zzso reporter genes that can package zzso iron or iron supplement into iron oxide zzso will also be zzso
