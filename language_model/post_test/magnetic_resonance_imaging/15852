To evaluate the methods of zzso reconstruction in zzso zzso planning for zzso of cervical cancer, and to investigate zzso shifts and changes in zzso parameters during zzso zzso 

For each application MR scans with zzso in zzso were made: three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Spin Echo zzso scans and a balanced Steady State Free zzso scan zzso zzso Three observers tested two zzso reconstruction zzso zzso directly on the zzso scan and zzso on a zzso combination of the three zzso zzso For 10 patients MR imaging was repeated on the second day of each zzso fraction to determine zzso shifts and changes in zzso zzso 

For both zzso reconstruction methods the zzso variation for the zzso parameters was comparable zzso zzso in zzso zzso between the two methods were larger (up to zzso for zzso and were related to position differences during MR zzso The average zzso shift relative to the pelvic structures was 5-6 zzso into the zzso direction and zzso zzso zzso For a single zzso zzso the average zzso zzso on zzso 2' was zzso zzso zzso zzso lower than that for day zzso The average increase in zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for a single zzso zzso If the effect of both zzso was combined, for 1 patient a total decrease of zzso of 7 zzso was found, whereas for another patient the total increase in zzso dose was 12 zzso 

zzso reconstruction on MR data is zzso In the overall accuracy during zzso zzso the reconstruction uncertainty is of minor zzso zzso and/or organ movement during the course of the zzso fraction produce larger zzso
