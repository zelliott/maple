We describe the development and zzso of a new open zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso system, with which zzso procedures can be performed using image zzso Our initial zzso experience consists of 140 cases, including 63 zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso 55 zzso 3 zzso zzso and 3 zzso The surgical advantages derived from this new zzso are zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso system zzso SP, Boston, zzso developed by General Electric Medical Systems in collaboration with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has a vertical gap within its zzso providing the physical space for zzso Images are viewed on monitors located within this gap and can also be acquired in conjunction with optical tracking of surgical instruments, establishing accurate zzso correlations between instrument position and zzso zzso 

A wide range of standard zzso procedures can be performed using zzso zzso The images obtained are clear and provide accurate and immediate information to use in the planning and assessment of the progress of the zzso 

zzso zzso allows zzso to be precisely localized and targeted, and the progress of a procedure can be immediately zzso The constantly updated images help to eliminate errors that can arise during zzso and zzso zzso surgery when zzso structures alter their position because of shifting or displacement of brain zzso but are correlated with images obtained zzso zzso zzso is particularly helpful in determining tumor margins, zzso surgical approaches, achieving complete zzso of zzso zzso and monitoring potential zzso zzso
