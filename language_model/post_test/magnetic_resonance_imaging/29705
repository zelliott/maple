To evaluate the effects of movement on cortical activities evoked by noxious zzso we recorded zzso following noxious zzso laser stimulation applied to the zzso of the left hand in normal zzso zzso of the present study can be summarized as zzso zzso active movement of the hand zzso to the side of noxious stimulation resulted in significant zzso of both primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso to the zzso hand zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to the side of stimulation zzso was not zzso zzso Active movement of the hand zzso to the side of noxious stimulation resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was not zzso zzso zzso movement of the hand zzso to the side of noxious stimulation resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was not zzso zzso Visual analogue scale zzso changes showed a similar pattern to the zzso changes of zzso These results suggest that activities in three regions are modulated by movements zzso zzso in zzso was considered to be mainly due to an interaction in zzso by the signals ascending from the zzso and movement zzso zzso in zzso was considered to be mainly due to particular brain activities relating to motor execution and/or movement execution associated with a specific attention zzso In addition, since zzso changes showed a similar relationship with the zzso changes of zzso zzso may play a role in pain zzso
