A radio frequency zzso and zzso zzso fast low angle shot technique was used to acquire images from the human brain at 8 zzso The resulting zzso images, obtained with a 17 degrees zzso a 70 zzso repetition time, and a 17 zzso echo time, displayed an average zzso ratio zzso of zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso 256 zzso zzso These images were compared with images obtained at zzso zzso using identical parameters yielding a zzso of less than zzso As such, the 8 zzso images display a remarkable improvement in zzso with increasing field zzso The images also show little evidence of zzso zzso chemical shift, or zzso penetration zzso
