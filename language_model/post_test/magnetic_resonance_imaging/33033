To test the zzso and zzso zzso of brain zzso patterns that zzso visually guided zzso and word recognition in normally sighted subjects and patients with zzso zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Ten normally sighted subjects and five patients with zzso zzso were asked to perform two visually guided zzso tasks and two zzso tasks during zzso with behavioral zzso The zzso zzso were repeated three times at intervals of at least 4 weeks between zzso The zzso zzso of the brain zzso patterns was examined in a zzso manner by comparing the zzso of zzso across the zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso Control subjects showed overall higher zzso zzso of brain zzso patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso than that of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for the patients improved when the target location was zzso as in the zzso tasks zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the visually zzso tasks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of brain zzso patterns was zzso high for both the control and patient zzso 

The zzso method can serve as a reliable zzso measure of brain zzso that has potential for measuring zzso changes in brain networks associated with rehabilitation zzso zzso zzso zzso reflected at the level of zzso of the brain among control subjects with similar behavioral performance, suggests individual analysis is necessary when implementing zzso brain zzso zzso
