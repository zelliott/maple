zzso cerebral blood flow and blood volume changes have been associated with zzso zzso the zzso changes in vascular zzso vascular density, and vessel size have not been zzso Here we report a prolonged increase in vascular zzso from day 3 to day 21 after zzso in particular in the zzso outer cortical layers and zzso Increased cerebral blood volume zzso was observed from day 3 to day 14, whereas increased blood volume in small vessels, primarily zzso was noticed from day 7 to day 14 in the zzso zzso An initial decrease in vascular density and a zzso increase in vessel size were observed within the zzso zzso at days 1 and 3 after zzso zzso analysis confirmed a similar decrease in zzso density and an increase in vessel size in vessels with a diameter greater than 30 zzso These zzso vessels exhibited intense basic zzso growth factor and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso suggesting the growth of collateral zzso By contrast, a late increase in vascular density was noticed in the zzso outer zzso at days 14 and 21 after zzso Together, these findings suggest that the early phase of zzso increase is likely because of the improvement in collateral zzso whereas the late phase of zzso increase is attributed to the surge of zzso
