To compare zzso cartilage volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso assessment of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso cartilage volume was compared with the zzso grade of individual features of zzso zzso and joint space narrowing zzso in 252 subjects zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso 10 years, zzso zzso who were participating in studies of knee zzso 

zzso seen on both zzso and lateral zzso of the zzso joint was zzso associated with the respective zzso cartilage zzso This inverse relationship was strengthened with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index zzso and bone zzso After adjustment for these zzso for every increase in zzso grade zzso the zzso zzso cartilage volume was reduced by zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and the lateral zzso cartilage volume by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationship between mean cartilage volume and zzso grade of zzso was zzso Based on results in the zzso of subjects with normal zzso findings, we have proposed a model to estimate average zzso cartilage volume in men and women for a given age, zzso and bone zzso 

The results of this study demonstrate a strong negative, linear association between zzso and lateral zzso cartilage volume and increasing grade of zzso Using data from zzso normal subjects, we have proposed a simple model for zzso zzso cartilage zzso However, larger studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether they are valid in younger zzso
