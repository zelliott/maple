zzso zzso zzso zzso is a brain zzso clinically characterized by the zzso of zzso normal intelligence, and zzso We investigated the zzso relationship between cerebral volumes and cognitive ability in this disorder by studying 12 subjects with zzso and 6 controls using zzso analysis of high-resolution anatomical zzso and zzso zzso Total cerebral volumes and specific brain compartment volumes zzso matter, white matter, and zzso zzso in subjects with zzso were comparable to those in zzso There was a negative correlation between zzso gray matter volume and cortical gray matter zzso zzso and cortical volumes in zzso did not correlate with Full zzso zzso unlike in normal zzso Our findings support the idea that zzso zzso contain misplaced zzso that would normally have migrated to the cortex, and suggest that structural zzso of normal cognitive ability may be different in the setting of zzso migration zzso
