Over the last two decades several studies have suggested the role of zzso zzso of cerebral zzso using rose zzso resulting in small strokes in zzso that resemble those in zzso This paper describes such a zzso method of acute small stroke induction in rats with zzso and in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso observations from 3 to 6 h after zzso which is zzso to a human autopsy zzso zzso 30 zzso of zzso with minimal beam intensity zzso zzso cold white light in conjunction with 20 zzso of intravenous zzso rose zzso as a rapid infusion, small zzso were induced zzso in the frontal zzso of six zzso The zzso showed a consistent pattern on zzso and in zzso MR sections when examined within 7 h or less of zzso Both zzso and zzso sections were comprised of zzso a superior zone of zzso zzso zzso a middle zzso transition zone of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso an inferior zone of normal zzso zzso duration zzso zzso and zzso longer duration zzso signal zzso images both showed a zzso zzso transition zone of zzso The mean zzso and transition zone areas measured from the zzso sections were comparable to those measured on the zzso The zzso model described above allows in zzso observations using zzso with the potential for use in testing putative zzso zzso As demonstrated by a comparison with the zzso features of such zzso in surgical and autopsy brain zzso the model is relevant to acute human zzso zzso
