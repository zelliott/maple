There is still limited knowledge on the location and zzso of transient global zzso zzso MR studies including zzso imaging zzso have been unable to demonstrate consistently the location and underlying pathology of zzso 

To investigate patients with zzso using serial zzso performed from the day of symptom onset through days 1 and zzso 

After reporting negative zzso results in a previous study, the authors used a modified study design to investigate patients with zzso using serial zzso performed from the day of symptom onset through days 1 and zzso 

Of 31 consecutive patients zzso 26 developed a small, zzso zzso zzso in the lateral aspect of the zzso formation zzso and zzso zzso on either side (left, zzso zzso 15; right, zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were rarely noted in the zzso phase zzso zzso zzso but all became visible regularly at 48 zzso 

The study confirms the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso The delayed zzso of the zzso may explain the zzso of previous MR zzso studies in zzso zzso
