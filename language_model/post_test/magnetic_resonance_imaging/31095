Prior series of zzso zzso zzso of adrenal masses before the advent of dedicated CT and zzso of the adrenal zzso have shown that zzso of adrenal masses zzso were zzso zzso requiring no further evaluation or zzso This study was performed to assess the effect of dedicated adrenal imaging with CT and zzso on the rate of zzso zzso zzso of adrenal zzso 

We reviewed 50 consecutive adrenal mass zzso performed during a zzso zzso The patient zzso technique of zzso pathology results, and results of any prior dedicated adrenal imaging with zzso or CT protocols were zzso 

Only six zzso of 50 zzso were zzso Five of these six cases were preceded by dedicated adrenal CT or zzso Thirty-five cases were zzso disease, four were adrenal cortical zzso three were zzso and two zzso were zzso Overall, 20 of 50 cases were preceded by a dedicated adrenal CT or zzso examination to exclude an zzso in 21 of the remaining 30 cases, the imaging characteristics before biopsy were inconsistent with the potential diagnosis of an zzso and dedicated adrenal CT or zzso was not zzso 

The number of adrenal zzso zzso has declined markedly with the introduction of dedicated adrenal CT and zzso for adrenal zzso zzso zzso biopsy is useful in confirming the presence and nature of suspected zzso deposits to the adrenal zzso and in diagnosing or excluding adrenal zzso in patients with zzso imaging zzso
