Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the breast is being used increasingly in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer as a complementary zzso to zzso and zzso Although the potential diagnostic value of kinetic zzso in zzso is established, the method for generating kinetic zzso is not zzso The inherent reason that curve identification is needed is that the zzso of contrast agent in a breast zzso is often heterogeneous, especially in zzso zzso It is accepted that manual region of interest selection in zzso breast magnetic resonance zzso images to generate the kinetic curve is a time-consuming process and suffers from significant zzso and zzso zzso We investigated and developed a fuzzy zzso zzso zzso technique for automatically identifying characteristic kinetic zzso from breast zzso in zzso of the zzso Dynamic zzso MR images were obtained using a zzso zzso zzso zzso echo sequence with zzso dose of zzso zzso and zzso resolution of 69 zzso zzso zzso was applied to automatically partition the zzso zzso in a segmented zzso breast zzso into a number of classes zzso zzso zzso The zzso curve with the highest initial enhancement was selected as the representative characteristic kinetic curve zzso of the zzso Four features were then extracted from each characteristic kinetic curve to depict the maximum contrast enhancement, time to peak, zzso rate, and zzso rate of the zzso zzso The performance of the kinetic features in the task of distinguishing between benign and zzso zzso was assessed by receiver operating characteristic zzso With a database of 121 breast zzso zzso zzso and 44 benign zzso the zzso performance of the zzso zzso was found to be better than that from the zzso obtained by averaging over the entire zzso and similar to kinetic zzso generated from regions drawn within the zzso by a zzso experienced in breast zzso
