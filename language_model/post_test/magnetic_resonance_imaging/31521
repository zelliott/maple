Dynamic zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated high sensitivity for detection of breast zzso Analysis of correlation between quantitative zzso findings and zzso factors (such as zzso zzso zzso is important for defining the role of this technique in the diagnosis of breast cancer as well as the monitoring of zzso zzso This paper presents a practical clinical application of a quantitative zzso model to study zzso confirmed and graded invasive human breast zzso The hypothesis is that, given a documented difference in zzso zzso between benign and zzso breast zzso a relationship between zzso zzso parameters and zzso aggressiveness persists within invasive breast zzso In addition, it was hypothesized that zzso parameters may demonstrate stronger correlation with zzso factors than the more conventional black-box techniques, so a comparison was zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso and black-box parameters in 59 invasive breast zzso However, statistically significant variation with zzso grade was demonstrated in only two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using one-way analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in Grade 3 zzso than in zzso zzso None of the measured zzso parameters varied significantly between Grade 1 and Grade 2 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso might therefore be used to monitor the effectiveness of zzso treatment of high-grade invasive breast zzso but is unlikely to demonstrate zzso in zzso zzso
