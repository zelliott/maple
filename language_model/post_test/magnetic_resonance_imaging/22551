We use a novel balanced experimental design to specifically investigate brain mechanisms underlying the modulating effect of expected pain intensity on zzso zzso processing and pain zzso We used two visual cues, each zzso to one of two noxious zzso stimuli zzso approximately 48 degrees C zzso or 47 degrees C zzso The visual cues were presented just before and during application of the noxious zzso zzso zzso reported significantly higher pain when the noxious stimulus was preceded by the high-intensity visual zzso To control for expectancy effects, for one-half of the runs, the noxious zzso stimuli were accompanied by the cue zzso to the other zzso Comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging blood zzso zzso zzso produced by the high and low zzso stimulus zzso presented with the high-intensity visual cue showed significant zzso in zzso regions of the thalamus, second zzso cortex, and insular zzso To isolate the effect of zzso we compared zzso produced by the two visual cues presented with the high-intensity noxious zzso zzso this showed significant differences in the zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, the head of the zzso zzso and the zzso nucleus zzso zzso We propose that pain intensity expectancy zzso zzso produced by noxious stimuli through a distinct zzso network that zzso with zzso zzso input in the zzso
