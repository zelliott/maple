Small vessel disease zzso is associated with traditional vascular risk factors zzso The aim of our study was to determine whether different zzso types, single zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso with or without white matter zzso zzso have different zzso zzso 

Forty zzso parameters were zzso in 201 consecutive patients with magnetic resonance imaging finding of zzso 

History of zzso hypertension, higher zzso and mean blood pressure zzso but also zzso and higher plasma homocysteine levels were more frequent in zzso compared to single zzso patients zzso Patients with one zzso were younger, more frequently had clinically evident stroke and family history of cardiovascular disease zzso zzso zzso difference between groups was found only in these zzso indicating that similar pathological processes led to both types of zzso 

Positive correlation with age and family history of zzso zzso further analyses of other factors, predominantly zzso as the key to the answer why patients develop different zzso in zzso
