A zzso retrospective zzso zzso 

To establish zzso rates between interpretations of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with degenerative cervical spine zzso 

zzso discrepancies in interpretation of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging question the reliability of comparisons between these two zzso 

This study blindly and randomly evaluated cervical zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging in 20 patients referred for clinically diagnosed cervical zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso facet zzso lateral zzso zzso size, spinal canal, and neural zzso also were evaluated with graded zzso All results were subjected to the zzso statistic for strength of zzso 

zzso for interpretation of the zzso junction occurred in 144 of 240 sites zzso indicating only moderately good zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement on the characterization of facet joint disease was only moderately good zzso of 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and on characterization of lateral recess disease was poor zzso of 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On degree of spinal canal compromise, there was agreement within one grade in 199 of 240 sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement on neural zzso encroachment and zzso size was only moderately good zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to upgrade the spinal canal narrowing and neural zzso zzso 

For most parameters of zzso the degree of zzso between zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging is only moderately good, with discrepancies noted especially in the differentiation of disc and zzso zzso These methods should be viewed as complementary zzso
