zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso was used to investigate airway response in rats following intravenous zzso zzso administration of a zzso agent, zzso zzso The method provides direct zzso of the zzso regions within the zzso zzso zzso following the zzso zzso injection was evident using this zzso These zzso dynamic lung images revealed that the inspired fresh air was zzso to the zzso regions after the zzso challenge in a similar manner as described by zzso relationship for the stability between adjacent zzso The airways in the zzso regions became nearly closed, resulting in air zzso while the airways in the zzso regions remained effectively open, leading to zzso These data suggest a lung model of airway zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso These zzso regions are zzso distributed in the lung and this distribution cannot be deduced from zzso measurement of the whole zzso We demonstrate that a combination of functional zzso images and anatomical zzso images provide an effective method to diagnose regional lung abnormalities in zzso
