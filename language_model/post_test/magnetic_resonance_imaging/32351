zzso interactions in zzso zzso of liquids permit a new tissue contrast in MR imaging zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso Revamped by zzso zzso Echo zzso sequence which simply consists of two zzso zzso of delay zzso and a magnetic field zzso pulse of strength G, is applied to create zzso zzso zzso of zzso ensembles of water zzso with spatial distance d zzso zzso As a consequence, the measured signal originates from zzso that have a zzso zzso zzso was first applied to MR imaging at zzso T by zzso et zzso To study the contrast properties and influence of sequence parameters of this technique, we implemented different sequences of this type on a clinical zzso zzso zzso The sequences were zzso in experiments with zzso gel zzso We obtained images with zzso contrast from the brain of healthy zzso The zzso system enabled correlation distances d in the range of zzso zzso to 1 zzso
