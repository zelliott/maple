zzso in the developing zzso takes place in three dimensions, and in addition, the dimension of time is another important factor in zzso zzso the presentation of sequential zzso changes occurring in the zzso zzso zzso is essential for understanding the complex zzso events and the underlying zzso Until recently, zzso zzso of embryonic structures was possible only by reconstruction from serial zzso zzso which was tedious and zzso During the past two decades, zzso imaging techniques have made significant advances thanks to the progress in imaging and computer technologies, computer graphics, and other related zzso Such novel tools have enabled precise zzso of the zzso zzso of embryonic structures and to demonstrate zzso zzso sequences of zzso Here, we describe a project in which staged human zzso are zzso by the magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso images of zzso and their zzso at each zzso stage were reconstructed based on the MR data, with the aid of computer graphics zzso On the basis of the zzso models of staged human zzso we constructed a data set of zzso images of human zzso and made movies to illustrate the sequential process of human zzso Furthermore, a computer-based zzso program of human zzso is being developed for educational purposes, using the photographs, zzso zzso MR images, and zzso models of staged human zzso
