zzso the zzso habit of nocturnal grinding of the teeth and zzso is associated with the onset of joint zzso Especially prolonged zzso is suggested to cause functional overloading in the zzso joint zzso In this study, the zzso of stresses in the zzso zzso disc and zzso cartilage, were zzso during prolonged zzso The purpose of this study was to examine if joint degradation due to prolonged zzso can be attributed to changes in stress concentration in the zzso zzso 

zzso element model was developed on the basis of magnetic resonance images from a healthy zzso zzso movements recorded during prolonged zzso were used as the loading condition for stress zzso 

At the onset of zzso zzso the highest von zzso stresses were located in the middle and zzso areas zzso of the inferior disc surface facing the zzso zzso The largest magnitude of the minimum principal stress zzso was found in the zzso zzso The stress zzso were relieved towards the superior disc surface facing the zzso zzso On the surfaces of the zzso cartilage, relatively lower stresses were zzso After zzso zzso both stress values induced in the zzso components were reduced to zzso of the stress values at the onset of zzso although the zzso strains increased slightly during this zzso 

It is suggested that both the zzso and zzso cartilage layers along with the zzso disc, play an important role in stress distribution and transmission during prolonged zzso due to tissue zzso Furthermore, our study suggests that a development of stress zzso in the zzso during prolonged zzso and risk factors for the initiation of zzso zzso could not be zzso
