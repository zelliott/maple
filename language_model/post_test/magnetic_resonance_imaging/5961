zzso zzso abuse is associated with zzso to zzso brain regions with deleterious effects on cognitive zzso zzso in behavioral control are thought to be one contributing factor to the zzso of addictive behaviors in MA zzso 

In order to examine patterns of behavioral control relevant to addiction, we employed a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging design to examine zzso reaction time zzso adjustments in 12 zzso subjects and 16 zzso A zzso of the zzso task was employed to contrast the groups on error rates, zzso conflict, and the level of zzso adjustments seen after zzso zzso 

The MA abusers exhibited reduced zzso adjustments and reduced zzso in the right prefrontal zzso compared to controls on conditions that measured the ability to use exposure to conflict situations zzso conflict zzso to regulate zzso The groups did not differ on accuracy rates or zzso zzso conflict zzso 

The observed deficits in zzso zzso adjustments suggest that the ability to adapt a behavioral response based on prior experience may be compromised in MA zzso These failures to modify behavior based on prior events may reflect a deficit that contributes to zzso zzso
