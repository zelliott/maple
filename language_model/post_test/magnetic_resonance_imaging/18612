Many recent zzso studies have highlighted the role of prefrontal regions in the sustained maintenance and manipulation of information over short delays, or working memory zzso In addition, zzso findings have highlighted the role of prefrontal regions in the formation and retrieval of memories for events, or episodic long-term memory zzso but it remains unclear whether these regions are distinct from those that support zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to identify patterns of prefrontal activity associated with zzso and recognition during zzso and zzso tasks performed by the same zzso zzso showed that the same bilateral zzso prefrontal regions (at or near zzso Areas zzso 6, 44, 45, and zzso and zzso prefrontal regions zzso zzso were engaged during zzso and recognition within the context of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a region situated in the left anterior middle frontal zzso zzso zzso was engaged during the recognition zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso These results support the view that the same prefrontal regions implement reflective processes that support both zzso and zzso
