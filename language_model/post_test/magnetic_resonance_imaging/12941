The efficacy of zzso neurosurgery procedures is critically dependent on the accuracy of the device placement zzso The first step in this process involves correctly identifying the target location in three-dimensional brain zzso In some clinical applications, this targeting process cannot be accomplished using zzso images of gross anatomical structures zzso The zzso complex is a case in point, in that it consists of multiple zzso defined zzso with different functional zzso 

In this report, we describe an elastic zzso zzso method that projects zzso zzso anatomical information onto the zzso volumes of individual zzso 

The accuracy of this method was tested in 5 representative subjects using quantitative zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate a high degree of zzso zzso in zzso zzso lobe zzso and markedly superior anatomical matching performance by the elastic morphing method compared to zzso zzso 

zzso elastic morphing technique provides superior performance on fitting zzso templates to individual zzso The strengths and limitations of this and other zzso morphing methods are discussed in the context of emerging functional neurosurgery zzso
