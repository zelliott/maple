A generalized zzso partially parallel acquisition zzso method for zzso zzso sampling is presented that zzso zzso weights without zzso or acquired zzso zzso Instead, zzso weights are fitted to the zzso data as if they were the zzso zzso Because the relative zzso shifts associated with these zzso weights vary for a zzso zzso new zzso weights can be zzso for arbitrary shifts through zzso which are then used to generate missing projections between the acquired zzso The method is demonstrated in zzso and in abdominal and brain zzso Image quality is similar to zzso zzso using fully sampled zzso data, and improved relative to a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso
