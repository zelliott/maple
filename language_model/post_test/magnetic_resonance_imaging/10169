This study was conducted to explore differences in cortical thickness between subjects with bipolar disorder and healthy comparison subjects using cortical zzso zzso 

Brain magnetic resonance images were acquired from 25 subjects with bipolar disorder and 21 healthy comparison zzso zzso zzso analysis was conducted using the zzso zzso Group differences in cortical zzso defined by the distance from zzso boundary to the zzso surface, were assessed using statistical difference zzso 

zzso with bipolar disorder exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in left zzso cortex, left middle frontal cortex, left middle zzso cortex, right zzso frontal cortex, right angular cortex, right zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso relative to healthy comparison subjects (all p zzso zzso zzso of illness in bipolar subjects was zzso correlated with the cortical thickness of the left middle frontal zzso 

zzso thinning was present in multiple prefrontal zzso in bipolar zzso There was also cortical thinning in sensory and sensory association zzso which has not been reported in previous studies using zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso thinning observed in the current study may be related to impairment of zzso zzso and sensory processing in bipolar disorder but zzso studies will be necessary to test this zzso
