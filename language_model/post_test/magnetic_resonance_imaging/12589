Variations in the zzso heart rate and breathing pattern have been shown to result in significant zzso signal changes, zzso in part by zzso zzso mechanisms such as global changes in levels of zzso zzso When these zzso changes are correlated with a task, as may happen in response to emotional stimuli or tasks that change levels of zzso a concern arises that zzso zzso signal changes may be zzso as reflecting zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to provide information that can help in determining whether task zzso maps are influenced by zzso zzso noise, particularly zzso breathing zzso We also compare different strategies to reduce the influence of zzso zzso Two zzso are zzso a zzso decision task where some subjects showed zzso breathing changes, and 2) a task where subjects were instructed to hold their breath during the presentation of zzso zzso an extreme case of zzso zzso zzso zzso with previous literature, we find that zzso signal changes correlated with variations in breathing depth and rate have a characteristic spatial and zzso profile that is different from the typical zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of task correlated breathing changes was improved either by independent component analysis, or by including specific nuisance zzso in a zzso zzso The difference in the spatial and zzso characteristics of zzso and zzso fluctuations exploited by these strategies suggests that zzso can be studied even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso
