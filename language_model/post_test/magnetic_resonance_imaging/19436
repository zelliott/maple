Studies based on zzso zzso recordings are providing more and more impressive zzso In such recordings, the zzso sensors are several zzso away from the scalp and the positions of the zzso sensors with respect to the head differ from subject to subject, and from session to session for the same zzso In this paper, a method is presented and tested to estimate the scalp zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The goal is to remove the zzso of zzso zzso caused by the various sensor positions with respect to the head, as well as to reduce the zzso effect caused by the distance of the zzso sensors from the zzso The zzso measurement was first projected to a hypothetical zzso layer within the head volume conductor model using the inverse zzso The scalp zzso zzso was then obtained from the zzso zzso layer by the forward zzso The results from simulation studies, phantom experiments, and the auditory evoked field analysis demonstrated that, with reasonable signal to noise ratios, this method is a feasible way to achieve our zzso
