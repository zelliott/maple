The low sensitivity is the major disadvantage of zzso as compared to zzso zzso amplification strategies are necessary for specific zzso zzso This survey is aimed at exploring different routes to the zzso of zzso zzso in various type of cells at amounts sufficiently large to allow zzso zzso zzso the obtained results have been summarized in terms of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso of cells appears possible when the number of zzso zzso zzso is of the order of zzso zzso shows to be particularly useful for labeling cells that can be incubated for several hours in the presence of high zzso of zzso This approach appears very effective for labeling stem zzso zzso filled with zzso can be used for an efficient loading of cells endowed with a good zzso zzso zzso via receptors most often results in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be considered for being zzso by this route as well as zzso systems such as those formed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of nutrients in tumor cells appears to be a promising route for their differentiation from healthy zzso Finally, properly designed systems entering the cells by means of zzso peptides deserve great zzso
