An increasing number of youth are being diagnosed with, and treated for, bipolar disorder zzso zzso exists about whether youth with zzso zzso and symptoms of attention deficit zzso disorder zzso should be considered to have a zzso presentation of zzso 

A selective review of the literature related to this question, along with recommendations to guide clinical zzso 

Data indicate differences between youth with episodic mania and those with zzso zzso in zzso diagnostic associations, family history, and zzso In youth with episodic mania, elation and zzso are both common during manic zzso 

In diagnosing mania in youth, clinicians should focus on the presence of episodes that consist of a distinct change in mood accompanied by concurrent changes in zzso and zzso BD should not be diagnosed in the absence of such zzso In youth with zzso symptoms such as zzso and agitation should be counted as manic symptoms only if they are markedly increased over the zzso baseline symptoms at the same time that there is a distinct change in mood and the occurrence of other associated symptoms of zzso Although different techniques for diagnosing zzso illnesses have not been compared zzso it appears most rational to diagnose zzso illnesses such as zzso only if the symptoms of the zzso illness are present when the youth is zzso
