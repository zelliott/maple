zzso syndrome may affect the zzso and zzso of cerebrovascular diseases in patients with systemic lupus zzso We compared the spectrum of MR findings in patients with systemic lupus zzso with and without zzso zzso 

We identified 256 patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso with, 211 without zzso zzso who underwent MR zzso in 145 zzso we detected zzso These were zzso as large zzso zzso localized zzso and zzso zzso and as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso on zzso and/or zzso images, and as zzso zzso zzso on MR zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to compare the MR findings in patients with systemic lupus zzso with and without zzso syndrome, with patient age and zzso syndrome as the zzso 

zzso MR findings were more common in patients with systemic lupus zzso with zzso syndrome zzso versus zzso Large territorial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the rate of positive findings on MR imaging zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso of age, significantly more patients with zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso in the deep white matter zzso zzso zzso localized cortical zzso in the territory of the zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR findings were more common in patients with systemic lupus zzso with than in those without zzso zzso Large territorial zzso zzso zzso in the deep white matter, localized cortical zzso in the zzso territory, bilateral zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are common MR findings in patients with systemic lupus zzso with zzso zzso
