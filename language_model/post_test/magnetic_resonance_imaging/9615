zzso mapping of structural and functional zzso in the human brain via zzso zzso offers an exciting and unique opportunity to understand brain zzso Because connectivity zzso are widely reported in a variety of brain diseases, assessment of structural and functional zzso has emerged as a fundamental research area in clinical zzso A fundamental question arises when attempting to map structural and functional zzso how to define and zzso the best possible zzso of zzso zzso for brain connectivity zzso Essentially, when mapping brain zzso zzso provide the structural zzso for measuring zzso within individual brains and for pooling data across zzso Thus, identification of reliable, zzso and accurate zzso is critically important for the success of brain connectivity zzso This paper discusses several major challenges in defining optimal brain zzso from our perspective and presents a few thoughts on how to deal with those challenges based on recent research work done in our zzso
