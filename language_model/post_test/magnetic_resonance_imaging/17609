Imaging objects are zzso zzso by zzso magnetic fields in magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso current caused by rapid switches of zzso fields will result in artifacts in the zzso A method of zzso current compensation based on zzso of zzso current is presented in this zzso The compensation parameters are acquired rapidly utilizing zzso induction zzso and data fitting zzso The experiments prove that the method is efficient for reduction of the zzso time and for the improvement of the image zzso
