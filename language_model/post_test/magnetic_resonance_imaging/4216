We examined whether zzso and zzso abnormalities in the cerebral white matter, zzso zzso and zzso are associated with zzso white matter zzso zzso depicted on MR zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso study with zzso zzso and zzso was performed in eight normal control subjects without any zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 15 zzso subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure regional cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction zzso and oxygen zzso zzso 

In the cerebral white matter in the zzso subjects with zzso significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso P zzso zzso and significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were found compared with those for control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per minute and zzso zzso zzso zzso The severity of zzso was not related to the magnitude of zzso In the zzso zzso significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso P zzso zzso and significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were found in the zzso group than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the thalamus, there was no significant difference in zzso and zzso between the control and zzso zzso 

zzso of the cerebral white matter and zzso zzso in zzso zzso subjects may be induced by the zzso of long penetrating zzso arteries and zzso arteries but may not be directly related to the production of zzso The role of zzso in the production of zzso and acceleration of its development remains to be zzso
