The ability to recover episodic associations is thought to depend on zzso lobe zzso mechanisms and frontal lobe cognitive control zzso The present study examined the neural zzso underlying zzso zzso zzso and considered the consequences of successful retrieval on cognitive control zzso zzso zzso data were acquired while subjects retrieved strongly or zzso associated pairs of novel visual patterns in a zzso forced choice zzso recognition zzso zzso successful retrieval of strongly associated relative to zzso associated pairs was more likely to be accompanied by conscious recollection of the pair's prior zzso At the neural level, right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso were more active during successful retrieval of Strong than of zzso associations, consistent with a role in visual zzso zzso By contrast, zzso trials zzso greater zzso in right anterior zzso zzso zzso which may detect conflict between the similarly familiar target and foil stimuli in the absence of zzso zzso with this zzso stronger zzso activity was associated with weaker zzso and stronger right zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, recollection of relevant visual associations zzso and zzso results in lower levels of zzso conflict zzso and decreased zzso monitoring demands zzso These findings highlight the interplay between cognitive control and episodic zzso
