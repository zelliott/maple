We evaluated the zzso changes in the deep gray zzso and zzso brain zzso which demonstrated abnormal zzso and/or diffusion signal intensity, in 6 patients with infantile zzso treated with zzso compared with 6 zzso zzso zzso of interest were placed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Patients on zzso had significantly lower zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso brain stem zzso zzso zzso significantly lower trace in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for right and left, respectively), and significantly lower zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso brain stem zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso brain stem in patients compared with zzso The findings suggest that zzso changes play a greater role in the observed abnormal signal intensity, with lesser contribution from zzso zzso
