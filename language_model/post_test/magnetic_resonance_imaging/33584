Potential fields on the surface of the brain were estimated from zzso sampled scalp fields in human zzso Relatively simple methods of linear algebra were combined with detailed anatomical information from magnetic resonance zzso The method was verified using a tank model of the human head that encased a fully hydrated human skull in a zzso zzso of controlled zzso matching that of human brain and zzso Brain surface fields evoked by zzso contrast zzso spread less than their scalp field counterparts, and provided information helpful in zzso brain zzso
