zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent important cellular imaging targets for assessing vascular zzso We evaluated zzso for vascular zzso zzso and imaging in zzso using zzso and zzso 

zzso and diabetic mice underwent carotid zzso to produce a zzso vascular zzso In zzso and ex zzso zzso imaging were performed at 48 hours after intravenous injection of zzso zzso to zzso zzso 8 zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal from zzso was present in the zzso left carotid zzso but not in the control zzso right carotid arteries or zzso carotid arteries zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was performed at 48 and 72 hours after intravenous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal loss from zzso was seen in zzso left carotid zzso not in zzso controls zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso carotid zzso 

zzso accumulates in vascular zzso in zzso allowing zzso and MR zzso This zzso zzso zzso platform provides a promising approach for cellular imaging of vascular zzso
