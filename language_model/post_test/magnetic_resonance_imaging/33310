The purpose of this study was to identify the presence of a zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso just zzso to the zzso tunnel and correlate this with zzso signal characteristics of the zzso zzso which could result in a zzso appearance on zzso We correlated imaging characteristics with zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval was zzso zzso 91 ankle zzso utilizing a standard ankle protocol were reviewed by two musculoskeletal zzso Four zzso zzso were zzso using a standard ankle zzso protocol and reviewed by the same zzso All the zzso were examined for signal changes in the zzso The zzso zzso then underwent zzso dissection by an zzso surgeon, and a zzso review was undertaken by a pathologist with zzso zzso who looked for an zzso zzso or proposed zzso zzso relating to the signal change found on the zzso 

In the 91 ankle zzso studies, the zzso demonstrated normal low and increased zzso On the zzso zzso zzso 76 zzso zzso demonstrated low signal and 15 zzso demonstrated increased zzso Of the zzso ankle zzso all four demonstrated increased signal within the zzso three contained a zzso zzso and one contained an zzso zzso in that same zzso 

The zzso signal of the zzso can change with the presence of a zzso zzso which may be due to the molecular and chemical content of the zzso This zzso increases the zzso signal in the zzso zzso and gives the appearance of a zzso
