It is increasingly clear that simple decisions are made by computing decision values for the options under consideration, and then comparing these values to make a zzso zzso models of this process suggest that it involves the zzso of information over time, but little is known about the zzso course of valuation in the zzso To examine this, we manipulated the available decision time and observed the consequences in the brain and behavioral zzso of zzso Participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they chose to eat or not eat basic food items, in two conditions differing in the amount of time provided for zzso After identifying zzso regions with unbiased zzso general linear models, we analyzed two regions of zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso impulse response models of the zzso estimated neural activity from those regions allowed us to examine the zzso duration and termination of decision value signals, and to compare across zzso We found evidence for the immediate onset of value zzso in both regions, but an extended duration with longer decision zzso However, this was not accompanied by behavioral changes in either the accuracy or zzso of zzso Finally, there was modest evidence that zzso zzso correlated with, but lagged behind, zzso computation, suggesting the sharing of information across these zzso These findings have important implications for models of decision value zzso and zzso
