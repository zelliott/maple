To evaluate the roles of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and optimum zzso kinetic parameters in the zzso grading of the zzso brain tumors with zzso grades zzso 

zzso patients with zzso graded zzso were zzso Images with five flip angles were acquired before injection of zzso and were processed to calculate the zzso value of each region of interest zzso All the zzso data acquired during the injection were processed based on the zzso signal and zzso models to establish zzso zzso in the zzso drawn within the tumors, zzso normal areas, and area of the individual artery input functions zzso of each zzso A zzso zzso method was used to obtain zzso kinetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were applied to these parameters in different zzso grade groups for statistical differences zzso zzso zzso 

Volume transfer zzso zzso ) and zzso zzso space volume fraction zzso ) calculated using zzso can be used not only to distinguish the low zzso I and zzso from the high zzso III and zzso grade zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but also grade II from III zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is the most sensitive and specific zzso in zzso zzso distinguishing the high zzso and zzso from the low (I and zzso grade and high grade III from low grade II zzso
