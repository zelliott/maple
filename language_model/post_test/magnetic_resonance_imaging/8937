The zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso contributing to the control of zzso calcium zzso concentration by normally zzso net zzso zzso However, the reverse mode of the zzso can cause zzso zzso concentration overload, which zzso the zzso tissue injury resulting from zzso Although the zzso inhibitor zzso has been shown to zzso reduce zzso injury, no in zzso technique exists to monitor zzso zzso fluctuations produced by this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may indirectly assess zzso zzso by zzso changes in zzso zzso content in zzso since zzso has been suggested as a surrogate marker for zzso This study used the zzso technique to examine the zzso features of cardiac zzso zzso by implementing a zzso method and zzso the zzso with zzso The change in zzso zzso relaxation rate, Delta zzso in the left zzso free wall, was calculated at different time points following infusion of 190 zzso zzso zzso zzso in healthy adult male zzso The results showed 50% zzso signal zzso at zzso zzso zzso h zzso infusion without drug zzso Furthermore, treatment with 50 zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the rate of decrease in Delta zzso At zzso h zzso infusion, the average Delta zzso values for the two groups treated with zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for 50 and 20 zzso doses, respectively, as compared to the value of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the control zzso When this in zzso data were compared to ex zzso absolute zzso content data, the zzso zzso technique was shown to effectively zzso zzso zzso rates in the zzso zzso combining an zzso inhibitor with zzso may be a useful technique for assessing zzso transport mechanisms and rates in zzso which may reflect changes in zzso zzso
