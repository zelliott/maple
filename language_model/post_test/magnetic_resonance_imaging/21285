Animal models revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gray matter zzso However, there is a lack of evidence showing the relationship between zzso zzso concentration and gray matter in the human brain in zzso Here, to demonstrate an association between the zzso zzso binding potential, an index for zzso zzso and the local gray matter volume zzso an index for gray matter structure, we measured 35 healthy subjects with both zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso We found that regional zzso binding was positively associated with zzso in distinctive brain regions such as the zzso and the zzso zzso in both zzso zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso binding in the zzso zzso region was positively associated with zzso in zzso projection sites zzso zzso We also observed a broad range between zzso zzso binding and zzso Given the zzso of altered zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduction in depression or Alzheimer's disease as reported by numerous studies, these results might provide new insights towards understanding the mechanisms behind zzso zzso observed in these brain zzso
