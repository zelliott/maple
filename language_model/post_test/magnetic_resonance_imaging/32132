zzso rhythmic zzso zzso of adults zzso is currently considered a benign zzso pattern of uncertain zzso The underlying cortical sources and generating mechanisms are zzso We performed a source zzso analysis of zzso with the aim of better understanding this unusual zzso zzso 

Multiple spontaneous episodes of typical zzso were recorded in a patient during continuous zzso zzso Additional zzso episodes were induced by zzso zzso zzso was carried out using statistical zzso mapping zzso of low resolution electromagnetic zzso zzso 

zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso revealed a widespread zzso cortical origin of zzso the anatomical distribution of which included the zzso zzso and the known vascular watershed areas between zzso middle and zzso cerebral zzso zzso deep hyperventilation induced zzso on three of four zzso Mean duration of the zzso zzso was approximately three times longer than spontaneous zzso 

zzso in this patient with typical zzso revealed hyperventilation sensitivity and a zzso zzso source zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in large part zzso the anatomical distribution of the vascular watershed zzso 

The source zzso results and sensitivity to hyperventilation suggest some sort of association between cerebral vascular supply and zzso as originally proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso C, Rhodes J, zzso zzso A zzso de zzso zzso zzso du zzso zzso zzso zzso par zzso Rev zzso zzso
