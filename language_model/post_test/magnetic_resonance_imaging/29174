zzso zzso zzso pose difficult management problems because of the surgical risk of lower zzso zzso The indications and results of zzso zzso are not well zzso 

We reviewed our 10-year experience in the management of 17 patients who had jugular zzso zzso managed with the gamma zzso Thirteen patients previously had undergone surgery zzso zzso zzso Four patients had multiple zzso nerve deficits before zzso zzso 12 developed multiple lower zzso nerve zzso after zzso Four patients underwent zzso based on imaging criteria zzso zzso dose planning zzso margin dose of zzso zzso successfully zzso the irregular tumor volumes in all zzso 

zzso varied from 6 to 74 zzso zzso size decreased in eight patients, remained stable in eight, and increased in one patient during the average follow-up zzso of zzso zzso Six patients improved and 10 others retained their zzso clinical zzso One patient had an increase in tumor size and clinical deterioration 6 months after zzso and underwent zzso zzso No patient developed new zzso nerve or other neurological deficits after zzso 

We believe that gamma knife zzso is an effective alternative to zzso zzso for patients who have small tumors and intact lower zzso nerve zzso It is also effective for patients who have residual or zzso tumors after zzso zzso
