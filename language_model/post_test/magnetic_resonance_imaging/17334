We sought to determine whether zzso evidence supports zzso of the zzso muscle cone as a cause of zzso in zzso in children with zzso 

This was a retrospective case series of 40 patients with zzso zzso findings were assessed for zzso vertical zzso in particular excessive zzso in zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging scans were zzso Those scans with adequate zzso imaging of their orbits to assess the position and zzso of the horizontal zzso muscles were identified, and the degree of rotation of the muscles formally measured along with aged matched zzso These groups were analyzed for the association between presence of zzso in zzso and degree of zzso of the zzso muscle zzso 

The identified zzso on zzso that mimics inferior zzso muscle zzso was present in zzso zzso of zzso Imaging that permitted accurate measurement of the muscles positions was available in 10 of the 40 zzso Of these 10, 8 had the zzso and 7 of these 8 zzso demonstrated more zzso than their aged matched zzso zzso of scan zzso of patients revealed a significant difference in degree of zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso between patients with and without excess zzso in zzso 

zzso in zzso is significantly associated with zzso of the zzso muscle cone in children with zzso We demonstrate a simple method to assess for the zzso Our findings support the importance of imaging of the orbits in these children before zzso zzso
