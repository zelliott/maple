We examined how aging affects the pattern of brain activity zzso retrieval under zzso zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure brain activity in younger and older adults while they were engaged in an auditory verbal recognition test under either full or divided attention zzso or zzso During recognition under zzso older adults had more activity in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso with a distracting task requiring zzso judgments to words disrupted memory more than did a task requiring zzso judgments to zzso For both zzso and brain measures we contrasted the two zzso conditions to recognition under zzso to identify interference with memory zzso zzso there were no age differences in the magnitude of memory interference from zzso conditions, although recognition performance was poorer overall in older zzso During the zzso zzso condition, younger adults showed an increase in recognition zzso and older adults an increase in distracting task zzso Younger adults in this condition showed an increase in left inferior zzso coupled with a decrease in right zzso zzso these effects were diminished in older adults who instead showed an increase in bilateral middle frontal zzso During both zzso conditions, older adults showed greater activity in zzso zzso compared to the younger zzso zzso indicate that older adults are able to perform as well as younger adults on retrieval tasks under zzso conditions due to two zzso in brain activity: a zzso of the changes characterizing younger adults during the zzso zzso condition and greater recruitment of additional regions during both zzso zzso
