We used functional zzso zzso Imaging to explore the neural zzso of semantic relevance in 12 healthy participants performing a zzso zzso In addition, we tested the hypothesis that category effects typically found in functional imaging can be partly explained in terms of different semantic relevance for animals and zzso We report that semantic relevance zzso zzso responses in the zzso zzso zzso zzso As predicted, category effects in this region are strongly modulated by the semantic relevance of the zzso Specifically, the effect of zzso zzso animals is greatly reduced when the two categories are matched for semantic zzso Thus, the present study demonstrates that zzso responses during concept retrieval are modulated by the semantic relevance of the zzso It also suggests that increased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso typically found for zzso zzso animals can be explained by different semantic relevance for animal and zzso zzso
