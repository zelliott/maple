To determine the safety of zzso zzso zzso in patients with a solitary zzso 

We zzso reviewed the charts of all patients undergoing zzso at our institution for treatment of solid zzso tumors and identified those with a solitary zzso The clinical and zzso characteristics were zzso including zzso function, length of stay, use of blood products, and zzso The serum zzso level and zzso clearance rates were determined at zzso within 1 week, and at the last follow-up zzso 

Of the 100 patients who were treated with zzso for solid zzso tumors from September 2001 to January 2006, 16 with a solitary kidney were zzso The mean patient age was zzso years, and the mean tumor size was zzso zzso The median zzso zzso level was zzso zzso The median percentage of change in zzso clearance within 1 week of zzso was zzso and at a mean follow-up duration of zzso months was zzso All zzso functioned zzso All but 1 patient had maintained their zzso function at the last follow-up zzso Major acute complications occurred in 4 patients and consisted of 3 cases of zzso obstruction that were readily treated with zzso zzso and 1 case of zzso zzso 

zzso appears to maintain adequate zzso function in select patients with a solitary zzso When treating patients with central tumors in a solitary zzso the zzso should be vigilant with regard to the need for zzso zzso placement with the onset of any zzso
