zzso resonance imaging zzso has enabled us to see the spinal zzso pathology as differences in signal zzso zzso high intensity zzso were observed on zzso zzso in patients with cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso ligament zzso of the cervical spine zzso The frequency of this findings was zzso to the clinical severity of zzso and degree of spinal zzso zzso The zzso basis of such signal zzso was presumed to vary from acute zzso to chronic zzso The zzso zzso on zzso is considered to be the main site of zzso responsible for the neurological symptom because of a good correlation between the neurological level and high intensity zzso We found from nine autopsy cases of zzso that there are distinct differences in severity and extent of pathological changes between the spinal zzso with a zzso zzso and that with a zzso zzso In the zzso cases, major pathological changes were restricted to the gray matter and the white matter was relatively well zzso Secondary zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso zzso the fibers of which were derived from the affected zzso In the cases of a triangular shape, pathological changes were more zzso both white and gray matter were zzso There were severe pathological changes over more than one segment, and both descending zzso of the lateral zzso tracts and ascending zzso of the zzso column, including the zzso zzso were zzso In conclusion, it is clinically very important to understand the pathological basis of the compressed spinal zzso on zzso
