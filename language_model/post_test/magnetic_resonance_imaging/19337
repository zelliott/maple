zzso is an idiopathic neck pain syndrome associated with tenderness to zzso over the carotid zzso Although well known in the zzso and neurology literature, the zzso of the entity has recently been questioned, in part because of the almost uniform absence of zzso or zzso zzso We report the MR findings in five patients with zzso 

During a period of 44 months, five patients with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with zzso were referred for imaging from the zzso zzso Each patient underwent MR imaging of the neck on a zzso zzso The studies included, as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patients also had zzso zzso imaging and another two patients underwent duplex zzso of the zzso 

All five patients had abnormal enhancing tissue surrounding the symptomatic carotid artery centered at the level of the zzso common carotid and carotid zzso This tissue had intermediate signal intensity on zzso images and showed marked zzso In all patients, the remaining zzso portions of the carotid artery were zzso zzso flow voids were present throughout the vessel, and the caliber of the vessels was always within normal zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso cervical zzso or zzso disease of the zzso In one patient, repeat imaging after resolution of symptoms showed an absence of the previous zzso 

The MR findings in these patients, along with the lack of any findings to suggest alternative diagnoses, support the existence of zzso as a distinct clinical zzso
