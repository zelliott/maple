Several zzso zzso protocols have been used while selecting zzso patients for surgery among different zzso The relative value of the different available zzso tests is still under zzso 

We report on the surgical outcome obtained in patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso associated to zzso zzso sclerosis zzso and who were evaluated zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Forty one patients with zzso unilateral zzso lobe zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso disclosed unilateral zzso in all zzso All patients had at least 4 zzso zzso zzso All patients were submitted to zzso at the side determined by zzso 

zzso zzso showed unilateral zzso zzso compatible with zzso findings in 37 zzso in four out of the 41 patients, bilateral zzso were zzso Mean follow-up time was zzso zzso Thirty-nine patients zzso were classified as zzso Class I zzso Engel zzso Two patients zzso were rated as zzso Class zzso All patients in whom bilateral zzso were found were in zzso Class zzso zzso examination showed zzso in all zzso 

It is possible to adequately select good surgical candidates for zzso lobe zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso we should expect a zzso zzso rate higher then zzso The finding of zzso on zzso is the most important good zzso factor after zzso lobe zzso
