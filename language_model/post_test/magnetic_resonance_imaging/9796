zzso zzso may be involved in zzso mechanisms responsible for preservation of gait speed in elderly people with cerebrovascular zzso Our study examines the association between zzso zzso in the middle cerebral artery and gait speed in elderly individuals with impaired cerebral zzso 

Twenty-two fast and 20 slow zzso in the lowest zzso of cerebral zzso were recruited from the zzso Boston zzso zzso zzso was assessed in bilateral middle cerebral arteries by measuring cerebral blood flow during the zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso were measured for each group using magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso was attenuated in slow compared to fast zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The odds ratio of being a slow walker was zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso if there was a high burden of white matter zzso however, this risk increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso if zzso zzso was also zzso 

Our results suggest that intact zzso zzso may help preserve mobility in elderly people with cerebral zzso zzso
