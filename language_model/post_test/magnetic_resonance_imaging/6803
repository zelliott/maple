A new technique for assessing tissue blood flow using zzso zzso based on the fact that the zzso of a zzso substance can be destroyed permanently, is zzso zzso of blood flow with this technique are inherently insensitive to zzso delay and zzso and allow for zzso of the transit time and zzso in the arteries that supply the investigated zzso Renal cortical blood flow was studied in six rabbits using a zzso compound zzso that was polarized by the zzso polarization zzso zzso The zzso cortical blood flow was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso of tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean transit time and zzso in the zzso arteries were determined to be zzso zzso zzso s and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
