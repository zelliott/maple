The authors zzso reviewed the records of all brain magnetic resonance zzso images obtained at our hospital over a zzso period in an attempt to ascertain the relative prevalence and MR imaging characteristics of zzso zzso Of zzso patients who underwent MR imaging of the head and cervical spine, 175 were found to have zzso with zzso zzso extending more than 5 zzso below the zzso zzso Of these, 25 zzso were found to be clinically zzso The average extent of zzso in this population was zzso zzso zzso zzso and was significantly associated with a smaller zzso zzso zzso and zzso anomalies were found in only one zzso zzso 

The authors suggest that the isolated finding of zzso zzso is of limited zzso utility and must be considered in the context of all available clinical and zzso zzso Strategies for treating patients with zzso zzso are zzso
