The zzso imaging method was used to monitor the cooking of single rice kernels in real time and with high spatial resolution in three zzso The imaging sequence is zzso for rapid acquisition of signals with short relaxation times using centered out zzso Short scan time and high spatial resolution are critical factors in the investigation of the cooking behavior of rice kernels since time and spatial averaging may lead to erroneous zzso The results are confirming the general pattern of moisture zzso that has been suspected from previous (more zzso zzso Water zzso as determined by analysis of the zzso time series recorded during cooking compares well with zzso zzso This allows using these real-time zzso data for developing and zzso models that describe the effect of kernel zzso on its cooking zzso
