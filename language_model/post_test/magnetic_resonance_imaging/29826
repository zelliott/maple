The aim of the current study was to perform zzso relaxation time zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso patients and correlate them with zzso transfer ratio zzso zzso in order to investigate in more detail the various zzso changes that occur in zzso and zzso white matter zzso A total number of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso relaxation times were performed in 13 zzso patients and 10 zzso healthy zzso zzso concerned zzso plaques zzso zzso zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso evenly divided between the zzso patients, and normal white matter zzso zzso in the healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed, and also possible zzso between zzso and mean zzso relaxation times was evaluated using linear zzso analysis in all zzso zzso relaxation was more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso and homogeneous enhancing plaques zzso whereas zzso zzso and mildly zzso zzso presented zzso behavior with a lower zzso 5, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal white matter did not reveal any zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis between zzso zzso relaxation time and zzso zzso demonstrated excellent correlation for zzso zzso zzso very good correlation for zzso zzso zzso zzso good correlation for zzso zzso zzso zzso moderate correlation for mildly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlation for homogeneous enhancing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso behavior is seen in only very few zzso zzso on plaques with high degree of zzso and zzso zzso A strong correlation between zzso and zzso zzso values was found in regions where either inflammation or zzso zzso however, when both pathological conditions zzso this linear relationship is zzso
