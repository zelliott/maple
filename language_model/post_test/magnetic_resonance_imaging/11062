The purpose of this study was to analyze a series of patients with a high-grade zzso zzso of the knee who had been treated with a zzso zzso with preservation of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso portions of the zzso and an zzso zzso zzso 

The cases of thirteen patients with a high-grade zzso zzso around the knee who had zzso zzso and reconstruction with an zzso zzso were zzso reviewed at a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso survival of the patient, final preservation of the limb and zzso and functional results according to the zzso zzso Society scoring system were documented at the time of the latest zzso 

At the final follow-up examination, zzso of the thirteen patients continued to be zzso One patient died of bone and pulmonary zzso with no evidence of local zzso and the remaining patient had no evidence of disease after zzso of a local recurrence of the tumor in the soft zzso No patient had a local recurrence in the remaining zzso Seven patients had complications that included a fracture (three zzso zzso zzso zzso deep infection zzso and a local recurrence in the soft zzso zzso The zzso was removed in only four of these zzso At the latest follow-up examination, twelve patients were alive with preserved zzso In one patient, the zzso which originally had been zzso was zzso because of a zzso zzso and the limb was reconstructed with an zzso zzso The patients with a preserved zzso had an average functional score of 27 points zzso 30 zzso 

Preservation of the zzso in high-grade zzso zzso at the knee is an alternative in carefully selected zzso zzso factors needed to obtain local tumor control and achieve an acceptable functional result are a positive response to chemotherapy, accurate zzso assessment of tumor extension to the zzso and appropriate fixation techniques for zzso zzso
