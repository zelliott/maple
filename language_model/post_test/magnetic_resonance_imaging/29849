In the last decade, zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso two new zzso techniques for imaging of the zzso zzso Both techniques show promising initial results in the detection of zzso equal to or greater than 1 zzso in diameter in symptomatic zzso Imaging protocols are still mostly under development and prone to zzso Both CT and MR zzso generate a large number of source images, which have to be read carefully for filling defects and, if intravenous contrast material is used, enhancing zzso An important zzso technique is zzso zzso which allows the viewer to see potential zzso in an orientation other than that of the source zzso zzso zzso a volume rendering technique that generates images from within the colon zzso is used for problem zzso CT and MR zzso have potential advantages over zzso and zzso zzso enema examination: zzso capabilities, detection of enhancing zzso that make the distinction between zzso zzso and true zzso possible, and zzso and retrograde virtual zzso Currently, a number of studies suggest that patients have a preference for CT zzso over zzso Patients consider zzso zzso the most uncomfortable part of any colon zzso zzso from the acceptance point of view, zzso tagging techniques are zzso Before CT and MR zzso can be implemented in daily practice, they must show approximately the same accuracy as zzso for zzso detection in both symptomatic and screening zzso
