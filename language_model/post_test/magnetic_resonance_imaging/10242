zzso zzso of the central nervous system of childhood zzso is a rare and zzso zzso In the absence of a brain zzso the diagnosis is based on typical clinical and imaging zzso The aim of this study was to analyze systematically the MR imaging and MR zzso zzso abnormalities in a large cohort of children with zzso 

We analyzed the MR imaging features of a single pediatric center cohort of 45 zzso zzso MR imaging studies were performed for all patients, and both MR imaging and zzso were performed for 42 patients, who formed the cohort for review of the presence and correlation of zzso zzso were calculated by using the Fisher exact test, and agreement between MR imaging and zzso was calculated by using the zzso zzso The sensitivity of each diagnostic technique was zzso 

The zzso pattern of zzso zzso was zzso unilateral involvement, each in zzso patients zzso The lateral zzso artery zzso was affected in zzso of cases, with involvement of a zzso deep gray matter structure in zzso No zzso zzso occurred in the absence of zzso zzso zzso was normal in zzso patients zzso Among the abnormal studies, zzso was detected on zzso in zzso and was zzso in appearance in zzso of patients and zzso in zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso Multiple zzso zzso were seen in zzso MR imaging was abnormal in every patient where zzso was zzso With the assumption of MR imaging as the gold standard, the sensitivity of zzso was zzso The agreement between MR imaging and zzso for zzso was significant zzso zzso zzso 

We have illustrated the MR imaging and zzso appearances of zzso in the largest cohort to zzso Both zzso and vascular zzso were predominantly zzso zzso and zzso within the anterior zzso There was good agreement between MR imaging and zzso for zzso zzso MR imaging findings were abnormal in all cases at diagnosis, and this remains the most sensitive technique to the detection of zzso
