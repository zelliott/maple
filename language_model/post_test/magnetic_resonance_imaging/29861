zzso zzso zzso zzso with thin corpus zzso zzso is a rare neurodegenerative disorder classified as a complicated form of zzso zzso Some patients with zzso with thin zzso have previously been described in Japanese families, and the genetic locus was linked to zzso zzso 

Our objective was to further clinically and genetically characterize zzso with thin zzso 

We describe the clinical, zzso and functional follow-up and the genetic characterization of 2 sisters aged 26 and 31 years who had severe zzso zzso and cognitive zzso 

zzso resonance imaging revealed a thin zzso with progressing zzso cortical zzso paralleled by cognitive zzso Using zzso magnetic zzso we delineated a lack of zzso zzso Images obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced cortical and zzso zzso that decreased further within 4 zzso Additionally, combined zzso loss and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Because other family members were not affected, zzso zzso inheritance was considered zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso zzso was consistent with the linkage to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No zzso was found within the zzso zzso 

Progressive zzso zzso occurs in the zzso projections, zzso zzso and peripheral nerves in zzso with thin zzso linking to zzso zzso in a German zzso
