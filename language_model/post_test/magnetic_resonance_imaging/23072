zzso imaging technologies have improved surgical results in zzso and zzso zzso zzso With improvements and refinements zzso zzso zzso systems offer a potential of further improving these zzso zzso we describe the equipment and technique of a cost-effective zzso zzso zzso field zzso magnetic resonance imaging system and report our continuing experience on surgical tumor zzso A description of the facility design and equipment are given along with examples from our experience on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our facility based on the twin room concept and uses a zzso zzso Trio zzso zzso zzso zzso The unit consists of adjacent but independent zzso and operative suites, which are connected by a wide door for zzso procedure but are used as conventional zzso and operative zzso zzso head fixation during neurosurgery is achieved with a custom designed 5 pin zzso which also combines a zzso channel head zzso Operation is performed using regular zzso compatible equipment and the patient is transferred to the zzso during the procedure using a custom designed floating zzso Advanced sequences such as diffusion weighted and diffusion zzso imaging, MR zzso MR zzso MR zzso can be performed with no changes in the setup and result in image quality comparable to zzso zzso The zzso zzso ultra high field zzso unit with the twin room concept permits both diagnostic zzso imaging and image guided surgery in the same setting and is a cost effective solution to afford a highly capable zzso zzso
