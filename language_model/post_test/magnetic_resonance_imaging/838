zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a common cause of zzso in older zzso There appears to be a high prevalence of carotid zzso hypersensitivity zzso in patients with zzso with zzso bodies zzso but not in Alzheimer's zzso 

To compare the prevalence of zzso in zzso and Alzheimer's disease, and to determine whether there is an association between zzso induced zzso and brain white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso of zzso was compared in 38 patients with zzso zzso zzso age, 76 zzso zzso 52 with Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso and 31 case controls zzso zzso zzso during right sided zzso carotid zzso massage zzso zzso was defined as zzso zzso zzso s zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fall in zzso blood pressure zzso zzso weighted brain zzso was done in 45 patients zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso were rated by the zzso zzso 

zzso heart rate response to zzso was slower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the proportion of patients with zzso greater zzso in zzso than in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso to zzso zzso or controls zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The strongest predictor of heart rate slowing and zzso was a diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso The fall in zzso during carotid zzso massage was greater with zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso than with Alzheimer's disease (30 zzso zzso zzso or controls (24 zzso zzso zzso (both zzso Deep white matter zzso were present in 29 patients zzso In zzso there was a correlation between magnitude of fall in zzso during zzso and severity of deep white matter changes (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Heart rate responses to zzso are prolonged in patients with zzso causing zzso Deep white matter changes from zzso disease correlated with the fall in zzso zzso pathology is a key zzso of cognitive impairment and could be zzso in zzso where there are exaggerated heart rate responses to carotid zzso zzso
