The feasibility of diffusion zzso imaging zzso of prostate has been confirmed by several zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso values of prostate with healthy or pathological changes remain zzso 

To investigate the efficacy of zzso at zzso T in diagnosing prostate cancer in the peripheral zone and to determine the zzso zzso and zzso values of the normal zzso 

zzso imaging zzso and zzso of the prostate was performed in 33 cases with diagnosis confirmed by biopsy at zzso T zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso characteristic zzso zzso were used to compare the ability of zzso zzso and the two values combined in diagnosing prostate cancer in the peripheral zzso zzso data of 20 healthy young volunteers were also zzso zzso and zzso values of the normal central zzso and the peripheral zone were zzso 

zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower while zzso value zzso zzso zzso was higher in normal central zzso compared with that in normal peripheral zone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Sixteen of 33 cases were confirmed to be zzso while 17 of 33 cases were zzso All the 198 zzso were confirmed by zzso including 136 zzso zzso and 62 zzso zzso There were significant differences between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso values zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso differences were noted between the zzso of zzso and zzso alone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but no differences between the zzso of zzso and zzso alone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso values of normal prostate may be compatible with the zzso organization of zzso Furthermore, zzso may be a potential tool in diagnosing prostate cancer in the peripheral zzso
