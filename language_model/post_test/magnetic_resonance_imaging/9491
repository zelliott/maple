Motor imagery training is considered as an effective training strategy for motor skill learning and motor function zzso However, compared with studies of the neural mechanism underlying motor imagery, zzso examinations of motor imagery training are comparatively zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we designed a zzso motor imagery training experiment, including execution and imagery tasks, to investigate the effectiveness of motor imagery training on the improvement of motor performance, as well as the neural mechanism associated with motor imagery zzso Here, we examined the motor behavior, brain zzso and correlation between the behavior of the motor execution task and the brain zzso across zzso region of interests zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that motor imagery training could improve motor zzso More importantly, the brain functional zzso induced by training were found in the zzso zzso for both zzso These findings provide new insights into motor imagery zzso
