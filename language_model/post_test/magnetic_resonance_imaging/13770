To present recently published material comparing the performance of zzso relative to other imaging zzso when evaluating the patient with a suspected or known zzso zzso 

zzso was searched using the terms zzso and zzso zzso zzso from retrieved papers were reviewed to identify other zzso zzso was placed on zzso material published within the past three years that included comparison with other imaging zzso 

Despite advances in zzso imaging zzso zzso remains the most sensitive and specific method for identifying pancreatic mass zzso The zzso of pancreatic zzso is best determined with zzso zzso zzso zzso although zzso may be slightly more accurate for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fine needle aspiration biopsy has a high sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso when used in patients with masses in whom pancreatic cancer is suspected but prior zzso have been zzso 

zzso helps in the diagnosis of pancreatic zzso through definitive inclusion or exclusion of a mass zzso as well as biopsy confirmation of zzso The role of zzso in the determination of zzso has been eclipsed by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso ultrasound with fine needle aspiration of zzso zzso zzso may identify advanced disease with sufficient frequency to justify its routine use in patients with zzso that are thought to be zzso based on zzso zzso zzso
