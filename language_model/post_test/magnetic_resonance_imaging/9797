There is a growing need to identify zzso fluid zzso markers that can detect Alzheimer's disease zzso pathology in cognitively normal individuals because it is in this population that zzso therapies may have the greatest chance of zzso While zzso pathology is estimated to begin zzso years prior to the onset of cognitive decline, substantial zzso loss is present by the time the earliest signs of cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated potential utility as a marker of zzso zzso Here we investigate zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio as diagnostic and zzso markers in early zzso 

We assessed zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cognitively normal controls zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals with early symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and individuals with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging with Pittsburgh zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained in zzso of this zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso individuals had follow-up annual cognitive assessments for 2-3 zzso 

zzso zzso levels differentiated individuals with zzso from zzso and individuals with other zzso zzso zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso zzso and brain volumes in zzso zzso and zzso predicted future cognitive impairment in zzso over the follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted future cognitive impairment at least as well as zzso and zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso offer diagnostic utility for early zzso and can predict future cognitive impairment in cognitively normal individuals similarly to zzso and zzso zzso
