The adult human brain shrinks slowly with age, but the regional specificity and tissue class specificity of this loss is zzso zzso zzso were healthy aged participants in a zzso cohort who undergo periodic standardized cognitive and clinical zzso zzso zzso of magnetic resonance images into zzso matter zzso white matter zzso and zzso was performed on zzso image data using a custom template and calculated prior probability zzso Global differences were evaluated by fitting a zzso model for absolute and zzso subject zzso zzso and zzso zzso Global and regional patterns of zzso zzso and zzso differences were assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume decreased with age at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed no significant decrease in zzso volume, but a focal zzso decrease with age was detected in the anterior corpus zzso using zzso zzso reductions of zzso volume were seen with age in the zzso zzso and zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso Relative regional differences in cortical zzso volume with age occurred in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso lobe or in zzso zzso We did not observe significant gender zzso These findings establish a baseline for comparison with zzso changes in human brain volume between ages 58 and 95 zzso
