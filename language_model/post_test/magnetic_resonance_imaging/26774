zzso for zzso Patient zzso and zzso zzso 

Left zzso zzso zzso and zzso related zzso are major zzso of success in rhythm control of zzso zzso zzso We used delayed enhancement zzso zzso to zzso zzso patients based on zzso zzso and also to evaluate zzso zzso in order to identify zzso of a successful zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients were staged by percent of zzso zzso with zzso relative to the LA wall zzso minimal or Utah stage 1; zzso mild or Utah stage 2; zzso moderate or Utah stage 3; zzso and extensive or Utah stage 4; zzso All patients underwent pulmonary vein zzso isolation and zzso wall and zzso zzso Overall, LA zzso was zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso 3 months post zzso LA zzso post zzso was comparable across the 4 zzso Most patients had either no zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had zzso zzso over 283 zzso 167 zzso No zzso were noted in Utah stage zzso zzso was zzso in Utah stage 2, zzso in Utah stage 3, and zzso in Utah stage zzso zzso was predicted by zzso zzso zzso in Utah stage 2 and by overall LA wall zzso in Utah stage zzso No recurrence zzso were identified in Utah stage zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts zzso success in mild LA fibrosis, while zzso wall and zzso zzso is needed for moderate zzso This may help select the proper candidate and strategy in zzso zzso of zzso
