zzso imaging methods such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso have contributed zzso to the understanding of zzso cognitive processes in the brain in the recent zzso These techniques for the first time allowed the in zzso assessment of different features of brain function in the living human zzso It was therefore obvious to apply these methods to evaluate zzso of cognitive dysfunction in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease zzso as zzso One of the most dominant symptoms of zzso is the impairment of zzso In this context, the term zzso represents a zzso and summarizes a set of complex cognitive functions associated with zzso and retrieval of different types of zzso A number of imaging studies assessed the functional changes of zzso activity in the brain at rest and also during performance of cognitive work, with regard to specific characteristics of memory decline in zzso In the current article, basic principles of common functional imaging procedures will be explained and it will be discussed how they can be reasonably applied for the assessment of memory decline in zzso Furthermore, it will be illustrated how these imaging procedures have been employed to improve early and specific diagnosis of the disease, to understand specific zzso of memory dysfunction and associated zzso mechanisms, and to draw reverse conclusions on zzso function of zzso
