Advanced aging is associated with reduced zzso control and less flexible information zzso Here, the origins of these cognitive effects were explored using a functional magnetic resonance imaging task that systematically varied demands to shift attention and inhibit irrelevant information across task zzso zzso and zzso regions previously implicated in zzso control were recruited by the task and most so for the most demanding task zzso A subset of older individuals did not zzso activity in frontal and zzso regions in response to changing task zzso Older adults who did not zzso zzso activity underperformed their peers and scored more poorly on zzso measures of executive function and speed of zzso zzso 2 markers of zzso pathology in older adults revealed that white matter zzso zzso but not high zzso burden, were associated with failure to zzso activity in response to changing task zzso In contrast, high zzso burden was associated with zzso in default network zzso These results suggest failure to zzso frontal and zzso activity reflects a disruptive process in advanced aging associated with specific zzso zzso
