The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of zzso pulse inversion harmonic imaging zzso in detecting zzso zzso and to compare the results with zzso zzso zzso zzso in a group of patients whose fundamental liver zzso results were zzso 

zzso patients (21 women and 11 zzso age range, zzso zzso with a known primary zzso were enrolled in the zzso The patients were evaluated with conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 minutes after the injection of zzso zzso U zzso zzso zzso Berlin, zzso All patients also underwent zzso zzso CT within 1 week after zzso In 1 patient, zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed as part of the clinical zzso 

After zzso injection, in 4 zzso of 32 patients, at least 1 zzso zzso was detected by zzso multiple zzso were shown in 1 zzso The mean diameter of newly detected zzso was 12 zzso zzso zzso CT also showed all of the zzso that were detected by zzso The diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy and CT findings in 2 patients and by the typical CT and magnetic resonance imaging findings in 1 zzso For the fourth patient, the diagnosis was confirmed by follow-up and zzso zzso zzso zzso is comparable to zzso CT for detecting zzso zzso zzso but it protects patients from the potentially hazardous effects of radiation and zzso contrast zzso Further series involving a larger number of patients are needed to determine its place in the evaluation of cancer staging and treatment zzso
