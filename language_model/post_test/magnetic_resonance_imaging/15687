We describe a novel zzso enriched precursor zzso sodium zzso zzso which after zzso by zzso zzso and zzso Allows Dramatically zzso Nuclear zzso under controlled experimental conditions, becomes zzso zzso sodium zzso Fast in zzso zzso FIESTA MR imaging demonstrated that, following carotid zzso injection, the zzso zzso appeared in the head and cerebral circulation of normal and zzso zzso At this time, no in zzso zzso signal has been localized to normal brain or brain zzso On the other hand, ex zzso samples of brain harvested from rats bearing a zzso brain zzso 1 h or more following in zzso carotid injection of zzso zzso sodium zzso contained significant zzso of the injected zzso zzso sodium zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and products were below the limits of zzso detection in ex zzso samples of normal brain consistent with an intact zzso zzso These ex zzso results indicate that zzso zzso sodium zzso may become a useful tool for rapid in zzso identification of brain tumors, providing novel zzso in zzso MR zzso zzso
