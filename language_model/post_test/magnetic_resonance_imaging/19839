Multiple sclerosis affects many people, often in early adulthood, and causes significant zzso zzso is a novel agent to be evaluated for multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease that has demonstrated unique efficacy but has zzso been implicated in three cases of progressive zzso zzso This review covers the mechanism of action of zzso and efficacy for multiple zzso the three cases of zzso progressive zzso zzso our understanding of progressive zzso zzso and the mechanisms that may account for these zzso 

zzso an zzso zzso binds to zzso surface receptors to prevent migration from the circulation into the brain zzso Phase II and III trials have been completed and demonstrate previously unseen efficacy in preventing relapses and disease zzso The cases of progressive zzso zzso two fatal and one zzso resulted in the voluntary suspension of zzso and bring this entire class of agents into zzso It is important to determine what led to the development of progressive zzso zzso in the zzso cases and to advance understanding and continue to develop therapies for the treatment of multiple zzso 

With ongoing safety evaluations, zzso is being reevaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration for possible zzso and return to the zzso If zzso is zzso challenging questions and issues will remain in treating patients with multiple zzso
