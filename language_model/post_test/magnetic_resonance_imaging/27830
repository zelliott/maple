To study changes of serum zzso protein level in zzso infants with brain damage and its zzso 

zzso zzso infants were classified into 3 groups based on the results of brain ultrasound and zzso brain white matter damage zzso zzso brain but not white matter damage zzso zzso and control (no brain zzso zzso Blood samples were collected within 24 zzso 72 zzso and 7 days after zzso zzso protein level was measured using zzso 

zzso levels of zzso in the zzso and zzso groups were significantly higher than in the control group within 24 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after birth zzso More increased serum zzso levels were observed in the zzso group compared with the zzso group zzso 

zzso zzso protein level increases in zzso infants with brain damage within 7 days after birth, suggesting that it may be used as an early sensitive marker for the diagnosis of brain damage, especially zzso
