Pilot zzso 

The aim of the study was to develop a zzso method to diagnose the zzso as well as the zzso level of a complete zzso spinal zzso injury zzso with higher precision than today's zzso 

zzso unit zzso University Hospital, Stockholm, zzso 

zzso needle zzso was recorded in zzso spaces of five patients with zzso complete zzso zzso Tests were performed during rest, during voluntary zzso and during zzso of lower body zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed in each patient according to a protocol zzso for imaging near metal zzso 

Three distinct patterns were found in each zzso Above the zzso we found voluntary zzso normal motor unit zzso zzso At the neurological level and a varying number of segments below, zzso zzso segments with zzso zzso and positive sharp waves zzso Below the neurological level, normal zzso activated in concert with lower body zzso was zzso The number of zzso segments showed a significant correlation to the length of spinal zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso for imaging near metal implants can be used to determine the extent of a chronic complete zzso zzso both zzso and zzso The described method increases the sensitivity to detect delicate neurological changes related to the dynamic of the pathology that follows zzso and may be useful in analyzing outcome in clinical zzso
