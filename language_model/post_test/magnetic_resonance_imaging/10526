zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques were used to study zzso and zzso responses in human visual zzso during varying zzso blood oxygen zzso levels zzso determined by zzso and stimulation with zzso zzso The zzso potential zzso remained constant at lowered zzso of zzso Similarly, zzso cerebral blood flow zzso responses were unchanged during reduced zzso In contrast, visual zzso volume displaying blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso response decreased as a function of zzso but the zzso signal change of zzso was zzso zzso extraction ratio zzso during visual zzso showed values of zzso for normal zzso At lowered zzso two zzso patterns were zzso zzso a reduced zzso of zzso in the visual zzso structures showing zzso in zzso was zzso zzso signs of much higher zzso in other parts of visual zzso were zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging revealed signal increases by zzso with visual zzso during lowered zzso in the visual zzso structures, which showed zzso of zzso in magnitude under zzso Because the zzso response in the visual zzso was zzso similar during stimulation in zzso and zzso attenuated zzso signal increase in parts of visual zzso indicated high zzso during visual zzso in zzso which was close to that encountered in the resting zzso These zzso zzso regions of tissue oxygen extraction and metabolism argue for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso signals in mild zzso The findings point to zzso with regard to oxygen requirement and its zzso to the zzso response in the zzso
