Breast reconstruction and zzso have become a standard surgical treatment worldwide as zzso in medicine and technology enable safer and simpler zzso A variety of implants is used to mimic a natural breast both in appearance and zzso The most common complication of such procedures is zzso zzso zzso the zzso occurring in approximately zzso As to date, the zzso is mainly estimated by a physical examination of the breast, which is standardized according to the Baker zzso 

In a zzso study, we compared the clinical assessment of zzso zzso to a zzso thickness of the zzso as evaluated by ultrasound zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso A total of 20 patients, with 27 zzso were evaluated in the zzso All patients were examined by a single senior plastic surgeon and divided into 4 groups according to their clinical Baker score zzso zzso a US imaging of the implant with emphasis on zzso evaluation was zzso The zzso results, recently done prior to the study, were reevaluated in relation to zzso zzso 

Thirteen breasts had a clinical zzso contraction with a Baker score of I, 8 breasts with a Baker score of II, and 6 breasts with a Baker score of zzso The US and zzso images of breasts graded zzso revealed a thickened capsule zzso of zzso zzso by US and zzso zzso by zzso compared with the zzso imaging of the breasts with the lower clinical Baker scores zzso of zzso zzso by US and zzso zzso by zzso These differences were statistically significant according to the zzso test, with P values of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and US studies revealed distinct appearance of the thickened zzso 

It seems the zzso thickness as portrayed by US and zzso zzso well with the Baker scoring system and at the same time provides the physician with an objective and consistent zzso However, since clinical assessment can be difficult to interpret at times, zzso zzso can be effectively used to assess zzso zzso in women with a clinical suspicion of zzso zzso A revised zzso of zzso zzso taking into account the imaging of the zzso is zzso
