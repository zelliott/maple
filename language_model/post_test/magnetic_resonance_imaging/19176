Two coordinated experiments using functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso investigated whether the brain represents language form zzso zzso separately from its meaning content zzso While in the zzso 14 young, zzso adults listened to simple sentences that were either zzso or contained a grammatical error (for example, zzso can zzso or a semantic anomaly (for example, zzso can zzso A zzso tone pitch judgment task provided a baseline that isolated brain activity associated with linguistic processing from background activity generated by attention to the task and analysis of the auditory zzso Sites selectively activated by sentence processing were found in both zzso in inferior zzso middle, and superior zzso superior zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and semantic anomalies were differentiated by some zzso areas of zzso zzso anomaly triggered significantly increased activity in and around zzso area, whereas semantic anomaly activated several other sites zzso and zzso among them zzso zzso These zzso occurred when listeners were not required to attend to the zzso The results confirm that linguistic operations in sentence processing can be isolated from zzso operations and support the hypothesis of a specialization for zzso zzso
