In awake animal and human auditory zzso it is a common experience with zzso and suitable imaging methods for responses to steady stimulation to be strongly zzso and to exhibit zzso even over short periods of zzso If such zzso behavior is also reflected by zzso responses in the human auditory cortex, conventional methods of analysis of zzso data, although zzso for instance to largely stationary responses in visual and other zzso may be misleading in attempts to zzso auditory zzso into fields and to demonstrate functional zzso zzso described in this article as a convenient tool for the detection and analysis of zzso brain activities, zzso some of these zzso zzso demonstrates that activity is evoked reliably in three separate territories of human auditory cortex, parts of which may show zzso behavior, depending on the auditory stimuli and zzso
