To describe the zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of solid organizing zzso zzso and correlate them with the zzso zzso 

Ten patients with 10 zzso proven solid organizing zzso zzso who underwent zzso CT zzso zzso 10) or zzso zzso zzso 7) were enrolled in this zzso Images were zzso analyzed by consensus of 2 zzso for zzso zzso zzso shape, and margin of the zzso as well as for their enhancement zzso Their imaging findings were correlated with their zzso zzso 

The main imaging finding on CT or zzso was the zzso target appearance of a central enhancing area with a zzso zzso zzso rim on zzso and portal zzso On the delayed phase, most of zzso showed slightly low zzso zzso zzso with an enhancing zzso and 1 showed diffuse zzso zzso the central areas and peripheral rims corresponded to zzso tissue and fibrosis, zzso Nine zzso demonstrated a tiny zzso zzso portion in the zzso 

The target appearance of solid organizing zzso zzso on CT and zzso can be helpful in zzso them from other focal liver zzso These imaging findings are well correlated with the zzso zzso
