To determine the prevalence of clinically relevant zzso disease on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in patients suspected of zzso To assess the added value of zzso imaging of the pelvis in these zzso 

In a retrospective study of zzso patients undergoing zzso of the zzso zzso from January 2006 to December 2012 for inflammatory back pain the prevalence of zzso and zzso disease was zzso 

In 285 zzso patients zzso did not show any abnormal zzso In zzso of patients zzso features of zzso were zzso Spinal degenerative changes were the most common zzso finding in zzso patients zzso and consisted of disc zzso in 222 zzso patients, facet joint zzso in 58 zzso patients and disc zzso in 25 zzso zzso zzso joint disease in 44 zzso patients, zzso transitional anomaly in 41 zzso patients, zzso joint degenerative changes in 25 zzso patients and diffuse idiopathic skeletal zzso in 24 zzso patients were also zzso zzso zzso zzso in 17 zzso patients, zzso in 11 zzso patients, fracture in 8 zzso patients, infection in 4 zzso patients and acute zzso in 2 patients zzso were less frequently zzso 

Our study shows that zzso disease is more common than true zzso on zzso of the zzso zzso in patients with inflammatory type back zzso zzso pulse sequences may demonstrate unexpected findings that remain zzso if only zzso images are zzso Clinical relevance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may demonstrate conditions that clinically mimic zzso zzso imaging of the pelvis may help detect these unexpected zzso
