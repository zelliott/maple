The precision of zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to map the human primary motor zzso may be zzso by the direction of zzso current in the brain as determined by the orientation of the stimulation zzso In this study, the authors investigated the effect of current zzso on motor output mapping using zzso brain zzso The goal of this study was to determine the optimal zzso orientation (and, thus, induced brain zzso to activate hand zzso representations relative to each zzso unique zzso zzso The authors studied motor output maps for the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscles in 10 normal zzso zzso current zzso were delivered through a zzso zzso zzso and motor evoked zzso were recorded using zzso At each targeted brain region, the authors systematically rotated the zzso zzso to determine the direction of induced current in the brain for induction of the largest motor evoked zzso These optimal current directions were expressed as an angle relative to each zzso central zzso zzso of the optimal current direction was assessed by repeating the entire mapping procedure on two different occasions across zzso The authors demonstrate that systematic zzso of current direction as guided by zzso zzso improves the resolution of cortical output motor mapping with zzso
