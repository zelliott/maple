To characterize the relationship between cerebrovascular zzso zzso and white matter zzso diffusion in patients with internal carotid artery zzso zzso zzso 

In this exploratory zzso study, 41 patients with severe zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso and 12 healthy control subjects underwent zzso mapping using the zzso response to zzso Conventional zzso and zzso zzso sequences were used to calculate maps of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and to exclude areas of previous zzso zzso In all subjects, zzso was compared between zzso with positive and negative zzso In 27 patients with unilateral zzso involvement, zzso and zzso were compared between zzso and zzso zzso while zzso for relevant clinical risk zzso 

In patients with bilateral disease and in the zzso zzso of patients with unilateral disease, negative zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso In patients with unilateral disease, the zzso zzso deficit was correlated with the degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained significant after correction for potential zzso risk zzso 

zzso impairment is associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso of patients with severe zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso This finding is consistent with the presence of early, zzso zzso zzso
