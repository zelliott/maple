zzso zzso zzso is a critical step in prostate zzso planning, where dose plans are typically formulated on zzso zzso zzso is now beginning to be acquired at several medical zzso zzso of the prostate on zzso is acknowledged as being significantly simpler to perform, compared to zzso on zzso In this work, the authors present a novel framework for building a linked statistical shape model zzso a statistical shape model zzso that links the shape variation of a structure of interest zzso across multiple imaging zzso This framework is particularly relevant in scenarios where accurate boundary zzso of the zzso on one of the zzso may not be readily available, or difficult to zzso for training a zzso In this work the authors apply the zzso in the context of zzso prostate zzso for zzso planning, where the prostate is zzso segmented on zzso and zzso 

The framework comprises a number of logically connected zzso The first step zzso zzso registration of zzso and CT to map zzso boundary zzso of the prostate from zzso onto corresponding CT images, for a set of training zzso zzso the scheme zzso the need for expert zzso of the zzso on CT for explicitly constructing a zzso for prostate zzso on zzso The zzso of the prostate zzso on zzso and CT allows for zzso reconstruction of the prostate shape which zzso the building of the zzso In order to perform concurrent prostate zzso and CT zzso using the zzso the authors employ a zzso level set approach where the authors zzso the evolving prostate boundary to simultaneously fit to zzso and CT images in which zzso are classified to be either part of the prostate or outside the zzso The zzso is facilitated by using a combination of zzso zzso spatial zzso and a random forest zzso driven by zzso and zzso zzso 

The authors acquire a total of 20 zzso patient studies and use the zzso strategy to train and evaluate four different zzso First, a zzso zzso zzso is built using expert ground truth zzso of the prostate on zzso alone, where the ground truth for the zzso on CT is obtained via zzso of the corresponding zzso and CT zzso The authors compare the zzso against another zzso zzso where expert zzso of the zzso on both zzso and CT are employed in the model building; zzso representing the idealized zzso The authors also compare the zzso against an exclusive zzso zzso zzso built from expert zzso of the zzso on CT zzso In addition, two zzso trained using zzso zzso zzso on CT are compared with the zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso and the zzso perform zzso all of them zzso the zzso 

The zzso provides an accurate alternative to zzso that require careful expert zzso of the zzso that may be difficult or zzso to zzso Additionally, the zzso has the added benefit of providing concurrent zzso of the zzso on multiple imaging zzso
