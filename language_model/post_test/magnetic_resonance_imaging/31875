Progress in the development of effective therapies for diffuse intrinsic zzso zzso zzso is compromised by the unavailability of tissue samples and the lack of zzso markers that can characterize disease zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the zzso profile of zzso with that of zzso elsewhere in the zzso and to determine whether the measurement of zzso features can improve the assessment of disease zzso Forty in zzso MR zzso zzso studies of 16 patients with zzso at baseline and after radiation therapy were zzso zzso Control data for baseline studies of zzso were obtained from 14 zzso regular and zzso zzso All zzso were acquired with zzso short zzso (35 zzso zzso zzso Absolute zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso At zzso zzso and total zzso zzso were significantly lower in zzso than in zzso elsewhere in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso MRS in individual subjects revealed increasing levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and lipids zzso zzso zzso and reduced ratios of zzso zzso and zzso relative to zzso (all p zzso zzso zzso progression defined by increased zzso concentration in serial MRS preceded clinical deterioration by zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso zzso Low zzso of zzso at baseline is consistent with low zzso zzso zzso zzso changes that have been associated with zzso zzso preceded clinical zzso MRS provides early surrogate markers for disease zzso
