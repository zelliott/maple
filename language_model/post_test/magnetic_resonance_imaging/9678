zzso zzso zzso zzso is a clinically effective procedure for cartilage repair, but zzso evaluations are still zzso 

This study was conducted to assess the clinical zzso including zzso zzso of zzso treatment for traumatic and degenerative cartilage defects of the zzso 

Case series; Level of evidence, zzso 

The authors evaluated the midterm clinical and zzso outcome of zzso a zzso zzso graft for the treatment of cartilage zzso Clinical outcome at zzso follow-up was assessed in 52 patients with zzso cartilage zzso International zzso zzso Society zzso stage III and zzso Clinical scoring was performed preoperatively and 48 months after zzso using the zzso score, the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso score, the zzso score, the zzso injury and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso using the zzso zzso zzso evaluation was performed by zzso strength zzso comparing healthy and operated knee of each zzso 

Clinical evaluation showed significant improvement in the zzso (from zzso preoperatively to zzso at 48 months zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso pain from 62 to 78, symptoms from 68 to 76, activities of daily living from 68 to 85, sports from 19 to 55, and quality of life from 30 to zzso and zzso (from 31 to zzso scores zzso zzso zzso 48 months after zzso of zzso compared with the zzso zzso The zzso evaluations showed moderate to complete zzso filling in 43 of 44 treated zzso Two patients without improvement in the clinical and zzso scores received a total knee zzso after 4 zzso zzso evaluation showed significantly reduced maximum strength capacities for knee zzso and extension at the operated knee compared with the healthy knee zzso zzso zzso 

The clinical outcomes 4 years after graft zzso are good despite a zzso strength zzso zzso zzso is a promising treatment option for cartilage defects of the zzso More emphasis should be put on the rehabilitation of muscular zzso
