Although human experience is zzso in nature, previous research has focused predominantly on memory for zzso as opposed to zzso zzso In this work, we sought to investigate behavioral and neural differences between the cued recall of zzso audiovisual associations versus zzso visual or auditory zzso Participants were presented with zzso associations comprised of pairs of nonsense objects, pairs of nonsense sounds, objects paired with sounds, and sounds paired with zzso zzso they were required to recall the zzso of the target given the cue while behavioral zzso reaction time, and blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso recall was associated with zzso zzso in primary zzso regions, and was more accurate than zzso zzso When auditory targets were correctly or incorrectly recalled using a zzso visual zzso there was zzso in auditory association cortex, and recall of information from zzso associations activated the zzso to a greater degree than zzso zzso zzso support theories that propose an overlap between regions active during perception and memory, and show that behavioral and neural differences exist between zzso and zzso zzso zzso the current study highlights the importance of the role of zzso information in zzso
