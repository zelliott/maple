Recent advances in human zzso transplantation are hampered by significant graft loss shortly after transplantation and inability to follow zzso fate zzso Both issues were addressed by utilizing a zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso probe targeting zzso gene zzso We expect that treatment with the probe would result in significantly better survival of transplanted zzso which could be monitored by in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We zzso a probe consisting of therapeutic zzso to human zzso and imaging zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso In zzso testing of the probe included serum zzso of the zzso followed by treatment with the zzso zzso gene zzso and protein expression were determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso In zzso studies included serial zzso of zzso mice transplanted with zzso interfering zzso human zzso under the left kidney capsule and zzso zzso under the right kidney zzso 

Treatment with zzso probe resulted in decrease of zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso compared with zzso In zzso zzso showed that there were significant differences in the relative volume change between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso expression and cell zzso in zzso zzso compared with the control zzso 

Our data show the feasibility of combining zzso therapy and in zzso monitoring of transplanted zzso in zzso We observed a protective effect of zzso in treated zzso both in zzso and in zzso This study could potentially aid in increasing the success of clinical zzso zzso
