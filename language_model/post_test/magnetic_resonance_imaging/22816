The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso of chronic knee changes in long-distance runners based on the training status, including distance, running frequency, training pace, and running zzso 

zzso of the knee was performed in 26 zzso runners 5 days after their last training zzso zzso of the zzso and cartilage zzso zzso bone zzso and ligaments zzso zzso and joint zzso were zzso A total score zzso all knee zzso in each runner was zzso The zzso of the knee changes was correlated with the training level, zzso and age of the zzso 

Grade 1 zzso of the zzso were found in six runners with a high training level, and in only four runners with a low training zzso Grade 1 cartilage zzso were found in three zzso runners and in one zzso runner, and grade 2 zzso were found in one zzso runner and in two zzso zzso zzso Grade 1 anterior cruciate ligament zzso were seen in three runners with a zzso and in two runners with a zzso zzso zzso with a higher training level showed a statistically significant higher score for all chronic knee zzso than those with a lower training level zzso 

zzso findings indicate that a higher training level in long-distance runners is a risk factor for chronic knee zzso
