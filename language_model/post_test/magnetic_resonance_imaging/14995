Despite often showing zzso typical levels of social cognitive ability, unaffected siblings of children with zzso spectrum disorder have been found to show similar functional and zzso deficits within brain regions associated with social zzso They have also been reported to show increased zzso to biological motion in these same regions, such as the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso relative to both children with zzso and control zzso It has been suggested that this increased zzso may represent a zzso reorganization of these regions as a result of the highly zzso genetic influence of zzso However, the response patterns of unaffected siblings in the domain of action perception are zzso and the phenomenon of zzso zzso has not yet been zzso The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the neural responses to intentional biological actions in 22 siblings of children with zzso and 22 matched zzso The presented actions were either zzso or zzso with the actor's emotional zzso Prior studies reported that typically developing children and adults, but not children with zzso show increased zzso to zzso actions zzso to zzso within the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso We report that unaffected siblings did not show a zzso response, or a preference for zzso over zzso trials, in any brain zzso Moreover, interaction analyses revealed a zzso of the zzso in which control children showed an zzso preference to a significantly greater degree than siblings, which suggests a localized deficit in zzso A sample of children with zzso also did not show differential zzso in the zzso providing further evidence that it is an area of selective disruption in children with zzso and zzso While reduced zzso to both conditions was unique to the zzso sample, lack of differentiation to zzso and zzso intentional actions was common to both children with zzso and unaffected zzso
