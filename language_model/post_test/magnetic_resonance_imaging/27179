The prevalence of knee zzso is traditionally based on zzso findings, but magnetic resonance imaging is now being used to provide better zzso of bone, cartilage, and soft zzso as well as the zzso zzso The goal of this study was to estimate the zzso of knee features defined on magnetic resonance imaging in a population and to relate these abnormalities to knee zzso severity scores based on zzso findings, physical zzso and reported knee pain in middle-aged zzso 

zzso resonance images of the knee were evaluated for the location and severity of cartilage zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso tears, zzso and zzso among zzso middle-aged women zzso knees) from the Michigan Study of Women's Health Across the zzso These findings were related to zzso zzso severity scores from zzso zzso knee pain, zzso knee injury, perception of physical zzso and physical performance measures to assess zzso zzso physical performance assessment, and interviews were undertaken at the 1996 study baseline and again (with the addition of magnetic resonance imaging assessment) at the follow-up visit during 2007 to zzso 

The prevalence of zzso knee zzso changed from zzso at the baseline assessment to zzso at the follow-up visit zzso years zzso zzso cartilage defects of the zzso zzso and zzso compartments were present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso of the knees, and joint zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the knees had complex or zzso zzso zzso Large zzso marked zzso zzso zzso tears, and zzso zzso cartilage defects were associated with increased odds of knee pain and with zzso to zzso slower walking and zzso zzso 

zzso women have a high prevalence of zzso knee zzso zzso by strong associations with cartilage zzso complex and zzso zzso tears, zzso and zzso knee pain, and lower mobility zzso
