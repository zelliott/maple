There is increasing evidence that the phase of ongoing zzso plays a role in neural coding, but its relative importance throughout the brain has yet to be zzso We assessed zzso phase coding in four zzso lobe and four frontal lobe regions of the human brain using local field zzso zzso recorded during a zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of zzso matches based on zzso phase was significantly better than zzso based on zzso and comparable to the full zzso zzso Surprisingly, in these regions, the zzso mean zzso became aligned to one another before they zzso and coded for trial zzso zzso responses in the zzso were consistent with a mechanism of phase zzso while zzso zzso activity was indicative of evoked zzso These findings highlight the importance of phase coding in human zzso zzso lobe and suggest that different brain regions may represent information in diverse zzso
