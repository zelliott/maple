A model zzso system was subjected to magnetic resonance zzso to investigate how water zzso zzso zzso relaxation times and zzso transfer ratios can be applied to monitor collagen zzso In our model system, a collagen sponge was zzso with zzso zzso calcium zzso The lower zzso and water zzso zzso values of collagen sponges during the initial zzso phase were attributed to the replacement of the water within the collagen zzso by zzso calcium zzso The significant reduction in zzso values by day 6 zzso zzso zzso was attributed to the appearance of mineral zzso which were also detected by zzso zzso and scanning electron zzso In the second phase, between days 6 and 13, magnetic resonance zzso properties appear to plateau as zzso calcium zzso droplets began to coalesce within the zzso space of zzso In the third phase, after day 15, the zzso mineral phase zzso resulting in a reduction in the absolute intensity of the collagen zzso zzso We speculate that zzso transfer ratio values for collagen zzso with similar collagen zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso for control strips to a maximum value of zzso zzso zzso at day 15 zzso zzso zzso because mineral zzso greatly reduce the mobility of the collagen zzso
