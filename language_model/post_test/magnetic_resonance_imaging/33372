zzso magnetic resonance zzso has documented declines in normal zzso and long-term zzso of zzso signal after stroke in zzso Within days of stroke, zzso zzso the zzso zone may produce much of the zzso seen in the zzso and chronic zzso 

We examined 10 patients by localized zzso magnetic resonance zzso with one-dimensional zzso imaging within the first 60 hours after acute zzso cerebral zzso a period before abundant zzso zzso zzso studies on day 8 to 17 after stroke were performed on 7 of these zzso 

Initially, the zzso magnetic resonance signal was elevated in all zzso The zzso peak within the zzso was reduced below zzso normal brain in all but zzso At subsequent examination, significant declines had occurred in zzso maximum zzso and zzso signals, with average changes of zzso zzso zzso per week and zzso zzso zzso per week, zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso compound zzso occurred in some patients but did not attain statistical significance for the group as a zzso zzso zzso volume correlated positively with both total zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso maximum zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signal is reliably zzso by magnetic resonance zzso after acute cerebral zzso in zzso zzso of zzso occurs despite the potential contribution of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Delayed loss of zzso signal in second examinations suggests that late death of viable cells may occur within the first 2 weeks after cerebral zzso
