To evaluate zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures, and vascular risk among mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Both clinics and the zzso 

A total of 153 subjects with zzso 218 cognitively normal older individuals zzso and 68 patients with zzso zzso 

zzso of subjects with zzso according to current zzso diagnostic convention based on zzso performance, estimates of vascular risk based on medical history, research zzso unless there was a specific zzso and zzso E zzso 

Of the 153 subjects with zzso 65 were diagnosed with zzso zzso 46 with zzso zzso 27 with zzso zzso and 15 with zzso zzso zzso zzso of control, zzso and zzso disease cases revealed significant differences in brain and zzso volumes between each zzso Post hoc analyses of zzso measures among the zzso zzso found that patients with zzso zzso zzso had significantly less brain zzso and that zzso volume differed significantly from controls for the 2 zzso forms of zzso zzso E zzso prevalence was significantly greater in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso were more likely to have increased vascular risk and to be African zzso 

zzso forms of zzso appear to have zzso zzso and zzso findings suggestive of zzso disease pathology, whereas the zzso forms of zzso have findings suggestive of vascular zzso zzso however, all subjects with zzso showed evidence of brain injury, and the biological differences among zzso are relatively subtle beyond the memory vs zzso zzso
