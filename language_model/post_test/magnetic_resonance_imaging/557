zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso is particularly useful for the detection of zzso zzso However, whether contrast zzso is useful in multiple sclerosis zzso remains zzso This study evaluated the usefulness of contrast zzso in zzso 

We zzso studied the clinical histories and brain zzso studies of 6 patients with clinically zzso zzso diagnosed according to the new McDonald zzso zzso zzso zzso time zzso 9,000 zzso echo time zzso 120 zzso inversion time zzso 2,200 zzso zzso slice zzso with a zzso zzso zzso was obtained with the use of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Three enhancing plaques located in the zzso or zzso areas showed higher intensity on contrast zzso than on other MR zzso In contrast, 8 enhancing plaques in the deep white matter or zzso areas showed no increased signals on contrast zzso 

Our findings suggest that early zzso imaging with zzso may be helpful for the further detection of zzso zzso particularly those located in zzso and zzso zzso
