The developments in zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging that have taken place over the last two decades have dramatically increased our ability to detect and characterize focal liver zzso and have led to the liver becoming the primary focus of interest in abdominal zzso At the same time, advances in the medical and surgical treatment of secondary liver tumors have continued to be a challenge to these advances in zzso It is clear that a successful outcome depends on knowledge of the size and location of the tumor burden, and accurate zzso assessment is crucial in identifying the zzso of patients who may benefit from surgery and, at the same time, in preventing unnecessary radical surgery, with its high zzso in those likely to gain only a short-term zzso The current period of limited resources, along with increased awareness of the effects of zzso radiation, has led to competition between the two zzso with considerable debate as to which offers the better zzso examination of the liver, particularly with regard to the detection and characterization of focal liver zzso Arguments over each zzso relative merits have tended to be zzso but the parallel use of different diagnostic techniques is costly and zzso Each needs to be placed in an appropriate position on diagnostic zzso
