Patients with zzso zzso zzso undergo cortical and zzso zzso as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, the effect of the zzso of zzso has not been adequately addressed zzso We introduce a new method of zzso zzso in zzso to reveal a clearer pattern of zzso across a mixed patient zzso A zzso zzso of visual function in 19 ON patients examined at four zzso between presentation and 6 months was zzso Four different models were zzso The first model included the four different examination zzso as separate explanatory variables without adjustment for visual field zzso The second model also included zzso reflecting zzso zzso in visual field zzso from the average group value of the zzso mean zzso zzso at each examination zzso In the third and fourth models the four examination zzso were not zzso zzso but entered zzso through the associated changes in the zzso for each subject that marked their individual zzso The results show that the third and fourth models were more sensitive to zzso and visual cortical zzso during zzso Moreover, zzso from the fourth model can be extended to the general population of patients recovering from zzso In conclusion, we present a method of accommodating zzso differences between patients with acute ON by inclusion of an zzso This method is sensitive to the processes of zzso whilst the zzso of zzso makes the method suitable for future studies of zzso
