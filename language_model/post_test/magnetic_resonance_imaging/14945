The supplementary motor area zzso plays a key role in motor programming and production and is involved in zzso zzso In neurological zzso zzso syndrome following a zzso to the zzso zzso is characterized by transient impairment of voluntary movements and motor zzso This syndrome is assumed to follow on from an interruption of the motor zzso loop, and some case reports indicate that such a syndrome could occur after a brain zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso 

To characterize the pattern of motor zzso in a patient whose stroke zzso the zzso from the zzso motor zzso 

A patient developed a moderate transient left zzso following a zzso stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery area, which disconnected the zzso from zzso zzso Eight days after the stroke, when the zzso had zzso the patient presented a specific zzso motor disorder of the left hand which zzso as an zzso and was exacerbated when his visual attention was not directed towards his zzso We assessed finger tapping with left and right hands, eyes closed and open, in the left and right zzso We zzso movement speed as the number of taps filmed over zzso zzso 

Left motor weakness zzso strength of right hand: 49 zzso and left hand: 41 zzso was resolved in a zzso zzso and zzso gestures and motor sequences were zzso On the tapping task, zzso tapping was slower than right-hand zzso zzso visual feedback improved tapping speed for the left, but not for the right, zzso The zzso of the task execution had no effect on tapping zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso movement initiation and maintenance and this effect is partly compensated by visual zzso
