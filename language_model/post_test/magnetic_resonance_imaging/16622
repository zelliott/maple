Although zzso zzso for faces in the zzso visual zzso appears zzso in adolescence, recognition abilities for individual faces are still zzso We investigated how the ability to represent zzso faces and houses develops at the neural zzso zzso regions of interest zzso for faces in the zzso zzso zzso and for places in the zzso place area zzso were identified individually in children, zzso and zzso Then, using an functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation zzso we measured category selectivity and zzso adaptation for faces and houses in each zzso Only adults exhibited both category selectivity and zzso adaptation zzso for faces in the zzso and for houses in the zzso zzso showed category selectivity zzso for faces in the zzso and houses in the zzso Despite this profile of category zzso adolescents only exhibited zzso adaptation for houses zzso in the zzso and for faces in the zzso zzso Children only showed zzso responses for houses in the zzso and they failed to exhibit zzso responses for faces in the zzso and zzso adaptation effects anywhere in the zzso These results indicate that zzso neural tuning develops prior to zzso neural tuning and that zzso zzso is disproportionately slower in this zzso transition than is zzso zzso
