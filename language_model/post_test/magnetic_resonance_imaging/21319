zzso of the zzso signal is potentially of great value in providing a closer measure of the underlying changes in brain function related to zzso activity than the zzso signal alone, but current approaches rely on an assumed relationship between cerebral blood volume zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso This is poorly zzso in humans and does not reflect the predominantly zzso nature of zzso contrast, whilst this relationship may vary across brain regions and depend on the structure of the local vascular zzso This work demonstrates a new approach to zzso zzso which does not require an assumption about the relationship between cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood zzso This method involves repeating the same stimulus both at zzso and zzso using zzso zzso contrast to estimate the relative changes in zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso To do this the effect of zzso on zzso blood zzso has to be zzso which requires an estimate of zzso oxygen extraction zzso and this can be estimated from the phase as an alternative to using a literature zzso Additional measurement of the relative change in zzso combined with the blood zzso change can be used to calculate the relative change in zzso due to the zzso zzso changes of 18 zzso zzso in response to a motor task were measured without requiring the assumption of a zzso zzso relationship, and are in agreement with previous zzso
