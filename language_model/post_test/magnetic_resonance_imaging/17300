At the onset of acute diabetic zzso foot, therapeutic intervention may be delayed because plain zzso may not show zzso 

To assess the clinical course of acute zzso foot in 24 patients without evidence of zzso fractures on the first X-ray after onset of symptoms, who were referred to the foot clinic for diagnosis and treatment either early or delayed, zzso before or after zzso fractures were zzso on repeat zzso 

Eleven patients were referred early zzso zzso foot, case group), and 13 patients were referred delayed zzso zzso foot, control zzso In the foot clinic, both groups were immediately treated with zzso and total contact zzso After the healing process of the zzso foot was complete, the extent of fractures and subsequent zzso were zzso 

Based on zzso at the onset of symptoms, in 19 of the 24 patients the condition had been zzso prior to referral (in 11 patients as zzso zzso Additional imaging techniques zzso CT scan or bone zzso had been performed in 10 patients prior to zzso While these techniques had been used more frequently in the cases zzso the controls zzso zzso was less frequent in the cases zzso the controls zzso Only one out of 11 case patients developed extended foot fractures and severe zzso zzso 12 out of 13 control patients zzso 

Early detection of zzso zzso foot is facilitated by imaging techniques other than plain zzso Immediate zzso of zzso zzso foot appears to minimize fractures and zzso zzso
