In 1990, zzso et zzso zzso classified massive rotator cuff tears into five zzso Walch et zzso subsequently subdivided Grade 4 to reflect the zzso of zzso arthritis and emphasize zzso arthritis as a characteristic of Grade zzso 

We therefore determined zzso whether patient characteristics and zzso findings differed between the grades at initial examination and final zzso zzso which factors affected progression to a higher zzso zzso whether the zzso rate of repaired zzso differed among the zzso and zzso whether the zzso grades at final followup differed from those at initial examination among patients treated zzso 

We zzso reviewed 75 patients with massive rotator cuff zzso Thirty-four patients were treated zzso and 41 zzso 

Patients with Grade 3, 4, or 5 tears had a higher zzso of fatty muscle zzso of the zzso muscle than patients with Grade 1 or 2 zzso In 26 patients with Grade 1 or 2 tears at initial examination, duration of followup was longer in patients who remained at Grade 1 or 2 than in those who progressed to Grade 3, 4, or 5 at final zzso The zzso rate of repaired zzso zzso was more frequent in Grade 2 than Grade 1 zzso In operated cases, zzso grades at final followup did not develop to zzso 3 to zzso 

We believe cuff repair should be performed before zzso zzso zzso Our observations are consistent with the zzso concepts of massive cuff tear zzso proposed by zzso and Hansen et zzso
