The objective of this study is to determine which cognitive processes underlying spelling are most affected in the three zzso of primary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso primary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso primary progressive zzso zzso and zzso zzso primary progressive zzso zzso 

23 zzso patients were administered The Johns Hopkins zzso Battery to assess zzso zzso evaluate for effects of word frequency, zzso word zzso grammatical word class, zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso by controlling for the other zzso zzso effects of each variable were identified with zzso square zzso zzso on all spelling to dictation tests were scored by error zzso 16 of the 23 subjects also had a high resolution zzso brain scan to identify areas of zzso 

We identified 4 patterns of spelling that could be explained by damage to one or more cognitive processes underlying zzso Nine patients (3 zzso 4 with zzso 2 with zzso had zzso zzso by impaired access to zzso zzso with reliance on zzso zzso conversion zzso Two patients (with zzso showed zzso zzso by impaired access to zzso representations and complete disruption of zzso zzso Seven patients (4 with zzso 1 with zzso 2 zzso showed zzso zzso by impaired access to zzso representations and/or zzso representations with partially spared zzso zzso zzso Five patients zzso zzso 2 with zzso 1 with zzso and 1 zzso showed zzso zzso by impairment of the zzso zzso 

Any cognitive process underlying spelling can be affected in zzso zzso of zzso plausible zzso more accurate spelling of regular words than irregular words, and more accurate spelling of zzso than words zzso spared zzso zzso may indicate a low probability of progression to zzso
