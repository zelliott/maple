zzso to the zzso lobe can induce a condition known as spatial zzso characterized by a lack of awareness of the personal and/or zzso space opposite the damaged brain zzso zzso neglect is commonly assessed clinically using either the line zzso or the target cancellation zzso However, it is unclear whether poor performance on each of these two tasks is associated with the same or different zzso zzso To date, zzso limitations and differences have prevented a definitive link between task performance and zzso location to be zzso Here we report findings from a zzso zzso symptom mapping zzso analysis of an unbiased selection of 44 patients with a recent zzso zzso Patients performed both the line zzso and target cancellation zzso For each of the two tasks a continuous score was incorporated into the zzso zzso Both tasks correlated highly with each other zzso and zzso analyses indicated that the angular zzso was the critical zzso site for both zzso The results suggest that both tasks probe the same underlying cortical deficits and although the cancellation task was more sensitive than the line zzso task, both can be used in a clinical setting to test for spatial zzso
