The purposes of this study were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso compared with those of zzso and zzso in the evaluation of breast cancer and to evaluate the results in light of previously published data obtained with zzso and zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was conducted with data on 434 women zzso age, 53 zzso who underwent zzso evaluation of the breasts zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso and zzso examinations of all patients were zzso zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso and statistics were analyzed with the zzso zzso 

The sensitivities of zzso zzso and zzso in the detection of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The specificity of zzso increased from zzso to zzso over the course of the study zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depicted a significantly higher number of zzso tumors of the zzso There was no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with those in earlier reports in the zzso 

zzso at 3 T is more sensitive than zzso and zzso in the detection of breast cancer and the characterization of small zzso zzso 4 zzso but has lower zzso Compared with the results of zzso and zzso zzso in the literature, zzso zzso has higher sensitivity in the detection of breast cancer with no significant difference in zzso
