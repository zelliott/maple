zzso tissue structures zzso paths of the zzso zzso muscles zzso acting as pulleys and serving as functional zzso zzso This study was conducted to investigate the relationship of zzso and global zzso layers to pulleys and zzso implications of this zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to define the anterior paths of zzso zzso as influenced by gaze direction in living zzso zzso zzso were examined at zzso zzso and surgical zzso Human and monkey orbits were step and serially zzso for zzso zzso to distinguish zzso fiber layers in relationship to zzso 

zzso consistently demonstrated zzso shifts in the zzso locations of human zzso path zzso as well as shifts in components of the pulleys zzso zzso studies of human and monkey orbits confirmed gross examinations and surgical zzso to indicate that the zzso layer of each zzso zzso zzso on its corresponding zzso rather than on the zzso Only the global layer of the zzso zzso on the zzso This dual zzso was zzso in zzso by zzso in human horizontal zzso zzso 

The authors propose the zzso zzso By dual insertions the global layer of each zzso zzso zzso the globe while the zzso layer zzso on its zzso to position it zzso and thus influence the zzso zzso zzso zzso locations may also be altered in zzso This overall arrangement is zzso suited to account for numerous aspects of zzso dynamics and zzso including zzso zzso
