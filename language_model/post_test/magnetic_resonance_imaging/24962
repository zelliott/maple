zzso To identify zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso patterns in five benign essential zzso zzso patients and five zzso control zzso zzso zzso brain zzso maps were obtained during repeated conditions of spontaneous and voluntary blinking in zzso and control zzso Blood oxygen zzso intensity images were collected from two separate runs as 16 zzso and 16 zzso 8 zzso thick slices using a zzso weighted zzso echo zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blurred zzso maps for each subject were combined within groups of zzso patients and control subjects to generate maps of the zzso mean fractional signal zzso zzso greater zzso during spontaneous and voluntary blinking was seen in zzso patients compared with control subjects in the anterior visual cortex, anterior zzso cortex, primary motor cortex, central region of the thalamus, and superior zzso In both groups, zzso were generally greater for voluntary than for spontaneous zzso zzso The zzso observed might represent a zzso cortical circuit linking visual cortex, zzso system, supplementary motor cortex, zzso and zzso motor pathways zzso the zzso zzso
