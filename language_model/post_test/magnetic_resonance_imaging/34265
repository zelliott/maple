The goal of the study was to compare, in phantom and normally zzso rat brain zzso a zzso iron oxide zzso contrast agent zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in two zzso contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso modes zzso zzso shot sequence zzso and zzso imaging zzso A phantom consisting of dilution series of both contrast agents was zzso zzso were obtained with zzso serum from the available agent solutions zzso zzso zzso zzso 350 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso zzso agent zzso zzso was zzso injected in each zzso and dynamic zzso was performed zzso pass of the contrast zzso in rat zzso The doses of zzso 227 injected were zzso from the phantom zzso zzso zzso body weight of zzso and 7, 14, and 28 zzso zzso body weight of zzso 227 were zzso For both zzso zzso ratios zzso were measured on each tube of the phantom and on rat brain from each image of the dynamic zzso zzso was plotted versus contrast dilution zzso and versus time zzso In the zzso zzso a zzso curve zzso decrease, zzso peak decrease, zzso zzso of the first pass of the contrast agent was demonstrated for zzso and for zzso 227 (7 zzso zzso body zzso In the zzso zzso a zzso curve was demonstrated for zzso and a plateau effect was noted for both zzso of zzso zzso With the zzso technique, dynamic zzso contrast imaging of rat brain can be performed with very low zzso of zzso 227 compared with the zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso body zzso used in clinical zzso This could be of interest in zzso imaging, because it may allow for zzso zzso imaging after administration of a small volume in a narrow zzso
