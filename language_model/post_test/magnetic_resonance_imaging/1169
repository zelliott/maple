To examine the role of motor areas in speech perception, we carried out a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study in which subjects listened passively to zzso and produced the same speech zzso zzso to speech activated zzso a superior portion of zzso zzso zzso that largely overlapped a speech production motor area centered just zzso on the border of zzso areas zzso and 6, which we distinguished from a more zzso speech production area centered in area zzso Our findings support the view that the motor system is recruited in mapping acoustic zzso to a phonetic zzso
