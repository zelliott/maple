Rapid object visual categorization in briefly flashed natural scenes is influenced by the surrounding zzso The neural zzso underlying reduced categorization performance in response to zzso zzso associations remain unclear and were investigated in the present study using zzso Participants were instructed to categorize objects in briefly presented scenes zzso zzso Half of the scenes consisted of objects pasted in an expected zzso context, whereas for the other half, objects were embedded in zzso zzso Object categorization was more accurate and faster in zzso relative to zzso zzso Moreover, we found that the two types of scenes zzso different patterns of cerebral zzso In particular, the processing of zzso scenes induced increased zzso in the zzso cortex, as well as in the right frontal zzso This higher activity may indicate additional neural processing of the novel zzso zzso contextual associations that were inherent to the zzso zzso Moreover, our results suggest that the locus of object categorization impairment due to contextual zzso is in the right anterior zzso zzso zzso in this region activity was correlated with the reaction time increase observed with zzso zzso zzso for associations between objects and their usual context of appearance might be zzso in the right anterior zzso zzso
