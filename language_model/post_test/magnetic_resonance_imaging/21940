To compare the sensitivity of conventional zzso fast zzso fast zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso zzso MR sequences in the detection of multiple sclerosis zzso 

Conventional zzso fast zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were performed on a zzso MR zzso in seven patients with clinically zzso multiple zzso The images in each sequence were evaluated by two zzso and consensus was reached by zzso 

In comparing conventional zzso with fast zzso zzso five zzso were seen only by conventional zzso and 63 were seen only by fast zzso in comparing conventional zzso with fast zzso zzso 18 zzso were seen only by conventional zzso and 109 only by fast zzso in comparing conventional zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso were seen only by conventional zzso and seven only by zzso zzso zzso in comparing fast zzso with fast zzso zzso 45 zzso were seen only by fast zzso and 52 only by fast zzso 

Fast zzso and fast zzso sequences improve the sensitivity of MR imaging in the detection of multiple sclerosis zzso with reduced acquisition time as compared with conventional zzso zzso These sequences should therefore be considered for serial studies in patients with multiple zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso was inferior to the other zzso but its reduced acquisition time could make this technique the ideal choice for patients who cannot tolerate longer examination zzso
