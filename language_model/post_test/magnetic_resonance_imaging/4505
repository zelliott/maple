zzso zzso selective zzso zzso rely on the accuracy of zzso zzso to achieve desired zzso zzso Unfortunately, the high zzso zzso and zzso required by these zzso often lead to distortion of the zzso produced by imaging systems resulting in poor selection zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso zzso used to determine the actual trajectory produced by the zzso field zzso is extended to two spatial zzso This measured information is then incorporated in a selective zzso design technique for correcting the zzso pulse envelopes to compensate for zzso zzso induced distortion of the zzso zzso
