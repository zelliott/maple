CT is considered the gold standard imaging zzso for measurement of visceral zzso tissue zzso However, as CT imaging exposes subjects to zzso radiation, a comparable imaging technique without this exposure is desirable, such as zzso zzso we compared the agreement of measures of visceral zzso tissue and subcutaneous zzso tissue area from zzso images obtained at the zzso using a 3 T zzso scanner with zzso images obtained via CT zzso 

64 images were obtained from 27 subjects who underwent zzso and CT scanning on the same day, after zzso hours of zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso were manually separated and zzso using a zzso zzso software zzso 

We found good agreement between CT and zzso for the measurement of both visceral zzso tissue and subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso difference analysis demonstrated a mean bias of zzso (as a portion of total abdominal zzso for visceral zzso tissue and zzso for subcutaneous zzso zzso as measured by zzso compared with zzso 

zzso is a safe, accurate and precise imaging zzso for measuring both visceral and subcutaneous zzso zzso making it a zzso alternative to CT for zzso of these zzso zzso
