zzso invasive techniques are gaining popularity for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a relatively new procedure that uses zzso energy to disintegrate and zzso the disc zzso The purpose of this study is to examine the early zzso zzso changes after zzso zzso and to assess the short-term effects of this procedure on zzso lower back pain and leg zzso 

Twenty nine patients between the ages of 32 and 59 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso Visual zzso zzso zzso scores of the patients were recorded in the zzso period and 24 hours, 3 months and 6 months after the zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso examinations of these patients were zzso 

The mean zzso zzso score was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean zzso zzso scores at 24 hours, 3 months and 6 months were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were statistically significant reductions zzso zzso zzso in zzso scores for all zzso time points when compared to zzso zzso zzso did not produce obvious changes at least on the early zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso appeared to be a safe minimally invasive zzso the value of this new technique for the treatment of zzso zzso pain remains as yet zzso Further zzso zzso studies with longer follow-up are needed to zzso the effects of zzso on zzso low back and leg zzso
