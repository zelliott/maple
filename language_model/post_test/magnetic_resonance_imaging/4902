Study zzso zzso zzso Level of Evidence zzso What's known on the zzso And what does the study zzso zzso are available that combine clinical and biopsy findings to predict the probability of zzso insignificant prostate cancer in patients with clinically low-risk zzso Based on data from patients with zzso score 6, clinical stage zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our group developed the first zzso models for predicting insignificant prostate cancer that incorporated clinical data, detailed biopsy data and findings from zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso When tested zzso these MR models performed significantly better than standard clinical models with and without detailed biopsy zzso We zzso validated the previously published zzso zzso models in a population of patients with zzso score 6, clinical stage zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on data from this same population, we also developed two new models for predicting insignificant prostate cancer that combine MR findings and clinical data without detailed biopsy zzso Upon initial testing, the new MR models performed significantly better than a clinical model lacking detailed biopsy zzso 

zzso To validate previously published zzso for predicting insignificant prostate cancer zzso that incorporate clinical data, percentage of biopsy zzso positive zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso We also designed new zzso models incorporating magnetic resonance results and clinical data without detailed biopsy zzso zzso for predicting insignificant zzso can help physicians counsel patients with clinically low-risk disease who are choosing between active surveillance and definitive zzso 

zzso In total, 181 low-risk zzso patients zzso stage zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso biopsy zzso score of 6) had zzso before zzso zzso For zzso and zzso the probability of insignificant zzso was recorded zzso and independently by two zzso on a scale from 0 zzso zzso to 3 zzso significant zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined on surgical zzso zzso There were four models incorporating zzso or zzso and clinical data with and without zzso that were compared with a base clinical model without zzso and a more comprehensive clinical model with zzso zzso accuracy was assessed using areas under zzso characteristic zzso 

zzso At pathology, zzso of patients had insignificant zzso and the zzso score was upgraded in zzso of zzso zzso For both readers, all magnetic resonance models performed significantly better than the base clinical model zzso zzso zzso for all) and similarly to the more comprehensive clinical zzso 

zzso zzso models incorporating magnetic resonance data, clinical data and zzso for predicting the probability of insignificant zzso were zzso zzso All zzso models performed significantly better than the base clinical zzso
