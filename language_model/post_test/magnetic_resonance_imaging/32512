zzso spin labeling zzso data are typically zzso sometimes after zzso as part of zzso before statistical analysis in zzso While this process can reduce the number of time points by half, it zzso the subsequent signal and noise models zzso smoothed zzso zzso and white zzso In this paper, we argue that zzso data are best viewed in the same data zzso framework as zzso zzso data, in that all scans are modeled and colored noise is zzso The data are not zzso but the zzso effect is implicitly built into the zzso While the models using zzso data may seem easier to zzso we show that zzso models fit with ordinary least squares either produce biased estimates of the standard errors or suffer from a loss in zzso The main disadvantage to our approach is that zzso noise must be modeled in order to yield accurate standard zzso however, this is a standard problem that has been solved for zzso data, and the very same software can be used to account for such zzso zzso
