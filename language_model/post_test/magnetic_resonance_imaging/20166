To zzso the mechanism behind D wave zzso changes after surgical correction of zzso 

We collected D wave and muscle zzso data from 93 patients (78 female, 15 male, age range zzso years, mean age zzso zzso who underwent surgical correction of zzso D waves were recorded via a zzso zzso inserted zzso through the zzso Muscle zzso from lower limb muscles were also zzso Muscle zzso wave were zzso by short zzso zzso electrical zzso zzso were zzso through bilateral zzso stimulation of the zzso nerves at the ankle and an averaged response from 100 to 200 single sweeps were recorded over the scalp at zzso In addition, we analyzed zzso obtained X-ray images of the spine in 9 patients and zzso spinal zzso in two of those zzso 

After surgical correction of zzso in 25 of 93 zzso patients, the D wave zzso changed by more than zzso of its baseline zzso A zzso change occurred in 21 zzso and an incremental change in 4 zzso zzso D wave zzso of more than 50% were observed in 5 patients without significant zzso changes in any of these zzso In 9 patients, zzso obtained zzso of the spine zzso and after correction of spine zzso showed no zzso zzso Muscle zzso did not change and zzso zzso status was zzso In 2 patients, zzso zzso revealed displacement of the spinal zzso towards the zzso side of the zzso zzso 

During zzso surgery, D wave zzso changes should be interpreted cautiously until the definitive zzso of these changes are zzso One possible mechanism to explain D wave changes during zzso correction could involve rotation of the spinal zzso within the spinal canal, and the relative position of the zzso recording zzso zzso zzso of the spinal zzso after correction of zzso could introduce a new relationship between the zzso and the zzso tracts zzso Due to high zzso of false D wave zzso changes we suggest that this methodology should not be used to assess the functional integrity of the zzso during zzso zzso 

This study provides new insight into the methodology of D wave monitoring as well as strong evidence of a high zzso of false positive results using D wave monitoring during surgical correction of zzso
