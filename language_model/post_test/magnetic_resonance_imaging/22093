The three-dimensional zzso zzso of zzso bone is frequently zzso using computer zzso However, there are no standardized zzso of zzso programs and many variations are zzso Even though programs may use the same basic method, results can be significantly different because of differences in zzso zzso data from different laboratories therefore may not be zzso The method of directed zzso with parallel plate zzso is commonly used to zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of several variations in the zzso of this method on zzso of zzso plate number zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance images of 10 bovine zzso bone specimens were analyzed using several variations of the directed zzso zzso An analysis of zzso with repeated measures suggested that variations in the zzso used to count test line zzso variations in the criteria used to zzso a test coordinate as bone or zzso and variations in the number of test grid zzso had significant effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso The largest difference in zzso zzso was due to the method used to count test line zzso with the bone-marrow zzso Variations in the zzso zzso and variations in the number of test line grid zzso resulted in a zzso difference in zzso The spacing of the test line zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso and all differences were independent of volume fraction zzso zzso zzso These data show that there can be significant differences in zzso bone zzso zzso due only to the method used for the zzso To facilitate comparisons between laboratories, we have made validated computer programs to measure zzso bone zzso available over the zzso
