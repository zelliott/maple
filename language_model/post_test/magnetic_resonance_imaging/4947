The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain processes associated with the zzso of socially zzso zzso It is tested whether the zzso of zzso speech is solely related to brain areas associated with classical stop signal tasks or rather also involves brain areas involved in zzso zzso During the experiment, subjects had to do a zzso task, which was designed to elicit taboo or neutral zzso Here we show that the internal zzso of taboo words activates the right inferior frontal zzso an area that has previously been associated with zzso triggered zzso This finding strongly suggests that external social rules become zzso and act as a zzso
