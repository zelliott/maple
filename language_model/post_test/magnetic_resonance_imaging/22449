In this article the authors report the zzso of an expanded compact zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso that is designed to overcome significant limitations of an earlier zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a stronger magnetic field than its predecessor zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso a wider gap between magnet zzso and an zzso improved zzso zzso The additional time needed in the operating room zzso for use of zzso imaging and the number of sessions per patient were zzso zzso accuracy of the integrated navigational tool was assessed using a zzso zzso Of the 55 patients who have undergone surgery in the zzso zzso device, diagnoses included zzso in 13, zzso in 12, zzso zzso in nine, other skull base zzso in seven, and zzso other zzso The extra time required for use of the system averaged zzso hours zzso zzso zzso Imaging sessions averaged zzso per surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso accuracy revealed that zzso images were the most zzso zzso slices yielded measurably greater zzso although this was of questionable clinical significance (all sequences zzso or zzso zzso had a mean error of zzso or zzso zzso zzso The position of the phantom in the center compared with the periphery of the magnetic field did not affect accuracy zzso error zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso appears to make zzso zzso with a zzso magnet much more practical than it was with the first-generation zzso Greater ease of positioning resulted in a decrease in added time in the OR and encouraged a larger number of imaging zzso
