In juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso zzso changes in the zzso and zzso fluid zzso are pathological findings responsible for damage to the zzso tissue and zzso bone, which are late zzso findings in conventional zzso Early detection of these joint changes would allow the clinicians to initiate relevant therapies as is essential for the long-term outcome of zzso zzso zzso has shown great potential for this purpose but validation in a pediatric setting is zzso The objective of this study was to validate US zzso of cartilage thickness in target zzso in healthy children by comparing them with zzso 

Twenty-five healthy Caucasian children (17 zzso 8 zzso mean age zzso years, were examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso and US zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 - 14 zzso linear zzso in the right knee, ankle, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso US was obtained according to the zzso standard zzso 

All differences in cartilage thickness zzso between zzso and US were less than zzso zzso The zzso of variation zzso was found to be good (16 zzso except for in the case of the wrist joint (20 zzso 

We found a good level of agreement and no significant systematic joint zzso differences in cartilage thickness zzso between zzso and zzso US appears to be a feasible method for evaluating cartilage thickness in zzso target zzso especially when age and sex-related references are zzso
