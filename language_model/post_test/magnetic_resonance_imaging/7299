Alzheimer's disease zzso has a long zzso phase in which zzso and zzso cerebral pathology accumulate without producing cognitive zzso zzso state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that brain networks degrade during symptomatic zzso It is unclear to what extent these zzso exist before symptomatic zzso In this study, we investigated graph theory metrics of functional integration zzso zzso functional segregation zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso as a function of disease zzso Further, we assessed whether these graph metrics were affected in cognitively normal participants with zzso fluid evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not path zzso were reduced in zzso zzso normal participants who zzso zzso zzso pathology also showed reduced values in these graph measures, demonstrating brain changes similar to, but smaller than, symptomatic zzso Only zzso was significantly affected by zzso We also demonstrate that zzso has a particular effect on zzso regions in the zzso We conclude that zzso causes large-scale zzso that is present before onset of zzso
