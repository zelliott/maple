zzso imaging has a number of advantages for fast imaging, including an efficient use of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso blurring is zzso to the data acquisition zzso In this paper, we combine spiral data acquisition with a zzso echo zzso This allows a long data acquisition zzso per zzso while limiting the effects of zzso Long spiral zzso zzso are zzso into smaller, zzso ring zzso Each of these zzso rings is acquired during echoes of a zzso echo zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso periodically zzso zzso spins while building a long data zzso We describe both zzso single zzso and zzso zzso spiral zzso A typical sequence acquires a complete data set in three zzso (32 zzso zzso 192 zzso 192 zzso At a zzso zzso 2000 zzso we can average two acquisitions in an easy zzso zzso A zzso reconstruction zzso zzso the effects of any zzso zzso Though this zzso needs a field map, we demonstrate how signal averaging can provide the necessary phase data while increasing zzso The field map creation causes no scan time penalty and essentially no loss in zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso scans acquired on a conventional zzso system demonstrate the zzso
