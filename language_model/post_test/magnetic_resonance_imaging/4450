zzso resonance imaging of the zzso has been, limited by a series of artifacts with a resulting poor contrast to noise zzso Nevertheless, technological progress has allowed to reduce not only scanning time but also the number of artifacts, by increasing the number of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, tissue contrast can now be zzso In our study performed on 5 normal volunteers and 20 patients with different pancreatic diseases conditions, fast zzso sequences with and without fat suppression were used, with an overall increase in contrast to noise zzso In all patients MR images allowed the accurate definition of the zzso in 8 zzso patients the zzso could be zzso including the 2 zzso CT had poorly zzso Also in the 3 patients with zzso tumors, zzso depicted small tumors which were later confirmed at zzso This new protocol makes zzso a very sensitive and accurate tool in the study of zzso and inflammatory pancreatic diseases thus, zzso is not only a complementary tool to CT but an even better study zzso In particular, its higher contrast to noise ratio allows a dramatic improvement in the depiction of small solid zzso especially those not altering pancreatic zzso This study proves that zzso when adequately performed, is a very accurate tool to study, in a very short time, the zzso and zzso region, yielding much better results than all the other diagnostic imaging zzso
