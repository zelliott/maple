Resistance exercise has been proposed as an aid to counteract zzso muscle zzso in astronauts during extended missions in zzso While space authorities have advocated the squat exercise should be zzso no exercise system suitable for zzso use has been validated with regard to zzso muscle zzso We compared muscle involvement in the zzso zzso zzso squat using free weights and a zzso dependent zzso resistance exercise device designed for use in zzso 

The subjects were 10 zzso men who performed 5 sets of 10 repetitions using the zzso squat zzso 10 repetition zzso or zzso squat zzso each repetition zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and surface zzso zzso techniques assessed zzso muscle zzso zzso contrast shift of MR images was measured by means of zzso relaxation time zzso zzso root mean square zzso was measured during concentric zzso and eccentric zzso actions and zzso to zzso zzso determined during zzso voluntary zzso 

The zzso muscle group showed greater zzso zzso increase following zzso compared with zzso Among individual muscles, the zzso zzso displayed greater zzso increase with zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no difference across exercise zzso 

zzso the results of this study suggest that zzso muscle use in the squat is comparable, if not greater, with zzso compared with free weight resistance zzso Data appear to provide support for use of zzso squat resistance exercise as a zzso adjunct during zzso
