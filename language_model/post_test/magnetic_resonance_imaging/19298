The goal of this investigation was to describe the zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in a patient with an zzso zzso that extensively infiltrated the cerebral zzso especially over the frontal zzso 

zzso zzso are rare tumors that have been reported to involve the zzso matter in only a small number of zzso In most of the reported zzso the zzso zzso were successfully treated with a combination of surgery and zzso without prominent cognitive zzso 

zzso of the brain and zzso tests were conducted approximately 13 months after the patient underwent zzso In addition, measures of frontal lobe personality characteristics were obtained before and after zzso 

zzso findings revealed extensive enhancement around the anterior frontal zzso and prominent involvement of the anterior zzso zzso zzso from zzso testing indicated mild to moderately impaired performance on tests of working memory, complex attention, and cognitive zzso Further, the patient reported experiencing personality changes consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction as part of the initial symptoms of the disease, which remained unchanged after zzso 

Our findings are the first to describe cognitive zzso of zzso zzso In addition, results from this case study reveal that zzso of the frontal zzso produce personality changes similar to those observed in patients with significant frontal lobe zzso Finally, zzso that significantly zzso the frontal zzso may be insensitive to zzso and result in residual cognitive and personality zzso
