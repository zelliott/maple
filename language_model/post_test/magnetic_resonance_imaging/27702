Parkinson's disease zzso is surprisingly zzso some patients have a prominent resting zzso while others never develop this zzso Here we investigate whether the functional organization of the voluntary motor system differs between zzso patients with and without resting zzso and whether these differences relate to the cerebral circuit producing zzso We compared 18 zzso patients with marked zzso 20 zzso patients without zzso and 19 healthy zzso zzso performed a controlled motor imagery task during zzso zzso We zzso zzso cerebral activity by contrasting imagery of zzso difficult and easy zzso zzso activity was identified by relating cerebral activity to fluctuations in zzso zzso using zzso during zzso zzso patients with zzso had better behavioral performance than zzso patients without zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso patients showed increased zzso activity in zzso area zzso as compared with both healthy controls and to zzso zzso zzso This effect was independent from zzso activity, which was localized to the motor cortex, zzso and zzso zzso intermediate nucleus zzso The zzso with known projections to area zzso was unique in showing both zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso influences motor imagery by modulating central zzso processing through the zzso This mechanism may explain clinical differences between zzso patients with and without zzso
