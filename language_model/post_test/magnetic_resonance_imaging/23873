zzso evaluation of zzso in patients with zzso can give more information than qualitative zzso Previously developed zzso methods identified subtle widespread structural changes in the zzso beyond the zzso zzso in patients with zzso of cortical development zzso and zzso sclerosis zzso and also in zzso patients with juvenile zzso zzso zzso This study evaluates a zzso automated analysis of structural zzso in zzso After fully automated zzso of cerebral gray matter from structural zzso high-resolution zzso scans, we applied the automated and objective technique of statistical zzso mapping zzso to the analysis of gray matter of 35 control subjects, 10 patients with partial zzso and zzso 10 patients with left zzso lobe zzso zzso and zzso 10 patients with left zzso and normal MR zzso of the zzso and 20 patients with zzso At a corrected threshold of P zzso zzso significant abnormalities were found in zzso zzso in all 10 patients with zzso 6 of whom had additional zzso beyond the margins of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients with zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Group comparisons between control subjects and HS patients identified the affected left zzso lobe with an increase in gray matter in the zzso zzso zzso but did not identify zzso zzso The group of zzso zzso patients showed no abnormalities compared with control zzso Group comparison between control subjects and zzso patients identified a zzso frontal increase in gray zzso The zzso zzso comparison of gray matter distribution identified zzso and abnormalities beyond the zzso zzso in individual zzso zzso The method did not reliably identify HS in individual patients or identify abnormalities in individual zzso patients with zzso or zzso in a proportion larger than the chance findings in the control zzso Using group zzso structural abnormalities in the zzso gray matter of patients with zzso and HS were zzso to the affected zzso zzso In patients with zzso as a group, an increase in gray matter was localized to the zzso frontal area, corroborating earlier quantitative zzso zzso
