The perception of brightness depends on spatial zzso the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds zzso A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the zzso of a stimulus can also alter its zzso Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated zzso purer in zzso appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same zzso Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than zzso yellow and green zzso This zzso relationship between stimulus intensity and zzso called the zzso zzso effect, was first described in the zzso century but has never been zzso Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this zzso to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple zzso ideal observer model of the human visual zzso We also use zzso brain scans to identify the neural zzso of brightness without changing the spatial context of the zzso which has complicated the interpretation of related zzso zzso 

Rather than zzso human vision directly, we use a zzso ideal observer to model human visual zzso We show that the zzso effect is a result of zzso the zzso statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the zzso We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone zzso which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to zzso the statistics of zzso Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual zzso zzso if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of zzso (as opposed to their zzso zzso with activity in zzso as measured with zzso 

The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of zzso as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal zzso While the responses of the early visual system zzso in this zzso may represent specifically the statistics of images, post zzso responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and zzso A zzso of this suggestion is that the visual zzso is adapted to relate the retinal image to zzso given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal zzso the visual zzso is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world zzso
