zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging have respectively decreased the zzso of exploratory zzso by zzso to zzso then zzso after their successive inclusion in the assessment of the zzso of lung zzso Based on a systematic comparison of CT and zzso with exploratory zzso in 111 patients, the yield, sensitivity and positive zzso value of these examinations was assessed in relation to zzso extension to various sites: to the chest wall, for which the sensitivity was poor zzso for CT, zzso for zzso with a moderate zzso value zzso for CT, zzso for zzso to the zzso with improved sensitivity zzso and zzso but an uncertain zzso value zzso and zzso The sensitivity and zzso value were then measured for zzso zzso zzso zzso moderate sensitivity zzso and zzso but a good zzso value zzso and zzso zzso and zzso good sensitivity zzso and zzso but a poor zzso value zzso and zzso Apart from a few particular indications specific to zzso especially in the zzso left zzso and in contact with the atrium, the efficacy of these two investigations is very zzso However, their lack of specificity means that certain exploratory zzso are still justified in order to assess the zzso of the zzso A surgical or zzso anatomical assessment is still necessary for a good zzso of zzso zzso extension of lung zzso
