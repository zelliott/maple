Experimental correlation study design to zzso features of disc health, including signal intensity and distinction between the zzso zzso and nucleus zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and correlate with the functional mechanics in corresponding motion zzso 

zzso the relationship between disc health assessed by quantitative zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso 

zzso leads to altered zzso in the disc, affecting the mechanical zzso Clinical routine zzso sequences are not adequate in detecting early changes in zzso and fails to correlate with pain or improve patient zzso zzso zzso relaxation time mapping zzso zzso features and may offer more sensitivity in assessing disc zzso 

zzso zzso spines were zzso using quantitative zzso zzso as well as conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso were graded by the zzso scale, and features of disc health, including signal intensity zzso intensity zzso and distinction between the zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso zone zzso were zzso by zzso Each motion segment was subjected to pure moment zzso to determine range of motion zzso neutral zone zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso intensity area and transition zone slope were significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso intensity area was also correlated with lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grade was only correlated with lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mapping is a sensitive quantitative method capable of detecting changes associated with disc zzso Features of disc health zzso with zzso predicted altered functional mechanics of the zzso spine better than traditional zzso zzso This new methodology and analysis technique may enhance the assessment of zzso and enable greater patient zzso for therapeutic zzso
