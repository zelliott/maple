We present a novel zzso zzso based on a hybrid approach that combines watershed zzso and zzso surface zzso Our method takes advantage of the zzso of the former as well as the surface information available to the zzso The zzso first zzso a single white matter zzso in a zzso zzso image, and uses it to create a global minimum in the white matter before applying a watershed zzso with a zzso zzso The watershed zzso builds an initial estimate of the brain volume based on the three-dimensional connectivity of the white zzso This first step is zzso and performs well in the presence of intensity zzso and noise, but may zzso parts of the zzso that abut bright zzso structures such as the eye zzso or may remove parts of the zzso To correct these zzso a surface deformation process fits a smooth surface to the masked volume, allowing the incorporation of geometric constraints into the zzso zzso A statistical atlas, generated from a set of accurately segmented zzso is used to validate and potentially correct the zzso and the zzso intensity values are locally zzso at the boundary of the zzso Finally, a high-resolution surface deformation is performed that accurately matches the outer boundary of the brain, resulting in a robust and automated zzso Studies by our group and others outperform other publicly available zzso zzso
