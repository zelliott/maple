At separate institutions, pattern reversal visual evoked zzso zzso were recorded in children and older patients with zzso and compared with zzso of the zzso In nine patients aged less than 14 years, who were still on a diet low in zzso zzso were clearly abnormal in only one and the abnormalities seen on zzso were zzso In 27 patients aged zzso years zzso were abnormal in more than zzso with significant reduction of zzso and zzso of zzso despite the general absence of visual symptoms and abnormalities on routine zzso zzso Among the older patients there was no significant correlation between zzso measures and plasma zzso or zzso zzso neither was the zzso of zzso abnormalities dependent on whether or not the patients were still on a low zzso zzso Some zzso zzso measures were zzso correlated with the zzso zzso score, perhaps reflecting the severity of white matter abnormalities in the zzso zzso In the older patients the zzso of zzso to stimulation of the central 8 degrees of the visual field was significantly correlated with zzso The study confirms the high zzso of zzso visual zzso involvement in older children and adults with zzso and suggests the possibility of a link between the abnormal appearance of zzso white matter on zzso and a zzso index of function of the zzso As there was no evidence of general intellectual decline, it is suggested that the correlation between central field zzso zzso and zzso may reflect abnormal development during zzso zzso on zzso on the other hand, seem to be more closely related to current dietary state and zzso zzso
