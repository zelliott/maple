In specific clinical situations, zzso offer better zzso than the microscope during acoustic zzso zzso zzso surgery and can therefore decrease the zzso of the zzso complications of zzso fluid zzso leakage and recurrence of zzso This study was undertaken to determine if the use of zzso zzso provides complementary information to the operating surgeon during surgery for acoustic zzso 

zzso patients with acoustic zzso underwent tumor zzso by two zzso zzso zzso together with their respective zzso partners, via a zzso zzso approach zzso zzso zzso zzso approach zzso zzso zzso or middle zzso zzso approach zzso zzso zzso zzso with a rigid glass lens zzso was used during tumor removal to examine zzso zzso zzso structures, and after tumor zzso to inspect the internal auditory canal zzso inner ear, and middle ear, depending on the approach zzso One of the authors zzso has not used zzso zzso during zzso via the zzso and middle zzso zzso approaches, and therefore, these cases were excluded from the data collection and zzso 

Complete tumor zzso was achieved in 73 zzso zzso allowed improved identification of tumor and adjacent zzso relationships in all zzso In addition, residual tumor at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and exposed air cells zzso zzso 24) not seen with the microscope during zzso approaches were identified zzso In one of the zzso cases, the zzso allowed identification of open air cells not zzso with the zzso None of the 78 patients developed zzso zzso zzso the zzso did not significantly increase operative zzso 

zzso can be performed safely during surgery to remove acoustic zzso The zzso use of zzso may offer some advantages including improved zzso more complete tumor zzso and a lowered risk of zzso zzso
