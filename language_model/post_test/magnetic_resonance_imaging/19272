We have evaluated the addition of zzso a precursor of zzso oxide, to a zzso solution (named zzso designed for long-term heart zzso 

zzso zzso rat hearts zzso zzso zzso were arrested with the zzso solution either with zzso or without zzso (2 zzso zzso group, zzso zzso 12, vs control group zzso zzso 10), submitted to 8 hours of cold storage (4 degrees zzso in the solution, and then zzso for 60 minutes at 37 degrees zzso In 11 hearts, we evaluated the quality of cardiac preservation with zzso magnetic resonance zzso and the measure of function and cellular zzso zzso and independent zzso were measured in 11 other hearts, using zzso and zzso to assess zzso and smooth muscle zzso 

Adding zzso to the zzso solution improved functional recovery during zzso as shown by the rate pressure product zzso zzso zzso for control vs zzso zzso zzso for zzso p zzso zzso together with higher coronary flow and diminished zzso zzso release in coronary zzso during zzso was lower in the zzso zzso During zzso and zzso zzso of zzso pH and zzso zzso were similar in both zzso zzso zzso zzso was similarly impaired in both groups, but smooth muscle was less altered with zzso 

As an additive to the zzso zzso solution, zzso provides a protective effect for long-term heart zzso Our data do not show coronary zzso protection as the prominent zzso
