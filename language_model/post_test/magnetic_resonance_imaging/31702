The zzso implications of zzso following zzso of the human zzso are only incompletely zzso We performed a zzso statistical analysis of zzso documented on zzso zzso in 49 zzso recruited patients with acute zzso due to isolated unilateral zzso zzso For statistical analysis individual zzso zzso were zzso and imported in a three-dimensional zzso anatomical model of the human zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso to be associated with zzso of three distinct zzso zzso The strongest correlation referred to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affecting the inferior zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso base resulted in zzso limb zzso especially when zzso was accompanied by motor zzso In patients with bilateral zzso zzso were located in a zzso region between the upper zzso and lower zzso involving the zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso following zzso zzso may reflect three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso results from a zzso of the zzso zzso tract and the inferior zzso zzso conveying zzso information from the zzso arm and zzso zzso zzso zzso cause zzso and not bilateral zzso presumably due to major damage to the descending zzso projections and zzso base zzso while already crossed zzso zzso are not completely zzso zzso Finally, bilateral zzso probably reflects a zzso of zzso zzso on a central, zzso zzso zzso
