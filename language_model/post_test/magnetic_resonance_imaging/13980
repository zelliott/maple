A detailed analysis has been carried out of the correlation between the signals detected by zzso in the rat lung after zzso or zzso challenge and parameters of inflammation determined in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals after zzso correlated highly significantly with the zzso fluid zzso number, zzso zzso activity and protein zzso Similar highly significant correlations were seen when the zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso In contrast, following zzso challenge, zzso was the sole zzso fluid zzso that correlated significantly with the long lasting signal detected by zzso Since zzso is an integral component of pulmonary zzso zzso provides a zzso means of monitoring the course of the inflammatory response and should prove invaluable in profiling zzso drugs in zzso Further, the prospect of zzso detecting a sustained zzso zzso zzso in the lung brings an important new perspective to models of chronic zzso pulmonary zzso
