zzso action selection requires knowledge about how alternative actions impact the zzso a zzso zzso of instrumental zzso zzso learning theories formalize this map as a set of zzso relationships between actions and states, such that for any given action considered in a current state, a probability distribution is specified over possible outcome zzso Here, we show that activity in the human inferior zzso zzso zzso with the divergence of such outcome zzso measure that reflects whether discrimination between alternative actions increases the zzso of the zzso further, that this effect is zzso from those of other information zzso and motivational zzso such as outcome zzso action values, and outcome zzso Our results suggest that, although ultimately combined with reward estimates to generate action values, outcome probability zzso associated with alternative actions may be contrasted independently of zzso zzso to narrow the scope of the action selection zzso
