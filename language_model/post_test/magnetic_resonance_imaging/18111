Diabetes zzso zzso is associated with brain zzso and vascular brain zzso zzso disease is a key zzso in this zzso We assessed whether zzso increased the rate of progression of brain zzso vascular brain zzso and cognitive decline in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso 

In zzso patients zzso from the zzso study zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso examination were performed at baseline and after zzso zzso 

zzso measures zzso zzso for age, sex, and vascular risk zzso showed that patients with zzso had smaller total brain volume zzso differences as percentage of zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso smaller gray matter volume zzso zzso zzso larger zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and larger white matter zzso volume zzso zzso zzso than patients without zzso Patients with zzso had accelerated increase in zzso volume over time compared with patients without zzso zzso differences zzso volume as percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that patients with zzso had an increased risk for incident brain zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with and without zzso had similar performance on zzso 

zzso on top of existing symptomatic zzso disease is associated with increased brain zzso and vascular brain zzso load that proceed at a slightly higher rate than in patients without zzso
