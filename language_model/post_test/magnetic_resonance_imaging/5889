zzso of coronary zzso is of clinical importance for patient management and prediction of long-term zzso However, there are few studies of the changes of magnetic resonance imaging after coronary zzso This study was designed to investigate the imaging of the left zzso using delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as well as the left zzso ejection fraction after coronary zzso in animal zzso 

Eight zzso of either sex zzso weight 21-25 zzso were used to make the coronary zzso zzso After coronary zzso a zzso infusion zzso was placed in the left anterior descending artery with the tip located between the second and third diagonal zzso zzso with the diameter of 42 zzso and mean dosage of zzso zzso zzso were selectively infused into the left anterior descending zzso First pass and stressed first pass zzso scan were performed after zzso images were zzso Then a second zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was given at a rate of 2 zzso Ten minutes later, delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images of the left zzso wall were zzso zzso changes of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was not observed at first pass zzso at the anterior wall of the left zzso zzso of the zzso and anterior wall of the left zzso was in evidence on delayed enhancement images 6 hours after zzso and disappeared one week zzso The characteristic change of coronary zzso on delayed contrast enhanced magnetic imaging was zzso regions within the zzso zzso Left zzso ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging decreased significantly from zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso at the sixth hour zzso zzso zzso and recovered to zzso zzso zzso one week later zzso zzso zzso vs 6th zzso Compared with baseline values, the left zzso end zzso volume enlarged significantly at 6th hour and at one week after zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased significantly at 6th hour zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it further increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso at one week after coronary zzso and was significantly higher than that at baseline zzso zzso zzso 

On delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, zzso of the zzso and anterior wall of the left zzso show at 6th hour but not at one week after coronary zzso This might represent the characteristic imaging after coronary zzso The left zzso ejection fraction decreased at 6th hour and recovered one week later after coronary zzso Although impairment of left zzso function could be recovered at 1 week after coronary zzso the left zzso zzso process still continued in concert with continuously zzso of serum zzso
