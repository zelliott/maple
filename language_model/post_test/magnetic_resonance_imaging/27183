We analyzed brain zzso data from zzso young adult twins to identify cortical regions in which gray matter thickness and volume are influenced by zzso This was achieved using an zzso structural equation model that divides the zzso of these traits, at each point on the cortex, into additive genetic zzso shared zzso and unique environmental zzso zzso A strong genetic influence was found in frontal and zzso zzso In addition, we correlated cortical thickness with zzso intelligence zzso for comparison with the zzso zzso and several regions where cortical structure was correlated with intelligence zzso are under genetic zzso These cortical measures may be useful zzso to narrow the search for quantitative trait zzso influencing brain zzso
