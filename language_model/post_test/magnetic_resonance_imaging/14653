To estimate the proportion of patients presenting with isolated third, fourth, or sixth zzso nerve zzso of presumed zzso origin versus other zzso 

zzso zzso zzso case zzso 

A total of 109 patients aged 50 years or older with acute isolated zzso motor nerve zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso of the zzso 

zzso of acute isolated zzso motor nerve zzso zzso zzso or zzso as determined with early zzso and clinical zzso 

Among 109 patients enrolled in the study, 22 had zzso nerve III zzso 25 had zzso nerve IV zzso and 62 had zzso nerve VI zzso A cause other than presumed zzso zzso was identified in 18 patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The presence of 1 or more zzso risk factors zzso hypertension, zzso coronary artery disease, zzso zzso stroke, and zzso was significantly associated with a presumed zzso cause zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso zzso risk factors were also present in zzso of patients zzso with other zzso In the group of patients who had zzso risk factors only, with no other significant medical condition, zzso of patients zzso were found to have other causes, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and giant cell zzso zzso By excluding patients with third zzso nerve zzso and those with zzso the zzso of other causes for isolated fourth and sixth zzso nerve zzso was zzso zzso 

In our series of patients with acute isolated zzso motor nerve zzso a substantial proportion of patients had other causes, including zzso zzso and brain stem zzso Brain zzso and laboratory zzso have a role in the initial evaluation of older patients with isolated acute zzso motor nerve zzso regardless of whether vascular risk factors are zzso
