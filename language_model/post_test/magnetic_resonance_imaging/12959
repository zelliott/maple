To identify and review available evidence on the diagnostic yield of brain zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images zzso in zzso zzso and examine yield in our own institution zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso to October 2007) and zzso zzso to October 2007), we identified and analyzed studies that examined imaging yields in zzso zzso yield being defined as the percentage of scans showing abnormalities that may result in zzso We also zzso analyzed diagnostic yields in 46 patients hospitalized in our institution between 2001 and 2006 for zzso zzso 

Five studies were deemed zzso Including our own series, the sample comprised zzso CT and 184 zzso zzso Point estimate for diagnostic yield was zzso for CT and zzso for zzso zzso These yields likely overestimate clinical usefulness of zzso zzso scans also resulted in a zzso number of zzso clinically irrelevant zzso 

In zzso zzso routine CT or zzso scans are of little benefit and should be reserved for situations where history or examination suggests neurological zzso or possibly for people aged 50 years and zzso
