A method has been developed using techniques from partially parallel imaging zzso to detect localized inconsistencies in zzso that are caused by certain types of zzso The inconsistent data are discarded and consistent data zzso from the remaining data using zzso zzso The price is a small decrease in zzso ratio zzso and additional zzso An zzso scheme is presented which does not require separately acquired zzso sensitivity information for the zzso zzso This method has been found to reduce artifact levels in phantom and in zzso test zzso
