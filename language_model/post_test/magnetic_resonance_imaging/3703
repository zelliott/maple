Age has been reported to influence zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Nevertheless, it is not yet fully understood which brain regions are responsible for these zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso on the zzso potential and the simultaneously acquired zzso signal of functional zzso 32 healthy male subjects were investigated using an auditory oddball zzso The functional zzso data were acquired in zzso zzso to the zzso The evoked potential data were recorded during the intervals in between MR image acquisitions in order to reduce the influence of the scanner noise on the presentation of the tones and to reduce zzso zzso The zzso were calculated by means of zzso zzso In addition, brain regions modulated by the zzso zzso variation of the zzso were identified zzso trial zzso The results indicated an age effect on the zzso zzso Younger subjects demonstrated increased zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso responses in a network of brain regions including the anterior and zzso zzso cortex, the zzso the zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso the zzso body, the zzso and the zzso zzso Single trial zzso of zzso and zzso indicated that zzso zzso were predominantly associated with neural responses in the anterior zzso cortex, the zzso and zzso brain zzso Taken together, the results indicate diminished neural responses in older compared to younger subjects especially in zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso
