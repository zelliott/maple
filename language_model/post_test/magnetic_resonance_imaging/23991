The aim of this pictorial review is to describe applications of zzso zzso using zzso zzso MR zzso 

350 patients were zzso over a four-year period with a zzso zzso zzso Vision scanner and a phased array body zzso The zzso MR sequence was applied in multiple planes with an acquisition time of 13 seconds allowing breath hold zzso In addition, a zzso technique provided single slice acquisitions with a thickness of 20 zzso A chemical fat suppression zzso reduced zzso MR high zzso 

zzso zzso accurately determines the presence of level of zzso obstruction in up to zzso of zzso Common zzso duct stones are detected with a sensitivity of zzso Acute zzso is depicted on zzso MR as zzso high signal in zzso zzso patients and zzso stones are detected with a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso offers a zzso rapid imaging method to evaluate the zzso common zzso duct and zzso Its zzso fluid sensitive capabilities are of particular value in detecting common zzso duct stones and acute zzso
