zzso lobe zzso zzso is considered primarily a zzso zzso Our purpose was to map zzso network organization in zzso and to statistically relate it to zzso zzso We performed zzso cortical thickness analysis in 110 zzso patients (including 68 patients with zzso zzso and 42 patients with normal zzso zzso and 46 healthy zzso zzso connectivity was statistically zzso by zzso mean thickness of the zzso zzso zzso with thickness at each zzso across the entire zzso The zzso was chosen as seed region since it is the link between the zzso and the zzso zzso Patients showed cortical thinning mainly in zzso and zzso zzso with a prevalence of zzso in up to zzso In controls, zzso networks corresponded closely to known anatomical zzso In zzso the pattern of correlations was similar to controls, suggesting that pathological processes in the zzso affect the same networks that zzso with the zzso in the healthy zzso Nevertheless, we found decreases in correlations mainly in the zzso lobe and increases mainly in zzso zzso Although our analysis indicated zzso in the zzso network in zzso there was no association between zzso connectivity and zzso across the entire cortical zzso This divergence zzso the complexity of the zzso mechanisms leading to zzso zzso in zzso
