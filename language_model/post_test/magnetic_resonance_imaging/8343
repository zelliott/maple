zzso of the different physiology and zzso markers present in tumor vessels is essential to enable both the development of new zzso zzso agents and of more specific imaging zzso zzso blood vessels are zzso irregular in zzso zzso and do not have specialized features of normal zzso zzso or zzso zzso tumor vessels have large gaps between or through cells, loose zzso and zzso or redundant layers within the basement zzso rendering these vessels zzso Furthermore, the zzso of tumor vessels may express unique markers on their zzso Imaging is becoming increasingly important in the evaluation of zzso Clinical imaging is minimally invasive and enables sampling of the whole tumor in a zzso zzso The patterns of increased zzso seen on Dynamic zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso mirror the known zzso defects associated with zzso zzso Conventional zzso weight contrast agents are currently in clinical use for zzso studies and have proven successful in detecting changes related to novel zzso zzso However, they are relatively zzso zzso contrast media may be more suitable for imaging tumor zzso It is hoped that imaging zzso can be adapted to specifically target markers expressed on the zzso of tumor zzso The number of cell surface markers of zzso is relatively low, and only small amounts of contrast agents can bind to these zzso currently only zzso zzso zzso zzso and Single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have sufficient sensitivity to allow detection at this low zzso Despite limitations in their spatial resolution, PET and zzso imaging are more likely to enter the clinic as targeted zzso imaging zzso The quest for selective targets on the tumor zzso continues, currently the zzso family of receptors offer the most promise but other targets are being pursued by zzso zzso analysis of gene expression or in zzso zzso display may help identify new, more selective, markers that can be zzso for the targeted imaging and treatment of zzso
