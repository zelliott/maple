The goals of this work were to evaluate the practical utility of zzso to zzso zzso mass in patients with zzso zzso zzso define the differences in zzso mass zzso obtained with three-dimensional and geometric MR methods in patients with normal left zzso zzso and in patients with wall zzso and establish the correlation between the two MR methods and the geometric zzso method zzso 

The same protocol was followed to conduct prospective MR examinations on 72 zzso In 60 of the subjects suspected to have zzso imaging was performed to confirm or rule out the preliminary clinical zzso the other 12 were healthy zzso zzso SE, single slice zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were performed in all zzso Left zzso mass was calculated using formulas that assume an zzso geometry for the left zzso zzso zzso and the results were compared with the mass found using the three-dimensional method and subsequent application of Simpson zzso Tests were run to evaluate zzso zzso in the MR data obtained with the three-dimensional zzso The zzso obtained with the two MR methods were compared with the results obtained with zzso 

Although the mean left zzso mass values obtained using the three-dimensional MR method were smaller than the mean values found with the geometric MR method in all patients, the difference was significant only in patients with zzso The correlation between the geometric MR method and zzso was very good both in patients with zzso and in those with normal wall zzso The correlation between the three-dimensional MR method and zzso was good in patients whose left zzso zzso was normal and poor in patients with zzso zzso agreement for three-dimensional mass values was zzso 

MR examinations should be a standard technique for calculating zzso zzso zzso In patients with normal zzso wall zzso the geometric method can be used to calculate zzso mass because it is less time zzso However, in patients with abnormal zzso of the left zzso and/or zzso wall zzso such as found in zzso in whom the geometric method zzso zzso mass, zzso should be made using the three-dimensional zzso
