The advantages of array zzso imaging in human zzso MR systems are well known and have gained relevance in many applications and MR zzso In the field of zzso studies, this concept has become increasingly zzso In this work, three different zzso coils for performing zzso on mice are zzso For imaging at 300 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso One zzso and a zzso zzso setup operating at 750 zzso show the feasibility of array zzso imaging at zzso zzso All of these coils show excellent performance and deliver high-quality MR images of zzso
