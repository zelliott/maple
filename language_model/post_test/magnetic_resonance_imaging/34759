In order to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging zzso changes in correlation with different degrees of internal zzso of the zzso joint, we evaluated 117 zzso of 59 symptomatic patients and 31 zzso Data analysis included zzso and zzso zzso Sixteen zzso zzso were considered normal, 40 demonstrated anterior displacement with reduction zzso and 27 anterior displacement without reduction zzso In three of the volunteers anterior displacement with reduction was zzso zzso anterior position of the disk was associated with reduced ability to open the mouth, progressive zzso and zzso of the zzso thinning of the zzso zone, zzso and zzso zzso changes of the zzso reduced zzso movement of the disk and zzso thinning of joint space, zzso and zzso displacement of the zzso and zzso of the slope of the zzso In addition to zzso in zzso and disk zzso zzso can demonstrate various additional measurable changes that correlate well with the degree of anterior disk zzso
