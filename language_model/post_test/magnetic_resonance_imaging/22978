The distribution of zzso receptors in the human brain has been widely studied with zzso using zzso and zzso approaches, but these methods do not allow zzso of the total zzso site concentration available for binding zzso and of the apparent equilibrium zzso constant zzso One of the major obstacles to full quantitative studies is that zzso effects zzso the administration to humans of the high doses of zzso required to zzso the labeled zzso from the zzso In this study, we applied a zzso protocol using the zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso effects, to zzso all binding parameters of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were acquired in 8 healthy volunteers, one of whom had participated in a zzso PET zzso The experimental protocol consisted of injections of zzso and/or zzso zzso We developed a kinetic model to integrate the different zzso of these 2 zzso To simplify the model, we assumed linear relationships between zzso and zzso parameters and adjusted them using a coupled fitting zzso The resulting constrained zzso model was then used to zzso the zzso zzso 

Across regions, we obtained zzso values ranging from 7 to 69 zzso and zzso values for zzso from zzso to zzso zzso There was a close correlation in the zzso values calculated in the same volunteer using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso approach can be used to zzso all model parameters with acceptable zzso This work demonstrates a zzso framework and initial application of zzso to zzso binding zzso
