We evaluated the ability of late zzso enhancement zzso using cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso to identify acute zzso heart failure zzso with left zzso zzso dysfunction zzso whether or not in relation to underlying coronary artery disease zzso in patients with no clinical evidence of associated zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients admitted with acute zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with no clinical or zzso data suggestive of zzso The patients were classified according to the presence or absence of significant zzso zzso zzso or zzso in at least one major zzso zzso patients zzso had significant zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso of the 21 patients zzso with zzso had zzso zzso In the diagnosis of zzso zzso has a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, with a negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso It has an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso and zzso for whom there are no clinical and exploratory data suggestive of zzso heart disease, zzso with zzso is an excellent means of ruling out significant zzso and is a valid alternative to zzso
