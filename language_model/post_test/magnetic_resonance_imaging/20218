The presence of cortical zzso zzso and their zzso distribution in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso have been clearly shown by recent zzso zzso zzso can also be assessed in zzso with less sensitivity, by using specific zzso zzso zzso zzso probability maps zzso may partially overcome this lack of sensitivity and provide unique information on the spatial distribution and frequency of zzso in zzso 

A total of 149 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 46 primary progressive zzso underwent an zzso examination, which included the double inversion recovery zzso sequence for zzso zzso zzso masks were then obtained for each patient and a cortical zzso zzso was created for each zzso zzso 

zzso were mainly distributed in the frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a prominent involvement of the motor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The extent of brain lobe affected by zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso zzso The frequency of zzso occurrence was higher in zzso than in zzso zzso Both zzso however, did not show differences between the 2 zzso zzso at zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso share more similarities than differences in terms of zzso number, volume, zzso distribution, and zzso The similarities between zzso data and the findings reported here suggest that zzso images can accurately illustrate the focal pathology occurring in the cortical regions of patients with zzso providing clinically relevant zzso
