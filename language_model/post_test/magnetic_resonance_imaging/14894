zzso joint space zzso zzso is considered the reference standard for demonstrating structural therapeutic benefits in knee zzso Our objective was to determine the proportion by which zzso zzso zzso and cartilage measures explain zzso differences of zzso in the fixed zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cartilage was performed in double echo steady state zzso zzso zzso measures of zzso size and position, zzso cartilage zzso and zzso zzso zzso and fixed zzso were compared between both knees of 60 participants of the zzso Initiative, with strictly unilateral zzso joint space narrowing zzso zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso were performed using zzso zzso 

A strong relationship with zzso in minimum and a central fixed location zzso was observed for percent zzso plateau coverage by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and central zzso cartilage thickness zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso other zzso and cartilage measures displayed lower zzso The correlation of central zzso cartilage thickness with zzso (but not that of zzso zzso was greater zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when excluding knees with zzso alignment between the zzso and X-ray zzso 

zzso measures of zzso and cartilage provide zzso independent information in explaining zzso in zzso zzso in fixed zzso zzso zzso coverage by the zzso and central zzso cartilage explained two thirds of the zzso in minimum and fixed location zzso zzso provides a better representation of zzso zzso cartilage zzso when optimal positioning of the fixed zzso zzso is zzso
