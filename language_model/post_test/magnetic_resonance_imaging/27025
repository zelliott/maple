We have previously reported that pathological zzso have impaired performance on the zzso color word naming task, zzso task and speed accuracy zzso performance, tasks used to assess executive function and interference zzso The aim of the present zzso study was to explore the relationship between frontal zzso function and gambling severity in pathological zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate brain activity of ten male zzso pathological zzso during performance of an zzso learning zzso Performance of this task has been shown to depend on the function of regions in the frontal zzso 

The executive functions needed to perform the zzso learning task were expressed as brain zzso in lateral and zzso frontal as well as zzso and zzso zzso By zzso the level of local brain zzso to task performance, zzso regions and lateral frontal and zzso regions were zzso A higher score in zzso was associated with intrusion on the zzso zzso in the left hemisphere, to some extant in zzso regions and even more zzso in left frontal and zzso zzso 

Our preliminary data suggests that pathological gambling may be characterized by specific zzso changes related to the frontal zzso
