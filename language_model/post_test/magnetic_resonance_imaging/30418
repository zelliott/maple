Learning to associate sensory cues with threats is critical for minimizing aversive zzso The ecological benefit of zzso learning relies on accurate perception of zzso cues, but how aversive learning enhances zzso acuity of sensory signals, particularly in humans, is zzso We combined zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging with zzso zzso to show that initially indistinguishable odor zzso zzso zzso become zzso after aversive zzso zzso the spatial divergence of ensemble activity patterns in primary zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that aversive learning zzso zzso plasticity with corresponding gains in odor zzso discrimination, zzso the capacity of fear conditioning to update zzso representation of zzso cues, over and above its zzso role in the acquisition of zzso zzso That completely zzso sensations can be transformed into zzso zzso further zzso the potency of zzso learning to enhance sensory cue perception and support zzso zzso
