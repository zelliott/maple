zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso valve area does not consider zzso variations of the opening area during the ejection zzso We evaluated an zzso methodology for the assessment of zzso dynamics in patients with severe zzso zzso by measuring the zzso zzso of the zzso blood zzso that is, the zzso zzso 

With institutional review board approval, we examined 22 patients (13 male, 9 zzso mean age, 68 zzso zzso with severe zzso zzso using zzso T zzso and a standardized scanning protocol consisting of zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso free zzso zzso before and after valve replacement zzso zzso changes of the zzso valve area, represented by zzso variations of the area of zzso turbulent flow at its smallest zzso that is, the zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso and zzso by a calculated zzso of zzso valve dynamics zzso T was defined as the period which the zzso valve spent over its zzso opening area zzso during zzso zzso was also used to determine left zzso zzso before zzso and its zzso zzso after valve zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso and cardiac zzso 

All patients had an zzso effective orifice area, zzso of zzso zzso The comparison of T to zzso and zzso revealed significant correlations zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso Further significant correlations with zzso zzso severity were observed in the comparison with manual zzso invasive zzso and zzso valve areas, as well as with pressure zzso 

zzso can measure zzso variations of the zzso valve zzso zzso parameters of the zzso relevance of valve dynamics obtained by this method correlate with established parameters of zzso zzso severity and zzso
