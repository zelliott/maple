The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of peripheral zone prostate cancer zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso at 3 T using zzso matching of zzso and MR images to avoid bias by image features in selection of cancer and zzso zzso 

Forty-eight patients underwent zzso MR imaging zzso on a 3 T system using a phased array body zzso and spine zzso elements for signal detection before zzso The examination included zzso imaging zzso zzso imaging zzso dynamic zzso imaging zzso and MR zzso imaging zzso zzso slides were correlated to zzso images and a stringent matching procedure was performed to define cancer and zzso areas of the peripheral zone without influence of the MR image zzso Mean zzso signal intensity, apparent diffusion zzso area under the enhancement curve, and zzso + zzso signal ratio were calculated for cancer and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was performed on zzso parameters from the selected zzso zzso zzso was used to create models based on best combination of zzso A simplified approach assigning a zzso score to each segment based on zzso values from zzso analysis was also zzso 

By using the stringent matching zzso 138 zzso and 41 cancer segments were selected in the zzso images and transferred to the images of the other MR zzso A significant difference between mean values in cancer and zzso segments was observed for all MR parameters analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso was the best performing single zzso with an area under the zzso curve zzso of zzso for prostate cancer zzso Any combination of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly better than zzso alone in separating cancer from zzso segments zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso was also better than zzso alone zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso models including zzso did not have significant zzso The simplified approach combining all parameters gave similar results to zzso zzso combining all parameters zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

By selecting zzso defined cancer and zzso areas without influence of image contrast, this study zzso reveals that all investigated MR parameters have the ability to separate cancer from zzso areas in the peripheral zone individually and that any combination is better than zzso zzso
