In this paper, we describe a patient zzso suffering from semantic zzso who showed a zzso naming impairment for living things over and above the effects of several zzso zzso zzso We investigated the characteristics of zzso impairment to address the following three issues raised in three different accounts of zzso zzso zzso the role of an imbalance in the loss of sensory compared to zzso features zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso semantic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the role of cross domain differences in Feature zzso zzso by the Conceptual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso The emergence of zzso deficits in a distributed semantic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Category zzso in Brain and Mind zzso zzso New York: Psychology zzso zzso the role of semantic distance zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso the factors underlying the structure and zzso of the meaning of zzso cherry, zzso cheese, and cello (and many other such concrete zzso Journal of Experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that semantic distance was the only factor zzso linked to zzso poorer performance on living zzso In fact, her naming performance was less accurate on items that had many semantic zzso which is typical of living zzso On the contrary, a feature listing task revealed that the features available to zzso were not predicted by their level of zzso as expected by the Conceptual zzso zzso Finally, at zzso with the zzso zzso Theory, although zzso quoted sensory features less accurately than zzso ones, this did not give rise to a disproportionate loss of semantic features in the living zzso
