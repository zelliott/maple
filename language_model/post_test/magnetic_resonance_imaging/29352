Using single slice two-dimensional zzso imaging zzso nine acute head injury patients and six controls have been successfully zzso The problems presented by the need for zzso monitoring of these patients during MR scanning was overcome using MR compatible monitoring zzso In previous studies of head injury which used zzso zzso single zzso zzso procedures have meant that the spatial extent of the spectral data has been zzso With spectral data from a whole zzso zzso we have been able to identify zzso abnormalities in regions remote to any zzso visible zzso This suggests that zzso (of zzso in zzso will be useful for the diagnosis of diffuse zzso zzso
