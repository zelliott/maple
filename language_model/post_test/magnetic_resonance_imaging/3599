During fear learning, anticipation of an impending aversive stimulus increases defensive zzso Interestingly, omission of the aversive stimulus often produces another response around the time the event was zzso This omission response suggests that the subject detected a mismatch between what was predicted and what actually occurred, thereby providing an indirect measure of cognitive zzso Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether zzso brain activity reflects fear expectancy during learning and zzso of zzso zzso During zzso a face expressing a moderate amount of fear zzso zzso zzso signaled delivery of an aversive shock zzso stimulus zzso whereas the same face with a neutral expression was zzso In a subsequent zzso test, subjects were presented with faces expressing more or less fear intensity than the zzso zzso results revealed an increase in the skin zzso response zzso during learning when the US was zzso zzso zzso were also observed during the zzso test following the offset of zzso but not zzso face zzso zzso results revealed zzso neural activity during learning in the anterior zzso cortex, zzso cortex, zzso and zzso These same regions also showed zzso responses during the zzso test following highly expressive fearful zzso Finally, zzso analysis on omission responses during the zzso test revealed correlations in zzso zzso and neural activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and neural activity upon omission of aversive stimulation provides a novel metric of US zzso even to generalized cues that had no prior history of zzso
