The purpose of this study was to examine magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings and zzso zzso pattern and its characteristics after surgical repair of the rotator cuff using an zzso zzso zzso anchor zzso zzso 

zzso patients with complete rotator cuff tears treated by the zzso method under zzso whose repair condition was assessed by zzso approximately 12 months after the procedure were included in the zzso The mean age at treatment was 65 years zzso 42 to 82 zzso The mean follow-up period was 26 months zzso 24 to 32 zzso 

The repair integrity was classified into 5 groups according to zzso zzso A zzso zzso was seen in 34 zzso zzso zzso of the deep layer was observed in zzso zzso zzso of the superficial layer around the zzso anchors was observed in zzso Complete zzso of the zzso around the zzso anchors with a zzso footprint was observed in zzso Complete zzso of the zzso from the footprint was observed in zzso The zzso patterns involving superficial zzso and complete zzso around the zzso anchors were unexpected and zzso These types of zzso seem to be characteristic of the zzso method and were seen in cases with zzso zzso The zzso of characteristic zzso was 7 of zzso 

zzso partial tearing and complete tearing around the zzso anchors with a zzso zzso on the footprint could be characteristics of the zzso zzso These zzso patterns were observed in 7 of 13 zzso cases and 7 of 47 cases zzso The zzso rate by the characteristic zzso was zzso zzso the causes of this zzso and preventing it could lead to better clinical results with the zzso zzso 

Level IV, therapeutic case zzso
