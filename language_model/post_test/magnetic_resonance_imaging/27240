zzso navigation is believed to be guided in part by reference to an internal map of the zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to test for a key aspect of a cognitive zzso preservation of real-world distance zzso University students were scanned while viewing photographs of familiar campus zzso zzso response levels in the left zzso corresponded to real-world distances between landmarks shown on successive trials, indicating that this region considered closer landmarks to be more zzso similar and more distant landmarks to be more zzso zzso In contrast, zzso visually responsive regions such as zzso complex and the zzso place area were sensitive to landmark repetition and zzso landmark identity in their zzso activity patterns but did not show a zzso zzso These data suggest the existence of a zzso representation in the human zzso zzso lobe that encodes the coordinates of familiar locations in zzso real-world zzso
