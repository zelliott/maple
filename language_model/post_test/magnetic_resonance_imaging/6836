To evaluate the local tumor control rate and survival data for magnetic resonance zzso zzso laser zzso of breast cancer liver zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 232 female patients with zzso liver zzso from breast zzso Survival rates were calculated with the zzso zzso zzso for the procedure were defined for patients with no more than five zzso none of which were larger than 5 zzso in diameter, as zzso zzso liver zzso after partial liver zzso zzso zzso in both liver zzso zzso locally zzso tumors zzso general zzso for surgery zzso or refusal to undergo surgical zzso zzso 

Local recurrence rate at zzso follow-up after zzso was zzso (five of zzso for zzso up to 2 zzso in diameter, zzso zzso of zzso for zzso 2-3 zzso in diameter, zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso in diameter, and zzso (one of zzso for zzso larger than 4 zzso in zzso No additional local tumor progression was observed beyond 6 zzso The mean survival rate for all treated patients, with calculation started on the date of diagnosis of the zzso treated with zzso was zzso years zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The median survival was zzso years; zzso survival, zzso zzso survival, zzso zzso survival, zzso and zzso survival, zzso The mean survival after the first zzso treatment was zzso years zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso yields high local tumor control and survival rates in patients with liver zzso from breast zzso
