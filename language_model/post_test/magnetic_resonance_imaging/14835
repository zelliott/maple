Several molecular imaging methods have been developed that use zzso contrast agents to detect markers of inflammation within zzso zzso inflammation contributes to disease progression in a wide range of zzso and inflammatory diseases, and a biopsy is currently the only method of definitively diagnosing active kidney zzso However, the development of new molecular imaging methods that use contrast agents capable of detecting particular immune cells or protein zzso will allow clinicians to evaluate inflammation throughout the zzso and to assess a patient's response to zzso zzso These imaging tools will improve our ability to validate new therapies and to zzso the treatment of individual patients with existing zzso This review describes the clinical need for new methods of monitoring kidney inflammation and recent advances in the development of zzso contrast agents for the detection of inflammatory markers of kidney zzso
