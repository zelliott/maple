zzso joint disorders zzso may be associated with the onset of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso assess if, at the zzso position, the distance between the zzso joint zzso disk and the zzso nerve is shorter in patients with zzso and zzso pain vs patients with zzso without zzso pain or in healthy zzso 

After ethical committee approval, we evaluated by MR imaging 16 zzso with zzso and zzso pain, 16 zzso with zzso without zzso pain, and 16 zzso of healthy zzso All of the subjects were informed about the study zzso We evaluated the distance between the zzso disk and the zzso nerve at the oval zzso zzso Furthermore, the presence within the zzso of internal zzso zzso joint zzso and bone zzso zzso was zzso 

At the zzso zzso position, the distance between the zzso disk and the zzso nerve is shorter in patients with zzso and zzso pain than in patients with zzso without zzso pain or in healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso The imaging findings of zzso internal zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso were present both in patients with zzso without zzso pain and in patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

We suggest that a closer proximity between the zzso disk and the zzso nerve could be one of the causes of the onset of zzso pain in patients with zzso and zzso zzso
