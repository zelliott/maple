zzso with zzso C virus zzso is reported to be associated with a higher prevalence of zzso than zzso infection zzso We examine the association between zzso and zzso tissue volume in zzso men and zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso subjects from the study of Fat zzso and zzso Change in zzso zzso zzso measured regional zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso defined zzso zzso 

Twenty percent of 792 men and zzso of zzso women were zzso zzso and zzso women had similar amounts of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso in the leg, lower zzso upper zzso and arm and similar amounts of visceral zzso tissue zzso Similar findings were seen in men, except in the leg and zzso After adjustment, zzso infection remained associated with more leg fat in men zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso Among those on zzso zzso men had less leg fat zzso effect per year of zzso use, zzso zzso -9 to zzso P zzso zzso a weaker association was seen in zzso men zzso effect, zzso zzso zzso to 3; P zzso zzso zzso was associated with less leg fat zzso in zzso men, zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso in zzso men, zzso zzso zzso to 2; P zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso is not associated with less SAT in men and zzso zzso infection seems to mitigate the loss of leg fat seen in zzso men on zzso
