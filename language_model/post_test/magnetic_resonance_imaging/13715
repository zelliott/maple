zzso knowledge of the relationship between contrast agent concentration and tissue relaxation is a critical requirement for quantitative assessment of tissue zzso using zzso zzso In the present study, using a pig model, the relationship between zzso blood concentration levels of an iron oxide zzso with a hydrated diameter of 12 zzso zzso zzso and changes in the zzso and zzso relaxation rates zzso and zzso zzso in blood, muscle, and zzso zzso was investigated at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were additionally performed in whole pig blood spiked with different zzso of the iron oxide zzso In zzso zzso and muscle, zzso increased zzso with contrast agent concentration with slopes of 101 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In blood, zzso increased as a zzso function of contrast agent zzso with different zzso terms in the ex zzso zzso the in zzso zzso In zzso zzso in blood increased zzso with contrast agent zzso with a slope zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The achievable increase in zzso in zzso zzso and muscle was limited by the rate of water exchange between the zzso and zzso compartments and the zzso were well described by a zzso water exchange limited relaxation zzso
