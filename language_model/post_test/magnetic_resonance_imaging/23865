This study applied a zzso automated zzso method, originally proposed for adults, to the measurement of zzso brain regions in pediatric study zzso Manual measures of zzso brain regions in a sample of 15 healthy boys, girls and adults were used initially to revise the original zzso grid to increase its zzso to pediatric zzso The zzso of the revised zzso grid was then tested on an independent sample of five girls with zzso zzso As zzso 3 and 4 in the text zzso sensitivity, specificity and positive zzso values either remained unchanged or increased as a result of revising the sectors to fit the brains of zzso High levels of sensitivity and specificity were achieved for all revised zzso calculations in relation to the manual zzso Both positive zzso values and zzso correlations between zzso measures produced by the revised automated and manual methods varied with the relative size of the brain zzso zzso were relatively low for smaller structures such as the zzso and zzso region, and high for zzso zzso These results suggest that the automated zzso zzso zzso method can produce sensitive and specific zzso measures of zzso brain regions in both normal children and children with brain zzso zzso the method holds much promise for zzso quantitative pediatric zzso zzso
