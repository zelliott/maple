zzso idiopathic premature zzso complexes zzso are associated with a zzso form of zzso The effect of frequent zzso on left zzso function has not been evaluated in zzso zzso 

This study sought to evaluate the value of zzso zzso zzso and possible zzso of a zzso zzso 

Thirty consecutive patients (24 men, age 61 zzso 12, left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso with remote zzso zzso referred for zzso zzso zzso zzso for primary prevention of sudden death or for management of symptomatic zzso zzso or zzso were zzso Fifteen patients with a high zzso burden zzso of all zzso complexes on zzso zzso zzso underwent mapping and zzso of zzso before zzso zzso The remaining 15 patients served as a control zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso burden was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with delayed enhancement zzso in both zzso 

zzso zzso was successful in 15 of 15 patients and reduced the mean zzso burden from 22 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After the zzso zzso increased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso In the control group, zzso remained unchanged within the same time frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with frequent zzso had a significantly smaller zzso burden by zzso compared with control zzso Five of the patients with frequent zzso underwent zzso zzso 

zzso patients with frequent zzso may have a zzso form of zzso zzso may identify patients in whom the zzso may improve after zzso of frequent zzso
