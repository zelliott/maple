The study was undertaken to describe the magnetic resonance imaging zzso appearances of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the knee and to determine whether zzso provides additional information concerning the anomaly compared with more traditional methods of zzso 

The subjects of the study were three children (one girl and two boys, aged 13 months, 3 years and 11 zzso with zzso of the zzso All the patients had plain films of the knee and zzso zzso 

Plain zzso showed bone overgrowth and zzso zzso zzso with adjacent scattered zzso which coalesced to form a zzso irregular zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso or zzso zzso Its origin from the zzso was much more clearly zzso zzso showed the extent of the zzso zzso as well as any potential zzso plane between the zzso and the mass zzso zzso surface zzso and joint involvement could be zzso It is concluded that plain films supplemented with zzso provide the greatest amount of diagnostic information in cases of zzso zzso is useful to show the exact location and extent of the zzso any joint involvement and any potential zzso between the zzso and the mass zzso
