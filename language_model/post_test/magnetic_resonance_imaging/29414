Global zzso without zzso zzso is a rare stroke zzso This study localized the zzso and examined the zzso mechanism in Korean patients with zzso and investigated whether areas of extensive zzso existed outside the zzso imaging zzso zzso seen in these zzso 

Eleven patients were diagnosed with zzso using the Western zzso zzso To identify decreased zzso which might be functionally relevant to zzso but not detected by zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in five zzso To uncover the possible zzso mechanisms of zzso stroke, vascular and zzso zzso were performed in all of the zzso 

The zzso seen on zzso zzso and included both inferior frontal and superior zzso zzso isolated inferior frontal zzso or superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and even zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso did not reveal an extensive zzso of the zzso area outside the zzso zzso in any of the patients, except one with the zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that a single zzso in different locations may be sufficient to produce zzso and the zzso profile and stroke mechanism in zzso are heterogeneous, suggesting that zzso to an area of complex functional anatomy result in zzso
