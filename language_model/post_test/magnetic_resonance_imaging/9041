Early blind persons have often been shown to be superior to sighted ones across a wide range of zzso zzso abilities, which in turn are often explained by the functionally relevant recruitment of zzso zzso While voice stimuli are known to involve zzso areas of the superior zzso zzso zzso in sighted zzso it remains unknown if the processing of vocal stimuli involves similar brain regions in blind zzso or whether it benefits from zzso zzso To address these questions, we used zzso to measure cerebral responses to voice and zzso stimuli in blind zzso and zzso and sighted zzso The global comparison of all sounds zzso silence showed a different pattern of zzso between blind zzso zzso and zzso and sighted groups, with blind subjects showing stronger zzso of zzso areas but weaker zzso of zzso areas centered around zzso zzso In contrast, the specific comparison of vocal zzso zzso sounds did not isolate zzso in the zzso areas in either of the blind zzso In the zzso blind group, however, it led to a stronger zzso in the left zzso and to a lesser extent in the zzso cortex, compared to both sighted participants and those with acquired zzso Moreover, zzso activity in zzso blind participants significantly correlated with performance in a voice discrimination zzso This increased recruitment of zzso areas in the blind for voice processing is in marked contrast with the usual zzso recruitment of zzso zzso
