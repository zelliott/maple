Stroke is one of the major medical burdens in zzso zzso Animal experiments indicate that blockade of the zzso zzso zzso zzso improves neurological outcome after cerebral zzso These protective effects are partially zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso leukemia zinc finger zzso was identified as a direct adapter protein of the zzso Furthermore, our group was able to demonstrate that zzso also directly binds and mediates the effects of the human zzso zzso zzso which is involved in brain zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso is involved in zzso Here we show that zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso exhibited an ubiquitous expression pattern in different brain zzso Furthermore, stable zzso zzso in human zzso cells was able to mediate zzso in a zzso toxicity model in zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were zzso on the zzso side in a stroke model in zzso whereas the zzso zzso target genes zzso zzso and zzso were zzso under this zzso Further analyses indicated that the zzso zzso is zzso upon stable zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso Finally, reporter gene zzso demonstrated the functionality of zzso promoter zzso regarding zzso and zzso zzso
