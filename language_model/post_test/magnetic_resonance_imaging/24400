The purposes of this article are to zzso the basic concept and the strategies of reporter zzso introduce reporter genes frequently used in optical imaging, nuclear medicine, and zzso for in zzso zzso and show typical examples of reporter gene zzso 

In molecular biology, many reporter genes have been developed for monitoring cellular zzso Development of controlled gene delivery systems promotes construction of various types of reporter genes for monitoring the level of a gene zzso promoter activity, and zzso zzso When an imaging reporter gene is placed under the control of a promoter, the amount of reporter protein can be zzso zzso in zzso zzso advances in molecular imaging have increased the sensitivity and resolution of in zzso reporter zzso Though several types of reporters and zzso imaging instruments are currently available, more efficient zzso reporter gene systems and detectors compatible with several imaging zzso are zzso
