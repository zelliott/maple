An essential problem in the diagnosis of zzso disorders is still the evaluation of the type and severity of the zzso zzso For a differential zzso of zzso diseases, we developed an electronic zzso system which zzso a recording of lower jaw zzso It works zzso and relates to the zzso The measuring system, which was internationally zzso is based on a linear zzso foil for the zzso plane and an zzso gauge for the horizontal zzso The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the usefulness of our electronic zzso system in obtaining a differential diagnosis of zzso zzso We examined 30 patients zzso zzso with complaints in the zzso area zzso and zzso zzso Clinical examinations yielded only uncertain indications of zzso zzso With the help of electronic zzso we could differentiate the zzso diseases into zzso and zzso Both forms may show a loss of function and an audible zzso zzso 23 zzso had a zzso zzso displacement with reduction, 20 times; disk displacement without reduction, 3 zzso In 8 zzso a zzso was zzso 3 zzso showed a zzso In 4 uncertain cases, the diagnosis was confirmed with the help of magnetic resonance imaging zzso All patients with a diagnosed zzso disorder received adequate treatment with zzso zzso Our initial results show that zzso electronic zzso can be a good aid in further characterization of zzso disorders and permits an effective zzso
