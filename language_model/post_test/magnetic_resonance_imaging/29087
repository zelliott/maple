zzso of zzso in the rotating frame zzso to both transient cerebral zzso and cortical zzso was studied in zzso zzso is believed to probe water in close contact with zzso revealing water spins with restricted zzso mobility relative to bulk zzso It is shown that zzso increases within minutes of zzso thereby demonstrating it as a new, sensitive indicator of zzso After zzso at 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso remains elevated or increases in tissue destined to zzso damage but returns to the normal level if no zzso damage develops within 24 zzso zzso determined during the first 2 hours of zzso shows a significant positive correlation with the ultimate zzso damage zzso However, zzso is not affected by acute zzso These data show that, by combining three magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso viable zzso areas that do not develop zzso damage within 24 hours can be distinguished correctly from tissue already destined for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
