Assessment of disease extension and activity is crucial to guide treatment in Crohn's zzso The objective of the current zzso study was to determine the accuracy of MR for this zzso 

50 patients with clinically active zzso zzso zzso or inactive zzso zzso zzso Crohn's disease underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso sequences were zzso zzso activity was evaluated by zzso zzso Disease zzso Index of zzso in addition zzso zzso were classified as zzso mild zzso without zzso or severe zzso of zzso 

The comparison of zzso segments with zzso mild and severe inflammation demonstrated a progressive and significant zzso increase in the following MR zzso wall zzso zzso wall signal intensity, relative contrast enhancement, presence of zzso ulcers, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Independent zzso for zzso in a segment were wall thickness zzso zzso zzso relative contrast enhancement zzso zzso zzso presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and presence of zzso at MR zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso of the segment and the MR index calculated according to the zzso zzso analysis zzso The MR index had a high accuracy for the detection of disease activity zzso under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and for the detection of zzso zzso zzso under the zzso curve zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso in the colon and terminal zzso 

The accuracy of MR for detecting disease activity and assessing severity brings about the possibility of using MR as an alternative to zzso in the evaluation of zzso Crohn's zzso
