A total of 27 consecutive patients (age zzso 45 zzso 17 years; 14 zzso presenting with zzso zzso pain, positive zzso and no coronary zzso underwent cardiac zzso 9 zzso 7 days after pain onset and 8 zzso 5 months later (N zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso sequence was applied for the assessment of zzso function and both zzso zzso and zzso sequences were used for analyzing the topography and extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso was also systematically zzso 

zzso zzso pattern typical of acute zzso was documented in 12 patients zzso zzso zzso pattern zzso or zzso focal zzso was documented in 12 of the 15 remaining patients zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso higher zzso protein zzso levels zzso zzso 32 zzso 14 zzso 24 zzso P zzso zzso lower zzso cardiovascular risk (3 zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso P zzso zzso lower zzso of zzso zzso defects zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso higher left zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso 16 zzso 64 zzso 10 zzso P zzso zzso and higher zzso of zzso areas at follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso
