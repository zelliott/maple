zzso zzso has demonstrated differences in response to memory performance based on risk for Alzheimer's disease zzso The current study compared blood oxygen level dependent zzso functional zzso response with zzso spin labeling zzso zzso response during an zzso zzso task and resting zzso signal in different risk groups for zzso Thirteen individuals with a positive family history of zzso and at least one copy of the zzso E zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were compared to ten individuals without these risk factors zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the high risk group had an elevated level of resting zzso and demonstrated decreased fractional zzso and zzso responses to the zzso zzso However, there was no difference in the absolute cerebral blood flow during the zzso These data demonstrate that individuals with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease have elevated zzso resting cerebral blood flow, which significantly influences apparent differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso should be interpreted with caution, and do not necessarily reflect differences in zzso zzso
