To build digitized visible model of the zzso zzso of Chinese visible zzso 

zzso images from the Chinese visible human data set were reviewed and the structures of the zzso space were confirmed on a zzso zzso zzso computer reconstructions of the zzso space and surrounding structures were generated from these data using PC and imaging zzso 

The three-dimensional reconstructed images displayed perfectly the anatomical relationships of the zzso space, zzso muscles, zzso and zzso All reconstructed structures can be represented individually or zzso any diameter and angle of the structures reconstructed could be measured zzso 

The Chinese visible human data set can provide complete and accurate zzso The digitized model of the zzso space and its surroundings offer unique insights into the complex zzso and provide zzso data for image diagnosis and operation of the zzso zzso
