Although the zzso zzso play an important role in zzso movement, their involvement in zzso paced voluntary movement is less zzso We recorded local field zzso zzso from the region of the zzso zzso of eight patients with Parkinson's disease during the performance of a warned reaction time task in which an imperative cue instructed the subject to move or not to zzso In zzso trials, zzso activity in the beta frequency band ( approximately 20 zzso decreased prior to movement, with an onset zzso that strongly correlated with mean reaction time across zzso This was followed by a late zzso increase in beta zzso In contrast, in zzso trials the beta power drop following imperative signals was prematurely terminated compared with go trials and reversed into an early beta power zzso These differences were manifest as power increases when go trials were zzso from zzso zzso In six patients these relative beta power increases in zzso difference trials were of shorter zzso than the respective reaction zzso The findings suggest that, zzso the zzso nucleus is involved in the preparation of zzso paced voluntary movements in humans and, zzso the degree of synchronization of zzso nucleus activity in the beta band may be an important zzso of whether motor programming and movement initiation is zzso or zzso
