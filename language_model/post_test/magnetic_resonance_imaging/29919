The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of zzso in evaluating patients for residual cancer, identify the prevalence of zzso or zzso disease, and evaluate the impact of zzso on surgical treatment zzso zzso AND zzso Of 101 potentially eligible patients, 80 candidates for breast conservation therapy who had primary breast cancer in 82 breasts diagnosed by zzso biopsy with close or positive margins were included in the study zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso before further surgery and subsequently underwent either zzso zzso or mastectomy with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso either invasive or in zzso was present in zzso of the zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso for detecting residual disease were zzso and zzso zzso zzso additional zzso distant from the biopsy site were identified in 19 zzso and 18 suspicious zzso underwent zzso zzso results indicated that six zzso were zzso so the overall prevalence was zzso The positive zzso value of identifying an additional suspicious zzso was zzso In 24 zzso zzso changed which procedure would be performed next from zzso zzso to mastectomy zzso zzso zzso biopsy of an additional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 2) breast, or zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the breasts underwent mastectomy as definitive surgical zzso 

zzso in the appearances of benign and zzso zzso limits zzso evaluation for residual zzso zzso can show additional suspicious zzso that are likely to be zzso or zzso zzso These findings changed the original treatment plan for approximately zzso of zzso
