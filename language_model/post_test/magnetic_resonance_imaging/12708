A focal zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso is a rare finding in patients with zzso zzso with zzso drugs, zzso after generalized seizures, or a rapid change of zzso drug levels have been proposed as possible zzso The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between this zzso and possible zzso zzso 

We analyzed the magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans of 1,050 patients undergoing prolonged zzso zzso monitoring and identified 24 patients with a focal zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso patients without such a zzso served as a control zzso We evaluated the following parameters for their possible zzso zzso zzso syndrome, seizure types in medical history, seizure frequency during the past year prior to admission for prolonged zzso monitoring, zzso of zzso spikes and zzso zzso patterns in patients with focal zzso as documented during prolonged zzso seizure types and seizure frequency during prolonged zzso monitoring, past as well as current zzso medication, withdrawal of zzso drugs during monitoring including duration of medication withdrawal, and finally drug levels above the therapeutic zzso 

The parameters analyzed showed no significant difference between the group of patients with focal zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso and the control zzso 

We could not identify a single zzso factor responsible for the zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso
