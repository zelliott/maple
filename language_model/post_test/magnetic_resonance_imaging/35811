By means of zzso zzso the zzso relaxation times zzso zzso of pelvic and leg muscles were measured in zzso muscular zzso zzso patients and normal zzso The bound water fraction zzso was calculated from the zzso value zzso In normal children, the zzso value zzso and zzso increased with zzso In zzso the zzso value rapidly zzso from an zzso high value in the early zzso with the progress of the zzso This reduction of the zzso value in zzso was not the same for all zzso it was most prominent in the zzso zzso and least prominent in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was below normal in the early stages of zzso It is suggested that both zzso and zzso muscle zzso together with the increased muscle water content, cause the high zzso value and low zzso in the early stages of zzso whereas replacement of muscle by fat causes the decreased zzso value in the advanced zzso
