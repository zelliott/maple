zzso at time of MR contrast administration has been reported to zzso patients with zzso failure to development of zzso systemic zzso zzso We assessed the frequency of infection at the time of MR contrast administration in a group of zzso zzso 

Eight patients developed zzso during zzso of whom seven received the MR contrast agent zzso zzso with doses of zzso zzso Data for the following were available for only 2005 and zzso numbers of infected and zzso zzso failure patients who received MR contrast material and number of zzso MR scans in all zzso We zzso data to zzso to approximate rates of zzso in infected and zzso zzso failure patients using zzso exact test for association between variables and calculated odds ratios with zzso zzso 

Five of seven zzso patients receiving MR contrast material had infections at the time of contrast zzso Three hundred zzso patients with zzso failure received MR contrast material in 2005 and 2006 (29 zzso The rate of zzso was zzso in infected zzso failure patients and zzso in zzso zzso Data zzso to zzso yielded estimates of 75 infected and 750 zzso zzso failure zzso The association of zzso with infection was highly significant zzso zzso zzso with an odds ratio of 25 and zzso of zzso 

The association of zzso with infection was highly zzso supporting the hypothesis that infection at the time of MR contrast administration in zzso failure patients zzso to zzso
