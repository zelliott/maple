It is a vital ability of humans to zzso adapt their behavior to different environmental zzso zzso the rules for our zzso zzso need to be adapted to the current task zzso For example, the same sensory input might require two different motor responses depending on the actual zzso How does the brain prepare for such different zzso It has been suggested that the functional connections within zzso are biased according to the present rule to guide the flow of information in accordance with the required zzso zzso Here, we investigated with zzso whether task settings might indeed change the functional connectivity structure in a large-scale brain zzso zzso performed a zzso response task that required an interaction between visual and motor zzso either within each zzso or across the two zzso of the brain depending on the task zzso A zzso analysis on the functional connectivity graph of a cortical zzso network revealed that the functional integration, zzso the connectivity structure, is altered according to the task condition already during a zzso period before the visual cue and the actual zzso Our results show that the zzso of connection weights within a single network changes according to and thus predicts the upcoming zzso This suggests that the human brain prepares to respond in different conditions by altering its large scale functional connectivity structure even before an action is zzso
