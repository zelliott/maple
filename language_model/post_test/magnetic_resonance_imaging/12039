From January 1980 to December 1984, zzso patients underwent exploratory surgery for zzso Small Cell Lung Cancer with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso In group 1: for 167 patients zzso zzso cancer was zzso In group zzso for 103 patients zzso an extensive zzso was zzso This study allows comparison of these two groups and confirms the value of exploratory zzso The zzso was extended to the superior zzso zzso in zzso of cases, the trachea and zzso in zzso and the left atrium in zzso Survival in group 1 was similar to that of non operated patients zzso less than zzso at one zzso and the mortality was zzso with no operative zzso Survival of group 2 was considerably better: zzso at 1 year, zzso at 3 years, zzso at 5 zzso The mortality was zzso with no operative zzso Three year survival of patients with T4 zzso was clearly higher than that of T4 zzso zzso versus zzso Although the results were poor for patients with zzso disease and those who underwent incomplete zzso they were nonetheless better than in those patients with zzso tumors zzso versus zzso at 18 zzso We conclude that: exploratory zzso is safe, a significant number of patients zzso in our series) may benefit from this approach, and that it is sometimes hazardous to zzso surgery for patients suffering from lung cancer only on the basis of zzso zzso
