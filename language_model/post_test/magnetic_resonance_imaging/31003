Management options for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso The long-term results of zzso zzso for these disease entities are poorly zzso In this report the authors reviewed both neurological and zzso outcomes following zzso zzso for zzso zzso over 15 years of zzso 

Fifty patients with zzso zzso underwent gamma knife surgery between 1987 and zzso There were 29 male and 21 female patients with an age range of 7 to 79 years zzso 35 zzso zzso locations of these zzso included the zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso (three zzso The radiation dose applied to the margin of the zzso varied from 12 to 26 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso patients were followed up from 5 to 176 months zzso 72 zzso The zzso confirmed zzso obliteration rate was zzso at the final follow-up zzso Two patients experienced a zzso before zzso The annual zzso rate was zzso for the first 3 years after zzso and zzso zzso Patients who had received zzso at two or fewer zzso had higher obliteration rates zzso compared with zzso for zzso two zzso p zzso zzso and this was related to a more zzso zzso zzso The rate of persistent neurological complications in patients treated using magnetic resonance zzso dose planning after 1993 was zzso compared with zzso in patients treated before zzso An older patient age, a zzso located in the zzso and a higher zzso score were significantly associated with greater neurological zzso 

zzso zzso provided complete obliteration of zzso in two thirds of the patients with a low risk of zzso zzso Better three-dimensional imaging studies and zzso dose planning reduced the risk of adverse radiation zzso Younger patients harboring more zzso zzso that did not involve the zzso plate had the best zzso
