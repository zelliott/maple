A novel quantitative zzso mapping zzso processing technology has been developed to map tissue zzso property without blooming zzso We zzso that zzso volume measurement on zzso is independent of imaging zzso eliminating its echo time dependence on zzso echo zzso 

zzso echo zzso of 16 patients with zzso zzso was processed with zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso and zzso at various echo zzso zzso volumes were measured from these zzso 

Linear zzso of zzso volume versus echo time showed substantial slopes for zzso echo magnitude zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso zzso but nearly zero slope for zzso zzso At echo zzso zzso zzso volume on zzso was zzso that on zzso echo magnitude image zzso 

zzso can provide reliable measurement of zzso volume, which can be performed rapidly and accurately using a zzso zzso zzso
