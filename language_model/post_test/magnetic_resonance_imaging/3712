zzso integration between sensory stimuli and contextual framing is fundamental to action zzso zzso may entail zzso actions, while zzso or spatial characteristics of a stimulus train may establish a contextual framework for upcoming zzso Here we aimed at identifying core areas for zzso integration and delineated their functional connectivity zzso using zzso connectivity modeling zzso and analysis of zzso zzso In a zzso zzso consistently increased activity under higher demands on zzso integration was predominantly found in the right zzso junction zzso which represented the largest cluster of overlap and was thus used as the seed for the zzso zzso The conjunction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the right zzso revealed a shared network zzso zzso inferior zzso and frontal zzso anterior zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso connectivity was observed with the zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso motor cortex, while stronger zzso zzso zzso connectivity was found with the zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso Our data provide strong evidence that the right zzso may represent a key region for the integration of sensory stimuli and contextual frames in action zzso zzso associations with regions related to stimulus processing and motor responses indicate that the right zzso may integrate zzso of sensory processing and apply zzso contextual zzso most likely via zzso of zzso zzso Given the pattern of zzso zzso internal states and goal representations may provide the zzso for the contextual integration within the zzso in the absence of a specific zzso
