zzso slow growing brain zzso were induced in rats by a single subcutaneous injection of zzso zzso within 24 h of zzso A parallel control group of rats was injected with zzso Seven treated rats developed zzso within 2 zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain in zzso slices at zzso zzso and monthly plasma sampling for zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso at 360 zzso were started 6 months after the injection of zzso In the MRS experiments, the zzso index, average of the line zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso at 360 zzso was determined from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso In five of the zzso injected animals that developed zzso verified brain tumors, these were also observed by zzso without contrast zzso There was no consistent correlation between the zzso tumors and the zzso index obtained through MRS during the course of the study where repeated observations were performed on individual animals, nor was there any consistent statistical difference in the zzso index between zzso and control zzso The results of this study demonstrate that slowly developing zzso brain tumors in rats can be successfully and reliably monitored zzso by zzso but not by MRS of zzso
