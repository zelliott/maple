The literature on biological effects of weak electromagnetic fields of a frequency of 200 zzso or less is zzso The topic has been extraordinarily controversial, in part because of disputed assertions about a role for electromagnetic fields in zzso or production of abnormalities in growth and zzso There is fairly widespread acceptance of certain beneficial effects, particularly the stimulation of zzso An increasing number of reports point to interactions between zzso magnetic fields and zzso fields in the production of some zzso Safety implications are noted along with the hypothetical possibility of production of experimental artifacts by electromagnetic fields in MRS zzso
