The goal of this study was to describe the zzso technique for three-dimensional zzso zzso of zzso relationships in the zzso zzso at the surface of the zzso This technique is based on the processing of high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso The principles and technical details involved in the accurate simultaneous zzso of vessels and zzso nerves as tiny structures are presented using explicit and implicit zzso as well as volume zzso 

In this approach zzso MR constructive interference in steady state imaging data served as the source for image processing, which was performed using the zzso software tools zzso for zzso and zzso for volume zzso A sequence of filtering operations (including noise reduction and zzso and other software tools such as volume growing are used for a semiautomatic coarse zzso The subsequent zzso zzso in which implicit zzso is used for the differentiation of zzso nerves, vessels, and zzso is achieved by allocating zzso and color values and adjusting the related transfer zzso This method was applied to the zzso evaluation in a consecutive series of 55 patients with zzso zzso syndromes and the results were correlated to surgical zzso The potential for its use, further developments, and remaining problems are zzso 

This method provides an excellent zzso real-time virtual view of difficult anatomical zzso
