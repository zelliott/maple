Recent imaging evidence suggests that a network of brain regions including the zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, and zzso zzso zzso zzso supports the successful zzso of long-term zzso Other areas, like the zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso have been associated with zzso failure rather than zzso In line with the zzso processing view, we hypothesized that distinct neural networks predict successful zzso depending on whether the later memory test draws primarily on zzso or conceptual memory zzso Following an zzso phase, memory was assessed in a combined incidental zzso identification and intentional recognition memory zzso We found that during zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso predicted successful zzso identification zzso whereas zzso in zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted successful recognition zzso zzso recent theories of attention to memory, the results suggest that zzso zzso regions support zzso attention to zzso item features, forming memories zzso by later zzso memory tests, whereas zzso zzso regions support attention to meaningful item features, forming memories zzso by later conceptual memory zzso
