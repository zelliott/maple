30 zzso volunteer subjects and more than 400 patients with suspected rotator cuff zzso were examined by zzso at zzso T using zzso weighted zzso echo zzso zzso Its superiority over zzso spin echo imaging was established in previous zzso The results were compared to those of surgery in 87 cases and zzso in 233 cases zzso with CT zzso in 70 zzso In the operated patients, zzso and zzso correctly diagnosed 49 complete zzso zzso zzso was found to be superior to zzso for defining the real extent of the zzso the degree of zzso zzso and the local muscular zzso essential information to define the therapeutic zzso In contrast, among 22 zzso of the long biceps tendon, correctly demonstrated by zzso or CT zzso 5 zzso zzso were not detected by zzso zzso was able to detect 8 zzso of the anterior zzso associated with a zzso not demonstrated by zzso Lastly, among the 18 cases of partial inferior zzso zzso 6 partial superficial zzso and 14 cases of inflammatory changes, correctly diagnosed by zzso only 8 zzso were also demonstrated by zzso For the zzso patients investigated by the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in 43 zzso In contrast, 103 intact cuffs on zzso showed features on zzso compatible with zzso without zzso zzso and degenerative zzso In the absence of very fine surgical or zzso correlations for these small zzso it is impossible, at the present time, to determine the real sensitivity and specificity of zzso
