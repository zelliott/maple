Patients harboring a brain zzso zzso zzso often have zzso zzso zzso Experts have argued about the clinical significance of these zzso which may be important for risk zzso in patient management and clinical zzso We studied the association between zzso zzso and initial presentation with zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso evaluated at two zzso zzso 

zzso and clinical data were collected from a prospective series of patients evaluated for zzso at the University of California, San Francisco zzso zzso and zzso Medical Center, New York zzso zzso Using zzso zzso regression, we examined the independent association between zzso presentation and the presence of a zzso aneurysm, and compared the association at the two zzso 

zzso were associated with 28 zzso at zzso zzso and 74 at zzso zzso zzso zzso presentation with zzso was associated with the presence of a zzso aneurysm at zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso The opposite trend was observed at zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso We observed an interaction by site involving the association between zzso presentation and aneurysm zzso 

Although many zzso characteristics were similar at the referral centers zzso the association between initial presentation with zzso and zzso zzso was zzso This zzso between populations undermines the zzso of zzso on the role of zzso from any single referral series, and emphasizes the complexity in creating zzso zzso models that incorporate zzso
