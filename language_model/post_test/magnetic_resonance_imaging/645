zzso functional zzso as indicated by the concurrent spontaneous activity of zzso zzso regions, is being studied increasingly because it may determine the reaction of the brain to external stimuli and task requirements and it is reportedly altered in many neurological and psychiatric zzso In functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso such functional connectivity is investigated commonly by zzso the time course of a chosen zzso zzso with the remaining zzso time courses in a zzso zzso This approach is biased by the actual choice of the seed zzso however, because it only shows functional connectivity for the chosen brain region while ignoring other potentially interesting patterns of zzso We used spatial independent component analysis zzso to assess cortical functional connectivity maps from resting state zzso zzso does not depend on any chosen zzso profile of local brain zzso We hypothesized that zzso would be able to find functionally connected brain regions within sensory and motor regions in the absence of zzso brain zzso We also investigated functional connectivity patterns of several zzso regions including the superior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The components of interest were selected in an automated fashion using zzso anatomical volumes of zzso zzso yielded connectivity maps of bilateral zzso motor and visual zzso Moreover, it showed that prefrontal and zzso areas are also functionally connected within and between zzso during the resting zzso These connectivity maps showed an extremely high degree of consistency in zzso zzso and frequency parameters within and between zzso These results are discussed in the context of the recent debate on the functional relevance of fluctuations of neural activity in the resting zzso
