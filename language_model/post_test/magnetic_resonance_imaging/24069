If cardiac zzso have been used for a long time to study cardiac zzso only, more recent developments allow the assessment of flow, zzso and zzso zzso zzso segmented and MR tagging sequences offer new capabilities to explore regional functional consequences, of particular interest to characterize zzso injury after zzso zzso representing an alternative technique to zzso or nuclear zzso Combined with zzso stress test, MR cardiac imaging offer a more precise characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso If MR coronary zzso requires further developments, cardiac zzso have the potential to represent in the future the only imaging zzso allowing combined assessment of coronary vessels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
