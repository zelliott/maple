External snapping hip is caused by snapping of the thickened zzso band or the zzso zzso over the greater zzso We zzso reviewed results of the release of multiple zzso bands of the zzso band or zzso zzso for treatment of external snapping hip in 44 zzso 

We wanted to evaluate the functional results of this technique in terms of resolution of symptoms, patient satisfaction, and zzso A snapping hip questionnaire was designed for the zzso and the results were evaluated at an average 62 months after zzso 

All the patients had resolution of their symptoms after surgery and were satisfied with the zzso zzso of snapping was reported in five patients, but they did not find it severe enough to require a second zzso Ten patients reported some limp or zzso and four patients had zzso formation, requiring zzso of a drainage zzso 

We recommend release of multiple zzso bands of the zzso band and zzso zzso muscle for treatment of external snapping hip, as it has a low rate of recurrence and a high rate of patient zzso
