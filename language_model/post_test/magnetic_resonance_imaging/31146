zzso resonance zzso zzso of the human is becoming increasingly common for studies of tissue zzso and zzso In this study, we consider the constraints that such experiments place on the design of zzso zzso zzso and describe the advantages of zzso zzso which offer a locally uniform zzso zzso We show that these coils are particularly suitable for zzso imaging of a restricted region of larger experimental animals or humans, offering the same simplicity and efficient use of zzso power as a simple surface zzso but without requiring sequence modifications such as zzso zzso Imaging results are shown from human brain and from the abdominal zzso of an experimental zzso
