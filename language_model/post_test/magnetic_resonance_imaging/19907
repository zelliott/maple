The aim of this study was to assess the consistency and performance of zzso interpreting breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

Two test sets of eight cases zzso zzso benign disease, technical problems and zzso enhancement were prepared from two manufacturers' equipment zzso and zzso and reported by 15 zzso using the recording form and scoring system of the UK zzso breast screening study zzso zzso Imaging in Breast zzso zzso Variations in assessments of zzso kinetic scores and diagnosis were measured by assessing zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The sensitivity and specificity of reporting performances was determined using receiver operating characteristic zzso curve zzso 

zzso variation was seen in 13 zzso of 47 of the zzso conclusions (four technical and seven pathological zzso zzso zzso variation was observed in the scores recorded for zzso pattern of enhancement, zzso of enhancement and zzso zzso The overall sensitivity of breast zzso was high zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso combined with a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivities were similar for the two test sets zzso but the specificity was significantly higher for the zzso X zzso zzso zzso curve analysis gave an area under the curve of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso variation in all elements of the scoring system and in the overall diagnostic conclusions was observed between zzso participating in zzso High overall sensitivity was achieved with moderate zzso zzso differences in zzso possibly occurred because the zzso thresholds set for the scoring system were not zzso for both equipment zzso zzso systems developed on one equipment software may not be zzso to other zzso
