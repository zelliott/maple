The aim of this study was to identify cortical areas important for optimal cognitive zzso 74 participants zzso zzso went through zzso tests and two MR zzso The sample was split into two age zzso In each, every participant was classified as zzso or zzso on fluid ability tests and on zzso tests related to executive zzso The groups were compared with regard to thickness on a point-by-point basis across the entire cortical zzso The old high fluid performers had thicker zzso than the average performers in large areas of cortex, while there was minimal difference between the groups of high zzso average executive zzso Furthermore, the old group with high fluid function had thicker zzso than the young participants in the zzso zzso and adjacent zzso Further analyses showed that the latter was a result of a complex aging pattern, differing between the two performance groups, with decades of cortical zzso and subsequent zzso
