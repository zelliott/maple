Our goal was to evaluate the clinical reliability of a new software system employing zzso zzso virtual zzso reconstruction and zzso virtual exploration for detection of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso reality systems have been proposed for zzso zzso and colonoscopy, as well as for the zzso reconstruction of liver anatomy and zzso zzso The impact of these systems in zzso zzso has not been established due to the lack of large clinical series evaluating their zzso 

From November 2000 to July 2002, all patients presenting to our Institute with suspected zzso were zzso included in the zzso All patients underwent conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso and either zzso zzso zzso or zzso retrograde zzso zzso The digital data from zzso were incorporated into an original virtual reality software system to generate a zzso zzso All zzso reconstructions were evaluated by a surgeon and a computer software engineer who were blind to the results of the zzso or zzso zzso and specificity were then calculated based on the results of either the zzso or zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in the zzso The average time required to reconstruct the images into navigable virtual reality was zzso minutes zzso zzso The zzso virtual zzso had sensitivity and specificity rates of zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso and zzso of the standard zzso 

: The zzso virtual zzso provides detailed zzso reconstruction of zzso anatomy and reliable identification of zzso with acceptable sensitivity and specificity in a clinical zzso Newer software developments may further enhance its zzso so that virtual zzso might challenge or replace more invasive diagnostic measures in the near zzso
