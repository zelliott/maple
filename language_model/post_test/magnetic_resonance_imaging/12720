zzso PET demonstrates higher sensitivity and specificity for zzso than traditional zzso zzso PET zzso However, PET provides limited zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso fusion can provide precise zzso zzso of abnormal zzso zzso and how this activity zzso to MR signal zzso 

Two groups of patients were zzso Group I consisted of 21 patients who underwent zzso PET and zzso followed by zzso for tumor zzso Group II consisted of 70 patients with a pathological diagnosis of zzso that had zzso PET and zzso but lacked additional zzso zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso images were analyzed for zzso and correlated with zzso zzso 

Fusion technology facilitated precise anatomical zzso of zzso zzso In group I, all 21 cases showed zzso zzso Of these, zzso scans were positive in zzso zzso previously zzso tumors, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Of the 70 patients in group II, zzso between zzso and zzso was found in zzso zzso of patients with sufficient zzso in the remaining 16 patients zzso could not be determined due to lack of zzso zzso labeling was comparable in both zzso and zzso zzso and identified both enhancing and zzso tumor equally zzso In some cases, zzso activity preceded tumor detection on zzso 

zzso zzso fusion provides precise zzso zzso of zzso zzso and labels enhancing and zzso tumor zzso In a small minority of cases, zzso activity may identify tumor not visible on zzso
