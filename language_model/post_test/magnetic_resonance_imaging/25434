The relationship between the zzso and the zzso arteries was studied in a series of magnetic resonance images zzso from 50 patients without neck zzso 

The vertical distances of the excursion of the zzso arteries into the neck was measured, as was the distance from the zzso cartilage to the highest point of this zzso zzso analysis allows the probability of any given zzso distance occurring in the population to be zzso 

The mean zzso excursion of the right zzso artery above the zzso was zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso distance from the zzso cartilage to the right zzso artery was zzso zzso zzso and the data showed a high degree of zzso There was a linear relationship between neck length and zzso distance zzso which explained some of the zzso in the latter, but there was also wide individual zzso which was independent of this zzso 

When performing a zzso zzso a zzso distance between the incision site and zzso artery cannot be assumed or reliably predicted from the neck zzso
