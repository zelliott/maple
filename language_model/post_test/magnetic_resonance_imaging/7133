zzso of various imaging zzso in recent years have resulted in imaging systems with greater spatial resolution, faster data zzso and more powerful computer zzso It is the purpose of this report to examine three of these systems, zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to their zzso for determination of cardiac volumes and other characteristics related to zzso While each of these zzso has widespread applications and specific advantages, this report will be primarily concerned with two zzso functional ability to record indicator dilution zzso suitable for zzso of flow and the zzso or geometric ability to measure chamber dimensions with high zzso Time concentration zzso have been outlined on all zzso and used for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso determined cardiac output by dilution zzso although in zzso zzso recording from PET has demonstrated suitable zzso for this zzso Both zzso and zzso have demonstrated accurate determination of chamber volumes by the geometric method, the latter giving somewhat higher spatial zzso The advantages of these machines for such purposes have yet to be zzso
