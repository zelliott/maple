The zzso zzso areas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso from the reconstructed muscle volumes, angles of zzso and distance between zzso of six healthy male volunteers by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso In all subjects, the zzso maximum voluntary contraction strength zzso was measured at the optimum angle at which peak force zzso The zzso developed at the ankle was zzso zzso zzso N and its zzso component zzso given by a mechanical advantage of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso To calculate the force acting along the zzso zzso of each muscle, zzso was divided by the zzso of the angle of zzso and multiplied for zzso zzso where zzso zzso was the sum of zzso of the four zzso The resulting zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stress of each muscle was obtained by dividing these forces for the respective zzso which was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The mean value of stress of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso this value is in good agreement with data on animal muscle and those on human zzso zzso
