To investigate liver lobe volumes and the ratios of liver lobe volumes to zzso volume measured with magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso monitoring and staging liver zzso 

Animal study was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use zzso Sixteen zzso were zzso used to model liver fibrosis, and underwent abdominal zzso zzso on 0, zzso zzso zzso and zzso weekend after modeling this disease staged by biopsy according to zzso zzso zzso On zzso volume parameters including left lateral liver lobe volume zzso left zzso liver lobe volume zzso right liver lobe volume zzso zzso lobe volume zzso and zzso volume zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso analyses were performed for staging this zzso 

zzso and zzso increased with increasing stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all P zzso zzso RV and zzso increased from stage 0 to 2 and decreased from 2 to 4; and zzso decreased from 0 to 1, increased from 1 to 2, and decreased from 3 to 4 (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased from stage 0 to 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could distinguish stage zzso from 2-4 and 0-2 from zzso (all P zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso and zzso could best zzso stage zzso and zzso respectively zzso under receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso complement each other in staging liver fibrosis, and both parameters should be used to stage this zzso
