The objective was to investigate the changes in zzso volume in zzso children following successful zzso third zzso zzso 

Using zzso techniques, serial zzso of zzso volume were performed using the zzso scans of 13 zzso children who had successful zzso between 1999 and 2002 to monitor zzso zzso All patients remained zzso did not require zzso and demonstrated zzso evidence of zzso zzso on phase contrast zzso zzso throughout the follow-up period extending from 1 to zzso zzso There were 6 boys and 7 girls with a mean age at operation of 76 months zzso zzso zzso Imaging was obtained zzso 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months zzso Each volume measured was divided by the corresponding average normal volume for sex and age, to calculate the zzso zzso zzso volume zzso The patients were divided into two groups for analysis: those children having large zzso volumes at presentation zzso and those with moderate initial volumes zzso 

The mean zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso while the mean volumes at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months were 120 zzso zzso 104 zzso zzso 119 zzso zzso 146 zzso zzso and 185 zzso zzso respectively, for the entire zzso Nine patients had large zzso zzso volumes while 4 patients presented with moderate zzso The pattern of change in zzso size varied between the large and small volume zzso For the majority of patients presenting with large volumes zzso zzso size decreased significantly until 3-6 months following zzso after which the volume change zzso zzso In some patients, a slight increase in volume was observed after this zzso Patients presenting with moderate initial volumes had a much less steep reduction in zzso size in the 3-6 months following zzso after which the volume appeared to zzso or fall zzso However, the final volume in both groups remained higher than normal, especially in the large presentation volume group zzso zzso N volumes at 12 zzso large zzso volume group zzso zzso moderate zzso volume group zzso zzso 

In response to zzso zzso volume falls to a value lower than preoperatively but higher than the zzso value for age and zzso All patients appeared to have zzso volumes in the long term, with the volume zzso at 3-6 zzso This contrasts with zzso patients who continue to exhibit declining zzso volumes after 6 zzso The observation that the final volumes are much higher than normal (especially in the large volume zzso implies that the zzso mechanism works less well in these patients in comparison to normal subjects and it thus appears that successful zzso produces a state of compensated zzso zzso The long-term zzso consequence of persistently enlarged zzso may require further zzso
