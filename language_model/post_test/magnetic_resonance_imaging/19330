In the search for a diagnostic test for zzso lateral sclerosis zzso especially upper motor zzso zzso involvement, MR imaging and zzso zzso techniques have each received attention, but their findings have not been zzso The purpose of this study was to identify relationships among the results of current techniques, taking into account the severity of clinical zzso disease, so that objective measures of the zzso of ALS may be zzso 

zzso subjects with clinically diagnosed ALS and 12 healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging of the brain and localized zzso MR zzso zzso zzso from the left zzso zzso and from the left zzso zzso were analyzed with the zzso method, yielding zzso for zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso images were assessed zzso in a blinded zzso 

For the zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the ALS group were significantly zzso After adjustment for zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso For the zzso zzso no difference in zzso zzso between groups was zzso Trend analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed significant increases in zzso and zzso and decreases in zzso and zzso with respect to the severity of clinical zzso zzso zzso changes were greater in the subset of ALS patients with zzso zzso signal changes on imaging, and significantly increased zzso was associated with cortical zzso on fast zzso zzso 

Mean zzso zzso determined from zzso zzso zzso reflect clinical and zzso changes that occur in zzso Imaging findings, while related to the spectral and clinical results, are not specific to zzso
