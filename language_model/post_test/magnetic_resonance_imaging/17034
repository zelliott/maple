The magnitude dimensions of number, time and space have been suggested to share some common magnitude processing, which may imply zzso interaction among zzso Here we challenge these suggestions by presenting a double zzso between two zzso patients with left zzso and right zzso zzso zzso and selective impairment of number and time processing zzso Both patients showed an influence of zzso number stimuli on time but not space zzso In zzso otherwise preserved time processing was severely impaired in the mere presence of zzso numbers, which themselves could not be processed zzso In zzso impaired zzso zzso was influenced by preserved number zzso small numbers made zzso zzso zzso time intervals appear even shorter relative to large zzso However, zzso zzso was not influenced by time in healthy controls and in both zzso This new double zzso between number and time processing and the zzso interaction of number on time: zzso provides further support to the hypothesis of a partly shared magnitude system among dimensions, instead of the proposal of a single, fully shared system or of independent magnitude systems which would not explain zzso or interactions among zzso zzso may be explained in terms of a stable hierarchy of dimensions, with numbers being the zzso
