zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies demonstrate reduced brain volumes in zzso but specific structural abnormalities have not been clearly zzso The structural abnormalities of this disorder are likely to be heterogeneous, consistent with its diverse clinical zzso To investigate the relationship between structural zzso and clinical symptoms, we examined regional brain and cerebral spinal fluid zzso volumes in a large sample of schizophrenic patients and controls, with patients zzso into clinical zzso 

Right and left zzso frontal and zzso lobe brain and zzso volumes were zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso for 71 schizophrenic patients and 77 zzso and zzso zzso The following four standardized rating scales were used to assess symptom zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Patients were also zzso as either deficit or zzso on the basis of enduring negative zzso 

zzso patients overall exhibited abnormal brain zzso with selective decrease in brain volume in the left zzso and right frontal zzso Left zzso lobe zzso volume reduction and zzso volume increase were correlated with the severity of negative zzso zzso with this, the zzso analysis revealed abnormal zzso lobe asymmetry for the deficit zzso zzso Right frontal lobe volume reduction correlated with the duration of illness, independent of symptom severity or schizophrenic zzso 

zzso lateral asymmetry suggests selective structural deficits in zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso The pattern of regional abnormalities is related to clinical symptoms, with negative symptoms being associated with left zzso lobe rather than frontal lobe zzso This is consistent with suggestions of a zzso prefrontal network zzso in zzso Further zzso studies are warranted, using zzso zzso technology and gray zzso matter zzso to confirm and extend these zzso
