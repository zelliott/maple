zzso dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery zzso is mainly assessed with zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso which are not always at zzso In contrast, color duplex zzso zzso is readily zzso We undertook this prospective study to examine the accuracy of zzso to diagnose zzso in patients with first carotid territory zzso 

zzso patients with first carotid territory stroke or transient zzso attack or retinal zzso underwent clinical and laboratory zzso zzso zzso of the cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso in case of stroke or transient zzso attack, and zzso and 24-hour zzso in selected zzso Patients were included, if they were zzso years of age, zzso showed a probable zzso zzso internal carotid artery zzso or zzso or had no determined zzso of zzso All of the included patients underwent cervical zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was blinded to the results of zzso and zzso zzso 

We included 177 of zzso screened zzso Excluded patients zzso were zzso or zzso years old zzso had another determined cause of zzso zzso and had zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosed zzso in 77 of 177 patients, and the zzso of zzso was zzso in the remaining 100 zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed 74 zzso there were 6 falsely positive and 3 falsely negative zzso zzso Thus, sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative zzso values for zzso diagnosis of patients with zzso causing carotid territory zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Color duplex ultrasound allows the reliable exclusion of zzso in patients with carotid territory zzso whereas diagnosis of zzso of zzso must be confirmed with cervical zzso and zzso
