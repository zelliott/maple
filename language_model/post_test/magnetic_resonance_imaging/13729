Over the last several years there has been a rapidly growing interest in high-resolution zzso of the vascular wall to assess the extent of zzso zzso zzso of particular clinical relevance are the carotid and coronary zzso Currently, the preferred imaging sequence for these studies is a zzso technique based on the zzso scheme to zzso the blood zzso A critical drawback of the zzso technique, however, has been its zzso nature, as there is only one point in time during the recovery of the blood zzso from inversion at which the signal is completely zzso zzso the total scan time can become zzso long, particularly when an imaging protocol includes several series of these zzso In this work, a zzso zzso technique is described that can reduce the scan time by a factor of two or zzso It is demonstrated in zzso with examples from carotid and coronary arteries that one can acquire multiple slices with sufficient zzso of blood, following a single set of inversion zzso
