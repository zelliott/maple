zzso zzso hearing loss zzso has been proposed as a symptom of underlying vascular zzso The purpose of this work is to evaluate the genetic and acquired risk zzso 

Ninety-nine patients were tested for the presence of common zzso related to zzso zzso and factor V zzso in order to assess genetic risk factors, and several parameters classically associated with vascular disorders zzso events, brain stroke and zzso zzso were zzso Additional assessments of personal and familial history risk factors for vascular disorders were performed in each zzso 

zzso studies did not demonstrate statistically relevant differences between the patients and control zzso However, zzso profile and directed personal and familial histories showed positive trends for zzso 

The lack of clear relationships between zzso and other vascular risk factors suggests zzso as a zzso disease zzso Although preliminary results point at a vascular involvement in zzso a long-term prospective study is necessary to demonstrate that zzso represents an early vascular zzso
