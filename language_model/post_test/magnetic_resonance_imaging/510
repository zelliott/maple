zzso was designed as a highly selective zzso zzso zzso derived from natural zzso Its binding profile indicates that zzso may be suited as a PET zzso for the zzso exploration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso As a key feature, its structural design zzso both, zzso with zzso at its terminally fluorinated zzso zzso and zzso at its zzso zzso zzso The present report concerns the efficient zzso zzso synthesis of zzso from an zzso precursor zzso acid salt with zzso in zzso in up to zzso zzso zzso A preliminary zzso demonstrates the zzso highly specific binding of zzso in the brain of a male zzso zzso
