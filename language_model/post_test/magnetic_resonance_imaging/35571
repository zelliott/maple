zzso zzso analysis of neurological disorders would benefit if it could use data acquired from different zzso but scanner based contrast variation could interfere with the detection of zzso structural zzso In this study we examine zzso data from three different sites to investigate structural differences between childhood absence zzso zzso subjects and zzso 

zzso structural zzso scans were acquired zzso Site zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso Site zzso 15 zzso 33 zzso and Site zzso 19 zzso 11 zzso The images were processed using the zzso zzso zzso Three statistical analyses were zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso subjects and controls zzso by zzso zzso zzso comparison of controls from each zzso zzso zzso analysis of all data with site and disease status as zzso 

zzso regions of structural change, located in the zzso zzso were observed in the zzso analysis of zzso vs zzso Analysis of control scans, however, indicated zzso differences between controls, which required that we adjust for site in combined zzso Analysis of all data with adjustment for site confirmed the finding of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Combined zzso analysis of structural zzso scans acquired from different sites yield consistent patterns of structural change in zzso when site is included as a factor in the statistical analysis of the processed zzso In zzso studies of diseases where only a limited number of subjects can be zzso at each site, our study supports the possibility of effective zzso studies as long as both disease subjects and healthy controls are acquired from each zzso
