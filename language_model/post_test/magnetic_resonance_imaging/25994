Although multiple sclerosis zzso is an inflammatory zzso disease, there can be substantial zzso injury and zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso cortical changes may contribute to limiting functional zzso particularly in the early stages of the zzso To test our hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to characterize the zzso and volumes of zzso in the motor zzso during simple zzso finger zzso There were differences in the patterns of cortical zzso with movement between the 12 zzso patients and the 12 normal zzso All patients showed greater relative supplementary motor area zzso than did the normal zzso The relative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased in direct proportion to the total cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This appeared to be due primarily to increases in zzso zzso zzso with increasing zzso load in white matter of the zzso zzso to the limb zzso The center of zzso in the zzso zzso was shifted a mean of zzso zzso zzso in patients relative to controls, providing additional evidence for cortical zzso responses to zzso The magnitude of this zzso shift in the zzso zzso increased with greater zzso zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that cortical recruitment for simple finger movements can change both zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso patients, suggesting that cortical reorganization or zzso of zzso pathways can contribute to functional zzso These zzso changes are another factor potentially limiting the strength of the relationship between zzso measures of pathology and clinical measures of zzso
