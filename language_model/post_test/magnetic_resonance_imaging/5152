zzso has been demonstrated to be zzso as an adjunct to primary zzso coronary intervention in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the post hoc analysis study was to evaluate the effect of zzso in relation to system zzso defined as time from first medical contact to first zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso In zzso zzso flow zzso were randomly assigned to intravenous zzso or zzso continuous zzso Study treatment was commenced 15 minutes before intervention and maintained for 6 hours after the zzso The patients were zzso according to median system delay zzso zzso Final zzso size and zzso area at risk were measured by cardiovascular magnetic zzso Among patients with a system delay zzso minutes zzso treatment with zzso resulted in a smaller zzso size (9 grams zzso range zzso zzso versus 13 grams zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso In a zzso analysis adjusting for zzso area at risk the data points of the zzso group lay significantly lower than for the zzso group zzso In the patients with system delay zzso minutes zzso no difference was observed in zzso size expressed as grams zzso or percentage zzso There was significant interaction between system delay (less than or equal to median versus greater than zzso and treatment allocation in terms of zzso size zzso 

In this post hoc analysis, zzso treatment was associated with a zzso decrease in final zzso size in patients with short system zzso whereas no zzso effect in patients with long system delay was zzso However, this finding must be confirmed in larger zzso
