zzso models of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso assume abnormalities in zzso networks involving zzso and zzso zzso but the connectivity within these systems is rarely addressed in experimental imaging studies in this patient zzso Using an established monetary reinforcement paradigm known to involve the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the present study sought to test for altered zzso zzso in zzso patients anticipating potential zzso The anterior zzso zzso zzso a region zzso negative emotion, pain, and cognitive control, was chosen as a seed region due to its particular relevance in zzso representing the zzso target for zzso and showing increased responses to errors in zzso zzso zzso from zzso interaction analyses revealed that significantly altered, inverse zzso occurs between the zzso and the zzso zzso when zzso patients anticipate potential zzso This zzso links the two major contemporary zzso zzso target sites, and provides direct experimental evidence of altered zzso connectivity in zzso zzso an abnormal zzso zzso with cortical areas outside of traditional zzso zzso was identified besides the zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings support the importance of applying connectivity methods to study zzso networks in zzso and favor the application of effective connectivity methods to study zzso abnormalities in zzso patients performing tasks that involve symptom provocation and reinforcement zzso
