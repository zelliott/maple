This paper is motivated from the analysis of zzso data in a study of neural and muscular mechanisms of muscle zzso zzso outcomes of different zzso were obtained simultaneously from multiple zzso including zzso force, zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We first study individual modeling of the zzso response depending on its zzso A zzso beta model and a zzso zzso model are compared for modeling the zzso zzso A zzso zzso model is proposed for modeling the zzso zzso Then, I present a joint modeling approach to model the zzso outcomes together, which allows us to not only estimate the zzso effects but also to evaluate the strength of association among the multiple responses from different zzso A simulation study is conducted to zzso the possible benefits by the new approaches in finite sample zzso Finally, the analysis of the fatigue data is illustrated with the use of the proposed zzso
