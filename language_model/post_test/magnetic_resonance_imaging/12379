zzso zzso in combination with structural zzso zzso source imaging, zzso plays an increasingly important role as one of the tools for zzso evaluation of medically intractable focal zzso The aim of the study was to compare the zzso and commonly used video zzso monitoring method zzso in their sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso in 22 patients with drug resistant zzso Furthermore, the detection and zzso results obtained by both methods were verified using the data of zzso zzso and zzso outcome in 13 patients who underwent invasive zzso monitoring and zzso The results showed that zzso was superior to zzso in terms of sensitivity to zzso with difference in sensitivity of zzso The data also suggested that zzso superiority to zzso in detecting zzso zzso might, at least partly, arise from better zzso responsiveness to zzso events coming from the zzso zzso and zzso aspects of cortical zzso zzso zzso estimates were in the same cortical lobe and at the same zzso aspects as the zzso zzso detected by zzso in all zzso Thus, magnetic source imaging can provide critical zzso information that is not available when other zzso methods, such as zzso and zzso are zzso
