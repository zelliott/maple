To assess the ability of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish known risk factors for zzso we evaluated 17 cognitively normal individuals with a family history of zzso and at least one copy of the zzso e4 zzso compared to 12 individuals who were not carriers of the zzso gene and did not have a family history of zzso Blood oxygen level dependent zzso was performed evaluating zzso signal and zzso default mode network signal differences between the two risk zzso zzso testing revealed that the high risk group performed worse on category zzso testing, but the groups were equivalent on all other cognitive zzso During zzso of novel zzso pairs, there were no regions of zzso zzso zzso that were different in the high risk zzso zzso zzso were greater in magnitude in the low risk group in the zzso and right lateral zzso cortex, similar to findings in zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis demonstrated nine regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that distinguished the two risk zzso zzso zzso analysis could distinguish risk groups with an effect size of zzso compared to an effect size of zzso using zzso zzso zzso Imaging of the resting state avoids performance related zzso seen in zzso zzso is less complicated to acquire and zzso does not require zzso and may be more effective at identifying functional pathology associated with zzso risk compared to zzso zzso zzso
