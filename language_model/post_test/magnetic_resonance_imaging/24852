This study aimed to investigate the zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso risk factors associated with HO were zzso 

The authors zzso analyzed patients who had undergone single-level zzso zzso of a zzso device for the treatment of zzso spinal zzso Patient data recorded were age, sex, zzso weight, body mass index, smoking habits, and surgical zzso zzso zzso was identified through zzso zzso and lateral view zzso The authors developed a simple zzso for defining HO and compared zzso and zzso cases to identify possible risk zzso 

Among 32 patients with follow-up times of zzso months, HO was zzso in 26 zzso Among these 26 patients, HO was in the lateral space of the zzso process but not in the zzso space in 8, HO was in the zzso space but did not bridge the adjacent zzso process in 16, and zzso fusion occurred at the level of the device in zzso zzso of HO was not associated with patient age, sex, zzso weight, body mass index, smoking habits, or surgical zzso 

A high zzso of HO has been detected after zzso of zzso zzso zzso should be aware of this possible outcome, and more studies should be conducted to clarify the clinical effects of zzso
