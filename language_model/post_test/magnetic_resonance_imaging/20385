In the foreseeable future, the zzso field could greatly assist zzso zzso molecules provide information on specific molecular or cellular events that could not only aid diagnosis but potentially differentiate stages of disorders and zzso To accomplish this, reporter molecules literally need to pass a barrier, the zzso which is designed to repel zzso molecules from the zzso Although this is not a trivial task, several transport systems could be tricked into guiding molecules into the zzso The zzso nature in conjunction with a wide availability makes MR imaging particularly suitable for zzso zzso imaging zzso This review explains the principles of MR imaging contrast, zzso different types of reporter zzso and describes strategies to transport reporters into the zzso It also discusses recent advances in MR imaging hardware, pulse zzso the development of targeted reporter zzso and future directions of the MR zzso zzso
