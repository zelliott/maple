The zzso with magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso its zzso and patterns of contrast enhancement were zzso 

A total of zzso zzso examinations were performed in zzso patients using a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence at zzso zzso zzso breast zzso were obtained in 332 zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso including 20 zzso 

Of 20 zzso 14 were correctly diagnosed by zzso on the basis of focal increase of signal zzso In two cases zzso no increase of signal intensity was zzso In another three cases zzso zzso enhancement lead to a zzso zzso In one case zzso zzso was a random finding in a patient diagnosed and treated for adjacent zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso 4 zzso of the zzso did not show zzso at conventional zzso and were only detected at zzso The sensitivity of conventional zzso also amounted to zzso However, the combination of both imaging methods increased sensitivity to zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso is not reliably zzso by zzso alone due to lack of a uniform pattern of zzso
