The performance of a supervised zzso neighbor zzso zzso and a zzso fuzzy zzso zzso zzso zzso method are evaluated for zzso measurement of the volumes of normal brain zzso and zzso zzso The stability of the two zzso methods is evaluated for zzso operator selection of training data, zzso zzso during repeat imaging sessions to determine any variations in the sensor performance over time, zzso variations in the measured volumes between different subjects, and zzso zzso with different imaging zzso The variations were found to be dependent on the type of measured tissue and the operator performing the zzso The zzso during repeat imaging sessions for the zzso method was zzso zzso The absolute volumes of the brain matter and zzso fluid between subjects varied quite large, ranging from zzso to zzso The zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were zzso zzso for the soft zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The corresponding results for the zzso zzso method were higher compared to the zzso zzso
