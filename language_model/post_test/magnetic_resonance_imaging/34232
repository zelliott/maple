In this zzso study, the sensitivities of three magnetic resonance imaging techniques for detecting the appearance of new zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso were evaluated and zzso zzso conventional zzso zzso fast zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso zzso scans were obtained on four occasions, each separated by 28 days, from 18 patients with zzso zzso using a zzso zzso New zzso seen using each sequence during the follow-up were counted by agreement by four observers in two stages zzso 1: random review of complete sets of scans from each zzso stage zzso side-by-side review with a zzso count of new zzso At stage 1, zzso new zzso per patient per month were detected on zzso scans, zzso on zzso zzso more than zzso and zzso on zzso zzso scans zzso more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were, however, reduced after stage zzso zzso detected zzso and zzso zzso scans detected zzso more new zzso than zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso scans detected 144 new zzso whilst the usual combination of zzso and zzso scans detected 133 new zzso This study indicates that enhanced zzso remains the most sensitive method for detecting zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso may be used when monitoring short-term disease activity in zzso either natural or modified by zzso
