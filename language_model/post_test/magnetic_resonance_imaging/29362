An unresolved issue in visual motion perception is how distinct are the processes underlying zzso and zzso zzso The former is defined by zzso variations of zzso and the latter by zzso variations in other image attributes such as contrast or depth, for zzso Using zzso and zzso we present data from four neurological patients with unilateral and mostly cortical zzso which strongly suggest that zzso and zzso motion have a different neural zzso We found that from the early stages of processing, these two types of motions are zzso by two distinct zzso zzso motion is carried out by mechanisms along the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso while the zzso motion by mechanisms mostly along the zzso zzso The data reported here also suggest that different cortical regions may be in charge of processing zzso in zzso motion defined by different zzso zzso
