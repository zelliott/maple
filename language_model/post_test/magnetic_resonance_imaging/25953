Conventional zzso implicitly treats the zzso signal as a single, narrow zzso However, water signals in zzso are often in zzso broadened and have multiple resolvable zzso These components represent discrete populations of water molecules within each zzso which are affected differently by physiology and contrast zzso zzso measurement of each component of the water resonance can improve zzso and functional MR images and provide insight into the structure and dynamics of zzso zzso This report describes high spectral and spatial resolution zzso MR imaging of zzso prostate tumors before and after injection of a zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso images in which intensity is zzso to peak zzso peak frequency, and zzso These images showed zzso features which were not clearly delineated in conventional zzso and zzso echo zzso zzso images obtained after injection of the contrast agent showed T zzso and zzso changes which were not seen in conventional zzso These changes are associated with zzso density and zzso The results suggest zzso with zzso contrast agents has the potential to improve characterization of zzso
