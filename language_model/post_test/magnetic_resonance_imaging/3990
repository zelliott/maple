The effects of white and gray matter diffusion zzso on zzso zzso zzso have been studied in the rat model of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso maps obtained by conventional zzso zzso spin echo zzso imaging zzso were compared with maps of the trace of the diffusion zzso in both normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso trace maps were derived from the average of the zzso maps from three separate experiments with diffusion weighting along three zzso zzso and also from a zzso zzso A marked degree of diffusion zzso was observed in both cortical gray matter and white matter from zzso maps of the control zzso In the zzso animals, the systematic effects of zzso on zzso and zzso area influenced the zzso of the zzso territory in the zzso zzso zzso However, the two trace methods eliminated these effects and gave consistent zzso zzso zzso despite the use of differing diffusion times in the two zzso
