To investigate in zzso the zzso zzso bone structure in elderly human donors with high spatial resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging at zzso T and zzso zzso to zzso compare MR measures of bone zzso with those from zzso zzso zzso and to compare the performance of zzso MR imaging with that of zzso MR imaging in zzso donors with spinal fractures from those without spinal zzso 

The study was performed in line with institutional and legislative requirements; all donors had dedicated their body for educational and research purposes prior to zzso zzso MR images of 49 human zzso zzso specimens were obtained zzso age of donors, zzso years zzso 11 zzso zzso 26 male donors, 23 female zzso After the spatial zzso of images acquired at zzso and zzso MR imaging, the zzso and structural parameters obtained at each magnetic field strength were compared in corresponding zzso zzso was performed on zzso zzso obtained from corresponding regions in 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso spine were zzso classified by using the spinal fracture zzso zzso performance of the structural parameters in zzso donors with zzso fractures from those without was assessed by using receiver operator characteristic zzso analysis, including area under the zzso curve zzso 

zzso between structural parameters at zzso MR imaging and those at zzso were significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than correlations between structural parameters at zzso MR imaging and those at zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso at zzso T vs r zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso dimensions were amplified at zzso T because of increasing zzso zzso Also, higher zzso values were found for structural parameters at zzso T than at zzso zzso but differences were not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso T vs zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

MR imaging at zzso T provided a better measure of the zzso bone structure than did MR imaging at zzso zzso There was a trend for better differentiation of donors with from those without zzso zzso fractures at zzso T than at zzso zzso
