Musical imagery is associated with neural activity in auditory cortex, but prior studies have not examined musical imagery tasks requiring mental zzso This paper describes functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies requiring manipulation of musical zzso In one set of experiments, listeners were asked to mentally reverse a familiar tune when presented zzso This manipulation consistently elicits neural activity in the zzso zzso zzso Separate experiments requiring judgments about melodies that have been zzso from one musical key to another also elicit zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that the same portions of the zzso are recruited in both zzso The findings suggest that the zzso zzso of auditory processing is involved in the manipulation and transformation of auditory information, as has also been shown for zzso and zzso zzso As such, it provides a zzso for the creation of new mental representations that are based on manipulation of previously experienced sensory zzso
