The corpus zzso zzso represents the major zzso tract connecting the two cerebral zzso and is supposed to play crucial zzso role in functional zzso zzso The present study examined whether zzso variations in zzso and zzso of the human zzso are associated with zzso and zzso zzso a combined zzso zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso study was performed on 34 zzso and 33 left-handed subjects of both zzso The zzso surface areas and quantitative measures of molecular diffusion zzso zzso mean zzso of the total zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Analysis revealed a larger total zzso area in zzso as compared to left-handed subjects and in males as compared to zzso Throughout all zzso zzso zzso was found to be increased in left-handed as well as in male subjects, while the mean diffusion was diminished only in zzso For the zzso third of the zzso a significant negative correlation zzso between zzso and area was detected in right-handed zzso zzso significant zzso in the molecular diffusion and in the size of the zzso with respect to gender and zzso were revealed in the present zzso These findings can be interpreted as zzso and zzso differences in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the inspection of the zzso zzso using zzso yields empirical evidence on zzso connectivity that goes well beyond the information revealed by anatomical zzso zzso Thus, zzso has proven to be a useful additional method in cognitive zzso
