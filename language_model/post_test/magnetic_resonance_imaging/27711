The ability to jointly consider several structured mental zzso or relations, is fundamental to human zzso Prior studies have consistently linked this capacity for zzso integration to zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Here, we sought to test two competing zzso zzso zzso processes relations in a zzso manner, interacting with different brain regions as a function of the type of zzso relations that must be zzso or zzso A zzso zzso exists within zzso such that zzso integration in the zzso domain involves relatively more zzso zzso than integration in the semantic zzso To this end, we examined patterns of zzso zzso and functional connectivity during performance of zzso and semantic zzso of a zzso matching zzso Across the two task zzso the regions that were most strongly engaged during zzso comparison were left zzso and left zzso zzso zzso Within left zzso there was considerable overlap in zzso for the semantic and zzso zzso However, zzso task zzso zzso were located zzso to the semantic task zzso In addition, zzso exhibited differential functional connectivity on the two tasks, interacting with different brain regions as a function of the type of relations being zzso While zzso throughout zzso may share the function of zzso diverse zzso individual zzso zzso may have privileged access to particular representations depending on their anatomical zzso organized along a zzso zzso Thus, zzso is zzso as a locus of abstraction from concrete, zzso details to the general principles and rules that enable zzso zzso
