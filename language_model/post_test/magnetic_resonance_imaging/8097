zzso multiple sclerosis zzso in Asians has similar features to the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso is suggested to be zzso based on the frequent detection of specific zzso targeting zzso zzso designated zzso The present study sought to clarify the significance of zzso zzso in the whole spectrum of zzso zzso from 113 consecutive Japanese patients with clinically zzso zzso based on the zzso criteria, were zzso for zzso zzso by zzso using zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were calculated using serum samples with zzso status predetermined at the Mayo zzso The zzso zzso zzso rate was significantly higher in zzso patients zzso zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso other neurological diseases zzso or healthy controls zzso None of the 11 patients tested with a zzso form of zzso were zzso Among zzso patients, the zzso zzso rate was highest in zzso patients with zzso extensive spinal zzso zzso zzso extending over three zzso segments and brain zzso that fulfilled the zzso criteria zzso zzso Multiple zzso analyses revealed that emergence of the zzso zzso was positively associated only with a higher zzso rate, but not with zzso presentation or zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso patients showed significantly higher zzso of severe zzso zzso acute zzso zzso and zzso while most conditions were also common to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso patients were located at the zzso zzso cord, while those in zzso zzso zzso patients appeared throughout the zzso zzso On zzso planes, the former most frequently showed central zzso matter involvement, while zzso involvement was zzso in the zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients zzso involved the zzso zzso presenting a peripheral white zzso pattern, as seen in the short zzso zzso zzso zzso patients fulfilling zzso zzso criteria showed female zzso higher zzso rate, greater frequency of brain zzso and less frequent responses to zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso These findings suggested that zzso are distinct in zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso There were cases of zzso zzso zzso distinct from zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso This indicated that the mechanisms producing zzso are also zzso in cases with zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso
