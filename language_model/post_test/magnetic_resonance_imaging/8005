zzso zzso are rare and benign tumors in the zzso Little is known about their zzso but the implication of the zzso gene is suspected because of their presence in a third of patients with type 2 zzso zzso a disorder caused by zzso of the zzso zzso 

We conducted a clinical and genetic study of a family in which 5 of 9 members suffered from zzso zzso zzso and zzso array analysis were performed on DNA from peripheral blood zzso from affected zzso The zzso gene sequences were then determined in DNA from 3 zzso and all 5 affected members of the zzso 

zzso and zzso array findings were zzso zzso of zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso 9 zzso in all affected members that was absent from all zzso zzso zzso analysis and sequencing revealed a novel zzso transcript characterized by a skipping of zzso 9 (75 zzso This deletion is predicted to result in a zzso acid deletion in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso Modeling of this zzso domain suggests possible disorganization of the zzso zzso 

We report the first family with an zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso without other features of zzso zzso This zzso which has not been described zzso may particularly affect the function of zzso 2 in zzso leading to the development of zzso WHO grade II zzso We propose that sporadic zzso zzso should also be analyzed for this region of zzso zzso
