The zzso of zzso zzso is not well zzso We investigated whether combined zzso imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso could identify zzso meaningful categories of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso were identified from the Beth Israel zzso Medical Center Stroke zzso All patients had zzso and zzso the majority of them within the first 24 hours of symptom zzso 

Three patterns of zzso abnormalities were associated with the diffusion zzso 1, normal zzso (5 zzso 2, localized zzso deficits matching the area of restricted diffusion (5 zzso and 3, extensive zzso deficits involving 1 or more vascular territories (7 zzso All but 1 patient with pattern 1 had transient zzso zzso as the presumed stroke zzso Two patients with pattern 2 had cardiac or zzso zzso zzso none had zzso disease or zzso zzso zzso was detected in all patients with this pattern who submitted to a follow-up zzso All patients with pattern 3 had severe zzso or zzso of a large zzso the internal zzso anterior zzso or middle zzso 

We zzso that the zzso zzso varies according to the mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso zzso deficits occurring with zzso in the absence of significant zzso disease may not be revealed by zzso zzso may cause some cases of small zzso zzso zzso Critical zzso disease may cause large territorial zzso deficits and zzso to zzso zzso
