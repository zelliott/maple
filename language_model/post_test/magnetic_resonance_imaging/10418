We sought to compare the image quality, zzso zzso and the diagnostic performance of zzso T and zzso T zzso iron zzso liver magnetic resonance imaging zzso for detecting focal zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 35 patients with zzso proven liver zzso underwent both zzso and zzso T zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the zzso response receiver operating characteristic zzso Image artifacts, quality, and the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso of the zzso were zzso 

No significant difference of area under zzso curve zzso zzso was zzso The mean zzso and zzso of the zzso was higher in the zzso T zzso There was no difference between the zzso T and the zzso T image sets for zzso zzso but the image quality was better on zzso zzso Motion and zzso artifacts were more frequent on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were equivalent on the zzso T and zzso T image zzso More prominent artifacts on zzso T zzso iron zzso liver zzso zzso advantage of higher zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
