The suitability of a previously hypothesized zzso model of zzso processing, involving analog zzso auditory zzso and visual Arabic codes of zzso was investigated for the complex mathematical task of the mental addition and zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data from 15 normal adult subjects were processed using exploratory group Independent zzso Analysis zzso Separate zzso components were found with zzso in bilateral inferior zzso left zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results support the hypothesized zzso model corresponding to the activated regions found in the individual components and indicate that the zzso model may be a suitable framework for analyzing the zzso bases of the performance of complex mathematical zzso
