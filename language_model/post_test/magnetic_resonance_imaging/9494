zzso stem cells zzso have attracted major research interest due to their potential use in cell replacement zzso In patients, human cells are the preferred choice, one source of human zzso being the brain of zzso The aims of the present study were to explore the long-term zzso mobility and viability of zzso derived from the human fetal zzso in response to zzso zzso To investigate long-term zzso and functional dynamics of zzso in zzso by magnetic resonance imaging, these cells were labeled with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso of human zzso left the quantitative profile of the zzso cell composition and differentiation capacity of the cells in zzso zzso Also after zzso the zzso after long-term cell differentiation were not significantly different from zzso zzso Upon zzso we detected a zzso corresponding to the zzso graft location in all animals and zzso for at least 4 zzso The zzso signal appeared visually similar both in location and in volume over zzso However, quantitative zzso analysis showed that the zzso apparent graft volume decreased significantly from 3 to 16 zzso Finally, the human zzso were not zzso after zzso indicating lack of tumor zzso These cells are thus a promising candidate for zzso relevant investigations for stem zzso zzso zzso
