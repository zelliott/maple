We evaluated the role of magnetic resonance zzso imaging with zzso acid zzso in zzso regional liver function in a rat zzso zzso zzso liver damage was induced in the right lobe by vascular clamping for 0 zzso 30 zzso 60 zzso and 90 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso groups was clearly zzso as a high intensity area in the zzso images at late phase of zzso enhancement, Moreover, the zzso of signal intensity in zzso zzso significantly correlated with the duration of vascular zzso We also observed significant correlation between zzso and zzso concentration in the liver tissue zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our results indicate that MR imaging with zzso is useful for evaluation of regional liver function in zzso
