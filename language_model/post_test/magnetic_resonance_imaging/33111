zzso relaxation is traditionally described as a zzso signal zzso with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso by fitting to the zzso model can be substantially compromised in the presence of field zzso especially for low zzso zzso The normal approach to address this issue involves the development of dedicated composite zzso zzso for artifact reduction while still using the zzso model for zzso zzso In this work, we propose an alternative approach for improved zzso zzso with the zzso rotary echo zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso by fitting to a modified theoretical model which is derived to reveal the dependence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso time, zzso frequency and zzso without involving complicated zzso pulse zzso It has zzso for zzso zzso improvement at low zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping was demonstrated on phantom and in zzso rat zzso imaging at 3 T compared to the mapping using the zzso zzso
