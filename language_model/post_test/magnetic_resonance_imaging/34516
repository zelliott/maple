zzso is thought to be important in the zzso of cerebral zzso The mechanism of zzso induction remains unclear but several studies suggest that it is zzso triggered by zzso zzso zzso We examined in cats whether induction of zzso after zzso h of unilateral middle cerebral artery zzso plus 10 h of zzso is influenced by the degree of cerebral zzso zzso zzso monitoring over time of the disturbances of cerebral zzso in zzso brain areas and evaluation of zzso zzso associated with zzso deficits was achieved by using two zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso high-speed echo zzso imaging combined with a zzso of magnetic zzso contrast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were counted in zzso areas with different severity of zzso injury characterized by magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The number of zzso cells was significantly higher in zzso areas with severe zzso deficits during zzso and zzso zzso changes 10 h after zzso In contrast, in areas where zzso was reduced but maintained during zzso there were no zzso zzso changes and significantly fewer zzso zzso A similar number of cells that undergo zzso were shown in regions with transient or prolonged zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso process is induced in the zzso core and contributes significantly in the zzso of zzso associated with transient zzso
