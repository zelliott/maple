zzso iron oxide zzso zzso are potential zzso for zzso cell zzso but the design of safe zzso coupled with high labeling efficiency is still an important objective for such zzso In this study, an efficient zzso probe has been developed for zzso stem cells zzso labeling and zzso Different from many other systems involving high molecular zzso we chose low molecular weight zzso zzso to form stable zzso with zzso zzso The probe can hold multiple zzso zzso with a controlled zzso structure, leading to much higher zzso zzso compared to single zzso zzso zzso zzso are unaffected in their zzso zzso or differentiation zzso The iron zzso process in zzso displays a zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso reveals that the zzso are zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso injection of the labeled zzso dispersed in a collagen type I zzso showed strong image contrast against zzso cells under a clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanner up to 19 days zzso This study provides an important alternative to label zzso at zzso low zzso with high efficiency, and the probe may be useful to label other biologically important cells for imaging zzso
