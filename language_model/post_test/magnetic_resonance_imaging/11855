zzso zzso of zzso and zzso data is indispensable for the correct interpretation of zzso maps or source zzso in relation to brain anatomy derived from zzso In this study, a method for the zzso of zzso and zzso data is zzso The method consists of an zzso matching of zzso based reconstructions of the scalp surface to zzso zzso zzso based surface reconstruction is achieved via zzso zzso of individually digitized zzso zzso In contrast to other approaches, neither zzso determination nor any additional provisions (such as bite bars, other zzso devices or head shape zzso are required, and zzso errors associated with inaccurate zzso determination are zzso The accuracy of the method was estimated by calculating the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso surface reconstructions in 20 zzso In addition, the distance between zzso and genuine zzso coordinates was assessed via a simulation study, in which surface reconstruction was based on virtual zzso determined on the scalp surface of a high-resolution zzso data zzso The mean zzso zzso of surface reconstructions was zzso zzso and the zzso distance between any two matched surface points was zzso zzso The simulated zzso revealed a mean zzso of genuine and zzso zzso coordinates of zzso zzso It is concluded that surface matching using zzso zzso reconstructions of scalp surfaces is a precise and highly zzso method to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
