zzso zzso cell zzso is a rare aggressive zzso of zzso cell zzso with a zzso for the head and neck zzso There are only two case reports in the literature documenting a zzso cavity zzso cell zzso presenting as a primary zzso zzso 

We report a rare case of zzso cavity zzso zzso cell zzso presenting initially as a zzso bridge zzso Two initial zzso revealed features consistent with zzso cell zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso 

Final surgical pathology showed extensive invasive zzso cell zzso with zzso differentiation arising from the zzso zzso zzso with extension to the zzso zzso The zzso features were interpreted as zzso zzso cell zzso 

We discuss the difficulties in zzso diagnosis of this condition given its varied zzso zzso As well, this case emphasizes the necessity for diagnostic vigilance when assessing a primary zzso zzso as it may be a rare presentation of an underlying zzso extending to the zzso
