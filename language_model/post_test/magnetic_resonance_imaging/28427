zzso medical imaging enables measurement of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of a zzso zzso within the zzso Using a conceptual spatial zzso model these data may be transformed to provide information on deposition per airway zzso This methodology has been used to study the zzso deposition patterns of two zzso of a zzso dose zzso and two zzso in control zzso The zzso study has also been zzso using a computer model of zzso The comparison between derived experimental results and those from computer modeling shows areas of agreement, although there are also areas of zzso The new methodology has considerable potential value in the fields of inhalation therapy and deposition zzso although more detailed validation is still zzso
