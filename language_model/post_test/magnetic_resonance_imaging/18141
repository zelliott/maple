Memory formation is known to be critically dependent upon the zzso zzso lobe zzso Despite this zzso role, it remains unclear whether and how zzso zzso processes are affected by zzso goal zzso Here, we examined the manner in which task demands at zzso affect zzso activity and its relation to subsequent memory zzso Participants were scanned using high-resolution zzso of the zzso while engaging in two incidental zzso tasks: one that directed zzso attention to stimulus zzso and the other requiring evaluation of similarities across zzso We hypothesized that attending to distinctiveness would lead to the formation of more detailed memories and would more effectively engage the zzso circuit than attending to zzso In line with our zzso higher rates of subsequent recollection were observed for stimuli studied under the zzso than zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and the zzso demonstrated an interaction between memory performance and task such that a significant subsequent memory effect was found only when task goals required attention to stimulus zzso To this end, robust engagement of the zzso circuit may zzso the observed behavioral benefits of attending to zzso Taken together, these findings advance understanding of the effects of zzso intentional information on successful memory formation across zzso of the zzso
