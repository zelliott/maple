Previous studies assessing the magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis zzso achieved conflicting zzso zzso zzso zzso provides metrics that are sensitive to the zzso and microscopic zzso zzso load with increased specificity to the more destructive aspects of zzso pathology than conventional zzso We performed an exploratory study to assess the magnitude of the correlation between quantities derived from zzso and measures of cognitive impairment in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans of the brain and an extensive battery of zzso tests zzso language, complex reasoning, attention and zzso were obtained from 34 zzso zzso We measured zzso and zzso zzso volumes zzso and brain zzso Average zzso mean zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso were zzso D and zzso zzso from the brain tissue zzso the zzso brain tissue zzso the zzso white matter zzso and the zzso gray matter zzso were also zzso Nine patients zzso were found to be cognitively zzso zzso correlations were found between symbol zzso zzso test, verbal zzso test and zzso spatial recall test scores and zzso zzso zzso zzso and average zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso values zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso No correlations were found between any of the zzso test scores and brain volume, average zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides quantitative metrics that seem to reflect the severity of language, attention and memory deficits in patients with zzso This study also suggests that the extent and the intrinsic nature of the zzso zzso as well as the damage of the zzso and zzso all contribute to the zzso deficits of zzso zzso
