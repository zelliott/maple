The clinical and zzso results of the patients with removed zzso zzso ligament zzso were compared with those of the patients with preserved zzso in the treatment of cervical zzso zzso zzso 

To investigate effect of zzso of the zzso in anterior zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso has been proved to be effective in the treatment of zzso and the zzso matters including zzso disc, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso ligament should be definitely zzso However, it still remains controversial to remove degenerative or zzso zzso considering the potential risks of zzso tears and zzso zzso 

Between March 1997 and December 2002, 58 patients who underwent anterior zzso for zzso were included in this zzso Among them, the zzso was removed in 31 patients zzso removed zzso and that was preserved in the other 27 patients zzso preserved zzso The clinical zzso zzso Association zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the spinal zzso on magnetic resonance zzso results were compared between 2 zzso The risk of complications and zzso was also zzso 

With a 12-month zzso the mean zzso score increased from zzso to zzso in zzso removed group and that increased from zzso to zzso in zzso preserved zzso The improvement rate between 2 groups was significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso study showed that the increase of diameter of the spinal zzso in zzso removed group was significantly greater than that in zzso preserved group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only 1 patient with zzso removed developed zzso fluid leakage after operation, and 8 patients (5 with zzso preserved and 3 with zzso zzso need zzso revision zzso 

zzso of zzso was generally safe and helpful to get more zzso in anterior approach for zzso although more technically zzso
