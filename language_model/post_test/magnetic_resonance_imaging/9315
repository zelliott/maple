To determine the accuracy of zzso pelvic magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the zzso assessment of zzso and to evaluate colon wall involvement after zzso gel zzso 

Institutional review board approval for this study was zzso and each patient gave written informed zzso zzso consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of zzso underwent pelvic MR imaging at zzso T before zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso zzso sequences were repeated after the zzso was filled with zzso zzso zzso Two blinded readers interpreted images zzso Image quality was scored by using a zzso zzso zzso mapping of deep zzso was zzso zzso wall zzso was graded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging results were compared with surgical and zzso zzso zzso agreement was assessed by using zzso zzso zzso tests were performed to compare colon wall zzso scores without and those with US gel and between zzso 

zzso of 41 patients had deep zzso at surgery and zzso zzso zzso zzso positive and negative zzso values, and accuracy for the diagnosis of deep zzso at MR imaging were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of 26), zzso zzso of zzso and zzso (40 of zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso depending on the location of deep zzso zzso wall zzso assessment by both readers correlated well with zzso findings zzso zzso zzso although median wall involvement scores were lower at zzso examination than for both readers both before zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso and after zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso gel zzso 

MR imaging of the pelvis at zzso T is accurate in the diagnosis and staging of deep zzso for the zzso assessment of patients clinically suspected of having zzso
