Many automatic zzso have been proposed for analyzing magnetic resonance imaging zzso data zzso With the increasingly large data sets being used in brain zzso there has been a significant rise in the need for accelerating these zzso zzso volume zzso zzso a brain tissue zzso zzso for zzso was implemented on a zzso gate array zzso high performance zzso computer using the zzso high-level language zzso This work develops on prior work in which we conducted initial studies on accelerating the prior information zzso zzso In this paper, we extend the work to include probability density zzso and present new results and additional zzso We used several simulated and real human brain MR images to evaluate the accuracy and performance improvement of the proposed zzso The zzso probability density zzso and prior information zzso zzso achieved an average zzso over an zzso 2 CPU of zzso zzso and zzso zzso , zzso The overall performance improvement of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with four zzso
