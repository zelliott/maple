To investigate the early changes in zzso MR images in the sustained zzso zzso 

zzso injection of zzso acid was used to induce sustained zzso zzso in seven zzso The animals were investigated with serial zzso MR imaging beginning immediately after zzso zzso seizures, and at 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso images and apparent diffusion zzso were zzso assessed and compared with zzso zzso The results were compared with eight control animals given zzso saline zzso 

zzso MR images revealed an increase in signal intensity zzso in the zzso and the zzso zzso immediately after the sustained seizures, whereas zzso images did not show changes in signal intensity at this zzso Both zzso and zzso images showed marked increase in signal zzso in these same areas 24 hours after zzso acid zzso The apparent diffusion zzso values were significantly lower in the area of the zzso and the zzso zzso immediately after and lower again 24 hours after the sustained zzso The area of zzso in zzso images was zzso with the zzso distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso MR revealed focal abnormalities in the zzso system after 1 hour of sustained zzso induced with zzso acid, before changes on zzso zzso zzso MR is a potential method for studying the mechanisms of brain damage caused by sustained zzso
