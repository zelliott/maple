zzso zzso dynamic zzso imaging provides information about the regional cerebral blood volume zzso an increase of which indicates zzso MR zzso imaging informs about zzso changes in brain tumors, with elevated zzso zzso values revealing cell proliferation and density, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso zzso This study investigates zzso changes within the tumor zzso of zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso maps of zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated in 36 patients with primary or zzso WHO grade III or IV zzso Apart from zzso and zzso values within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso values of the tumor tissue were recorded zzso zzso The correlation between these parameters was analyzed with zzso zzso test while a zzso test was performed to check whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that, in 29 of the 36 patients, neither zzso nor zzso had their zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, zzso was highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Further zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Neither of the zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso In conclusion, in WHO grade III and IV zzso the zzso with zzso zzso often differs from the zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso indicating the spatial divergence between zzso and tumor cell zzso cell density and zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso changes within the area of zzso are positively correlated with the zzso increase within the tumor zzso These results demonstrate aspects of regional tumor zzso as characterized by different MR zzso that, apart from zzso grading might be crucial for zzso biopsy as well as for zzso and future molecular zzso
