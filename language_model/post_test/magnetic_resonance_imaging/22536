zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso muscle belly has been implicated as a possible zzso of tears of the zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess whether patients with zzso confirmed tears of the zzso zzso zzso have a more zzso located zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was done to identify all patients in whom direct inspection of the zzso zzso was done between 1999 and zzso The operative reports were zzso and all in whom a zzso zzso tear was confirmed were included in the study group, Group I (29 zzso Group II represented an operative control group and consisted of all patients who had operative inspection of the zzso zzso but did not have a tear (30 zzso Group III represented a zzso control group and consisted of patients who had zzso of the ankle for reasons unrelated to lateral ankle symptoms (30 zzso For each patient, the vertical distance from the zzso junction of the zzso zzso zzso to the tip of the fibula was measured on zzso zzso The role of gender also was zzso The average distance between the zzso junction of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso fibula was calculated solely for men and women in all three zzso zzso comparison of the groups was performed using the zzso zzso zzso reliability was determined by calculating zzso Alpha zzso 

The average distance from the zzso junction to the tip of the fibula was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Groups I, II, and III, zzso The average distance in Group I was statistically significantly lower than the average distance in both Groups II and III zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the difference in the distance between Groups II and III also was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The average distances in both men and women were statistically significantly different zzso zzso zzso among the three zzso 

It has been hypothesized that tears of the zzso zzso zzso result from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso muscle zzso This study provides zzso support for this zzso
