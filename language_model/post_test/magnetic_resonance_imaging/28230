We assigned 67 patients with central zzso zzso alternately to either multiple zzso or total zzso The zzso however, allowed multiple zzso to be changed to total zzso if it was thought that the former procedure might not give adequate neural zzso There were therefore three treatment groups: group I consisting of 26 patients submitted to multiple zzso group II, 9 patients scheduled for zzso but submitted to zzso and group III, 32 patients scheduled for, and submitted to, zzso The mean follow-up was zzso zzso zzso zzso at two or three levels required a longer mean operating time than total zzso at an equal number of zzso The mean blood loss at surgery and the clinical results did not differ in the three zzso The mean zzso improvement score for low back pain was higher in group I but there was also a higher zzso of neural complications in this zzso No patient in group I had zzso zzso instability, whereas this occurred in three patients in groups II and III, who had zzso zzso or degenerative zzso zzso Multiple zzso is recommended for all patients with zzso zzso and for those with mild to moderate degenerative zzso or degenerative zzso Total zzso is to be preferred for patients with severe degenerative zzso or marked degenerative zzso
