zzso zzso virus encephalitis is a severe sporadic encephalitis in man with high mortality and zzso A critical step in the establishment of therapy is early zzso zzso resonance imaging is a zzso accurate diagnostic test for the detection of central nervous system zzso In an effort to monitor zzso changes in zzso we present a new diagnostic zzso model of experimental zzso zzso virus zzso A mouse model of zzso zzso virus encephalitis was zzso 40 zzso mice were zzso zzso with an infectious dose of zzso strain zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were studied by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso These findings were correlated with sequential zzso zzso zzso of animals developed cerebral abnormalities on zzso resembling human zzso Areas of increased signal intensity on zzso sequences and focal pathological contrast enhancement were mostly found in the frontal and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso All animals with zzso abnormalities had zzso signs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in corresponding zzso The described monitoring system offers a new approach for studies on zzso and therapeutic zzso
