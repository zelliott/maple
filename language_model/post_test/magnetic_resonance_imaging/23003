The purpose of this study was to determine whether the zzso plate is zzso horizontal in women with normal support, zzso different between women with and without zzso zzso related to zzso hiatus and zzso body zzso 

zzso of cases with zzso at least 1 zzso below the zzso and normal controls with all points 1 zzso or more above the zzso were zzso enrolled in a study of pelvic organ support to be of similar age, race, and zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso during zzso zzso plate angle zzso was measured relative to a horizontal reference zzso zzso hiatus length zzso and zzso body location zzso were also zzso Student zzso tests and zzso correlation zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso controls and 74 cases were zzso During zzso controls had a mean zzso of zzso degrees zzso Cases, compared to controls, had zzso degrees zzso more zzso directed zzso zzso degrees vs zzso degrees , P zzso zzso zzso larger zzso length zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso more zzso zzso location zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso in zzso were correlated with increased zzso length zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso location zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The measured zzso plate angle in women with normal support is zzso degrees zzso During zzso women with zzso have a modest zzso zzso though statistically greater zzso plate angle compared to zzso This larger angle showed moderate correlation with larger zzso hiatus length and greater displacement of the zzso body in women with zzso compared to zzso
