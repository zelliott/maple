Several studies have provided data on the zzso zzso of normal zzso but there is a paucity of data on the zzso zzso in patients with idiopathic zzso 

The zzso of the zzso and bodies of 307 zzso as well as the distance between the zzso and the zzso zzso (the zzso zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso idiopathic zzso were analyzed with use of magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso 

A distinct zzso asymmetry was found at the zzso region of the zzso curves, with significantly thinner zzso on the zzso side than on the convex side zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso diminished farther away from the zzso with zzso symmetry restored at the neutral zzso In the zzso spine, the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso measured between zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso side and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the convex side zzso zzso zzso In the zzso spine, the zzso zzso measured between zzso zzso at the zzso part of the curve and zzso zzso at the zzso part of the zzso The chord length and the zzso length gradually increased from 34 zzso and 18 zzso respectively, at the fourth zzso vertebra to 51 zzso and 25 zzso respectively, at the third zzso zzso The zzso zzso angle measured 15 in the zzso aspect of the zzso spine, decreased to 7 at the zzso zzso vertebra, and increased again to 16 at the fourth zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso space was zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso levels and averaged 1 zzso at the zzso zzso zzso levels on the zzso side, whereas it was between 3 zzso and 5 zzso on the convex side zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with distinctive zzso zzso with smaller zzso on the zzso side and a shift of the zzso zzso toward the zzso
