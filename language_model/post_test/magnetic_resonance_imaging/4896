Carcinoma ex zzso zzso zzso is a rare aggressive zzso zzso arising from a primary or zzso benign mixed zzso Only a few case reports describing the zzso features of zzso have been zzso 

To describe and characterize the magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings of zzso in the zzso zzso and correlate them with zzso zzso 

The MR images of surgically proven zzso in the zzso zzso of five men and five women ranging in age from 28 to 75 years zzso 52 zzso were zzso zzso All MR images were evaluated with emphasis on the size, margin zzso zzso zzso the presence of an zzso zzso and signal intensity on zzso or zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso 

The average zzso diameter was zzso zzso All 10 tumors had zzso zzso and seven tumors showed zzso zzso reflecting invasive growth of the zzso component identified on zzso zzso Eight tumors had a round zzso component and seven of those signal zzso were a mixture of zzso and zzso on zzso or STIR zzso zzso correlation of these components revealed zzso zzso tumors containing zzso and zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso components had zzso and various signal zzso 

An invasive zzso mass zzso with a round zzso component is suggestive of zzso ex zzso zzso
