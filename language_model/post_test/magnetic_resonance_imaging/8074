zzso inflammatory zzso known collectively as zzso are chronic diseases that cause zzso mainly from muscle zzso despite the use of zzso zzso An improved outcome requires increased knowledge of the key molecular pathways that cause symptoms in muscles and other zzso zzso advances offer promise for improving our understanding of disease mechanisms, and some tools will be helpful in diagnosis and the assessment of therapeutic zzso The application of new tools depends on their validation in zzso studies using clinical outcome measures combined with assessments of molecular events in affected zzso Clinical outcome measures and definitions of improvement have been developed and validated through the International zzso Assessment and Clinical Studies zzso Some imaging techniques, such as zzso and magnetic resonance zzso of muscles, and high-resolution CT of zzso can assess changes in local inflammatory activity, among many other aspects of zzso Changes in protein and gene expression patterns in repeated zzso from affected zzso zzso skin and zzso provide molecular information and allow increasingly precise disease zzso and therapeutic zzso but are to date only research zzso This Review focuses on advances in diagnostic and outcome tools and their roles in clinical practice and clinical research in patients with zzso and zzso
