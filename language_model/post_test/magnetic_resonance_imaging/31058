A functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was conducted during which seven subjects carried out zzso tactile object recognition zzso of real zzso zzso zzso zzso across subjects, were compared between tasks involving zzso of common real objects, zzso of zzso objects, and zzso The tactile tasks involved similar motor and sensory zzso allowing higher tactile recognition processes to be zzso Compared to nonsense object zzso the most prominent zzso evoked by zzso was in secondary zzso areas in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirming a zzso path for zzso zzso zzso was also present in zzso and lateral secondary motor zzso but not in primary motor areas, supporting the high level of sensory and motor integration characteristic of object recognition in the tactile zzso zzso in a lateral zzso area associated previously with visual object recognition may support zzso collateral zzso Finally, zzso in zzso zzso and prefrontal areas may reflect a common final zzso of zzso object zzso This study suggests that zzso involves a complex network including zzso and insular zzso association zzso as well as zzso visual areas, zzso and zzso zzso zzso areas, and zzso and lateral secondary motor zzso It confirms the involvement of zzso association areas in the recognition component of zzso and the existence of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso in intact zzso It challenges the results of previous studies that emphasize the role of visual zzso rather than zzso association zzso in zzso zzso zzso
