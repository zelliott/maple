How the dominant zzso zzso zzso contributes to naming performance is zzso In this case report, a patient with an zzso near the dominant zzso was given a zzso task during zzso electrical stimulation in order to zzso as much zzso zzso as possible without zzso the dominant zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso with the zzso task also provided some insights into how the dominant zzso contributes to naming zzso The stimulation induced naming difficulty, verbal zzso and zzso and continuous zzso Moreover, just after producing the incorrect responses, the patient displayed continuous zzso even though the stimulation had zzso The left zzso connects to the inferior frontal zzso which is necessary for word production, so that the naming difficulty appears to be the result of disrupted word production caused by electrical stimulation of the dominant zzso The verbal zzso appears to be due to the failure to select the correct word from semantic memory and the failure to suppress the incorrect zzso The left zzso is associated with working memory, which plays an important role in zzso zzso The continuous zzso appears to be due to disturbances in word production and a failure to inhibit an appropriate zzso These findings in this case suggest that the dominant zzso has multiple roles in the naming of zzso
