The components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso receive different kinds of zzso The zzso zzso receives primarily zzso information, the zzso zzso receives contextual information, and the zzso receives high-level zzso that include zzso context, and other zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have similar zzso which differ considerably from that of the zzso and suggest that these zzso process their zzso differently from the way that the zzso processes its zzso Much evidence indicates that the zzso is designed to rapidly bind together zzso representations that support zzso zzso In contrast, the newer zzso zzso rapidly create poorly zzso memories that support familiarity well, but zzso very zzso For over a decade, there has been disagreement about whether zzso is primarily zzso by the zzso and familiarity by the zzso newer zzso zzso or whether the zzso mediates these kinds of memory in an zzso homogeneous zzso Common zzso about familiarity, recollection, item, and zzso memory are discussed as are zzso problems with zzso zzso and functional imaging zzso The possible confound of familiarity with weaker memory and recollection with stronger memory is discussed and the implications of the zzso et zzso zzso functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso study, which matched memory strength between strong familiarity and recollection, finding that only recollection activated the zzso are zzso A suggestion is made about how the long-running conflict of findings in the human zzso zzso literature may be zzso
