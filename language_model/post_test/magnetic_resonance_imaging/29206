The ability to zzso zzso brain structures by magnetic resonance imaging zzso improves the planning for surgical removal of zzso located in and around the third zzso The zzso approach is the most appropriate path to the anterior part of the third zzso The present study was undertaken to obtain zzso zzso data, derived from zzso zzso scans, which are necessary for operation planning that takes into account the surgical zzso and landmarks encountered during this zzso 

The zzso evaluation was performed on 72 zzso zzso zzso The surface landmarks for the corridor were the two points, zzso and zzso located 5 and 7 zzso anterior to the central zzso zzso With these two points on the cortical surface as references, a variety of zzso were made to provide quantitative information about distances between brain structures encountered during the surgical zzso In addition, various parameters were determined to characterize the different shapes of the zzso and the different types of zzso zzso 

The following zzso zzso were zzso 1) the distance between zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso 2) the distance between the zzso zzso and the corpus zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso 3) the height of the corpus zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso 4) the distance between the anterior zzso and the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso and zzso 5) the distance between the lower margin of the corpus zzso and the upper zzso point of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso 6) the distance between the lower margin of the corpus zzso and the lower zzso point of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and 7) the distance between the lower margin of the corpus zzso and the anterior zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reference to zzso Four different zzso types between the zzso and the corpus zzso were noted and zzso 

zzso data concerning the surrounding structures of the third zzso have received very little attention in the zzso This zzso study permitted definition of the surgical corridor to the third zzso by preserving important zzso structures such as the motor strip, zzso of the corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso The detailed zzso data obtained on zzso zzso scans of the brain structures involved in the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso approach allow for exact planning of the surgical zzso
