A zzso method for assessing regional zzso work is zzso The method zzso zzso magnetic resonance images zzso obtained from two sets of zzso planes to mark and reconstruct 24 small zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the in zzso left zzso zzso Regional zzso work is assessed by calculating the area enclosed by the zzso wall zzso zzso loop of each studied zzso The method was applied to six normal canine zzso In addition, a global zzso work index was obtained from the corresponding estimated zzso zzso zzso The average work index calculated using the zzso loop was zzso zzso zzso zzso in agreement with the average index obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso correlate zzso with a correlation zzso of zzso
