To compare the imaging characteristics of magnetic resonance zzso delayed enhancement between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso analyzed the imaging and clinical characteristics of 25 patients who had MR delayed zzso 

Among the 25 cases, 19 cases were zzso heart diseases, in which the delayed enhancement was zzso zzso or zzso two cases were zzso zzso in which the delayed enhancement was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso one case was zzso zzso in which the delayed enhancement was diffuse small zzso spots two cases was restrictive zzso in which the delayed enhancement was located in the area of the zzso both of the right and left zzso and one case was a mass of the lateral wall of the left zzso in which the delayed enhancement with a zzso shape was zzso 

MR zzso delayed enhancement is not a specific sign of zzso zzso of zzso heart zzso The differentiation of the zzso of the delayed enhancement relies upon both the MR images and the clinical zzso
