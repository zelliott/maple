A study was conducted to determine the possibility of evaluating the blood flow in cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso by employing dynamic zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso U 555 zzso which can be rapidly injected via an intravenous zzso 

Six patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso served as the zzso Dynamic zzso includes images obtained at zzso and at 10 zzso zzso 60, zzso 180, zzso 300 and 600 s after the start of injection of zzso U 555 zzso CT zzso zzso zzso and CT during zzso zzso zzso were used as the standards of reference, and these were performed in all patients three days after dynamic zzso The signal changes were evaluated at each phase, especially at the zzso phase from the viewpoints of a zzso zzso ratio zzso and visual zzso 

A total of 23 zzso zzso were detected on zzso and zzso Of the 23 zzso 17 were detected on zzso U 555 A enhanced zzso zzso timing during acquisition of the zzso phase was considered in two cases with three zzso Of 14 zzso excluding two cases with incorrect timing, a reduction in the transient signal in the zzso at the zzso phase was visually recognized in 10 zzso zzso zzso differences were seen in tumor size between visible and zzso tumors involving transient signal reduction zzso zzso zzso gradually increased after rapidly decreasing in the zzso zzso 

zzso U 555 A enhanced zzso is valuable in limited zzso zzso of tumor blood flow employing dynamic zzso with zzso U 555 A is affected by tumor size and requires optimal timing of the zzso zzso
