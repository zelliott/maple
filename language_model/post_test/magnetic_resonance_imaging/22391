zzso of a similarity metric is an essential component in zzso medical image zzso The increasing availability of parallel computers makes zzso some registration tasks an attractive option to increase zzso In this paper, two new zzso zzso and zzso parallel zzso methods are adapted for image zzso zzso zzso zzso is a global technique for zzso bounded problems, and zzso search zzso is a recent local zzso The performance of zzso zzso and hybrid methods using a parallel zzso of Powell's method for local zzso are zzso Experimental results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are zzso accurate, and substantially reduce zzso time in parallel zzso
