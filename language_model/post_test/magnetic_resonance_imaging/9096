Many structural brain zzso accompany left zzso language zzso For example, the zzso zzso is larger in the zzso zzso of the right hemisphere, while the more zzso zzso zzso is larger on the zzso The functional significance of these zzso is unknown because zzso studies rarely attempt to zzso zzso to specific zzso possibly due to difficulties in consistent zzso zzso In zzso cortex, for example, there are many regions of partial zzso overlap where zzso images do not provide sufficient information to zzso distinguish a zzso zzso from a displaced anterior zzso zzso As large samples of zzso material are rarely available for zzso studies of zzso variation, we have investigated the effect of variation in boundary and zzso definition on zzso asymmetry in the zzso scans of 200 healthy adults zzso men, 100 zzso Although women displayed a reliable asymmetry in the size of the zzso zzso regardless of boundary definition or technique, asymmetry was greatest when zzso the measurement was limited to the zzso region between the zzso and the anterior zzso and zzso the more zzso of two overlapping zzso was always classified as a zzso zzso (rather than as a displaced zzso zzso The fact that zzso asymmetry is zzso in the zzso region suggests that this region may play a particular role in zzso specialization for zzso Future work should investigate the structural and functional zzso of zzso variation in this zzso
