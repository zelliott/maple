The zzso zzso for which zzso zzso is indicated are often accompanied by a disruption of the zzso barrier zzso which allows the contrast agent to come into contact with the nervous zzso Thus, assessment of the zzso safety for a new contrast agent is of crucial zzso The objective of this study was to assess the zzso of the new zzso contrast agent zzso zzso using zzso in the presence of focal zzso of the zzso 

zzso of the zzso were obtained inducing a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso administered at zzso zzso An zzso was recorded during zzso behavior and was analyzed for zzso tracing and for changes in spectral content in terms of total power and frequency zzso The presence of the zzso zzso was verified using zzso liquid zzso measurement of the zzso zzso content in the zzso 

zzso zzso did not have any zzso effect in zzso zzso However, it caused a zzso shift of the zzso power spectrum toward the zzso to 9 zzso frequency bands of the zzso zzso during quiet zzso In the zzso cortex, higher levels of zzso zzso were found until 3 hours after zzso 

In experimental conditions of focal brain zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated up to doses even 10 times higher than the maximum clinical dose zzso zzso intended for brain imaging zzso
