To describe the magnetic resonance zzso appearances of the bone zzso of children's feet and to determine their frequency and zzso 

A review of MR studies obtained in a retrospective series of 35 children with foot pain and in a prospective series of 19 zzso children was zzso The MR appearances on zzso zzso and STIR sequences were assessed and the frequency of zzso areas of low signal intensity on zzso and high signal intensity on zzso or STIR sequences was determined and correlated with clinical zzso 

Low signal intensity on zzso and high signal intensity on zzso and STIR sequences were seen in zzso of symptomatic and 57% of zzso zzso In all cases where both feet were zzso the changes were seen zzso The zzso pattern varied from multiple discrete zzso to more extensive zzso areas of high signal on the STIR zzso These appearances are frequent and represent normal variation in the growing zzso and should not necessarily be interpreted as a sign of zzso
