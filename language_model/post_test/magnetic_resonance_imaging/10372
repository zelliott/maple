zzso zzso that cannot be detected by mechanisms sensitive only to zzso zzso ubiquitous in visual scenes, but the zzso mechanisms zzso perception of such stimuli are not well zzso We used an adaptation protocol to measure neural activity in the human brain selective for the orientation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were measured in three subjects to presentations of zzso and zzso probe zzso after adapting to a zzso zzso or zzso grating that was either parallel or zzso to the probe zzso zzso zzso stimuli were generated by modulating the stimulus zzso zzso stimuli were generated by modulating the contrast zzso or orientation zzso of a zzso zzso We used four combinations of adapter and probe zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The fourth condition tested for zzso adaptation with zzso adapter and zzso probe zzso Attention was diverted from the stimulus by a demanding task at zzso Both zzso and zzso stimuli zzso zzso adaptation in multiple cortical visual areas, including zzso zzso zzso zzso a newly identified visual area anterior to zzso zzso that we have termed zzso zzso and zzso For zzso stimuli zzso zzso the adaptation was no larger in zzso areas than in zzso zzso that the zzso zzso zzso adaptation originated in zzso For zzso stimuli zzso zzso and zzso the magnitude of adaptation, relative to the absolute response zzso was significantly larger in zzso (and for condition zzso also in zzso and zzso than in zzso suggesting that zzso stimulus orientation was extracted by additional processing after zzso There was little difference in the zzso of adaptation between the zzso zzso No consistent effect of adaptation was found in the zzso condition zzso in agreement with zzso evidence for weak interactions between zzso and zzso stimuli and zzso models of separate mechanisms for zzso and zzso visual zzso
