The goal of surgical treatment for zzso disease is zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine zzso for zzso zzso cure in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso studies were evaluated in 18 patients with zzso disease who underwent zzso surgery for selective zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso levels were measured by zzso during the first week after zzso One week after surgery, a test using zzso hormone zzso was performed on each patient to check the reserve function of normal zzso zzso 

In eight patients, zzso zzso levels were below the measurable level for 1 week, and zzso showed no response to the zzso zzso In these patients, serum zzso and cortisol levels were kept in the normal range with a normal zzso variation during long-term zzso These patients can be defined as zzso zzso In seven patients, the zzso level returned to within normal range on the day after surgery, but zzso was provoked by the zzso zzso Five of these seven patients showed subsequent zzso of zzso above the normal zzso zzso levels were never zzso in the remaining three patients, and medical treatments were zzso 

The most reliable indicators for predicting zzso cure in zzso disease are no response of zzso to the zzso test in the early zzso stage and an zzso low zzso level in the week after zzso zzso a normal range of zzso level zzso is insufficient to define zzso zzso
