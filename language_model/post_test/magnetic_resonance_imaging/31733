zzso spasms zzso in West syndrome zzso are classified as being of the generalized seizure zzso However, evidence of a focal zzso origin has been proposed based mainly on surgical zzso zzso We report zzso two infants with zzso whose zzso subsequently evolved into focal zzso of the right lower zzso 

Medical records, zzso and zzso findings were zzso zzso 

A 2 year-old Japanese girl developed zzso at 3 months of zzso zzso zzso of the right leg zzso one month after successful zzso therapy performed at 6 months of zzso zzso jerking of the right leg, every few seconds, occurred immediately after zzso A 7 month-old girl with symptomatic zzso had developed focal zzso with zzso signs at 2 months of zzso The zzso gradually diminished and had been replaced by zzso by 3 months of zzso zzso gradually evolved into focal zzso of the right zzso A zzso study demonstrated the zzso with marked predominance in the right leg corresponding to a left sided zzso zzso zzso slow wave zzso Brain zzso revealed no abnormal findings although zzso zzso demonstrated left zzso localized spike zzso 

The focal zzso of one lower zzso following treatment of zzso in these two infants with zzso suggests the origin of the zzso in the first case to be a zzso focus involving the primary motor zzso representing the lower limb while that in the second case involves more widespread zzso area with predominance in the same motor zzso as the first zzso
