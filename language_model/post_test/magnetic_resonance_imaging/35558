The present zzso study investigates the neural basis of zzso processing using two types of artificial zzso one governed by rules of adjacent zzso and the other by rules of zzso zzso The adjacent dependency sequences followed the rule zzso at which simple transitions between two types of syllable categories were generated zzso zzso The zzso syllable sequences followed the rule zzso generating a zzso structure zzso zzso the learning of which required the processing of zzso zzso When comparing the processing of zzso zzso to adjacent zzso significantly higher zzso were observed in zzso area and the adjacent rim of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to some several other cortical and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso area is part of a neural circuit that is responsible for the processing of zzso structures in an artificial zzso
