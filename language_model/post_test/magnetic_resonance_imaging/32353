zzso magnetic resonance images of the inner hoof wall tissue at the microscopic level would enable early accurate diagnosis of zzso and therefore more effective zzso 

To zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso parameters in order to obtain the highest possible resolution of the structures beneath the zzso hoof zzso 

zzso resonance zzso zzso was performed in front feet from 6 zzso horses using zzso fast spin echo zzso and zzso zzso echo zzso zzso 

In zzso weighted zzso images most of the stratum medium showed no zzso however the zzso terminal and sole zzso were zzso The stratum zzso was clearly visible and primary zzso zzso could be differentiated from zzso zzso 

Most structures beneath the hoof wall were zzso Conventional scanners for diagnostic zzso in horses are low or high zzso However this study used zzso field scanners currently not available for clinical zzso zzso ratio zzso increases as a function of field zzso An increase of spatial resolution of the image results in a decreased zzso zzso can also be improved with better coils and the resolution of high field zzso scanners will increase as technology develops and surface array coils become more readily zzso 

Although MR images with microscopic resolution were obtained ex zzso this study demonstrates the potential for detection of zzso pathology as it zzso Early recognition of the development of zzso to zzso effective therapy at an earlier stage and may improve the outcome for zzso zzso Clinical MR is now readily available at 3 zzso while 4 zzso 7 T and 9 T systems are being used for human whole body zzso
