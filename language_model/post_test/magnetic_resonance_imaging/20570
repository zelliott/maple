Childhood emotional zzso zzso has been associated with a profound and enduring negative impact on behavioral and emotional zzso Animal models have shown that adverse rearing conditions, such as maternal zzso can induce a cascade of long-term structural zzso in the brain, particularly in the zzso amygdala, and prefrontal zzso However, in humans, the zzso zzso of zzso are zzso 

Using high-resolution zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, anatomical scans and a zzso zzso zzso zzso approach, we examined whether healthy control subjects and zzso patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders reporting zzso before age 16 zzso zzso zzso age: mean zzso zzso displayed structural brain changes compared with control subjects and patients who reported no childhood abuse zzso zzso zzso age: mean zzso zzso 

We found that zzso zzso is associated with a significant reduction in predominantly left zzso zzso prefrontal zzso volume, even in the absence of physical or sexual abuse during zzso In addition, reduced zzso prefrontal zzso in individuals reporting zzso is present in males and zzso independent of zzso zzso 

In this study, we show that zzso is associated with profound reductions of zzso prefrontal zzso volume, suggesting that sustained zzso of growth or structural damage can occur after exposure to zzso Given the important role of the zzso prefrontal zzso in the regulation of emotional behavior, our finding might provide an important link in understanding the increased emotional sensitivity in individuals reporting zzso
