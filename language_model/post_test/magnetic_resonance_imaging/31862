zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, little is known about the relationship between zzso zzso In order to examine the gene zzso associated with the zzso of Chinese zzso with zzso linkage analysis and zzso detection were zzso For affected family members, clinical analysis, zzso examination and zzso of the brain and spinal zzso were also zzso Every zzso patient had a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso examination revealed decreased zzso of compound muscle action zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso motor nerves in most zzso zzso nerve action potential zzso from the zzso nerve was not zzso in most zzso Central motor zzso time zzso to the zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso first zzso zzso muscle zzso and anterior zzso muscle zzso were either absent or clearly prolonged in all zzso Spinal zzso zzso showed different levels of zzso in every affected zzso These zzso present an increased spot or patch signal on zzso axis zzso and an intense signal of continual zzso strip on the zzso zzso Our study supports that zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso and further demonstrates zzso correlations in zzso
