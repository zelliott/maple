The zzso is known to be a relatively well preserved structure, but subtle zzso may occur early in the evolution of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso patients appear to be particularly vulnerable to zzso However, little is currently known whether altered patterns of zzso function occur in zzso zzso 26 zzso patients and 18 zzso healthy controls underwent a baseline zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso After a mean follow-up period of 20 months, the subjects who successfully completed baseline zzso scans underwent a further follow-up zzso while spontaneous zzso and functional connectivity of the zzso were explored by using zzso zzso Compared to controls, increased zzso of low frequency fluctuation of the zzso zzso lobe may contribute to the underlying mechanisms affected, while greater decreased functional connections to the zzso zzso lobe were identified in the zzso study of zzso zzso This suggests that abnormal functional connectivity of the zzso may offer a more sensitive and possibly preferred index of functional zzso than regional activity measures in zzso zzso The zzso may be partly related to the underlying mechanisms of zzso and it could help guide subsequent investigations designed to specify the precise functional role of zzso in zzso zzso
