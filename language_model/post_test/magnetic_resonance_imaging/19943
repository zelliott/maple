To assess the state of the art of fetal magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso 

Both Chinese and English language zzso were searched in the databases of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 41 published articles about fetal zzso were zzso 

Fetal zzso can serve as an adjunct tool for zzso because of its excellent soft tissue contrast, high spatial resolution, zzso capabilities, large field of view and simultaneous zzso of fetal and maternal zzso Since the development of zzso zzso sequences provides faster scan time and avoids motion artifacts, it is widely applied in detecting normal or abnormal fetal development, including the central nervous system, zzso region, abdomen and zzso In China, experience in fetal zzso has been zzso but the technique will be extensively used in the near future because of its zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso as a complementary imaging for fetal screening is prospective in China or other parts of the world because of its multiple zzso
