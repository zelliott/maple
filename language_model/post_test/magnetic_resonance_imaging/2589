The recovery of a three-dimensional zzso model from a sequence of two-dimensional zzso images is very useful in medical image zzso Image sequences obtained from the relative motion between the object and the camera or the scanner contain more 3-D information than a single zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso can be divided into two zzso the surface rendering approach and the volume rendering zzso In this paper, a new surface rendering method using optical flow is zzso zzso flow is the apparent motion in the image plane produced by the projection of the real 3-D motion onto zzso zzso The 3-D motion of an object can be recovered from the zzso field using additional zzso By zzso the surface information from 3-D motion, it is possible to get an accurate 3-D model of the zzso Both synthetic and real image sequences have been used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed zzso The experimental results suggest that the proposed method is suitable for the reconstruction of 3-D models from ultrasound medical images as well as other zzso zzso
