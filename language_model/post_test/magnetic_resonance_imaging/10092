zzso zzso and memory deficits have been reported in Type 2 zzso Whether similar zzso occur in Type 1 diabetes is currently zzso 

In a zzso design, 13 Type 1 diabetic patients with at least 10 years' duration of disease, but free from clinical signs of zzso disease, were compared with zzso and zzso control zzso zzso volume and measures of global cerebral zzso fluid zzso were determined from magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso functions were assessed using four zzso zzso zzso and depression were measured by zzso 

zzso volume and memory did not differ between Type 1 diabetic patients and control zzso However, a significantly increased amount of cerebral zzso suggestive of mild cerebral zzso was observed in the zzso In addition, deficits in zzso speed and selective attention were zzso Eleven of 13 patients had zzso and/or zzso zzso were unrelated to cerebrovascular disease, white matter disease or silent zzso 

zzso from our small study in Type 1 diabetic patients do not support findings from previous studies of Type 2 diabetic patients demonstrating reductions in zzso volume and impaired zzso On the contrary, we observed evidence for mild cerebral zzso and impaired zzso speed and selective zzso This is in line with some previous studies in Type 1 zzso If zzso in larger studies, our findings would support the idea that the effects on brain function and structure differ between Type 1 and Type 2 zzso
