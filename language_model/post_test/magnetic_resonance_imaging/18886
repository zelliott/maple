It has been suggested that left-handers have a cerebral zzso for language zzso Specifically, the use of the right hand for writing may have a specific effect on the cerebral organization in zzso In an investigation of the relationship between motor and visual language procedures, functional magnetic resonance imaging at three zzso was conducted during stroke counting of zzso zzso zzso zzso in six left-handers who usually write with their right zzso Two types of stimulus zzso zzso and zzso were employed to examine the different neural pathways used for processing zzso Each stimulus presentation involved two motor conditions: one allowed finger movements for tracing the characters, while the other zzso finger zzso The tasks induced zzso in the primary motor area, the zzso area, the supplementary motor area, and the anterior zzso zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso zzso area zzso The activated areas in both the zzso and zzso conditions were almost identical except for the primary motor zzso These results clearly contrasted with those of a previous study of right-handers which showed that right-handed volunteers demonstrated decreased zzso in the zzso area and the zzso zzso during the zzso zzso This zzso may be attributable to a difference in cerebral organization for language zzso Specifically, in zzso the zzso procedure for zzso and the motor procedure for tracing the zzso may be zzso distributed in both zzso whereas in right-handers these procedures may be predominantly zzso in the left zzso
