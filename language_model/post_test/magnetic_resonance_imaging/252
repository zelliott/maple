zzso using zzso radiation are frequently used in the evaluation of disease activity in children affected by idiopathic inflammatory zzso disease zzso 

To develop an MR imaging protocol without the need for zzso zzso of an zzso tube and to assess the disease activity in children with zzso 

Included in the study were 37 children zzso girls and 15 zzso age range zzso years, mean zzso zzso with zzso who underwent MR imaging of the small zzso Of these 37 children, 32 had zzso disease and 5 had indeterminate zzso A water solution containing herbal zzso was administered orally or through a zzso zzso Patients were zzso on a zzso MR scanner with zzso and zzso sequences followed by a dynamic study using 3-D zzso images after intravenous administration of zzso 

The percentage enhancement of the zzso wall was significantly increased in patients with abnormal zzso protein zzso values compared to patients with zzso values in the normal range zzso A relatively weak but significant correlation between percentage enhancement of the zzso wall and zzso values was noted during all zzso of zzso 

This MR imaging protocol is a safe and zzso method for evaluating disease activity and zzso manifestations of zzso in zzso
