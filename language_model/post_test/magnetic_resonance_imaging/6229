Both normal and zzso zzso rabbits were zzso at zzso T using partial zzso zzso zzso and inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso The signal intensity of normal zzso zzso and zzso markedly increased after the injection of zzso zzso of zzso In the unilateral total zzso the zzso zzso pelvis did not contrast enhance after 15 and 35 zzso of zzso zzso The enhancement pattern was similar in zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso times at zzso T was studied using zzso Fifteen minutes after the zzso injection zzso zzso the zzso times of excised rat zzso decreased from 311 to 90 zzso The authors conclude that the enhancement of the MR signal of the kidney by zzso at an zzso magnetic field zzso zzso is similar to its enhancement at higher fields zzso than zzso zzso
