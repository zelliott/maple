The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of fat containing zzso zzso zzso including serial zzso zzso 

Imaging findings of 10 zzso zzso on CT zzso zzso 2) or zzso zzso zzso 3) or on both CT and zzso zzso zzso 5) were zzso reviewed in 9 zzso Both techniques included serial contrast enhanced imaging in zzso portal zzso and late zzso zzso 

On zzso CT, fat containing zzso was either zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) or of mixed density zzso zzso zzso The density values ranged between zzso and 9 zzso On zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso 4) signal loss was observed on zzso zzso images as compared to zzso zzso Enhancement patterns on serial zzso CT and zzso zzso zzso enhancement indistinguishable from the liver with zzso wash out zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blush with zzso phase fading zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhancement with zzso zzso and zzso phase wash out of zzso zzso zzso had late zzso zzso 

Fat containing zzso has spectrum of imaging findings on CT and zzso zzso with chemical shift technique depicts the fat zzso zzso contrast enhancement with zzso zzso or fading may help for the diagnosis of zzso in zzso zzso
