Numbers are known to be processed along the left and right zzso zzso The present study investigated zzso differences between the magnitude representation of small and large symbolic zzso To this purpose, an zzso adaptation paradigm was used, where the continuous presentation of a zzso number was interrupted by an occasional zzso zzso The results presented a zzso increase of zzso larger ratios of zzso and zzso number caused a larger recovery of zzso Similar zzso patterns were observed for small and large symbolic numbers, which is in line with the idea of a more coarse magnitude representation for large zzso Interestingly, this pattern of zzso was only observed in the left zzso cortex, supporting the recently proposed idea of zzso zzso zzso Does the zzso zzso distinguish between zzso zzso and Ten zzso zzso 53, zzso zzso that the left zzso zzso is specialized in the processing of zzso symbolically presented zzso
