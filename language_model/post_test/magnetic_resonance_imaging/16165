The impact of zzso zzso of zzso function on zzso and functional connectivity of the adult zzso was studied in zzso zzso knockout mice zzso using structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso and diffusion zzso zzso in conjunction with fiber zzso zzso presented with decreased volumes of total brain and zzso bulb, reduced cortical zzso and altered layering of the zzso zzso Tracking of major zzso fiber zzso revealed a disorganization of zzso fibers with an almost complete lack of zzso zzso In zzso mice zzso zzso fibers as well as zzso fibers were predominantly directed along a zzso orientation instead of a zzso and zzso orientation found in zzso zzso disorganization also involved the zzso connection targeting mostly the lateral zzso zzso The zzso was zzso extended and its volume was increased relative to that of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal enhancement in the zzso region suggested a normal function of zzso zzso zzso zzso several zzso disturbances in gray and white matter of zzso mice were similar to observations in human zzso zzso The present findings indicate an important role of zzso in the development of both the zzso and cerebral fiber zzso
