To characterize the zzso of cognitive function, serum zzso of zzso converting zzso zzso and brain structure with the zzso zzso or deletion zzso zzso were analyzed in subjects with zzso cognitive impairment zzso A group of 48 subjects meeting criteria for zzso and 36 zzso control subjects were assessed using a comprehensive battery of standardized zzso tests and magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by means of zzso and serum zzso zzso were measured using ultraviolet zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso and zzso gray matter volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined using general linear zzso The D carriers among the zzso subjects performed significantly worse on zzso recall compared to the I zzso zzso The D carriers had higher serum zzso zzso than did the I zzso carriers, though this difference only reached statistical significance in the zzso zzso Compared with the I zzso carriers, in the zzso group, D carriers showed smaller zzso of the bilateral middle frontal zzso right zzso right zzso zzso right zzso frontal zzso right superior frontal zzso and left zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso between I zzso and D carriers in the normal control zzso The study suggests that zzso zzso has considerable effect on the cognitive performance of zzso subjects, particularly episodic memory, serum activity of zzso and the structure of specified brain zzso The zzso D zzso may be a genetic risk factor for greater zzso of gray matter in zzso
