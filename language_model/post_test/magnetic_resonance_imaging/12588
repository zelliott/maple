Brain mechanisms underlying hysterical conversion symptoms are still poorly zzso Recent hypotheses suggested that zzso of motor pathways might be suppressed by zzso signals based on particular emotional zzso To assess motor and zzso brain circuits during conversion paralysis, we designed a zzso task while a patient underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso arose in right motor zzso despite left paralysis, indicating preserved motor intentions, but with zzso increases in zzso regions that normally mediate motivational and affective zzso Failure to execute movement on go trials with the affected left hand was associated with zzso in zzso and zzso frontal zzso However, right frontal areas normally zzso zzso were activated by zzso trials for the right zzso hand, but not during go trials for the left hand zzso by conversion zzso By contrast, a group of healthy controls who were asked to feign paralysis showed similar zzso on zzso trials and zzso trials with simulated zzso suggesting that distinct zzso mechanisms are implicated in simulation and conversion zzso In the patient, right motor zzso also showed enhanced functional connectivity with the zzso zzso cortex, zzso and zzso These results suggest that conversion symptoms do not act through cognitive zzso zzso but involve selective zzso in zzso brain regions associated with zzso representations and emotion zzso
