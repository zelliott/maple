zzso evidence indicates that outcomes from traumatic brain injury zzso are worse in the elderly, but there has been little zzso research to explore potential zzso In this study, we examined the age-related effects on outcome in a mouse model of controlled cortical impact zzso zzso We compared the responses of adult zzso months old) and aged zzso months old) male mice following a moderate lateral zzso injury to the zzso zzso zzso function was evaluated with the zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso behavioral zzso Acute zzso was assessed from zzso on zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso barrier opening was measured using zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso silver zzso and zzso cavity volumes were measured from zzso zzso zzso of injury were generally worse in the aged than the adult zzso Acute zzso measured at 24 and 48 h zzso resolved more slowly in the aged mice zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery zzso zzso zzso and zzso deficits zzso zzso zzso were significantly worse in aged zzso There was greater zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso and more prolonged zzso opening of the zzso barrier in the aged zzso zzso was greater in the aged mice zzso zzso zzso at 3 zzso In contrast, zzso cavity volumes, measured at 3 days zzso were not different between injured zzso These results suggest that following moderate controlled cortical impact injury, the aged brain is more vulnerable than the adult brain to zzso resulting in greater loss of zzso zzso loss at the impact site does not explain the increased functional deficits seen in the aged zzso zzso acute zzso increased opening of the zzso barrier and increased zzso found in the aged animals zzso secondary processes in age-related differences in zzso
