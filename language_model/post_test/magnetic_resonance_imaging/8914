zzso zzso zzso has detected differences between brains of groups of patients with zzso and controls, but the sensitivity for detecting subtle pathological changes in single subjects has not been zzso The aim of the study was to test the sensitivity of zzso using statistical zzso mapping zzso to detect zzso sclerosis zzso and cortical zzso loss in individual zzso zzso zzso zzso T MR images from 13 patients with HS and zzso cortical zzso loss were zzso zzso and smoothed using zzso Both modulated and zzso analyses were zzso Comparisons of one control subject against the rest zzso zzso zzso were first performed to ascertain the smoothing level with the lowest number of zzso changes in zzso Each patient was then compared against the whole control zzso The lowest number of zzso changes in control subjects was found at a smoothing level of 10 zzso full zzso half maximum for modulated and zzso zzso In the patient group, no zzso abnormalities were found in the affected zzso lobe or zzso at this smoothing zzso At lower smoothing levels there were numerous zzso findings in controls and zzso zzso did not detect any abnormalities associated with either zzso cortical zzso loss or zzso This may be due to zzso and smoothing of images and low statistical power in areas with larger zzso zzso This suggests that the methodology may currently not be suitable to detect particular zzso abnormalities possibly associated with seizure onset zone in individual zzso patients with unremarkable standard structural zzso
