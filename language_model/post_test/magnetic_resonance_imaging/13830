zzso contributions to cognitive decline in aging were explored using functional zzso zzso regions active in younger adults during zzso zzso memory zzso were zzso in older zzso Older adults showed less activity in zzso regions associated with controlled use of semantic zzso zzso was reversed by requiring semantic zzso suggesting it stemmed from difficulty in spontaneous recruitment of available frontal zzso In addition, older adults recruited multiple frontal regions in a zzso manner for both verbal and zzso zzso Lack of selectivity was not reversed during zzso directed zzso even when zzso was zzso These findings suggest two separate forms of zzso change in frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso The former is zzso and potentially amenable to cognitive zzso the latter may reflect a less malleable change associated with cognitive decline in advanced zzso
