The brain reward zzso zzso by zzso is critically disturbed in zzso This study aims to investigate the role of zzso brain activity during prediction of monetary reward and loss in first episode schizophrenia zzso 

We measured zzso dependent zzso activity in 10 patients with schizophrenia zzso and 12 healthy controls during zzso depletion with zzso zzso and during a zzso condition zzso 

zzso reduced the zzso of zzso and cortical brain regions in zzso In zzso zzso controls reduced zzso was found in the zzso condition in several regions during anticipation of reward and loss, including areas of the zzso and frontal zzso In zzso zzso controls reduced zzso of the superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed in zzso during anticipation of rewarding zzso zzso patients had reduced zzso in the zzso zzso frontal and zzso zzso in anticipation of zzso The findings of reduced zzso brain activity during zzso were verified by reduced levels of zzso in zzso zzso in plasma and increased zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso depletion affects functioning of the zzso reward zzso in zzso The findings also suggest that zzso functions associated with zzso zzso and attribution of zzso to reward predicting stimuli are altered in zzso
