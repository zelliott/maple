The consumption of zzso has been linked to zzso in human learning and memory, as well as aspects of executive zzso zzso zzso in learning and memory in chronic zzso users, it has been argued, are caused by the effects of zzso on zzso zzso The current study involved two zzso zzso 1 compared 35 current users of zzso and 38 zzso controls on a zzso task, previously shown to activate the zzso zzso Based on the results of experiment 1, experiment 2 used zzso and a modified version of the zzso task, to examine cortical and zzso activity during learning and recall in 14 current users of zzso and 14 zzso zzso of experiment 1 showed that zzso users were significantly worse with respect to learning, short and long-term memory zzso zzso 2 showed that despite zzso differences in learning and memory performance, zzso users had significantly lower levels of zzso activity in the right superior zzso zzso right superior frontal zzso right middle frontal zzso and left superior frontal zzso compared to controls during zzso zzso also showed that zzso users had significantly higher zzso activity in the right zzso zzso during zzso zzso in frontal and zzso zzso and relative zzso in the zzso identify functional deficits and zzso processes in zzso zzso
