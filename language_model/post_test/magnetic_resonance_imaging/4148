The aim of this study was to determine the response properties of the human visual zzso to chromatic stimuli using zzso zzso zzso responses were recorded to zzso zzso zzso zzso for a wide range of spatial and zzso zzso For each condition the response was dominated by a single major component which was well modeled by an equivalent current zzso zzso of zzso and zzso data provided evidence that the principal evoked cortical activity originated from visual area zzso To investigate the chromatic response properties of this area, the maximum global field power of the evoked response was plotted as a function of stimulus spatial and zzso zzso The zzso tuning was zzso and the zzso tuning was zzso with zzso at 0 and 4 zzso The results demonstrate the use of zzso as a technique for investigating activity from discrete regions of zzso
