Volume determination in cerebral tumors requires accurate and zzso zzso This task has been traditionally accomplished using zzso methods which define the boundary of the zzso using zzso and edge detection zzso These methods lack accuracy and zzso when the contrast between the zzso and surrounding tissue is not zzso Because of this limitation contrast agents are used providing zzso results for the enhancing portion of the zzso A novel approach for volume determination has been developed zzso zzso which segments a desired feature zzso zzso from surrounding zzso features in a sequence of zzso This method zzso for partial volume effects and has been shown to provide accurate and zzso volume zzso In addition, the zzso filter does not require the use of contrast and has the capability to segment a zzso into multiple zzso This allows different components of the zzso to be included and monitored in zzso In this study zzso methods and the zzso filter were compared for zzso cerebral tumors and determining their zzso The zzso methods were zzso in determining volumes for the enhancing portion of the zzso with zzso percent differences zzso zzso and zzso percent differences zzso zzso The zzso filter had zzso percent differences zzso zzso and zzso percent differences zzso zzso In the zzso procedure both the enhancing portion of the zzso as well as additional regions within the zzso were zzso Comparing the results obtained from the two methods demonstrated good agreement for zzso studies zzso differences zzso zzso When comparing zzso studies large differences were zzso In the zzso studies the zzso method allowed multiple regions to be followed in subsequent zzso and in two patients showed a volume change that suggested tumor recurrence more zzso Since the amount of information obtained using the zzso filter may allow a more complete assessment of the zzso it is suggested that it could improve the clinical evaluation of cerebral zzso
