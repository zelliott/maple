zzso vessels zzso on zzso inversion recovery imaging are frequently observed in acute zzso stroke zzso However, the exact mechanism and clinical implications of this sign have not yet been clearly zzso The features of zzso and its relevance to other imaging factors are presented zzso 

zzso and location of zzso were documented in 52 consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery zzso territory zzso before treatment with IV zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume, zzso zzso volume, and vessel zzso were determined in addition to zzso status and zzso zzso volume on follow-up zzso zzso Stroke zzso zzso was used as a measure of clinical zzso 

zzso zzso to zzso zzso was observed in zzso of zzso more frequent in zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the 38 patients with zzso zzso zzso initial zzso zzso volume was comparable among patients with different grade zzso zzso However, patients with more prominent zzso zzso had smaller initial, zzso and zzso zzso zzso volumes and lower initial zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso vessels before zzso treatment is associated with large zzso mismatch and smaller zzso zzso zzso volumes in patients with zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion zzso zzso zzso zzso recalled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle cerebral zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso mean transit time; zzso zzso zzso Stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso TE zzso echo time; zzso zzso inversion time; zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso repetition zzso
