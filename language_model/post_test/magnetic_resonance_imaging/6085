To zzso analyze the zzso distribution of late zzso enhancement zzso with zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging, to compare the prevalence of this distribution in zzso male marathon runners with that in zzso control subjects, and to examine the zzso role of zzso 

Institutional review board and ethics committee approval were obtained for this study, and all subjects provided written informed zzso zzso zzso segmented zzso zzso MR sequences were performed after administration of a zzso contrast agent in 102 ostensibly healthy male runners aged zzso years who had completed at least five zzso during the past 3 years and in 102 zzso control zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso coronary artery disease zzso zzso were distinguished from a predominantly zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso Marathon runners with zzso underwent repeat cardiac MR imaging and additional zzso zzso zzso zzso were followed up for a mean of 21 months zzso 3 zzso zzso after initial zzso The zzso Fisher zzso and zzso exact tests were used for zzso zzso survival rates were estimated with the zzso method, and overall group differences were evaluated with zzso zzso 

Of the 102 zzso five had a zzso pattern of zzso and seven had a zzso pattern of zzso The zzso pattern of zzso was located in the territory of the left anterior descending coronary artery more frequently than was the zzso pattern zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso The prevalence of zzso in runners was higher than that in zzso control subjects zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso exact zzso The zzso survival rate was lower in runners with zzso zzso than in those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Ostensibly healthy marathon runners have an unexpectedly high rate of zzso zzso and this may have diagnostic and zzso zzso
