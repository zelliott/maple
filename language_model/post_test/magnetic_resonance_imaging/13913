In order to compare score values, joint zzso in zzso patients on early and late prophylaxis were assessed and evaluated by X-ray zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a prospective zzso 

24 zzso (10 knees and 14 zzso of 15 zzso patients, with at least one manifestation of bleeding zzso by zzso assessment) were zzso zzso and zzso investigations were done after complete zzso of zzso For zzso evaluation a zzso score zzso 13 points), and for zzso evaluation a modified zzso score zzso 13 points) according to zzso et zzso were zzso 

Good correlation could be demonstrated between the number of joint zzso and the degree of zzso 16 zzso with zzso 2 zzso had no zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with 3 zzso had zzso score from 0 - 3 points and zzso scores of 2 zzso zzso with zzso 4 zzso had a zzso score between 7 and 12 points, zzso scores ranged from 3 to 8 zzso 

zzso severity of zzso zzso could be demonstrated initially by the zzso score and later by the zzso score depending on the number of zzso The zzso score describes initial zzso zzso more precisely and earlier than the zzso score, allowing a discerning zzso of the degree and a follow-up of zzso zzso
