To date, few studies have focused specifically on imaging findings in zzso syndrome zzso We set out to evaluate zzso zzso data from a large sample of patients with zzso focusing on the pattern of white matter abnormalities and the zzso evolution of the cerebral involvement to establish the zzso natural history of the zzso 

zzso patients, 18 girls and 18 boys, were zzso All had a clinical diagnosis of zzso genetically confirmed in 31 of zzso For every subject, we reviewed at least 1 CT and 1 MR imaging study; 19 zzso had multiple zzso In all, we reviewed 109 zzso zzso comparisons were analyzed by using the zzso zzso 

zzso were found in all subjects, mainly in the zzso zzso zzso white matter, and zzso zzso zzso white matter was present in all the subjects, showing 2 patterns of zzso diffuse in 18 zzso and an zzso zzso in 18 zzso Cystic areas were observed in the zzso and/or frontal zzso in zzso patients zzso A correlation was found between early age at onset and severity of the zzso in the frontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant degree of cerebral zzso was found in zzso subjects zzso The zzso presentation remained substantially stable with zzso 

The different zzso presentations of zzso are here outlined for the first time in a large sample of zzso These findings may facilitate more precise and earlier diagnosis of this rare but probably zzso zzso
