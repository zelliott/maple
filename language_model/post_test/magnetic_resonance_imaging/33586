zzso evaluation of the zzso anatomy in potential zzso kidney donors is essential regarding the presence of accessory zzso zzso Conventional zzso remains the standard of evidence for zzso the zzso zzso zzso We assessed the utility of two-dimensional phase contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the zzso of potential zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine patients were examined with conventional zzso and zzso which was performed on a zzso system using a two-dimensional PC technique in both zzso and zzso planes zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso flip 60 zzso zzso 256 zzso zzso field of view, 28 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso section with zzso zzso The number of zzso and polar zzso zzso arteries was zzso zzso zzso arteries were classified as zzso if they were similar in size to the zzso main zzso zzso 

Conventional zzso identified 78 dominant and 13 zzso (3 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso identified the zzso 35 zzso of all 78 dominant and the 3 zzso zzso zzso Of the remaining ten (7 polar and 3 zzso accessory vessels, only four were correctly identified with zzso 

The high error rate zzso suggests that two-dimensional PC zzso as zzso should not be used in the zzso evaluation of potential zzso zzso
