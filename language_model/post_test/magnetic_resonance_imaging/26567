Kimura's disease is a rare inflammatory disease that mainly affects Asians and most often occurs in the deep zzso zzso of the head and zzso We report on a rare case of Kimura's disease in the hard zzso of a white zzso 

A 56-year-old white man was seen with a rapidly growing mass in the upper zzso A complete tumor zzso with zzso was zzso The zzso which showed signs of zzso was located within the bone and the soft zzso 

Kimura's disease was diagnosed by zzso examination of the zzso zzso 

This case demonstrates that Kimura's disease, though rare, is not limited to the Asian zzso We present a case of a tumor in a white zzso This adds another possibility for uncertain differential diagnoses of rapidly growing tumor zzso
