zzso transplantation is in decline, in contrast to other solid zzso where the number of solid organ transplants from donors after circulatory death zzso is zzso Hearts from zzso donors are not currently zzso due to concerns that they may suffer irreversible cardiac injury with zzso poor graft zzso Using a large animal model, we tested the hypothesis that hearts from zzso donors would be suitable for zzso zzso pigs were subjected to hypoxic cardiac arrest zzso followed by 15 zzso of warm zzso and resuscitation on zzso zzso or zzso death zzso via zzso balloon zzso zzso function was assessed through zzso measures and magnetic resonance imaging and zzso After zzso zzso hearts had near normal zzso although stroke volume was reduced, comparable to zzso zzso zzso hearts had a significant decline in zzso and increase in zzso zzso during the hypoxic period, with a return to baseline levels after zzso After zzso cardiac function was comparable between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a large animal model, the zzso heart maintains viability and recovers function similar to that of the zzso heart and may be suitable for clinical zzso Further study is warranted on optimal zzso zzso
