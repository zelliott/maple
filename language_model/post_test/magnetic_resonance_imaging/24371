To assess whether zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso results zzso weeks after initial zzso therapy can aid accurate distinction between zzso and zzso to determine whether overall survival zzso is improved, and to compare zzso functional MR response with zzso response criteria zzso zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso modified zzso zzso European Association for the Study of the Liver zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso 

In this zzso zzso retrospective, institutional review zzso study, informed consent was zzso 143 patients with zzso zzso underwent zzso therapy between October 2005 and February zzso zzso functional MR response zzso or more increase in apparent diffusion zzso zzso or more decrease in zzso was zzso as zzso zzso zzso fulfilled both criteria, zzso zzso fulfilled one zzso and those with stable disease zzso fulfilled zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso response criteria were zzso zzso technique, zzso tests, and the Cox zzso hazards model were used to test whether zzso was different per zzso 

zzso differed significantly between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response improved zzso compared with zzso zzso risk of death decreased zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In those with zzso compared with zzso responders, risk of death increased zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was short of zzso most zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso level increased in 55 zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso had decreased risk of death zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso between zzso response criteria and zzso functional MR findings zzso zzso zzso and between zzso response and imaging criteria zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso 

zzso functional MR response zzso weeks after initial zzso therapy showed improved zzso zzso functional MR was superior to current imaging zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso response zzso
