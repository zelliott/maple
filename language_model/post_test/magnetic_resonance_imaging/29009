Our aim was to investigate the usefulness of zzso dynamic MR imaging using a zzso zzso technique during breath holding in assessing zzso invasion by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso Dynamic MR imaging was performed using the zzso zzso technique during breath zzso We compared accuracy in the assessment of zzso invasion by zzso zzso between zzso images, zzso zzso images, and dynamic MR zzso 

The accuracy rates in zzso zzso invasion with zzso images, zzso zzso images, and dynamic MR images were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significant differences were seen between dynamic MR images and both zzso images and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso dynamic MR imaging using the zzso zzso technique during breath holding is useful for the evaluation of zzso invasion by zzso zzso with zzso growth or an unclear zzso zone on zzso zzso
