To define specific brain magnetic resonance features in methanol intoxicated patients and to evaluate the clinical relevance of monitoring these zzso 

During the past decade magnetic resonance imaging has proven to be an exquisitely sensitive zzso in depicting subtle water changes in diseased areas of the brain, allowing the definition of high-risk structures in numerous pathological zzso 

Four patients admitted to our institution for acute methanol intoxication were repeatedly evaluated by brain magnetic resonance imaging or a combination of zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso Common features of initial brain status were shown in all four cases and compared to those of patients presenting with other zzso or critical deprivation zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso was observed in all four zzso This finding is specific compared to intoxication by other substances like carbon zzso or in the critical phase of zzso zzso The striking zzso of the zzso zzso on follow-up magnetic resonance examinations correlated with complete neurological recovery and the absence of zzso zzso Two patients exhibited discrete zzso additional zzso in the zzso areas of the zzso zzso In a third one, the zzso zzso were zzso All three suffered from permanent visual zzso The fourth patient, in whom magnetic resonance examinations failed to reveal any zzso zzso never complained of visual zzso though signs of zzso zzso were detected in the visual evoked zzso 

zzso resonance imaging appeared as a well suited zzso zzso in methanol intoxicated patients both in revealing a specific pattern of brain zzso and in demonstrating valuable correlation between evolution of brain changes on magnetic resonance images and clinical zzso
