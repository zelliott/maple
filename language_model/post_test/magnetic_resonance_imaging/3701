Common zzso data processing techniques usually minimize a zzso cost function or fit a zzso model to extract an activity zzso Here, we focus on zzso a zzso zzso zzso statistical zzso map zzso from zzso data using a cost function that does not depend on a model of the subjects' zzso zzso Based on a generalized version of zzso correlation analysis zzso we propose a method to extract a highly zzso map by maximizing the sum of zzso correlations between some zzso In a group analysis, each map is calculated from a linear combination of zzso scans of a subset of subjects under zzso The proposed method is applied to zzso zzso zzso without any spatial smoothing from 10 subjects performing a simple reaction time zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso framework with a zzso measure based on zzso zzso we compare the proposed approach with zzso zzso analysis zzso and a simple general linear model zzso zzso provides statistical zzso maps with higher zzso than zzso and zzso with correlation zzso across independent zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is an efficient approach for zzso the default mode network, assessing brain zzso and processing zzso and zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso signal varies from subject to zzso
