When a conflict task involves zzso neutral, and zzso conditions, it is possible to examine zzso zzso zzso zzso and interference zzso zzso zzso zzso Very few studies investigated the brain areas that are specifically involved in zzso or zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants performed a magnitude conflict task (the size zzso zzso We observed four findings: zzso while most of the brain areas that were activated by conflict tasks showed interference effects, the zzso zzso was the only region activated for both interference and zzso zzso zzso Two groups of participants could be distinguished based on the pattern of anterior zzso zzso zzso activity, one with classical zzso zzso one with reverse zzso zzso zzso connectivity analysis of the areas that were modulated by the conflict task revealed an anterior zzso - lateral prefrontal zzso network and a zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the former plays a role in cognitive control and conflict zzso whereas the latter zzso in zzso selection of zzso stimuli and response zzso zzso These networks were modulated by the two groups that we distinguished based on the zzso zzso
