zzso is a popular physical complaint in zzso It is known that experimental anxiety zzso pain processing through zzso amplification, whereas it is not known whether a similar experimental reaction is related to daily physical complaints known as zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate the neural zzso of pain zzso induced by anxiety, particularly in the zzso and how individual differences in this neural reaction relate to zzso We measured neural response to noxious electrical zzso as well as the response to the preceding visual anticipatory cues (which induced low anxiety or high zzso by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Individual daily physical symptoms were assessed by using the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 90 revised zzso zzso zzso between the neural zzso and the zzso scores were zzso We found that manifestation of daily physical symptoms was related to smaller differences in zzso zzso between high and low anxiety states, suggesting that the ability of the zzso to distinguish anxiety states was weakened by the chronic condition that caused the daily physical zzso The proper zzso of neural zzso in low anxiety states in the zzso and the anterior zzso was observed to occur in companionship with lower daily physical zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso of the network that includes the zzso and that is associated with pain zzso zzso the manifestation of zzso
