To evaluate the images acquired with a clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging machine as the zzso of transplanted and surviving zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso was introduced to increase the labeling efficiency of zzso a zzso zzso iron zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to study the relationship among magnetic resonance imaging, zzso monitoring, and pathological zzso 

After receiving zzso zzso dark voids could be observed in the zzso of both groups, accompanied with a significant decrease in zzso intensity ratio from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One week after zzso zzso zzso were rejected in the zzso zzso Rapid disappearance of dark voids and a significant increase of zzso ratio were zzso No zzso zzso could be found in the zzso sections of zzso by that zzso Meanwhile, in the zzso group, zzso zzso survived zzso Dark voids persisted and low zzso ratios zzso The fact that the dark voids represented the labeled zzso was confirmed by combined zzso of insulin activity and zzso zzso 

Either spot counting or signal intensity measurement provides a perfect zzso of transplanted and surviving zzso in zzso zzso provides an effective and safe way to label zzso
