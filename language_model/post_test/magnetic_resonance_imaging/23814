The combination regimen of zzso plus zzso is the current standard zzso treatment of symptomatic or progressing zzso zzso cell zzso This regimen previously has been reported to have a major objective response rate of zzso in a zzso cooperative group zzso However, the authors believed that this favorable response rate was not consistent with their institutional experience at Memorial zzso Cancer Center zzso 

The authors zzso reviewed the records of all zzso cell zzso patients under care at zzso who were treated with zzso plus zzso since the publication of the study mentioned zzso Sixteen such patients treated between February 1992 and February 1998 were zzso Their clinical zzso sites of measurable disease, response to treatment, time to treatment failure, and survival status were zzso 

All patients were treated with the starting doses as outlined by the published cooperative group zzso All had zzso measurable disease on zzso zzso zzso zzso Only 1 of 16 patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso achieved a major objective response by standard CT response criteria, with response ongoing during treatment at 18 zzso Nine patients zzso had stable disease while receiving treatment zzso of treatment, zzso zzso Six patients zzso had progression of disease as their best response while receiving zzso The median overall survival of this patient group had not yet been reached at last zzso with zzso zzso of patients alive with follow-up ranging from zzso zzso 

A retrospective analysis of the zzso zzso experience with the combination of zzso plus zzso in patients with zzso cell zzso failed to confirm the high objective response rate previously reported for this zzso There remains an urgent need for improved zzso alternatives for patients with this zzso
