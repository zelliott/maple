zzso of acoustic zzso zzso growth is essential for treatment zzso 

A retrospective analysis of 119 patients with AN zzso age, 65 years; range, zzso zzso followed with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was zzso Change in maximum tumor dimension as a function of follow-up period was zzso 

Overall, maximum tumor dimension increased zzso zzso in only zzso of zzso Of those that grew, the mean growth rate was zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso Age, zzso and zzso did not predict zzso Most tumors that grew zzso zzso were zzso zzso at zzso However, tumors zzso zzso were statistically more likely to grow zzso p zzso 

Most zzso followed with periodic zzso do not zzso Available clinical information usually cannot predict zzso zzso zzso are advocated for all patients treated with zzso
