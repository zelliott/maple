zzso regulation, which is critical to the efficient functioning of the brain, is impaired in Alzheimer's disease and in transgenic mice zzso zzso Although senile plaques and zzso zzso represent zzso hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, deposition of zzso in cerebral blood vessels also likely plays a significant role in this debilitating and fatal zzso Further, soluble zzso which shows greater correlation with disease progression and severity than deposited plaques or zzso displays strong zzso zzso The aim of this study was to develop a zzso model of cerebral zzso that would ultimately be zzso to Alzheimer's disease as a marker for zzso efficacy of novel small zzso and zzso zzso Relative changes in cerebral blood volume following relevant doses of soluble zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or the reverse zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were monitored zzso by zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging in zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on a zzso horizontal bore scanner using zzso echo zzso zzso As expected, PBS and zzso did not induce any significant change in vascular zzso In contrast, zzso significantly decreased zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of characterizing zzso zzso vascular dysfunction in zzso using a zzso zzso Further, this technique can be readily applied to zzso screening in a zzso manner for novel drugs or zzso targeting disease zzso
