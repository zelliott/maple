To determine if testing vertical zzso zzso zzso has a role in the clinical assessment of infants and zzso 

A large field projection system was developed with which zzso zzso zzso could be zzso in any zzso Gross abnormalities in the response were detected simply by zzso 

zzso was tested in 144 children using this zzso projection zzso 26 of these children had abnormal zzso 13 had a vertical zzso initiation failure zzso motor zzso (in either direction, zzso or in zzso and 13 had absent zzso (in either direction, zzso or in zzso Nine of the children with an up and/or down vertical zzso initiation failure zzso had a zzso disease zzso had zzso disease type C, five had zzso disease type III, one had zzso disease type II, and one had zzso disease type zzso Five children with a zzso had an zzso identified by a magnetic resonance imaging zzso scan of the zzso In two of these children there was a focal zzso of the zzso zzso In 11 of the children with absent up and/or down zzso an zzso scan revealed an zzso This involved the zzso and/or the zzso in zzso Absent up and/or down zzso was found in association with zzso syndrome, Leigh disease, and cerebral zzso 

zzso testing has a useful role in detecting neurological abnormalities in infants and zzso zzso of abnormal zzso should indicate further investigations for a zzso disease or an zzso involving the cortex, zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso but normal horizontal zzso is highly suggestive of a zzso zzso zzso
