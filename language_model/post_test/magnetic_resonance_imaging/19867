Very zzso infants are at high risk for adverse zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has been proposed as a means of predicting zzso outcomes in this zzso 

We studied 167 very zzso infants zzso age at birth, 30 weeks or less) to assess the associations between zzso defined zzso and zzso abnormalities on zzso at term equivalent zzso age of 40 weeks) and the risks of severe cognitive zzso severe zzso zzso cerebral zzso and zzso (hearing or zzso impairment at 2 years of age zzso for zzso 

At two years of age, 17 percent of infants had severe cognitive zzso 10 percent had severe zzso zzso 10 percent had cerebral zzso and 11 percent had zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso abnormalities present in 21 percent of infants at term equivalent were zzso of the following adverse outcomes at two years of age: cognitive delay zzso ratio, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso motor delay zzso ratio, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso cerebral zzso zzso ratio, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso impairment zzso ratio, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso abnormalities zzso in 49 percent of zzso were also zzso but less zzso with cognitive zzso motor zzso and cerebral zzso zzso zzso abnormalities on zzso were significant zzso of severe motor delay and cerebral zzso after adjustment for other measures during the zzso period, including findings on zzso zzso 

zzso findings on zzso at term equivalent in very zzso infants strongly predict adverse zzso outcomes at two years of zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso at term equivalent in risk zzso for these zzso
