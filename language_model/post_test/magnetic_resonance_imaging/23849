To detect zzso abnormalities of auditory association zzso in zzso by measuring the area of the zzso region known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso in dyslexic and control zzso 

Several quantitative zzso investigations of cortical areas in zzso have focused on the zzso which encompasses the zzso plane and the inferior bank of the zzso ascending zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the results of these studies may be attributable in part to the use of measurement methods that do not account fully for surface zzso of the zzso 

The authors used an zzso surface reconstruction technique that models the zzso of the cerebral zzso in three dimensions to obtain zzso and regional surface area zzso zzso were obtained in both zzso of eight right-handed male dyslexic subjects and eight right-handed male control zzso 

The zzso area of dyslexic subjects was significantly larger than that of control subjects, and this result was not attributable to a difference in zzso surface zzso Neither the dyslexic nor control subjects showed a left or right asymmetry in this region, although there was a trend toward less zzso of the asymmetry scores in dyslexic zzso 

The gross zzso organization of this region is different in dyslexic subjects, and zzso of the precise nature of these differences may be aided by surface modeling zzso
