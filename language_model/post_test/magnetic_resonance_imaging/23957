We investigated structural changes of the corpus zzso in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso had a significantly decreased area only in the zzso portion of the corpus zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso values perpendicular to the zzso fiber orientation were significantly higher in the anterior portion of the corpus zzso without zzso zzso as well as in the zzso portion with significant zzso in patients with zzso than in controls zzso and thus diffusion in these regions showed a significantly lower degree of zzso in patients than in zzso zzso ratios were also significantly lower in patients with zzso in the anterior and zzso portions of the corpus zzso than in zzso These findings probably reflect structural changes in the corpus zzso including zzso loss and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be useful in detecting zzso of the corpus zzso in zzso
