zzso and scientists have puzzled for zzso over how zzso information is stored in short-term zzso Some have suggested that early sensory representations are involved, but their precise role has remained zzso The current study asks whether auditory zzso shows sustained zzso zzso while sounds are maintained in short-term memory using high-resolution functional zzso zzso zzso short-term memory representations within regions of human auditory zzso with zzso has been difficult because of their small size and high anatomical zzso between zzso However, we overcame these constraints by using zzso pattern zzso It clearly revealed zzso activity during the zzso phase of a change detection task, and the degree of this zzso zzso was positively related to performance in the zzso Although the sounds had to be maintained in memory, activity in auditory zzso was significantly zzso zzso patterns of activity in this maintenance period correlated zzso with the patterns evoked by the same zzso during zzso Furthermore, individuals who used a rehearsal strategy to remember the sounds showed reduced zzso suppression during the maintenance zzso Although negative zzso are often disregarded in zzso research, our findings imply that decreases in blood zzso zzso response carry important zzso information and can be related to cognitive zzso We zzso that, during auditory change zzso zzso suppression protects short-term memory representations from being zzso by zzso the zzso of interfering zzso
