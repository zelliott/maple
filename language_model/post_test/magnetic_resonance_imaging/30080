Many authors have concluded that the zzso zzso Type I zzso is due to a smaller than normal zzso zzso zzso In order to establish this smaller geometry as the cause of zzso zzso in a family, the authors of this paper performed zzso analysis in a family found to have this zzso documented in 4 zzso 

Members from this family found to have a zzso by imaging underwent zzso analysis of their zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso 

No member of this family found to have zzso on zzso imaging had a zzso zzso that was significantly smaller than that of zzso zzso 

The results of this study demonstrate that not all patients with a zzso will have a reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the mechanism for the development of zzso zzso in this cohort is unknown, this manifestation can be seen in multiple generations of a familial zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso
