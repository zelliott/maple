A three-dimensional zzso spiral sequence was developed for dynamic breast magnetic resonance zzso imaging with much improved image zzso zzso Z phase zzso was applied to obtain thinner slices for a coverage of the whole zzso zzso between the zzso and a previously developed zzso zzso spiral sequences was performed on ten healthy volunteers without contrast and five breast patients with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso spiral images had significantly less zzso blurring and spiral zzso With a small compromise on zzso resolution zzso seconds in zzso and zzso seconds in zzso we obtained 32 zzso 3-5 zzso slices (with 20 Z phase zzso for a full coverage of zzso zzso breast with the same 1 zzso 1 zzso zzso resolution as the zzso zzso which had 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and soft tissue in normal breasts was increased by about zzso The reduced repetition time in the zzso spiral acquisition led to an increased zzso zzso The difference between the enhancement of zzso and benign zzso increased by zzso We expect that this new development could lead to improved specificity in characterizing breast zzso using MR zzso
