A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study in sighted individuals showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso areas in the zzso zzso and adjacent zzso sites during locomotor zzso These zzso zzso were suggested to reflect the suppression of zzso signals during locomotion in order to prevent potentially adverse interactions of these zzso with the zzso automated locomotion zzso In this zzso experiment, 10 totally blind subjects and 10 zzso and zzso sighted controls imagined several locomotor tasks in a first-person perspective zzso imagery of standing, walking, and zzso As opposed to their sighted controls, totally blind individuals activated zzso zzso areas in the zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso with zzso preponderance during locomotor zzso These results zzso suggest that blind subjects rely more on zzso feedback for locomotor control than do sighted zzso Thus, this zzso study provides zzso evidence for distinct cortical processing in the zzso zzso system in the blind during locomotor zzso
