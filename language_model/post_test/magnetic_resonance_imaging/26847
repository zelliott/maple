Imaging of the zzso is often performed using contrast agents in combination with either ultrasound zzso or magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso agents are used to enhance medical imaging by highlighting zzso properties and zzso Dynamic signal changes arising from the passage of contrast agents through the zzso can be used to characterize different zzso however, comparisons across zzso are difficult due to differences in the interactions of contrast agents with the zzso Better knowledge of the relationship of contrast enhancement patterns with both zzso could enable better characterization of tissue zzso We developed a zzso platform for zzso US and MR imaging using clinical imaging systems in order to study the relationship between US and MR contrast zzso A preliminary validation study was performed in zzso to determine the registration accuracy of the zzso In zzso the zzso registration accuracy was measured to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the lateral and zzso directions, zzso The zzso registration accuracy was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso US and MR imaging was performed in a rabbit model to evaluate contrast zzso in different tissue types after zzso injections of US and MR contrast zzso The arrival time of the contrast agent in the plane of imaging was relatively similar for both zzso We studied three different tissue zzso muscle, large vessels and zzso In zzso the zzso zzso of signal enhancement were not strongly dependent on tissue zzso In zzso however, due to the different amounts of agent zzso in each tissue type, zzso contrast zzso were zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of performing in zzso zzso contrast US and MR imaging to study the relationships of the enhancement patterns with each zzso
