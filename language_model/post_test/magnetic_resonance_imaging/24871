zzso zzso of the cervical spine occurs rarely in younger children whereas the presentation and outcome are different from those of adult cervical zzso Because cervical spinal zzso in younger children is rarely reported, the clinical zzso the treatments, and the expected outcome of treatments in younger children are still zzso 

We present a case of cervical spine zzso in a zzso boy that grounds severe zzso destruction and an zzso zzso This child presented with neurological deficit in the form of zzso We performed anterior cervical zzso for this zzso to our best knowledge, the child in this case is the youngest patient reported in the literature as having had cervical zzso treated through anterior cervical zzso 

The neurological deficits of this patient were recovered soon, and no evidence of recurrence of the zzso zzso or of the zzso was revealed by the zzso follow-up magnetic resonance zzso 

Based on our experiences in this case and a review of the literature, we propose that for patients of cervical spine zzso in early childhood, anterior zzso of diseased bone without zzso should be adequate as a surgical zzso
