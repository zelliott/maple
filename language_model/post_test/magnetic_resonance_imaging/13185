zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides highly sensitive assessment of inflammatory and destructive changes in zzso arthritis zzso zzso but intravenous zzso zzso injection zzso examination time and increases cost, zzso and patient zzso We explored to what extent zzso joint zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be reliably assessed by zzso zzso images compared with zzso zzso as the reference zzso 

zzso data sets from 2 zzso zzso were scored according to preliminary zzso zzso zzso scoring system zzso zzso A included zzso zzso T MR images from 40 zzso patients, which were scored twice by 2 experienced zzso zzso B included zzso T dedicated zzso zzso zzso images from 55 patients, scored twice by one experienced zzso The first reading included only zzso images, whereas complete image sets were available for the second zzso 

zzso contrast injection appeared zzso to zzso scores of bone zzso and bone zzso in zzso wrist and zzso zzso However, when zzso zzso was considered the standard reference, zzso without zzso provided only moderate to high agreement concerning assessment of zzso and omitting the zzso acquisitions increased the zzso variation on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these exercises provided a lower sensitivity of zzso imaging for zzso than zzso using zzso zzso 

zzso IV contrast injection did not change scores of bone zzso and bone zzso but decreased the reliability of zzso zzso However, this disadvantage may for some purposes be zzso by the possibility to assess more zzso and/or greater zzso
