We report the case of a man who at 42 years of age had right frontal zzso for removal of a benign zzso zzso years later, at age 60, he had zzso of a fourth zzso zzso zzso which was found to be zzso identical to the original zzso A further zzso in the left zzso lobe was not zzso but was treated with radiation zzso We suggest that these subsequent two zzso represent zzso spread of the original zzso This case emphasizes the need for indefinite zzso surveillance for these zzso
