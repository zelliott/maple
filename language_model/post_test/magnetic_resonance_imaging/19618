zzso imaging is a new magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique used to reflect the zzso integrity of zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso contrast zzso of calf muscles in limb zzso muscular zzso zzso The calf muscles of 5 patients with zzso and 10 healthy volunteers were zzso with an zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso suppression zzso zzso suppression ratios were calculated for anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Clinical assessments of muscle strength were compared to the zzso suppression ratios in the zzso zzso Strong zzso was observed in healthy muscles, with mean zzso zzso suppression ratios ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso In diseased muscle, zzso signal suppression was reduced by zzso demonstrating an inverse correlation between symptom duration and suppression zzso zzso contrast in the patients with zzso as a reflection of tissue integrity, was best preserved in zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso muscles in descending zzso Clinical assessments did a poorer job of zzso than zzso did and were in poor agreement with zzso suppression zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso changes in zzso and appears to provide information not zzso from clinical zzso This suggests that this zzso technique may be useful in evaluating the extent, zzso and response to therapy of zzso
