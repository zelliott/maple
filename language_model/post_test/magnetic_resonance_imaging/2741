zzso zzso brain zzso zzso is a common accompaniment of zzso zzso It results from zzso zzso of plasma fluid and proteins through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are observed more commonly with benign zzso that are not associated with zzso This study investigates the hypothesis that these zzso distinct zzso of zzso zzso are linked by a common zzso mechanism involving vascular zzso zzso factor zzso which has been implicated in vascular leak phenomena including zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso Furthermore, zzso has been isolated from cultured zzso cells, and both zzso protein and zzso zzso transcripts are expressed in brain tumor zzso To further zzso the relationship of zzso to zzso and zzso the authors examined 34 pathological specimens for zzso zzso zzso primary zzso tumors, 11 primary high-grade tumors, and four zzso controls were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to zzso zzso and to determine the presence of zzso and tumor zzso The study revealed that eight zzso specimens exhibited no significant zzso whereas 26 zzso tumors exhibited either significant zzso or zzso zzso eight of nine benign zzso that were not associated with zzso zzso positive for zzso These data indicate a high degree of correlation between zzso expression by zzso and the occurrence of zzso or zzso irrespective of tumor grade, thus supporting zzso pivotal role as the common zzso link between these zzso
