To determine whether zzso value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings in detection of prostate cancer zzso extension zzso is significantly affected by the reader's zzso zzso 

In this cohort study, 344 consecutive patients with zzso prostate cancer underwent zzso MR imaging followed by zzso zzso of zzso described in MR imaging reports was compared with clinical predictor zzso zzso was determined from the final zzso report on specimens zzso at zzso Readers of MR images were classified into zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso 4) and general body MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso For data analysis, zzso rank sum and zzso tests, as well as receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso A difference with P zzso was considered zzso 

zzso analysis results demonstrated that all zzso except clinical stage were significantly associated with detection of zzso in both groups of readers zzso zzso In the zzso MR imaging zzso group of patients, area under the zzso curve for zzso MR imaging findings zzso was larger than areas under the zzso for all other zzso zzso In the general body MR imaging zzso group of patients, area under the zzso curve for zzso MR imaging findings zzso was not larger than areas under the zzso for all other zzso zzso zzso of zzso analysis of two models, one with all zzso and another with all zzso except zzso MR imaging findings, demonstrated a significant increase in area under the zzso curve with zzso MR images interpreted by zzso MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging findings are significant zzso for detection of zzso when MR images are interpreted by zzso zzso experienced with MR imaging of the zzso
