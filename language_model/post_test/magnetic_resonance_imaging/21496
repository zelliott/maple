zzso left zzso function and increased left zzso mass has been recently reported in the long-term follow-up of patients after successful repair of zzso zzso zzso 

We studied 35 patients, mean age zzso years zzso zzso following repair of zzso in order to zzso 1) left zzso mass and zzso function by zzso zzso in comparison with 20 healthy control zzso 2) the prevalence of systemic zzso 3) zzso blood pressure and the zzso zzso by CW zzso at rest and after zzso 4) subjects with a zzso response and/or with a significant zzso zzso during exercise, zzso such parameters with indexes of left zzso function and the ratio of zzso zzso zzso diameters zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso At the time of operation, mean age was zzso years zzso 1 zzso zzso and the follow-up period was zzso years zzso 6 zzso zzso 

Left zzso mass index zzso was significantly greater in comparison with that of the controls zzso zzso 25 vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the end zzso zzso stress zzso was decreased zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso while the peak zzso zzso stress zzso was not significantly different in the two zzso Fourteen out of 35 patients zzso showed an exaggerated zzso for the level of zzso which indicates an increased zzso zzso zzso at rest was present in 10 patients zzso Mean age at the time of operation of the zzso group was higher than that of the zzso one zzso zzso 10 vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso All patients showed a small zzso zzso across the side of zzso repair at rest zzso zzso zzso range zzso The exercise test was stopped in 5 patients because of hypertension zzso 250 zzso 24 patients zzso showed an zzso zzso The mean zzso at zzso exercise was zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 patients zzso developed a zzso zzso With MR it was possible to evaluate the anatomy of the zzso arch and the descending zzso in all zzso The mean ratio zzso was zzso zzso zzso The age at the time of operation showed a positive correlation with the zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and with Mi zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso blood pressure and the zzso at zzso exercise also showed a positive correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In the long-term follow-up of patients after successful zzso repair there are persistent zzso of left zzso function with zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso at rest and after exercise could persist despite good surgical zzso
