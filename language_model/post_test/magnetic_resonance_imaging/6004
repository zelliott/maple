Several studies have described zzso correlations in accordance with the zzso zzso placement zzso These studies have made a significant contribution to human brain imaging techniques, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the recent development of high resolution zzso an extension of the zzso system has been zzso This new zzso namely the 10-10 system, allows the placement of a high number zzso of zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso correlations with the 10-10 zzso Thanks to the development of a new zzso sensor and an automated zzso which enables the projection of zzso positions onto the cortical surface, we studied the cortical projections in 16 healthy subjects using the zzso zzso system and estimated the zzso of cortical projections in a statistical zzso We found that the cortical projections of the 10-10 system could be estimated with a grand standard zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in y and zzso zzso in zzso We demonstrated that the zzso of projections is greatest in the central region and zzso lobe and least in the frontal and zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlations with the 10-10 system should enable to increase the precision of surface brain imaging and should help zzso zzso such as zzso of superficial focal cortical zzso
