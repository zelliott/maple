The purpose of this study was to evaluate cortical zzso patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease during a relatively complex motor zzso 

Seven patients (six men and one woman) with zzso zzso Parkinson's disease underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain with a zzso zzso Finger tapping was chosen as a motor zzso The control group included 11 volunteers (six men and five zzso with no neurological zzso 

Patients showed zzso of the zzso and zzso motor zzso associated with bilateral zzso of the zzso zzso during movement of the affected zzso In some cases, there was a lack of zzso of the zzso and supplementary motor areas zzso when present, zzso in these areas was greater during movement of the healthy zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso zzso was found in all patients as a result of their tendency to control movement zzso 

zzso of this study confirm a zzso of cortical circuits due to zzso damage in patient's with Parkinson's zzso
