Data remain sparse to guide the use of targeted zzso for suspicious breast zzso found with zzso The purpose of our study was to determine the usefulness of zzso in this zzso 

zzso review of our breast zzso database was performed to identify all zzso zzso zzso zzso suspicious zzso from January 1, 2003, to December 30, 2004, that underwent targeted zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso detection was determined, and zzso features zzso zzso type and zzso zzso zzso and positive biopsy rates of zzso detected and zzso findings were compared using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed for 167 of 201 zzso zzso Outcomes were benign in 120 zzso and zzso in 47 zzso zzso zzso assessed on zzso were 84 zzso masses, 53 zzso zzso enhancements, and 30 zzso zzso with mean size of 16 zzso Overall, 76 of 167 zzso zzso were detected with zzso zzso was significantly more frequent for masses zzso than for zzso enhancement zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size did not affect the frequency of zzso zzso depicted findings had a significantly higher positive biopsy rate zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detected nearly half zzso of zzso zzso zzso with depiction being most frequent for zzso zzso zzso zzso had a probability of zzso zzso which warrants biopsy despite lack of zzso zzso
