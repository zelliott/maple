The human zzso zzso zzso appears to zzso a variety of cognitive and motor functions, including the prediction of zzso zzso In the present study we directly tested the correspondence of zzso zzso of predicting different zzso dynamics and imagining different actions by means of functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso tasks on either zzso object or rhythmic dynamics were expected to draw on zzso areas involved in motor imagery tasks for arm, hand and mouth movements, zzso zzso the results confirmed comparable zzso zzso of property effects (in zzso and movement effects (in motor zzso in zzso zzso even more direct zzso were observed for mouth movement imagery and rhythm prediction in inferior zzso PM and for arm movement imagery and spatial prediction in zzso zzso Hand movement imagery and object prediction led to zzso in closely adjacent areas in left superior zzso zzso Together, the present findings support the notion that zzso stimulus dynamics and motor zzso are coupled in lateral PM according to a pragmatic zzso Beyond that, the results add further support to the notion that the human PM is involved in the prediction of many if not all kinds of zzso
