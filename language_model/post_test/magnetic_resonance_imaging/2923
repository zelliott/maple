Patients with schizophrenia differ from controls in several measures of brain structure and function, but it is uncertain how these relate to clinical features of the zzso We zzso patient groups by treatment response to test the hypothesis that zzso patients exhibit more marked biological abnormalities than zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso and 20 zzso patients with zzso matched for sex, age, and illness zzso were compared by magnetic resonance imaging, single zzso zzso zzso and detailed zzso zzso 

zzso variables were not statistically related to treatment response, although poorly responsive patients had lower volumes of most brain zzso Several highly significant differences emerged between patient groups on zzso zzso zzso memory functioning distinguished patient groups even after we controlled for global cognitive zzso 

zzso structure and blood flow have a limited effect on treatment response in zzso but long-term episodic memory impairment is associated with, and may zzso poor zzso
