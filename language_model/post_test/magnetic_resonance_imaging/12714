Recent clinical studies raised concern of a cognitive zzso of the major zzso drug zzso To investigate possible cerebral zzso we established a forced zzso schedule by diluting zzso in the drinking water of pregnant zzso zzso 

After application of medium zzso and high doses zzso with mean daily zzso of about 470 and zzso zzso during the entire pregnancy, we analyzed effects on offspring performance in a series of behavioral zzso as well as brain zzso changes by magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

While high zzso with peak serum zzso slightly above 100 zzso induced early zzso in general activity and deficits in learning and memory, medium zzso led to improved zzso performance in zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated increased zzso volumes in the MD condition, whereas in the HD condition significantly decreased cortical and zzso volumes were zzso zzso volume reduction was correlated with spatial acuity in the zzso 

The results indicate that effects of zzso in zzso on offspring cognitive capabilities might depend on total drug load zzso affecting cerebral development during adolescence in the zzso
