The aim of this work is to evaluate the relationship between improvement of regional zzso function and visual analysis of zzso zzso zzso in patients after acute zzso zzso zzso was performed on 19 patients 1 and 11 weeks after a zzso acute zzso zzso zzso data zzso images zzso and delayed zzso zzso were acquired after an intravenous zzso of zzso and visually analyzed using a 17 segment zzso Each segment was then classified in 3 groups, according to the presence or absence of zzso and zzso patterns at baseline zzso group zzso zzso zzso group 1: segments with delayed zzso but no early zzso group zzso segments with early zzso Relative Wall zzso zzso was analyzed in each segment and its improvement evaluated in each zzso Between first zzso and follow-up study, a significant improvement of zzso occurred in group 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in group 2 (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In group 0, zzso despite normal value at baseline study exhibited a significant improvement at follow-up (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, the combined analysis of early and delayed zzso abnormalities in zzso in the week following zzso zzso can predict zzso viability and allows in the future an evaluation of the efficacy of zzso zzso
