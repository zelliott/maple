zzso zzso subjects with zzso blood pressure greater than 95 zzso zzso were treated with zzso over a period of 3 zzso To determine the effective decrease of blood pressure and for reliable and zzso demonstration of zzso of zzso zzso during zzso treatment, we performed parallel zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso were carried out before treatment, 4 h after the first dose, and after 14 days and 3 months of zzso zzso slices showed a significant decrease of zzso zzso thickness from zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso demonstrated an equivalent decrease from zzso to zzso zzso At each measuring point, zzso of wall thickness was performed three times and the means were zzso The zzso and the zzso wall of the left zzso were also measured at three different zzso The values were obtained with negligible scatter and the changes with zzso treatment were highly significant zzso less than zzso A zzso decrease of blood pressure was also zzso The therapeutic aim to reduce zzso blood pressures below 90 zzso zzso was achieved in all zzso In addition to the significant reduction in blood pressure, the zzso converting zzso zzso inhibitor zzso caused a significant zzso of zzso left zzso zzso demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging and zzso
