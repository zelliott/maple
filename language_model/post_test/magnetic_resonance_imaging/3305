zzso in the zzso poses significant challenges associated with patient transport and monitoring, and the potential for diminished image quality zzso to patient zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a dedicated zzso incubator with integrated zzso coils in improving image quality of zzso studies of the brain acquired in term and zzso zzso using standard zzso zzso 

zzso and objective analyses of image quality of zzso brain MR examinations were performed before and after the introduction of an zzso zzso For all studies, the zzso ratio zzso was zzso image quality was graded zzso and each was assessed for image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were used to compare mean zzso zzso 

39 patients were included zzso zzso age 39 weeks zzso zzso zzso mean zzso age 13 days zzso zzso zzso mean weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following the introduction of the zzso zzso diagnostic quality scans increased from 50 to zzso and motion zzso decreased from 73 to zzso of zzso zzso did not increase initially, but, when using MR sequences and parameters specifically tailored for zzso brain imaging, zzso increased from 70 to zzso zzso 

Use of an zzso incubator in zzso zzso provides a safe environment for zzso of the zzso and also zzso patient monitoring and zzso When specifically tailored MR protocols are used, this results in improved image zzso
