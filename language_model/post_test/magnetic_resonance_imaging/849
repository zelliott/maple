zzso invasive zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an alternative to open zzso However, it requires a precise zzso zzso This study evaluated the diagnostic use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging, zzso zzso and consecutive image zzso 

17 patients (9 women, 8 zzso age: zzso years; zzso zzso zzso with primary zzso were zzso zzso by zzso used zzso zzso and zzso sequences as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso In order to improve the anatomical zzso of a zzso focus, zzso were fused with the corresponding zzso using a modified version of the Express zzso software zzso Visual Systems, zzso zzso zzso of image fusion were then compared to zzso 

In zzso patients, a single zzso zzso was zzso There were 3 cases with zzso zzso zzso detected 10 zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso Both zzso detected 1/3 patients with zzso Image fusion improved the anatomical assignment of the 13 zzso zzso in five patients and was helpful in the interpretation of zzso zzso in two zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso sensitively detect zzso zzso but are less reliable in case of zzso zzso In case of a zzso focus, image fusion considerably improves its zzso zzso Furthermore, it zzso the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso
