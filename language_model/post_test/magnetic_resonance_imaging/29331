To investigate whether the zzso X-ray zzso zzso was a better predictor of abdominal fat, measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso at the level of zzso than zzso zzso in non-obese men and non-obese zzso 

zzso cross zzso zzso 

34 healthy subjects (17 men and 17 zzso aged zzso y with a body mass index zzso zzso 30 zzso 

Fat distribution parameters including waist circumference and zzso ratio zzso zzso abdominal fat zzso by zzso and central abdominal fat zzso by zzso 

zzso of zzso by zzso was highly correlated to the zzso measured by zzso In men, both waist circumference and zzso had similar correlation to zzso as zzso In women, waist circumference was less well correlated with zzso than zzso and the zzso had a weaker non significant correlation with zzso 

In non-obese zzso zzso waist circumference and zzso can predict zzso equally well, while in non-obese women, zzso is superior to waist circumference and much better than zzso
