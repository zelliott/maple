A direct zzso imaging method, which was developed for flow zzso was applied to the cervical regions of four normal volunteers to perform magnetic resonance zzso A zzso section of 10 zzso thickness was selectively excited to tag blood flow in the zzso region and a projected image of the zzso zzso viewed in terms of zzso direction was obtained after the echo time zzso Like zzso magnetic resonance imaging, multiple images representing four to 16 cardiac zzso were obtained with repeated zzso With a relatively long zzso ranging from 50 to 200 zzso we advanced zzso blood farther zzso so as to zzso the zzso zzso along the zzso Within the zzso zzso the outer layer close to the vessel wall, where the blood flow zzso was slow, stretched like long tails behind the central part of the zzso producing zzso shapes, and the tails were assumed to represent the vascular zzso zzso common carotid and zzso arteries were zzso in each image size approximately 5 zzso obtained at the zzso zzso Since prolonged TE yielded less signal intensity, the zzso was not clearly zzso when TE was longer than 100 zzso The zzso display of images with multiple cardiac zzso produced good evaluations of dynamic changes of zzso flow, and this method is expected to be a useful diagnostic tool which combines the capability of flow zzso with zzso zzso The accuracy of this method in zzso a zzso zzso was also evaluated using phantom with steady flow, since it is one of the most important capabilities of a clinically used zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
