To describe a patient with an incidental zzso zzso who experienced zzso zzso 

A patient experiencing zzso was found to have increased zzso and low testosterone zzso zzso as a cause for his increased zzso concentration was not considered zzso The patient underwent extensive testing to rule out a zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso that had remained unchanged for 6 zzso zzso therapy was discontinued and within 1 month the patient's zzso concentration decreased from zzso to zzso zzso and has remained within normal zzso 

We reviewed reports of zzso zzso This case was unique as this patient had an incidental zzso zzso that was not responsible for increasing the zzso concentration in our patient, but rather complicated the identification of a drug-induced zzso 

The failure to identify the zzso effect of zzso may have resulted in performing unnecessary zzso procedures in this zzso This case highlights the importance of obtaining a medication history in patients with zzso
