zzso analysis is a systematic collection of quantitative information on bodily movements during zzso zzso analysis has been employed clinically in stroke patients for their rehabilitation zzso In animal studies, gait analysis has been employed for the assessment of their zzso disturbances in zzso stroke, spinal zzso injury and Parkinson's zzso The aims of the work reported here were to identify the gait zzso collected from the computer-generated zzso System, that change after unilateral zzso zzso zzso in the acute stage and long term up to 56 days zzso The results showed that with the zzso unilateral zzso zzso the rats displayed a significant zzso decrease in print and maximum contact area and paw intensity, a diagonal increase in the stance duration of the left front and right hind zzso a significant decrease in the stride length of all four zzso and foot pattern instability as reflected by the base of support, support on styles, and zzso These deficits, including those in print area, stance and pressure, were demonstrated throughout the long-term period following zzso The correlations between the gait zzso zzso volume and zzso zzso use were also reported in this zzso This work has provided a systematic description on gait parameters in the classical zzso zzso model, which might become an essential assessment tool in future studies of zzso and the development of novel treatments for experimental unilateral zzso zzso with gait zzso
