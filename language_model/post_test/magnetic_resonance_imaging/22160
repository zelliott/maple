A preliminary comparison of a zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso technique for zzso imaging of the pancreatic and zzso ducts with zzso retrograde zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso and zzso examinations were performed in 19 patients referred for routine zzso with suspected zzso or pancreatic zzso The zzso technique employed a modified heavily zzso thick slice zzso sequence that allowed up to three images to be obtained in a 16 second zzso The examinations were reported independently and the findings zzso 

zzso accurately zzso between patients without obstruction zzso zzso zzso and those with zzso zzso 8) and correctly diagnosed the cause of obstruction (three zzso five zzso zzso In the 12 patients without obstruction the examinations were zzso in zzso In the remaining four patients zzso provided more information than the corresponding zzso study, diagnosing a zzso in one patient and visualizing the entire pancreatic duct in three patients in whom this was not possible at zzso 

These preliminary results suggest that a zzso zzso technique may allow the selection of those patients with zzso zzso that require therapeutic zzso intervention, and may have the potential to reduce the need for diagnostic zzso zzso
