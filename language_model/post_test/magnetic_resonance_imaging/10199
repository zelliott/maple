To analyze the tolerance dose for retention of visual acuity in patients with zzso tumors treated with carbon zzso zzso 

From June 1994 to March 2000, zzso patients with tumors in the head and neck or skull base region were treated with carbon zzso zzso Analysis was performed on 54 zzso nerves zzso corresponding to 30 patients whose zzso had been included in the zzso zzso These patients showed no evidence of visual impairment due to other factors and had a follow-up period of zzso zzso All patients had been informed of the possibility of visual impairment before zzso We evaluated the zzso probability and the zzso factors for the retention of visual acuity in carbon zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The median age of 30 patients zzso men, 16 zzso was zzso zzso Median prescribed total dose was zzso gray zzso zzso at zzso zzso per fraction per day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4-6 zzso Of 54 zzso that were zzso 35 had been zzso with zzso zzso zzso dose zzso resulting in no visual zzso zzso 11 of the 19 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso suffered a decrease of visual zzso In all of these cases, the zzso had been involved in the tumor before carbon zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, a dose of zzso of the volume of the ON zzso was significantly associated with visual zzso 

The occurrence of visual loss seems to be correlated with a delivery of zzso zzso to zzso of the volume of the zzso
