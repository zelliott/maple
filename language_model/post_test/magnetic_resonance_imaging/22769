We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activity related to motivational function of zzso feedback stimuli in a time zzso zzso In that task, subjects pressed a button as a response 3 s after a cue zzso a visual feedback stimulus was presented 2 s after the zzso In a true feedback condition, subjects received true information zzso zzso about their zzso zzso In the false feedback condition, the same visual signs were used, but they were presented zzso zzso they were not related to actual zzso In the 20 subjects zzso higher zzso responses were identified in the insular cortex, the thalamus, and the zzso by comparing the true feedback condition to the false feedback zzso The time zzso performance and zzso score on motivation were also markedly higher in the true feedback zzso The anterior insular zzso and zzso regions are known to be involved in motivational and reward zzso zzso the zzso responses observed in this study suggest that the motivational function of the feedback information is a crucial factor for behavioral zzso it is considered that the zzso feedback might serve as an implicit reward for zzso
