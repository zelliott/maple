zzso acid zzso zzso neural transmission is important to promote zzso plasticity after brain zzso This study investigated zzso in zzso zzso binding and functional and zzso connectivity within the motor zzso in children with cerebral zzso zzso 

We conducted zzso PET on children with zzso zzso to investigate whether in zzso zzso zzso binding is altered in the zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To evaluate changes in the zzso zzso zzso after prenatal brain injury, we performed zzso zzso zzso using rat zzso with a diffuse hypoxic zzso zzso We also performed diffusion zzso MR imaging and zzso functional MR imaging on the same children with zzso zzso to investigate zzso in zzso and functional connectivity at the motor zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso 

In children with zzso zzso the zzso binding potential was increased within the zzso motor zzso zzso receptors with the zzso zzso were highly expressed exclusively within cortical layers III, IV, and VI of the motor zzso in rat zzso The motor zzso with increased zzso zzso binding in children with zzso zzso had reduced zzso and zzso zzso which might be linked to increased zzso zzso distribution in cortical layers in zzso 

Increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso motor zzso may be an important zzso mechanism after prenatal brain injury in children with zzso but may be associated with improper functional connectivity after birth and have adverse effects on the development of motor zzso
