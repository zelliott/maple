There are many challenges in developing robust imaging zzso that can be reliably applied in a clinical trial zzso In the case of dynamic zzso zzso zzso one such challenge is to obtain accurate zzso zzso maps for subsequent use in zzso zzso models commonly used to fit the MR enhancement time zzso In the zzso a convenient and common approach for this task has been to use the same zzso zzso zzso sequence used to collect the zzso data, but with variable flip angles zzso to collect data suitable for zzso mapping prior to contrast zzso However, zzso zzso conditions within the prostate have been found to adversely affect the accuracy of this zzso zzso we demonstrate the sensitivity of zzso zzso parameters to zzso zzso values and examine methods to improve the accuracy of zzso mapping with flip zzso zzso zzso methods, comparing zzso maps from such methods with zzso zzso reference zzso maps generated with zzso recovery experiments performed with fast zzso zzso zzso
