The design and application of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that simultaneously records the zzso zzso and receives the MR signal for active zzso tracking is zzso The zzso acts as a long loop receiver, allowing for zzso of the entire zzso length while simultaneously behaving as a traditional zzso zzso zzso allowing for zzso zzso recording and zzso The application of the device is demonstrated by simultaneously tracking the zzso and recording the zzso zzso in canine models using 7 and 10 zzso real-time imaging zzso Using solely MR imaging, the entire zzso was zzso and guided from the jugular vein into the cardiac chambers, where the zzso zzso was zzso By combining several functions in a single, simple structure, the excellent tissue contrast and functional imaging capabilities of MR can be used to improve the efficacy of zzso zzso This zzso will facilitate zzso interventions and demonstrates the design of zzso zzso devices for use in zzso
