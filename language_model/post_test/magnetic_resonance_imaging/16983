zzso plays a key role in the zzso development of new drugs, zzso and their delivery zzso However, very high installation and running costs of existing zzso zzso machines limit the spread of zzso The new method of zzso zzso has the potential to overcome this limitation due to much lower installation and almost no running zzso However, due to the low field strength and decreased magnet zzso it is questionable, whether zzso can achieve sufficient image quality to provide useful information for zzso in zzso zzso It was the aim of the current study to explore the potential of zzso on tumor models in zzso 

We used a zzso of an in zzso zzso apparatus to zzso zzso and tumors and to zzso tumor progression in nude mouse zzso models of human zzso germ cell tumor and colon zzso 

zzso zzso were easily identified as relative zzso areas in zzso slices of zzso zzso Monitoring of tumor progression evaluated by zzso extension analyses based on zzso images correlated with increasing tumor volume calculated by zzso zzso zzso contrast agent injection resulted in a better differentiation between parts of the urinary zzso and zzso due to fast elimination of the agent via zzso In addition, interior structuring of tumors could be zzso A strong contrast enhancement within a tumor was associated with a central zzso zzso 

zzso provides satisfactory image quality to zzso zzso and tumors and to monitor tumor progression and structure in mouse zzso
