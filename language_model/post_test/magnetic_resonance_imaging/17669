The purpose of this study was to clarify the zzso of the International zzso zzso Society zzso grade 1 cartilage zzso in anterior cruciate ligament zzso knees using zzso and zzso zzso 

We performed zzso zzso and zzso mapping and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso sequences on 37 subjects with zzso zzso We determined the zzso on zzso zzso based on zzso zzso The zzso and zzso values zzso were measured in the regions of interest that were placed on the zzso cartilage of the zzso zzso The receiver operating characteristic zzso curve based on these values was constructed using the zzso findings as a reference zzso The evaluation of cartilage was carried out only in the zzso zzso The zzso values for determining the presence of a cartilage injury were determined using each zzso curve, and the zzso was calculated for the zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso values for the zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, while those of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso For the zzso zzso images, the same values were zzso and zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrated that the zzso and zzso values were significantly higher for zzso grade 1 cartilage zzso than for normal cartilage and that the two zzso were able to zzso detect zzso grade 1 cartilage zzso in the zzso knee with a higher zzso than were zzso zzso zzso
