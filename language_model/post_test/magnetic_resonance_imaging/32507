zzso artifacts due to metallic zzso are a major problem in clinical magnetic resonance zzso We theoretically and zzso analyze slice distortion arising from zzso differences in a phantom consisting of a stainless steel ball bearing embedded in zzso zzso To relate the observed image artifacts to slice zzso we simulate images produced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a view angle tilting zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences suffer from extreme slice distortion when a metal zzso is present, unlike zzso zzso sequences for zzso slices are zzso of the slice profile is zzso provided the selected slab is larger than the region of zzso In a zzso zzso artifacts are reduced by the application of a zzso along the slice direction during zzso However, zzso does not correct for the zzso slice profile, which results in the zzso of spins outside the desired slice location and can lead to incorrect anatomical information in MR zzso We propose that the best sequences for imaging in the presence of a metal zzso zzso zzso zzso with phase zzso replacing slice selection to minimize slice zzso combined with zzso and zzso zzso strengths at their maximum zzso
