A new zzso complex working memory span paradigm was used to identify brain regions making zzso contributions to working memory task zzso For both verbal and spatial versions of the task, complex working memory span performance increased the activity in lateral zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso zzso during the zzso zzso and zzso phase of task zzso Meanwhile, overlapping activity in anterior prefrontal and zzso zzso lobe regions was associated with both verbal and spatial recall from working zzso These findings help to zzso several contested issues regarding the executive mechanisms of working memory, the zzso of short-term and working memory in the verbal and spatial zzso and the relative contribution of short-term and long-term memory mechanisms to working memory zzso The study also provides a vital bridge between zzso and zzso approaches to working memory, and zzso our understanding of how working memory may contribute to the broader landscape of cognitive zzso
