zzso zzso zzso is a very rare and aggressive zzso of vascular zzso We describe zzso imaging findings of this entity with emphasis on dynamic zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso 

Seven cases of zzso confirmed zzso zzso were zzso reviewed zzso and zzso examinations were available in seven and six patients, zzso Two zzso evaluated zzso growth patterns, zzso signal intensity zzso contrast enhancement patterns, and apparent diffusion zzso zzso 

zzso zzso disease was present in six patients by means of a mixed pattern of large dominant masses and multiple small zzso one patient had a solitary large zzso zzso images depicted zzso areas and a markedly zzso internal architecture within large zzso zzso early phase images showed variable patterns including zzso peripheral or bizarre shaped zzso zzso of enhancement, peripheral rim enhancement, and small zzso without zzso On zzso images, the majority of zzso presented with varying degrees of progressive zzso Small zzso frequently displayed homogeneous enhancement on delayed phase images due to complete zzso zzso revealed a high zzso zzso of zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso imaging findings of zzso zzso reflect the varied zzso composition of the zzso zzso disease, zzso within large zzso as well as progressive enhancement on zzso images are typical features of zzso zzso The mean zzso of zzso was found to be slightly elevated in comparison with other zzso zzso
