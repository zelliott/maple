This study was designed to characterize the zzso and sensitivity to change of magnetic resonance zzso cartilage zzso metrics and zzso regions of interest zzso in order to provide preferable outcome measures in zzso studies of cartilage zzso zzso acquisitions were obtained at 3 zzso zzso in 33 subjects with and without zzso signs of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as baseline and zzso follow-up acquisitions in 28 subjects with zzso signs of advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso was segmented in the zzso and two distinct anatomical zzso zzso a zzso zzso extending zzso from the zzso notch to the zzso end of the zzso and a zzso zzso extending to the zzso bone zzso zzso of variation zzso zzso and standardized response means zzso sensitivity zzso were obtained for different zzso metrics and anatomical zzso The zzso bone area of the long zzso was zzso greater and less variable than that of the short zzso cartilage zzso metrics were generally more zzso in the long zzso zzso cartilage volume zzso and mean cartilage thickness (over the entire zzso bone area; zzso tended to be more zzso and more sensitive to change zzso up to zzso than cartilage volume zzso up to zzso cartilage thickness over the zzso area zzso zzso up to zzso or maximum cartilage thickness zzso zzso up to zzso The long zzso cartilage zzso provided more zzso zzso than the short zzso zzso and zzso may be preferable metrics in zzso studies of zzso cartilage adaptation or zzso
