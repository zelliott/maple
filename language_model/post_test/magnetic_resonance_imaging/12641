The term zzso zzso is used to zzso correlations in zzso among zzso brain regions, either in a resting state or when processing external zzso zzso connectivity has been extensively evaluated with several functional zzso methods, particularly PET and zzso Yet these relationships have been zzso using very different measures and the extent to which they index the same zzso is zzso We have implemented a variety of these functional connectivity measures in a new freely available zzso zzso These measures are zzso into two groups: whole zzso and zzso zzso We evaluate these measures via simulations with different patterns of functional connectivity and provide recommendations for their zzso We also apply these measures to a previously published zzso data set zzso zzso Thompson, zzso Carter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso and decreased zzso prefrontal zzso responses in zzso zzso related and independent zzso zzso zzso 610 zzso zzso in which activity in zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso was evaluated in 32 control subjects during a zzso sorting zzso Though all implemented measures demonstrate functional connectivity between zzso and zzso activity during zzso tasks, different participants appeared to display zzso different zzso
