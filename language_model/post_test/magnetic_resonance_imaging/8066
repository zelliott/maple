Dynamic zzso is restricted due to the time required to obtain enough data to reconstruct the image zzso Several zzso reconstruction techniques have been proposed to reduce the acquisition zzso In most of these techniques the zzso data are recovered by modeling the zzso information as varying zzso zzso represented in time or in zzso zzso Here we propose a new approach that recovers the missing data through a motion zzso of the object elements zzso or pieces of zzso of the zzso This method assumes that an zzso displacement through the sequence has lower bandwidth than fluctuations in zzso zzso caused by the motion, and thus it can be modeled with fewer zzso zzso results show that this technique can effectively reconstruct (with root mean square zzso errors below zzso cardiac images and zzso with zzso factors of 8 and 4, zzso Moreover, in the reconstruction process an approximation of the motion zzso is obtained for each zzso which can be used to zzso dynamic zzso In this method the motion need not be confined to a part of the field of view zzso or to a portion of the zzso zzso It is appropriate for dynamic studies in which the zzso motion model has fewer parameters than the number of acquired zzso
