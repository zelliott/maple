In 56 patients with anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso we zzso examined zzso zzso secondary to the zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Depending on the time from their zzso injury to the performance of zzso the patients were divided into three groups: the acute group (less than 1 month, zzso zzso zzso the zzso group (between 1 and 12 months, zzso zzso zzso and the chronic group (12 months or more, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were not detected by zzso were revealed by zzso in 14 patients in the acute group zzso 5 in the zzso group zzso and 1 in the chronic group zzso The detection rate of zzso zzso by zzso was significantly higher in the acute group than in the other groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were always detected in the same locations of the lateral compartment of the knee zzso When examined by zzso these zzso were often found to be accompanied by zzso cartilage zzso In the acute group, zzso zzso were visible in the high signal intensity area of zzso images and in the low signal intensity area of zzso density zzso They were interpreted as representing zzso and zzso within the bone zzso In the zzso and chronic groups, the zzso zzso were smaller, and their signal intensity on zzso images was lower than that in the acute group, probably reflecting the ongoing zzso of the zzso and healing of the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso develop following injury to the zzso
