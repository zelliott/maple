zzso resonance imaging zzso is often considered to be the gold standard in measuring left zzso function and zzso The aim of this study was to assess the agreements between standard zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the determination of left zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso volumes zzso in patients treated for acute zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Standard zzso contrast zzso zzso and zzso were performed on the same day, 3 months after zzso in 150 patients participating in the zzso Study on District Treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso measured by all four imaging zzso showed generally low mean differences but wide limits of zzso The mean zzso difference, however, was consistently higher when zzso was compared with standard echo zzso zzso contrast echo zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the limits of agreement were zzso The mean zzso differences between contrast echo zzso standard zzso zzso zzso standard echo and contrast echo zzso zzso were zzso 

Our data suggest that all four imaging zzso measured zzso closely similar after zzso as demonstrated by a very small zzso The limits of agreement were however zzso zzso measured by zzso was consistently higher when compared with the other methods which may be caused by different zzso and imaging zzso As zzso is preferable from a cost-benefit point of view, further analysis would be needed to clarify the nature of such zzso
