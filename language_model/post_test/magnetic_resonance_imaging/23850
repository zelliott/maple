To assess the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso in healthy people and to evaluate whether an enlarged zzso zzso area is associated with functional impairment of the zzso zzso 

Until now, zzso impairment of the zzso system could be identified only by functional zzso techniques such as PET in selected groups of zzso zzso is a new, zzso ultrasound technique that has demonstrated an increased zzso of the zzso in patients with zzso whereas in most healthy individuals, the zzso is either barely zzso or zzso by zzso 

Of 330 healthy volunteers, zzso exhibited an increased zzso of the zzso From these, 10 clinically healthy individuals with distinct unilateral or bilateral zzso signals in the zzso region zzso area above zzso zzso underwent comprehensive motor testing, zzso assessment, zzso and zzso PET zzso With regard to motor functions, these individuals did not differ from 10 zzso and zzso controls with a low zzso zzso and an area of zzso signals below zzso zzso Enlargement of zzso areas in the 10 healthy individuals was associated with a marked decrease in the zzso of zzso in the zzso nucleus and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso appears to indicate a functional impairment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a suitable method of identifying persons at risk of zzso zzso making possible the introduction of early zzso zzso
