Delayed acquisition of zzso motor and cognitive milestones is a common clinical expression of many zzso zzso Imaging exams of zzso delayed children often show no structural brain zzso despite suspicion of brain maturation zzso zzso studies increasingly suggest that white matter zzso finely reflects the progression in functional brain zzso In this zzso zzso study, we sought to evaluate whether zzso delay in children with normal conventional zzso exams is associated with reduced zzso white zzso A total of 100 children zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso delay and 50 normally developing zzso control children underwent 3-D zzso to measure the volume of zzso white zzso Patients showed a significant reduction in the relative content of zzso white matter zzso for zzso of brain volume in patients and zzso in control subjects, P zzso zzso The observed difference was equivalent to a zzso zzso zzso Although the whole zzso were invariably symmetrical, the volume of zzso white matter was zzso in zzso of patients and zzso of control subjects zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso assessment of white matter may reveal a reduction in brain zzso beyond early childhood in zzso delayed children showing normal brain zzso This finding further emphasizes the view of white matter zzso as an indicator of functional brain zzso
