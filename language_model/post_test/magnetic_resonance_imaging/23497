Patients with zzso cell zzso zzso may develop zzso and other central nervous system zzso zzso revealed by brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso We estimated the zzso and pattern of pathological brain zzso findings in a zzso zzso cohort of children with zzso 

Among children under 15 years of age diagnosed with zzso in the Stockholm County during zzso brain zzso was performed at a single center in children with clinical and/or laboratory signs of zzso involvement, including zzso zzso 

Out of the 29 children (16 zzso 13 zzso diagnosed with zzso brain zzso was performed based on clinical indications in 16 children zzso with either abnormal zzso findings zzso zzso zzso such as diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso low IGF-1 zzso zzso 1), or zzso zzso zzso 1), or clinical zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were demonstrated in eight children zzso at a median time of zzso years after zzso diagnosis zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 of the 29 children zzso had zzso findings associated with zzso corresponding to a minimal zzso of zzso children per zzso zzso abnormalities tended to be more frequent in patients with zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso 

The minimal annual zzso rate of neurodegenerative associated zzso findings in zzso is estimated at zzso children zzso of all children with zzso An important question is whether all patients with zzso or certain forms of zzso should be recommended for a late follow-up examination including zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso follow-up assessment is zzso
