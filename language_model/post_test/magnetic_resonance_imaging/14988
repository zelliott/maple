The zzso nerve is involved in the opening of the zzso orifice of the zzso tube by operating the zzso zzso zzso zzso The hypothesis was investigated that middle ear zzso occurs in a more severe disease zzso of canine zzso nerve mass zzso compared with dogs without middle ear zzso Three observers reviewed canine zzso with an zzso of zzso nerve mass zzso from three zzso Various parameters describing the zzso zzso by the zzso nerve were scored and compared between dogs with and without middle ear zzso zzso dogs met the inclusion zzso zzso middle ear zzso was observed in 63 per cent zzso zzso zzso per cent to zzso per zzso of the zzso The size of the zzso nerve mass zzso was positively correlated with the severity of zzso muscle mass loss zzso zzso zzso Dogs with middle ear zzso had a significantly increased zzso zzso muscle mass loss zzso or zzso zzso zzso muscle loss score zzso compared with those zzso zzso zzso nerve mass zzso were associated with a greater degree of zzso muscle mass zzso zzso muscle mass and, importantly, zzso zzso zzso muscle mass was more severely affected in dogs with middle ear zzso suggesting an associated zzso tube zzso
