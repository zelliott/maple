Patients with zzso fractures containing zzso zzso may represent a distinct zzso of zzso patients, yet the development of subsequent zzso fractures in this population has not been zzso We tested the hypothesis that after zzso for zzso zzso subsequent fractures would occur earlier and more frequently than after treatment of zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed 362 patients treated with zzso for zzso zzso The location, frequency, and timing of subsequent fractures were compared between 2 zzso group 1, patients treated at fractures containing zzso and group 2, treated patients without zzso A zzso analysis was used to compare the relative risk and timing of subsequent fractures adjacent to zzso with or without zzso 

Group 1 included 63 patients treated at 65 zzso and group 2 included 250 patients treated at 399 zzso Group 1 demonstrated a nearly twofold increased risk of subsequent fracture zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso At the zzso level, the relative risk of subsequent fracture was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso times greater adjacent to a treated zzso zzso adjacent to any treated level occurred significantly sooner than nonadjacent fracture zzso zzso zzso The presence of a zzso was not significantly associated with the timing of subsequent zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso fractures containing zzso are at increased risk for subsequent fractures and treatment of these zzso is associated with increased rates of adjacent zzso There is no significant difference in the timing of subsequent fractures based on the presence of a zzso
