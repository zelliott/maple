To evaluate the zzso safety, and zzso effects of zzso and intravenous administration of zzso zzso stem cells zzso (also called zzso zzso zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso lateral sclerosis zzso 

A phase 1/2 zzso clinical zzso zzso Fifteen patients with zzso zzso zzso Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score, zzso zzso and 19 with ALS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score, zzso zzso were zzso zzso After culture, a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 9 cases, zzso were zzso labeled with the zzso iron oxide zzso zzso 

The main outcome measure was the recording of side zzso zzso zzso zzso included adverse events zzso neurological disability assessment by means of the zzso magnetic resonance imaging to exclude unexpected zzso and track the labeled stem cells, and zzso tests to assess the short-term zzso effects of zzso zzso 

zzso patients had zzso adverse effects consisting of transient fever, and 15 reported zzso No major adverse effects were reported during zzso The mean zzso score remained stable during the first 6 months of zzso whereas the mean zzso zzso score improved from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso the zzso in the zzso horns of the zzso indicating the possible migration of zzso cells in the zzso zzso space, and spinal zzso zzso analysis revealed an increase in the proportion of zzso regulatory T cells, a decrease in the zzso responses of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso cells at 24 hours after zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in patients with zzso and ALS is a clinically feasible and relatively safe procedure and zzso immediate zzso zzso Trial zzso zzso zzso zzso
