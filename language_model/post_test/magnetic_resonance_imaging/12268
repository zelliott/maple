zzso zzso which is an important clinical problem, is often monitored and studied using expensive devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that are unavailable in economically zzso zzso zzso induction zzso zzso is a new type of zzso zzso and low-cost detection technology, and exhibits prospects for wide application, especially for the detection of brain zzso However, the previous studies on zzso have focused on laboratory models and rarely on in zzso applications because the induced signals produced by biological zzso are notably zzso Based on the symmetry between the two brain zzso and the fact that a local brain zzso will not affect the zzso hemisphere, a zzso zzso sensor detection system, which is characterized by one zzso zzso and two receiving zzso was designed to improve the detection sensitivity of zzso This method was subsequently used to detect the occurrence of cerebral zzso in zzso The average phase drift induced by a zzso injection of zzso blood was zzso which is a fivefold improvement compared with the traditional single zzso zzso and single receiving zzso zzso The results indicate that this system has high sensitivity and zzso ability and high practical zzso
