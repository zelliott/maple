Little is known about the zzso zzso zzso in bipolar depression despite altered zzso binding in major depressive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was compared between depressed bipolar disorder zzso and zzso 

Brain zzso binding potential zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso total available zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured in 32 currently depressed, zzso BD subjects and 47 zzso Participants were zzso for the zzso promoter zzso zzso 

The bipolar depressed group demonstrated higher zzso zzso across all regions of interest zzso p zzso zzso Post hoc analyses indicated that male BD patients had higher zzso zzso than male controls zzso zzso zzso with higher zzso zzso found in every region (by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso to 50% in the zzso zzso zzso female zzso did not differ in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not correlate with depression zzso The zzso zzso was overrepresented at trend level in the BD group zzso zzso zzso Number of zzso copies was associated with higher zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Higher zzso zzso in bipolar depressed males suggests higher zzso zzso zzso potentially causing less zzso release and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect may be partly zzso No difference in zzso zzso between BD and control females may reflect greater effect of prior zzso exposure in BD zzso
