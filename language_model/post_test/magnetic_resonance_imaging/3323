Active reading requires coordination between frequent eye movements zzso and short zzso in zzso Yet, the impact of zzso on word processing remains unknown, as zzso studies typically employ constant eye zzso Here we investigate zzso effects on word recognition processes in healthy human subjects using zzso constrained zzso zzso zzso and zzso detection in real zzso Word recognition was slower and brain responses were reduced to words presented early versus late after zzso suggesting an overall transient impairment of word processing after eye zzso Response reductions occurred early in visual zzso and later in language regions, where they zzso with repetition zzso zzso zzso similar effects occurred when words appeared early versus late after background movement that zzso zzso suggesting that retinal motion contributes to zzso zzso Further, differences in zzso and zzso effects suggest that central mechanisms also contribute to zzso zzso Together, these results suggest a complex interplay between visual and central zzso mechanisms during zzso
