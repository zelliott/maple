Of all mood states, patients in mixed episodes of bipolar disorder are at the greatest risk for impulsive behaviors including attempted zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether the neural zzso of motor zzso are distinct in patients with mixed zzso 

Ten patients with bipolar disorder in a mixed episode zzso 10 bipolar comparison participants in a depressed episode zzso and 10 healthy comparison zzso participants underwent functional zzso while performing a zzso task of motor zzso 

Both patient groups had zzso zzso motor zzso zzso The zzso group also had a zzso increase in commission errors relative to the HC group on the zzso zzso While the full sample strongly activated a zzso zzso brain network, the zzso group activated the zzso and frontal zzso more strongly than the HC group, and the thalamus, zzso and frontal zzso more strongly than the zzso zzso 

This study is primarily limited by a relatively small sample zzso 

Higher commission error rates on the zzso task suggest increased vulnerability to impulsive responding during mixed episodes of bipolar zzso Moreover, the distinct pattern of increased brain zzso during mixed mania may indicate a connection between behavioral zzso and a failure of zzso zzso especially in the zzso
