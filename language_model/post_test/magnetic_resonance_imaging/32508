The differences between two models of cerebral zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso and cortical zzso zzso were explored with zzso zzso of apparent diffusion zzso trace zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sections aligned with the MR images in the same zzso plane were used to map the zzso and to guide zzso zzso In zzso cortex, the larger zzso increase in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso is related to the different character of zzso between these zzso yet, neither zzso nor zzso zzso between them at zzso zzso suggesting that different mechanisms of zzso damage to the brain cells resulted in the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso were depressed in immediately adjacent zzso border by zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso but not in zzso suggesting marginal zzso in zzso zzso in zzso normal zzso in the opposite zzso was higher for zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Different pathological processes in the two models affect zzso zzso and zzso in a unique, regionally specific zzso The zzso model differs substantially from the zzso and is not a model of cortical zzso with an appreciable border zzso
