The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prone positioning on pulmonary zzso using zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso a zzso magnetic resonance imaging technique that requires no contrast zzso Seven healthy volunteers were studied in the zzso and prone positions under three respiratory conditions: normal breathing of room air, zzso breathing of zzso zzso and controlled mechanical ventilation zzso with positive zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso were obtained from zzso middle, and zzso regions on zzso lung images and zzso zzso ratios were calculated to evaluate pulmonary zzso zzso In the zzso position, zzso increased significantly from the zzso to zzso region under all three respiratory conditions and prone positioning zzso the zzso distribution under all zzso Right lung zzso ratios were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso position and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in prone for room air, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The difference between zzso and prone positions was statistically zzso The left lung showed a similar pattern and the difference was significant only under zzso No difference was observed between the different respiratory conditions in both zzso This study demonstrated that the distribution of pulmonary zzso was more uniform in prone than in the zzso zzso
