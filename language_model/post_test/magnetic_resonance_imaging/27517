The presence of zzso zzso invasion by zzso cancer is a key factor in prognosis and treatment decisions, although may be missed by biopsy due to sampling zzso zzso has shown potential for detection of muscle invasion but has not specifically been evaluated for this purpose in the setting of zzso cancer patients without evidence of muscle invasion on initial zzso 

To evaluate the role of zzso in detection of zzso zzso invasion by zzso cancer following a zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso 

This retrospective study included 23 patients who underwent pelvic zzso following a zzso diagnosis of zzso cancer without zzso zzso invasion and in whom additional zzso evaluation was performed following zzso Two zzso in consensus reviewed zzso images to identify those cases suspicious for muscle invasion on zzso The zzso identified whether cases suspicious for invasion demonstrated disruption of the zzso zzso layer of the zzso wall, zzso fat zzso and zzso soft tissue zzso zzso were compared with zzso results obtained after zzso 

zzso was raised for muscle invasion in eight of 23 cases, four of which exhibited invasion on follow-up zzso No case without suspicion on zzso exhibited invasion on follow-up zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso zzso Among individual findings, zzso disruption on zzso exhibited sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso fat zzso exhibited sensitivity and specificity of 50% and zzso and zzso soft tissue zzso exhibited sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso 

zzso demonstrated high sensitivity for detection of muscle invasion in cases of zzso cancer without invasion on initial zzso zzso zzso disruption on zzso appeared to exhibit a better combination of sensitivity and specificity than did zzso zzso
