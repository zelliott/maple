To introduce and test a direct reconstruction concept for zzso tandem ring zzso in MR zzso zzso treatment zzso 

zzso zzso of transparent zzso provided the geometric relation between source path and the Vienna ring zzso as visible on zzso For the manual direct reconstruction method zzso the geometry plotted on a transparency was placed on the screen and rotated to fit with visible ring zzso With the zzso reconstruction method zzso the zzso geometry was directly used when placing the visible parts of the zzso in the zzso zzso Clinical feasibility was tested in 10 clinical zzso Reconstruction and dose calculation were performed independently on two treatment planning systems zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso parameters for targets and zzso at risk were zzso and compared to the clinically used zzso zzso zzso 

The direct reconstruction concept for both methods was feasible and reduced treatment planning zzso zzso zzso parameters for plans using direct reconstruction methods differed from clinically used plans zzso zzso in mean differences zzso or zzso zzso for plans with 7 zzso prescribed zzso 

If the relation between zzso shape visible on zzso and the source path is defined once, the reconstruction process can be performed by directly placing the zzso in the zzso zzso
