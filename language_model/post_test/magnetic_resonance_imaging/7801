zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate regional zzso images of fractional ventilation zzso as the ratio of fresh gas entering a volume unit to the total end zzso volume of the zzso Using a single dose of zzso zzso gas and a total acquisition time of under 1 zzso gas zzso was measured by dynamic acquisitions during successive breaths with a fixed zzso A two-dimensional zzso imaging protocol was investigated in four healthy subjects in the zzso position, and in a second protocol the capability of extending the zzso imaging to a three-dimensional zzso acquisition covering the whole lungs was zzso During both zzso subjects were breathing comfortably, only restricted by synchronization of breathing to the sequence zzso The zzso protocol was also successfully tested on one patient with zzso zzso Mean r values from each volunteer were compared with global gas volume zzso as calculated from flow measurement at the mouth divided by total lung volume (from zzso zzso and a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was zzso The effects of gravity on R were investigated, and an average decrease in r of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to anterior was found in the right zzso zzso zzso of r imaging with the zzso and zzso protocol was tested, and a significant correlation between repeated experiments was found in a zzso zzso The proposed methods can be used to measure r on a regional zzso
