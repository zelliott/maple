A simple zzso model for zzso transfer was used to obtain theoretical expressions for the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow and delta M, the change in zzso zzso of brain water spins when zzso water spins are zzso The theoretical relationship can be written in two forms, depending on the approach used to zzso delta zzso Using the first approach, the calculation of cerebral blood flow requires a knowledge of zzso 1, delta zzso the zzso relaxation rate observed in the presence of continuous zzso zzso zzso Using the second approach, the calculation of cerebral blood flow requires a knowledge of zzso 1, delta zzso where zzso 1, delta zzso is given by the product of zzso 1, delta zzso and the fractional zzso zzso water zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso If the zzso zzso zzso used for zzso tagging does not produce appreciable zzso transfer effects, zzso 1, delta zzso can be zzso by the zzso relaxation rate measured in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions obtained by using the zzso model for zzso transfer are compared with equivalent expressions obtained by using zzso zzso
