To evaluate a simultaneous integrated boost zzso strategy in zzso zzso of zzso cancer patients following zzso chemotherapy using zzso and zzso tumor volumes assessed by zzso 

Ten patients with locally advanced zzso cancer, receiving chemotherapy prior to zzso were included in this zzso zzso and zzso MR tumor images were zzso with CT images for zzso zzso Three planning target volumes were zzso zzso zzso and zzso For zzso prescribed mean doses to the zzso were 46, 50 and 58 zzso respectively, given in 25 zzso zzso at risk zzso were zzso and zzso The novel zzso zzso strategy was compared to a conventional zzso zzso plan, in which zzso was ignored, using zzso zzso zzso and the generalized equivalent uniform dose zzso 

All patients showed tumor shrinkage following zzso For the novel zzso zzso mean doses given to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed minimal differences between the two zzso zzso 

zzso volume reduction for zzso cancer patients following zzso chemotherapy allows for increased tumor dose using a zzso strategy without increased zzso zzso
