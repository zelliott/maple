zzso stress has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of zzso brain shrinkage and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the correlations between liver function and brain volume zzso zzso in patients with alcohol zzso 

We recruited 124 patients with alcohol dependence and 111 healthy control subjects from National Institute of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and zzso zzso alcohol treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso were zzso shortly after zzso zzso resonance imaging examination was conducted in both groups (after zzso zzso in the patient zzso We used zzso linear zzso analyses to determine the variables most strongly correlated with brain zzso 

Patients with alcohol dependence had lower zzso and greater brain shrinkage as measured by gray matter ratio zzso white matter ratio zzso brain ratio zzso and higher zzso fluid ratio ratio zzso compared with their healthy zzso Age and sex were significantly correlated with some zzso zzso in both patient and control zzso Body mass index zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso serum zzso level with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the patient zzso No biological variables were correlated with zzso zzso in the control zzso In zzso analysis, age was significantly correlated with brain shrinkage in male patients but not in female zzso zzso zzso level in male and female patients, zzso in male patients, and zzso levels in female patients were significantly correlated with brain zzso 

Our results showed that the higher levels of liver function zzso especially zzso correlated with zzso shrinkage as measured using zzso zzso zzso and zzso in patients with alcohol dependence but not in zzso zzso zzso level zzso aging effect on brain shrinkage in female zzso
