zzso brain zzso as demonstrated by zzso resonance zzso are common zzso in adult zzso As mice share important zzso and zzso similarities with humans, we tested whether brain zzso abnormalities also occur in a transgenic mouse model of zzso In zzso resonance zzso at zzso of the zzso mouse brain revealed abnormalities in relative levels of zzso and zzso zzso These results are consistent with a prior proposal that deficits in zzso ratios may be common features of psychotic zzso Thus, zzso mice zzso certain aspects of the human disease zzso and further support the utility of this animal model for understanding zzso factors underlying uniquely human brain zzso
