Our purpose was to evaluate the role of zzso transfer and image zzso in detecting more enhancing zzso in brain MR imaging of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso Thirty-one zzso patients underwent MR imaging of the brain with zzso spin echo sequences without and with zzso transfer zzso using a zzso T zzso Both sequences were acquired before and after intravenous injection of a zzso contrast zzso zzso images in zzso sequences were obtained by zzso the zzso images from the zzso zzso A significant difference was found between the numbers of enhanced areas in zzso zzso images without and with zzso zzso The zzso zzso images with zzso allowed the detection of an increased zzso number of enhancing zzso compared with zzso zzso images without zzso A significant difference was also found between the numbers of enhanced areas in zzso zzso images without zzso and zzso images without zzso zzso The zzso images without zzso allowed the detection of an increased (10) number of enhancing zzso compared with zzso zzso images without zzso zzso transfer contrast and zzso techniques appear to be the simplest and least time-consuming applications to improve the zzso and detection of zzso zzso in patients with zzso
