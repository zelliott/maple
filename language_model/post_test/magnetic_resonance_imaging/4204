The authors characterize the appearance of the Achilles zzso in patients with zzso arthritis and differentiate this appearance from degenerative zzso in patients with chronic pain of the heel using magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso arthritis and 28 patients with chronic pain of the heel underwent MR imaging of the ankle and zzso Three zzso independently assessed the MR images with respect to size, shape, and zzso signal characteristics of the Achilles zzso The Achilles zzso was considered abnormal on MR imaging when zzso signal zzso or an zzso measurement greater than 8 zzso was zzso Physical examination of the Achilles zzso was accomplished in both zzso Operation confirmed the diagnosis of 13 patients in the second group with chronic pain of the zzso 

The Achilles zzso of zzso of patients with zzso arthritis demonstrated various zzso patterns zzso zzso zzso of intermediate signal intensity on all pulse sequences on MR zzso zzso percent of patients with zzso zzso showed no enlargement of the zzso diameter of the Achilles zzso In addition, all patients with zzso arthritis had findings compatible with an inflammation of the zzso zzso on MR imaging, whereas none of the patients with zzso associated with chronic heel pain had zzso zzso All patients, however, had enlargement of the zzso diameter of the Achilles zzso zzso percent showed various zzso zzso of intermediate signal intensity on all pulse zzso zzso percent of patients had an enlargement of the Achilles zzso without zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be distinguished from degenerative zzso in patients with chronic pain of the heel with MR zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the absence of enlargement of the zzso combined with the presence of zzso signal zzso are characteristic findings of zzso zzso
