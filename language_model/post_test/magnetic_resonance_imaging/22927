This study compared zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine whether zzso zzso could distinguish zzso zzso from traumatic zzso zzso Twenty patients with traumatic zzso fracture (and no zzso disease) and 14 patients with zzso zzso zzso were zzso Three to 4 hours after intravenous injection of zzso zzso images of the zzso in all patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired within 4 days after the zzso zzso bone images were zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated 24 zzso traumatic fractures and 44 zzso zzso On conventional bone scans, zzso zzso activity was increased in zzso of zzso fractures and in zzso of zzso zzso However, on zzso scans, no abnormal findings were observed in the zzso with zzso although increased activity was seen in zzso of zzso zzso In this study, traumatic zzso fractures tended to display no zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso whereas bone zzso usually appeared with high zzso In light of the excellent specificity of zzso zzso scans compared with zzso zzso bone scans, imaging studies that use zzso zzso scans may play an important complementary role in zzso zzso zzso from traumatic zzso zzso
