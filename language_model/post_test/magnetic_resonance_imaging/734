zzso and zzso studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso lobe is crucial for recognizing emotions from facial zzso In humans, bilateral zzso damage is followed by impaired recognition of facial expressions of zzso To evaluate the influence of unilateral zzso zzso lobe damage we examined recognition of facial expressions and functional magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso associated with incidental processing of fearful faces in thirteen zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso patients zzso with right zzso five with left zzso We also examined the effect of early versus later damage, comparing subjects with zzso sclerosis zzso and zzso occurring before five years of age to zzso patients with late onset zzso Fourteen healthy volunteers participated as zzso zzso testing demonstrated that the ability of right zzso patients to recognize fearful facial expressions is zzso Patients with early onset of zzso were the most severely zzso This deficit was associated with defective zzso of a neural network involved in the processing of fearful expressions, which in controls and left zzso included the left inferior frontal zzso and several zzso structures of both zzso
