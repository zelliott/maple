zzso and representation of the human cerebral zzso from magnetic resonance zzso images play an important role in zzso and zzso A successful zzso method must be robust to various imaging artifacts and produce zzso meaningful and consistent cortical zzso A method for the automatic reconstruction of the zzso central, and outer surfaces of the cerebral zzso from zzso MR brain images is zzso The method combines a fuzzy tissue zzso method, an efficient zzso correction algorithm, and a zzso geometric zzso surface model zzso The zzso is fast and zzso stable, and yields accurate brain surface reconstructions that are guaranteed to be zzso correct and free from zzso zzso results on real MR data are presented to demonstrate the performance of the zzso
