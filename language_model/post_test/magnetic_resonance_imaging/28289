zzso was performed in 13 patients who had zzso zzso therapy zzso for zzso zzso Six of them underwent surgery after zzso The area (including zzso treated by zzso showed low to high intensity on zzso and low to zzso on zzso No enhancement was obtained on dynamic zzso zzso this area was supposed to be zzso zzso On zzso only tumor showed high intensity within the zzso area in 8 patients, and nearly uniform intensity was observed in 5 zzso zzso residual cell zzso were observed in the former, and nearly uniform zzso necrosis in the zzso The marginal part of the zzso area exhibited low intensity on zzso and high intensity on zzso Strong enhancement was obtained on dynamic zzso and zzso zzso tissue was zzso In the zzso zzso around the zzso area, a zzso zzso high intensity part was observed in 7 patients on zzso and that part was enhanced on dynamic zzso This finding was considered to reflect changes such as zzso zzso In terms of the capability of visualizing residual tumor after zzso zzso was superior to zzso Furthermore, a clear distinction was seen between the zzso area and zzso area on zzso and dynamic zzso Thus, zzso was useful in the determination of additional zzso
