The purpose of this study was to investigate the dependence of zzso ratio zzso on the dose and rate of zzso injection in magnetic resonance relative cerebral blood volume zzso zzso zzso maps for 35 normal volunteers were constructed from dynamic MR image sets acquired with zzso zzso imaging after intravenous injection of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at rates of 2 zzso and 5 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso ratios of gray to white matter were zzso zzso depended on dose zzso zzso zzso but was independent of injection rate zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios of gray to white matter were dose independent zzso zzso zzso and rate independent zzso zzso zzso The dependence of zzso on dose, but not injection rate, has practical implications in optimal protocol zzso The independence of zzso ratios supports the theory underlying the generation of zzso zzso
