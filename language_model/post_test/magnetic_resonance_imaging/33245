zzso stress can have long-lasting effects on zzso Animal models suggest that deficits in executive functioning could result from zzso within the zzso zzso We investigated this hypothesis in soldiers before and after deployment to Afghanistan and a control group using functional and diffusion zzso zzso Combat stress reduced zzso activity and integrity, which was associated to compromised sustained zzso zzso follow-up showed that the functional and structural changes had zzso within zzso zzso In contrast, combat stress induced a persistent reduction in functional connectivity between the zzso and prefrontal zzso These results demonstrate that combat stress has adverse effects on the human zzso circuit and suggests that these zzso are partially zzso
