The purpose of our study was to compare zzso MR imaging zzso with conventional dynamic zzso in terms of the assessment of small zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

In 24 patients with zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of advanced zzso a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to a comparative analysis of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso dynamic imaging, and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 400 and 800 zzso by two independent zzso 

A larger number of the zzso were detected and diagnosed as zzso zzso on zzso zzso 1, 121 zzso zzso 2, 117 zzso than on dynamic imaging zzso 1, 107 zzso zzso 2, 105 zzso zzso For the 81 smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to detect more zzso than dynamic imaging zzso 1, 68 zzso zzso 56 zzso zzso zzso 2, 65 zzso zzso 55 zzso zzso but there was no statistically significant difference between the two image sets for larger zzso zzso zzso 

Due to its higher detection rate of zzso zzso zzso could be considered complementary to dynamic zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso of zzso
