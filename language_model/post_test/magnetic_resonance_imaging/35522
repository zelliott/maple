To zzso assess bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cartilage in zzso zzso or anterior cruciate ligament zzso knees using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso 

Eight healthy controls and 30 patients with zzso and other injuries who showed zzso were scanned at zzso A zzso model was constructed to automatically calculate the volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was acquired in the zzso and surrounding bone zzso 

The mean zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso cartilage than that in surrounding cartilage in the lateral zzso of patients with zzso tears zzso zzso zzso zzso elevated water and zzso zzso and decreased saturated lipids were observed in zzso The volume of elevated water correlated with the volume of zzso Water content was significantly higher within zzso than that outside zzso The zzso index outside zzso was significantly higher in patients with zzso tears than that in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso mapping provide tools to zzso evaluate zzso in zzso and knee zzso This may allow us to better understand zzso and evolution of injuries and degenerative conditions of the zzso
