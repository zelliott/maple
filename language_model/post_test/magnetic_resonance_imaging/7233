Starting in zzso zzso were treated daily for 22 weeks with zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso or an equivalent volume of zzso One zzso of each goat was zzso zzso daily throughout treatment, the other twice zzso zzso differentiation was studied in biopsy samples obtained before treatment and after 3 and 22 weeks of treatment, by determination of zzso synthesis rates of milk constituents and measurement of zzso zzso zzso growth was measured using a zzso imaging technique zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso caused an immediate and sustained increase in milk yield of approximately zzso overall, whilst the zzso zzso zzso daily produced approximately zzso more than the control zzso zzso twice zzso The effects of the combined treatment were zzso but not zzso A synergistic effect of the combined treatment resulted in a significant improvement in zzso zzso A zzso effect of milking frequency on zzso zzso activities was evident only in zzso zzso at 3 weeks, but in both groups at 22 zzso zzso rates of zzso and zzso were increased at 3 weeks only by the combined zzso Thus zzso accelerated or zzso the zzso response to zzso daily zzso zzso zzso volume, estimated by zzso increased significantly during the first 12 weeks of zzso treatment and remained higher throughout the rest of the treatment zzso Cell number was estimated from zzso volume and DNA zzso this decreased significantly in the controls between weeks 1 and 22, but remained constant in the zzso zzso In nine of the ten zzso zzso volume and cell number increased in the zzso zzso zzso daily relative to the control zzso zzso twice daily during the course of the zzso Thus zzso zzso growth of the zzso zzso over and above that induced by the frequent zzso The absence of any zzso increase in zzso incorporation suggests that this growth consisted of cellular zzso rather than zzso
