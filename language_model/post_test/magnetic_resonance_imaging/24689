Fifteen percent to zzso of patients with zzso zzso require invasive zzso zzso monitoring zzso to precisely delineate the zzso zzso This zzso based on the recorded zzso zzso zzso signals occurs visually by the zzso and is therefore prone to human zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate whether effective connectivity analysis of zzso recorded zzso during zzso provides an objective method to zzso the zzso zzso 

In this study data were analyzed from eight patients who underwent zzso at zzso University Hospital in zzso All patients had a focal zzso onset and were zzso following zzso zzso The effective connectivity pattern was calculated during the first 20 s of zzso rhythmic zzso zzso The zzso which is reflective of the number of outgoing connections, was calculated for each zzso contact for every single seizure during these 20 zzso The seizure specific zzso were summed per patient to obtain the total zzso The zzso contact with the highest total zzso was considered indicative of zzso of the zzso zzso This result was compared to the conclusion of the visual analysis of the zzso and the zzso brain region segmented from zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In all eight patients the zzso contact with the highest total zzso was among the contacts identified by the zzso as the zzso zzso This zzso that we named zzso zzso always laid within the zzso brain zzso Furthermore, the zzso connectivity patterns were consistent over the majority of zzso 

In this study we demonstrated the feasibility of correctly zzso the zzso zone from zzso recordings by using effective connectivity analysis during the first 20 s of zzso rhythmic zzso zzso
