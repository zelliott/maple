With the development of various models of pulmonary disease, there is tremendous interest in quantitative regional assessment of pulmonary zzso While ventilation imaging has been addressed to a certain extent, zzso imaging for small animals has not kept zzso In humans and large animals zzso can be assessed using dynamic zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso injection of a zzso zzso contrast zzso But the method developed for the clinic cannot be translated directly to image the zzso due to the combined requirements of higher spatial and zzso zzso This work describes a novel image acquisition technique staggered over zzso zzso zzso injections of contrast agent using an automated zzso synchronized with image acquisition to achieve dynamic zzso contrast enhancement in the rat zzso This allows dynamic zzso imaging that can be used to zzso pulmonary zzso Further improvements are made in the spatial and zzso resolution by combining the multiple injection acquisition method with zzso zzso Imaging and zzso zzso reconstruction zzso The results demonstrate a simultaneous increase in spatial resolution zzso zzso and zzso resolution zzso zzso over previous methods, with a limited loss in zzso
