The two main problems of surgery for zzso zzso zzso are: first, the difficulty of accurately zzso the zzso in this deep zzso and second, the proximity to the internal zzso with the risk of permanent zzso zzso The author describes the use of zzso direct electrical zzso stimulation in the identification and preservation of the internal zzso combined with an zzso zzso system for the selection of the best surgical approach in a case of deep zzso 

A 33-year-old man was admitted to our institution with a history of three episodes of zzso left zzso in the last 12 zzso Neurological examination revealed a mild left zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso showed typical features of a right zzso zzso zzso To prevent another zzso event, surgery was performed via a right zzso zzso approach, using a zzso zzso method that allowed us to reach the zzso directly and direct zzso to detect the zzso zzso zzso The patient had a zzso worsening with complete recovery in 10 zzso Control zzso showed total zzso 

As described at the cortical level, the zzso direct zzso zzso seem also to represent an easy, safe, accurate, and reliable method of real-time functional identification of the internal capsule during surgery for zzso zzso zzso The combination with an zzso zzso system to accurately zzso the zzso zzso the risk of zzso zzso and seems to warrant an increase of the surgical indications in this zzso
