An extensive zzso literature on chronic pain demonstrates increased cerebral blood flow and metabolism consistent with increased zzso activity in the structures zzso the zzso zzso zzso some of these regions have been shown to zzso pain zzso It is the objective of this study to demonstrate the feasibility of using quantitative zzso zzso source zzso to reflect and to zzso activity in the pain zzso 

zzso closed resting zzso was recorded from 19 standardized scalp locations, in a pilot sample of five patients with chronic zzso pain, before and after pain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso source zzso was zzso zzso the zzso most probable source generators of zzso surface zzso in each zzso Sources identified in this way have been demonstrated to zzso with those identified by zzso zzso 

zzso sources demonstrated frequency specific increased zzso activity in the baseline high pain state in structures including the thalamus, zzso cortex, anterior and zzso zzso zzso and lateral prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso reduction of zzso in these regions was seen when pain was reduced zzso on zzso zzso 

The areas that were activated in the high pain state localized to the same regions reported by other zzso methods and with frequency zzso The frequency and regionally specific zzso may indicate distinctive patterns of zzso underlying the pain zzso Although in a small number of patients, this work suggests that zzso may be a useful tool in the exploration and zzso of the pain zzso in a clinical zzso
