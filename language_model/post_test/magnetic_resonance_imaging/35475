The objective of the study was to develop a model of the female pelvic floor to study zzso stretch during simulated zzso 

zzso resonance data from an zzso zzso were segmented into pelvic muscles and bones to create a simulation zzso zzso estimates of lateral and zzso zzso attachments were varied to estimate the impact on zzso zzso A 9 zzso sphere was passed through the zzso along the path of the zzso simulating zzso zzso response was interpreted at 4 positions of the sphere, simulating fetal head zzso The zzso was color mapped to display the stretch zzso 

A maximum stretch ratio of zzso to 1 was seen in the zzso zzso zzso stretch increased with increasing zzso of lateral zzso zzso 

Although zzso this work may help explain zzso data regarding the pelvic floor impact of a first zzso The models and simulation technique need zzso but they may help study the effect of labor parameters on the pelvic zzso
