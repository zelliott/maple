zzso band zzso zzso are bilateral and zzso ribbons of gray matter found in the central white matter between the zzso and the zzso surface, which comprises the less severe end of the zzso zzso spectrum of zzso zzso in zzso (also known as zzso ) have previously been described in females with zzso We have now identified zzso in either the zzso or zzso gene in three of 11 boys zzso demonstrating for the first time that zzso of either zzso or zzso can cause zzso or mixed zzso zzso in zzso All three changes detected are zzso zzso predicted to be of zzso zzso They include a zzso zzso in zzso 4 of zzso in a boy with zzso zzso a different zzso zzso in zzso 4 of zzso in a boy with mild zzso and in his mildly affected mother zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso 6 of zzso in a boy with zzso zzso The zzso zzso probably account for the less severe brain zzso although other patients with zzso zzso in the same zzso have had diffuse zzso zzso it appears likely that the effect of the specific zzso acid change on the protein determines the severity of the zzso with some zzso enabling residual protein function and allowing normal migration in a larger proportion of zzso However, we expect that zzso mosaic zzso of both zzso and zzso will also prove to be an important mechanism in causing zzso in zzso
