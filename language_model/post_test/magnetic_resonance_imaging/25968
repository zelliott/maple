A novel pulse sequence based on a segmented zzso scheme for measuring the zzso relaxation time zzso value of an zzso signal in an imaging context is zzso This pulse sequence is a hybrid version of the zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso These are also known as zzso zzso zzso The new sequence presented here collects multiple zzso rows at each time point during zzso recovery, rather than the entire zzso (as in a zzso zzso or just one row (as in a zzso zzso Thus, it reduces the scanning time without significant sacrifice of the small sampling time advantage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this approach does not require a zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that a single slice human brain zzso zzso map with a nominal zzso resolution of less than (1 zzso be obtained at 4 T in about 4 zzso Published 2000 zzso zzso
