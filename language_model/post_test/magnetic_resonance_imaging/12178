This study contains the fundamentals and the technique of the zzso application of an zzso contrast agent in connection with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso It also presents the resulting clinical relevance for knee joint zzso The significance of zzso zzso is linked above all to the central question of whether or not it is possible to depict the zzso cartilage, its surface and its thickness with the help of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for in zzso examinations of rabbit knee joint cartilage and human joint zzso The in zzso application was carried out in 73 zzso Apart from the metric evaluation and the assessment of the information content of the zzso image, the corresponding zzso sections were made in 20 knee zzso in order to compare the cartilage surface and the thickness of the cartilage with the results in the zzso zzso The optimum amount of contrast agent for zzso was determined, the zzso and clearance of the contrast agent from the cartilage were zzso and trace elements from the cartilage were also zzso The examination showed that the molecular structure of the contrast agent zzso does not prevent the zzso of the contrast agent into the zzso of the zzso zzso But this process is zzso Thus, 14 hours after the zzso application of the contrast agent no measurable traces of zzso could be zzso The zzso application of the contrast agent also made it possible to achieve a constant and zzso zzso of all joint zzso This affected mainly the surface of the zzso zzso The best imaging quality was achieved with zzso application of 30 to 40 zzso of a 2 zzso solution of zzso The technique used for the zzso application is the same as for the common procedures of knee joint zzso The clinical importance of zzso zzso lies in the fact that a very detailed assessment can be made for therapy planning and zzso in the possibility to provide the surgeon with answers to specific questions concerning the zzso Examples are the extent and location of zzso in a patient and the question whether a cartilage fracture has already occurred in zzso zzso or zzso The evaluation of cartilage together with the possibility to assess all other structures in the knee joint is a special feature of zzso zzso The high sensitivity and specificity of this method makes it superior to the examination without contrast agent and comparable to diagnostic zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
