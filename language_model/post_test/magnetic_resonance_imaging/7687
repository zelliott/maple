Complex zzso cardiac surgery is associated with cerebral zzso In particular, zzso arch repair, requiring either deep zzso circulatory arrest zzso or zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso a high risk of zzso zzso It is unknown whether zzso results in less cerebral injury than zzso 

zzso zzso with an zzso arch obstruction presenting for zzso or zzso repair were zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso and 1 week after surgery, magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 36 patients (1 patient died during the hospital zzso The presence of new zzso cerebral injury was zzso and results were entered into a sequential analysis, which allows for immediate data zzso After the 36th patient, it was clear that there was no difference between zzso and zzso in terms of new cerebral zzso zzso 50% of patients had evidence of cerebral zzso zzso 14 of 18 zzso patients zzso had new injury versus 13 of 18 zzso patients zzso zzso White matter injury was the most common type of injury in both groups, but central zzso occurred exclusively after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Early motor and cognitive outcomes at 24 months were assessed and were similar between groups zzso and zzso zzso Additional analysis revealed lower zzso zzso zzso as a risk factor for new white matter injury zzso 

In this group of zzso undergoing complex cardiac surgery, we were unable to demonstrate a difference in the zzso of zzso cerebral injury after zzso compared with zzso Both techniques resulted in a high zzso of new white matter injury, with central zzso occurring exclusively after zzso
