We studied auditory zzso zzso zzso in correlation with zzso auditory verbal learning test zzso in an zzso patient with a left zzso lobe zzso On the zzso the number of words recalled was limited to immediate memory capacity zzso zzso throughout five trials, and recall after interference was remarkably zzso In the zzso the zzso component was zzso zzso but no zzso component was zzso Present findings suggest that these two zzso components may be associated with independent processes and support the view that the zzso may index a neural process involved in transfer of information from immediate memory to long-term zzso
