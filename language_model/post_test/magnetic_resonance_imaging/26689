zzso is a new technique for evaluating diffuse zzso injury associated with zzso zzso The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of cerebral zzso in amateur zzso compared with zzso by using zzso and to evaluate the sensitivity of zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We performed zzso MR imaging with a zzso scanner in 21 amateur zzso and 21 control zzso The study protocol included conventional MR images, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The proportions of zzso and controls having zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and were compared by using the zzso test of zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso zzso was assessed by using the zzso rank sum zzso The association between the categories was tested by using the Fisher exact zzso 

Using zzso zzso were found in 2 zzso of 21 zzso The zzso were not visible on zzso zzso or zzso zzso The proportion of subjects with zzso did not differ significantly between the zzso and control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, P zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso and zzso was significantly higher in the zzso than in the control zzso 

More zzso were detected in amateur zzso than in controls, but this difference was not statistically zzso
