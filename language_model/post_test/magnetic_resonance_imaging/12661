zzso zzso zzso is a sudden unilateral zzso failure zzso with a variable zzso zzso zzso often zzso and it is largely unknown why patients with the same degree of zzso show different functional zzso As the peripheral zzso deficit alone does not seem to determine functional recovery, it was the aim of this study to zzso whether structural zzso brain changes zzso contribute to central zzso compensation, and zzso account for the zzso of clinical recovery in zzso zzso global zzso volume zzso changes in 15 zzso patients were compared with zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso which may be related to functional disability scores, were zzso Patients were examined with zzso tests and clinical scores to assess zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed zzso increase in patients' zzso zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso lobe zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso areas in the middle zzso area zzso zzso decrease was found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso with improving clinically assessed zzso deficits, and zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with improving zzso zzso zzso For the first time, these data suggest structural cortical plasticity in zzso zzso areas in zzso that are related to clinical zzso function and zzso As increase of zzso was related to an improvement of zzso function, structural zzso may be related to central zzso zzso
