An ideal screening test is zzso zzso and has a high specificity and zzso zzso zzso response testing has been the usual screening test for the diagnosis of zzso zzso although its accuracy in diagnosing small zzso zzso has caused its effectiveness as a screening test to be zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso with zzso has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of zzso zzso Its use as a screening test for zzso zzso has been limited due to its high zzso Fast spin echo zzso is a technique that provides zzso images with excellent contrast between fluid and neural structures, and its cost is a fraction of a zzso zzso zzso This study compares the accuracy of fast spin echo zzso to zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

Twenty-five patients zzso zzso in whom there was a clinical suspicion of zzso zzso were scanned with both zzso All studies were read independently and scored as positive, negative, or zzso 

There were 11 true zzso and 39 true zzso There were no false zzso or zzso resulting in a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

Fast spin echo zzso appears to be an excellent choice as a screening test for zzso zzso due to its low cost, zzso and high sensitivity and zzso
