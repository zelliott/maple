To determine the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso measures of spinal zzso involvement and brain involvement and their relationships to disability in a small cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso 

Although it is known that cervical spinal zzso zzso zzso with disability in zzso it is unknown whether it is the most important zzso when compared to other regions of the central nervous system zzso Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent brain and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso 

zzso zzso of the whole brain and whole spinal zzso was obtained in 21 patients with zzso including 18 with zzso one with secondary progressive, one with primary progressive, and one with a clinically isolated zzso Brain global gray and white matter volumes were segmented with zzso zzso zzso zzso Spinal zzso zzso volume was segmented in whole by a zzso method with bins assigned to either the cervical or zzso zzso All zzso volumes were zzso by the zzso zzso Brain and zzso zzso zzso zzso were segmented using a zzso edge finding zzso 

Among all zzso measures, only upper cervical spinal zzso volume significantly correlated with Expanded zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso The brain zzso relationships between whole or regional spinal zzso volume or zzso and gray matter, white matter, or whole brain volume or whole brain zzso were generally weak and all zzso 

In this preliminary study of mildly disabled, treated zzso patients, cervical spinal zzso zzso most strongly zzso with physical disability in zzso when accounting for a wide range of other zzso measures of zzso and zzso including zzso or whole spinal zzso volume, and cerebral gray, white or whole brain zzso The weak relationship between spinal zzso and brain zzso and zzso may suggest that they progress rather independently in patients with zzso
