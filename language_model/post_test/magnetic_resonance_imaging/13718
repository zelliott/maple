zzso imaging with phase contrast zzso zzso is a zzso tool for quantitative blood flow measurement in zzso A shortcoming of conventional PC imaging is the reduction in zzso resolution as compared to the corresponding magnitude zzso For the measurement of zzso in a single direction, the zzso resolution is zzso because one must acquire two zzso zzso images for every PC image frame to subtract out zzso image phase zzso In this study, a high zzso resolution PC technique which retains both the spatial resolution and zzso length of conventional magnitude imaging is zzso Improvement by a factor of 2 in the zzso resolution was achieved by acquiring the zzso zzso images in separate zzso rather than zzso within a single zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso was incorporated into the PC experiment to acquire more views per unit time than is possible with the single zzso zzso A total improvement in zzso resolution by approximately 5 times over conventional PC imaging was zzso A complete set of images containing zzso data in all three directions was acquired in four zzso with a zzso resolution of zzso zzso and an zzso spatial resolution of 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso
