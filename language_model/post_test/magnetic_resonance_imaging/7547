Previous zzso and clinical studies have reported gender differences in prevalence and clinical features of generalized anxiety disorder zzso Such gender differences in clinical zzso suggest that the underlying neural zzso of zzso could also be different in males and zzso This study aimed to explore the possible gender effect on gray matter volumes in adolescents with zzso 

Twenty-six adolescent zzso patients and 25 healthy controls participated and underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate gray matter zzso 

Our study revealed a significant diagnosis main effect in the right zzso with larger gray matter volumes in zzso patients compared to healthy controls, and a significant gender main effect in the left zzso zzso cortex, with larger gray matter volumes in males compared to zzso No zzso interaction effect was found in this zzso 

The relatively small sample size in this study might result in a lack of power to demonstrate gender effects on brain structure in zzso 

The results suggested that there are differences in gray matter volumes between males and zzso but gray matter volumes in zzso are not influenced by zzso
