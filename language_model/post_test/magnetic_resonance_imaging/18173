Few examined the contribution of neural and muscular deficits to weakness in the same stroke zzso We determined zzso voluntary contraction zzso and 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and muscle volume using magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso in 7 chronic stroke subjects zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 50 zzso zzso were also done in 7 control subjects zzso zzso without zzso The zzso zzso was smaller in the zzso than zzso limb zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and was associated with deficits in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percentage was not significantly different between zzso Muscle volume, 50 zzso torque, and specific zzso zzso zzso zzso were also not different between zzso The concept that zzso is commonplace after stroke is not supported by the zzso Our findings indicate that zzso weakness in mobile stroke survivors is not explained by zzso or reduced zzso generating capacity suggesting an important role for central zzso
