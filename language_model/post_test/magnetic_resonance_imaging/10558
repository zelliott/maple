zzso zzso have been shown to represent task zzso Here we show the mechanisms by which the zzso activity in the prefrontal zzso influences subsequent cognitive performance based on that zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the zzso zzso zzso with zzso areas differently depending on whether subjects were going to perform a zzso or semantic zzso Moreover, we found that the sustained zzso activity in this region predicted the activity that could be recorded in the zzso areas during the performance, as well as the speed of that zzso We argue that the prefrontal set activity does not reflect simple maintenance of the task rules but the process of implementing the rule for subsequent cognitive performance and that this is done through zzso interactions with areas involved in execution of the zzso
