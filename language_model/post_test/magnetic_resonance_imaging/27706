Previous zzso studies have shown that working memory load has marked effects on regional neural zzso However, the mechanism through which working memory load zzso brain connectivity is still zzso In this study, this issue was addressed using dynamic zzso modeling zzso based on functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso normal healthy subjects were scanned while they performed a working memory task with variable memory load, as zzso by two levels of memory delay and three levels of zzso load zzso of digits presented in each visual zzso Eight regions of interest, zzso bilateral middle frontal zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were chosen for zzso zzso Analysis of the behavioral data during the zzso scan revealed that accuracy decreased as zzso load zzso zzso zzso on model structure indicated that a zzso zzso in which memory delay was the driving input to bilateral zzso and in which zzso load modulated several zzso connections was the optimal zzso Analysis of model parameters showed that higher zzso load enhanced connection from L zzso to L zzso and lower zzso load inhibited connection from R zzso to L zzso These findings suggest that working memory load zzso brain connectivity in a zzso network, and may reflect altered zzso zzso zzso information processing or error monitoring, with the change in working memory zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso 2011 zzso zzso zzso
