zzso of the cortical anomalies underpinning zzso disorder zzso can powerfully inform zzso zzso We previously found that zzso is characterized by a delayed maturation of prefrontal cortical zzso We now ask if this extends to the maturation of cortical surface area and zzso 

Two hundred zzso children with zzso and 231 typically developing children participated in the study, with zzso zzso magnetic resonance images acquired zzso We defined the zzso zzso of cortical surfaces and zzso and the sequence of cortical zzso as zzso by the age at which each cortical zzso attained its peak surface zzso 

In both groups, the maturation of cortical surface area progressed in zzso waves, both lateral zzso at the central zzso and zzso regions, sweeping toward the mid and superior frontal zzso and zzso zzso down the zzso prefrontal cortex, toward the zzso zzso However, the surface area zzso trajectory was delayed in zzso For the right prefrontal cortex, the median age by which 50% of cortical zzso attained peak area was zzso years zzso zzso zzso in zzso significantly later than in typically developing group at zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso test zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso but less zzso delay was found in the left zzso zzso There were no such diagnostic differences in the zzso zzso of cortical zzso 

The zzso delay in cortical thickness and surface area direct attention away from processes that selectively affect one cortical component toward mechanisms controlling the maturation of multiple cortical zzso
