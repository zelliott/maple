zzso zzso zzso zzso allows for a minimally invasive surgical zzso Current methods used for zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso and occasionally magnetic resonance imaging zzso In cases in which an zzso is not localized after a zzso zzso the surgeon must perform a zzso zzso zzso selective zzso sampling zzso has been described as a safe and clinically effective method to zzso a zzso zzso after failed zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso as a primary zzso technique in cases where conventional zzso techniques have zzso 

Fourteen patients with zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Eight patients underwent zzso prior to surgery and six patients underwent a zzso neck exploration without zzso zzso The two groups were assessed for accuracy of the zzso in zzso the zzso operative time, length of zzso and zzso 

All of the patients in the study underwent successful uncomplicated surgical zzso The zzso proved accurate in preoperatively zzso the zzso in 7 of 8 patients and allowed for a minimally invasive approach in zzso of zzso The mean operative time was 33 minutes for the zzso group and 67 minutes in the zzso zzso None of the patients in either group experienced procedural zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso may represent a safe and effective method of preoperatively zzso the zzso zzso zzso In cases where conventional zzso techniques fail to zzso an zzso zzso may zzso the need for a zzso zzso
