zzso were carried out to determine the ability of magnetic resonance systems to assess change in relaxation times following the induction of experimental brain zzso and subsequent administration of zzso zzso Nine small zzso dogs were used for these zzso zzso hours after producing a cold zzso magnetic resonance zzso studies were performed and zzso data were zzso Thirty zzso after beginning the administration of zzso serum zzso pressure was raised 88 zzso After administering zzso a small reduction in long spin echo images was observed in the zzso high intensity zzso The zzso and zzso values appeared to be decreased from 30 zzso after zzso zzso This decrease continued until the period of observation zzso zzso significant changes in the zzso values, especially in the white matter of the opposite side, were zzso The changes in zzso were generally not statistically zzso We conclude that the changes in water content of the zzso brain following the administration of zzso can be detected by magnetic resonance systems, that these changes become appreciable 30 zzso after administration of zzso and continue at least two more hours, and that the changes in zzso were larger than those in zzso
