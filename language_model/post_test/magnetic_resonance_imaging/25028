The objective of this study was to compare the zzso findings of zzso in patients diagnosed with zzso with those of the healthy controls, and to evaluate the correlation between the zzso differences and the zzso findings in the patient zzso This study involved 55 zzso 30 of which were clinically and zzso diagnosed with zzso and 25 healthy zzso These 55 zzso were evaluated zzso and in terms of median nerve diameter, ratio of median nerve diameter at zzso bone level to zzso zzso joint level, the zzso zzso bulging ratio and the median nerve intensity by zzso When the patient group, which were clinically and zzso diagnosed with CTS, and the healthy control group were zzso a significant difference zzso zzso zzso was observed between the two in terms of median nerve diameters (at zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso joint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio of median nerve diameter at zzso bone level to zzso zzso joint level zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso their zzso zzso bulging ratios zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their median nerve zzso In the patient group, no significant correlation between zzso and the zzso findings was found zzso zzso zzso According to the data obtained from the study, we believe that the zzso examination of structural changes that occur in the zzso tunnel, neighboring structures and the median nerve would be useful in the diagnosis of CTS, especially in cases with suspected clinical and zzso zzso
