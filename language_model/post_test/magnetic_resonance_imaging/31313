zzso disruption of the zzso zzso with opening of the zzso barrier zzso because of zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso injury after zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks the early disruption of the zzso but the long-term consequences of short-term zzso zzso are not zzso Recently, a method to zzso zzso zzso by zzso methods was zzso which provides a way to study both early disruption of the zzso and long-term effects on recovery in the same zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine both the usefulness of the zzso resonance imaging zzso method for treatment studies and the long-term effects on zzso zzso resonance imaging studies were performed in control zzso and zzso zzso groups on a dedicated zzso zzso zzso Adult zzso underwent a zzso middle cerebral artery zzso followed by an zzso study after 3 h of zzso which consisted of zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, a rapid zzso mapping protocol was also implemented to acquire one zzso acid baseline data set followed by zzso data sets at zzso intervals for 45 zzso The same animal was zzso again at 48 h for zzso size zzso Data was zzso zzso to generate apparent diffusion zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso at 3 zzso but failed to reduce zzso size at 48 zzso zzso studies showed impairment in recovery in treated zzso zzso resonance imaging allowed for the monitoring of multiple parameters in the same zzso Our studies showed that zzso was an excellent inhibitor of the zzso zzso However, results show that zzso may be responsible for significant deterioration in zzso status of treated zzso Although these preliminary results suggest that zzso is useful in reducing early zzso leakage zzso to zzso injury in stroke, further studies will be needed to determine whether the later zzso effects can be eliminated by shorter time course of drug zzso
