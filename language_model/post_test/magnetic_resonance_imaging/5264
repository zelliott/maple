To zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance scanners for the zzso of the concentration of iron in the zzso 

We analyzed zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance scanners using a phantom with four tubes containing different zzso of iron zzso zzso and one tube without zzso The phantom represented two typical zzso one with moderate iron overload and one with high iron zzso We measured the signal intensity ratio between each zzso tube and the tube without zzso then we calculated the theoretical levels of iron concentration in each scanner according to the model for the two levels of zzso We compared the results of each scanner with those of the reference scanner in which the model and the phantom had been zzso and we calculated the percentage of difference between the two zzso 

The mean difference in the ratios compared to the reference center was zzso zzso The mean concentration of iron was 71 zzso zzso for moderate overload and 193 zzso zzso for high zzso The mean difference was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In two zzso we applied a correction factor so that the difference was below zzso in all zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso zzso scanners for the concentration of iron in the liver and achieved zzso less than zzso
