zzso wrist postures and pinch grip use have been linked to the development of zzso tunnel syndrome and are likely related to the size and shape of the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso zzso tunnel dimensions with changes in wrist posture and pinch zzso 

Eight healthy volunteers (4 male, 4 zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging of their dominant zzso under seven conditions which zzso 30 degrees wrist extension, neutral and 30 degrees zzso (with and without a 10 N pinch zzso and a fist with a neutral zzso zzso area of the zzso tunnel and its contents were calculated at zzso increments along the length of the tunnel and integrated to calculate zzso zzso were calculated between the contents of the tunnel to the tunnel itself for area and zzso 

The use of a correction factor significantly reduced volume and zzso zzso tunnel area in zzso and extended zzso zzso tunnel areas were largest in neutral and smallest at the zzso end with wrist zzso An extended wrist resulted in the smallest zzso tunnel and content volumes as well as the smallest zzso tunnel content volume to zzso tunnel volume zzso While men had significantly larger areas and volumes than women for both the zzso tunnel and it zzso there were no differences in ratios between the contents and tunnel zzso 

A simple correction factor for zzso magnetic resonance images proved useful in relating volume changes to known pressure changes within the zzso zzso More inclusive and detailed evaluation of the zzso tunnel and its contents is required to fully understand mechanisms for median nerve zzso in the zzso zzso
