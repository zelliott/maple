zzso is a common zzso zzso disease characterized by the presence of zzso zzso within the zzso On zzso magnetic resonance zzso images, typical zzso appears as an zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso However, various zzso or zzso states such as amount of functional zzso zzso phase of the zzso cycle, zzso hormonal zzso and zzso hormonal stimulation may affect the MR imaging appearance of zzso and may result in a zzso zzso zzso MR imaging techniques used in diagnosis of zzso include zzso imaging, zzso imaging, hydrogen 1 MR zzso zzso MR imaging, and high-resolution MR imaging at 3 zzso zzso zzso that show high signal intensity relative to the outer zzso on zzso images mimic zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso In these cases, a relatively high apparent diffusion zzso at zzso imaging and a low zzso peak at MR zzso are suggestive of a benign zzso Small zzso zzso suggestive of an zzso zzso are well demonstrated as signal voids at zzso zzso zzso MR imaging is useful in zzso transient zzso contraction from focal zzso zzso MR imaging at 3 T demonstrates zzso detailed structures and may improve diagnostic accuracy in zzso zzso from its zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso
