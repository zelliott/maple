zzso reorganization of the human brain after an arm zzso has been documented in several zzso but as far as we know, there has been no report on amputees with skilled foot movement zzso To further assess the power of functional reorganization of the brain after an zzso we investigated two bilateral zzso amputees who were professional sculptors and painters with their zzso Performance tests showed that they possessed high foot movement zzso zzso zzso data indicated that toe tapping of the amputees not only activated the classical foot primary motor cortex, but also activated the hand zzso In the zzso zzso the central zzso of both amputees kept their characteristic zzso Our study suggests that there is a remarkable power of neural plasticity in the motor cortex, and the maturation of the zzso develops in response to daily zzso The possible mechanisms of the reorganization are tentatively zzso
