It is demonstrated, on the grounds of simulations, how zzso degrees zzso zzso can be used for slice selection in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso It is shown that the usual zzso reversal procedure can be omitted if the selective 90 degrees pulse normally used is replaced by a zzso zzso degrees pulse with a zzso zzso zzso profile, and some of the properties which are specific to this type of pulse are zzso
