zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and spectral editing methods, such as zzso allow researchers to investigate zzso and neurotransmitter zzso zzso Here we address the zzso of zzso MRS for the investigation of zzso zzso in the zzso brain, in three zzso zzso visual and auditory zzso An initial zzso study (5 subjects, 5 repeated measures separated by zzso on zzso indicated no significant effect of reference zzso choice on zzso zzso zzso zzso of variation for zzso zzso and zzso were all of the order of zzso Based on these findings, we investigated zzso zzso ratios zzso in a group of zzso children with zzso spectrum disorder zzso and zzso typically developing children zzso for Motor, zzso and Visual regions of interest zzso Linear zzso analysis of gray matter zzso volume changes zzso to occur with zzso revealed a significant decrease of zzso volume with Age for Motor zzso zzso and Visual zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso changes with Age revealed a marginally significant change for the Motor zzso only zzso zzso zzso analyses were thus conducted for each zzso separately using Age and zzso volume as zzso No group differences in zzso were observed for the Visual zzso between TD zzso zzso zzso However, the Motor and zzso zzso showed significantly reduced zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso in zzso from the Motor zzso was approximately zzso and zzso zzso was approximately zzso Our novel findings support the model of regional differences in zzso in the zzso brain, primarily in zzso and to a lesser extent Motor but not Visual zzso
