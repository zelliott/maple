Eight children with zzso circulation zzso and zzso had conventional zzso MR and MR zzso of the head and zzso Six patients had conventional zzso 

Six patients had zzso of zzso or zzso artery flow void on zzso zzso MR zzso showed all six cases of zzso proved zzso dissection or zzso despite overestimating the extent of zzso zzso in two zzso In two patients the zzso peripheral branch zzso shown at zzso was correctly predicted on screening MR zzso 

zzso circulation zzso in children is usually secondary to traumatic injury to the zzso zzso MR and MR zzso zzso show zzso flow disturbances and compare favorably with zzso in documenting dissection or zzso of the zzso zzso MR zzso may zzso the need for invasive zzso in these children at diagnosis and during follow-up of zzso zzso
