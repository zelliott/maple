We tested our ability to approximate the dose zzso zzso zzso (four zzso and distribution of zzso zzso zzso for prostate cancer with zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso We also report early clinical observations of zzso zzso zzso 

Ten patients were treated with zzso For each zzso zzso plan, an zzso plan was designed using common zzso sets and simulated zzso zzso Planning target volume coverage, zzso dose zzso and zzso zzso and zzso exposure were zzso 

Planning target volume coverage by the prescription dose was similar for zzso zzso and zzso plans, whereas percent of volume of interest receiving zzso of prescribed radiation dose zzso and zzso values were higher for zzso reflecting higher doses near zzso source dwell zzso zzso dose comparisons were lower for zzso zzso in 9 of 10 cases, suggesting that zzso zzso may more effectively limit zzso zzso zzso maximum point doses were higher with zzso but zzso dose zzso beyond the maximum dose region was more rapid with zzso zzso zzso wall doses were similar, but zzso zzso created sharper zzso dose zzso beyond the maximum dose zzso Second zzso zzso plans, constructed by zzso zzso radiation dose received by point of maximum exposure of volume of interest to the zzso plan, significantly increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso median zzso zzso levels decreased zzso from zzso Acute toxicity was primarily zzso and returned to baseline by 2 zzso Acute zzso morbidity was minimal and zzso 

It is possible to construct zzso zzso plans that closely zzso zzso zzso and deliver the plans zzso
