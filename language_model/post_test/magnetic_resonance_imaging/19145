The aim was to analyze serum zzso of zzso in the zzso elderly to zzso some biological markers related to zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso type zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso and controls zzso without zzso were compared among the three groups zzso zzso zzso and 15 correlation zzso among the 6 measured items of zzso were zzso 

zzso levels of zzso zzso were significantly lower in zzso group compared with zzso or C zzso zzso levels of zzso B, zzso and E were significantly lower in zzso group compared with zzso group, but not with C zzso zzso of correlations among the items of zzso revealed high significant correlations between zzso E and/or zzso zzso and other items in zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso such as zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso
