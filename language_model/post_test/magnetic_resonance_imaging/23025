Conventional zzso of osteogenesis in zzso zzso are destructive to living cells and incapable to provide three-dimensional zzso In the present study, zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was used to evaluate zzso differentiation in zzso in human zzso stem zzso zzso zzso The zzso were prepared by seeding the cells zzso on 4 zzso 4 zzso 4 zzso gelatin sponge cubes and subsequently exposing them to zzso differentiation or basic zzso During the zzso experiment, alkaline zzso zzso activity and calcium content of differentiated zzso were significantly increased compared to the basic medium zzso The zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso of differentiated zzso were significantly lower than those of the control group at each time point zzso zzso zzso The MR parameters of zzso were significantly correlated to their zzso activities zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and calcium content zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso MR zzso can be a promising tool for zzso assessment of zzso differentiation and to provide three-dimensional information about zzso zzso
