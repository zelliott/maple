The present study investigated the neural zzso of the processing of abstract zzso zzso zzso An extensive body of literature has investigated concrete versus abstract nouns but little is known about how abstract zzso are zzso Spanish abstract zzso including emotion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared to concrete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that abstract zzso zzso stronger activity in regions previously associated with semantic retrieval such as inferior zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso regions, and that concrete and abstract zzso networks zzso to that of zzso were partially zzso with concrete zzso zzso more zzso activity in these zzso In contrast to previous studies investigating zzso zzso strongly engage both left and right inferior frontal zzso zzso as previously found, that right prefrontal zzso aids difficult semantic zzso Together with previous evidence demonstrating zzso conceptual roles for the active regions as well as experiential content for abstract word zzso our results suggest that abstract zzso impose greater demands on semantic retrieval or property integration, and are less consistent with the view that abstract words recruit zzso regions because they activate verbal codes or context, as claimed by proponents of the zzso zzso Moreover, our results are consistent with distributed accounts of semantic memory because distributed networks may coexist with varying retrieval zzso
