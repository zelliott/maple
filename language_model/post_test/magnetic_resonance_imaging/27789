Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease, resulting from deterioration of the zzso zzso which in turn leads to a decrease of zzso levels in the zzso zzso the syndrome is characterized by motor zzso that are treated by the oral administration of zzso However, this treatment typically loses efficacy over time and therefore new treatments that procure a steady long term supplement of zzso are zzso Here we tested the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso treated primates own zzso The zzso whose expression of zzso zzso was controlled by a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso promoter, was injected into zzso treated zzso brains using zzso as a delivery zzso Monkeys were tested before and after zzso administration, and after gene therapy treatment on the zzso behavioral zzso zzso showed both zzso expression and significant behavioral improvements in the hallway task after the zzso zzso zzso The behavioral recovery observed in the primates whose zzso expressed rat zzso is a first step that warrant further studies using zzso zzso as a good cell lineage to express therapeutic zzso
