We measured and compared left zzso mass in 20 patients by zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and contrast left zzso zzso Left zzso mass was calculated by zzso and zzso in two ways: zzso excluding zzso muscles and zzso zzso zzso and zzso including zzso muscles and zzso zzso mass + zzso by zzso zzso Left zzso mass excluding zzso muscles and zzso zzso zzso in zzso was calculated by zzso method by zzso zzso zzso mass was significantly larger in zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso mass was significantly larger in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso there was no significant difference in zzso mass + zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed good correlation of zzso in both zzso and zzso We therefore conclude that left zzso mass is best measured by including zzso muscles and zzso by zzso method in zzso or zzso
