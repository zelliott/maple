Recent zzso imaging zzso zzso have focused on zzso zzso capable of imaging the vessel wall of a patent zzso These designs suffer from the presence of signal zzso and the inability to image in front of a device when it is oriented along the main zzso zzso This is of particular importance when a device is being zzso through an zzso zzso To address these limitations we propose a new zzso zzso design consisting of two independent zzso zzso located at the zzso zzso The two coils are oriented in such a way that signal zzso are eliminated and imaging is possible in planes located directly in front of the zzso Complete characterization of the spatial zzso ratio zzso distribution of the design is zzso The zzso zzso was zzso on a zzso guide zzso and its use is demonstrated in zzso and in zzso
