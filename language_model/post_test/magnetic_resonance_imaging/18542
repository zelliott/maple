The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between variation of the zzso artery zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso A total of 206 patients were examined using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso MR zzso zzso of the zzso Of these, 54 patients had zzso zzso zzso symptomatic and 31 zzso and the majority of them were located in the zzso zzso The sites of dominant zzso in the zzso were right in 18 cases, left in 8 cases, and bilateral in 28 zzso The number of patients with VA asymmetry (the ratio of internal diameters zzso or more) were 89 zzso Of these, 67 patients had small zzso VA of right side, and 22 of left zzso Among the 117 patients with normal VA pattern, 19 zzso had zzso while among the 89 patients with VA zzso 35 zzso had zzso The patients with small zzso VA of right side significantly had zzso in the same side of the zzso The results of this study suggest that VA asymmetry is considered to be one of the risk factors of zzso zzso and that zzso can be useful in the examination of the cerebral artery as a valuable and zzso screening zzso
