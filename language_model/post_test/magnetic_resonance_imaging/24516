zzso changes in knee zzso may substantially alter cartilage contact patterns and moment generating capacities of soft zzso The objective of this study was to use dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure the influence of the timing of zzso loading on in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso changes in knee zzso would alter both the finite zzso axis of the zzso joint and the moment arm of the zzso zzso Eight healthy young adults were positioned zzso in a zzso device that could impose either elastic or zzso loads on the lower leg in response to zzso knee zzso The elastic loading condition induced concentric zzso zzso with knee extension, while an zzso loading condition induced eccentric zzso zzso with knee zzso Peak internal knee extension moments ranged from 23 to 33 N zzso which is comparable to zzso seen in normal zzso We found that anterior zzso translation, superior zzso zzso and anterior zzso translation were reduced by an average of zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso loading coincided with knee zzso rather than knee zzso These zzso variations induced a zzso shift in the finite zzso axis of the zzso joint and a reduction in the zzso zzso moment zzso We conclude that it may be important to consider such zzso changes in knee zzso when using models to ascertain soft tissue and cartilage loading during functional tasks such as zzso
