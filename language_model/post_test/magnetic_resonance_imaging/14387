The volume of the zzso zzso was determined from magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Since there are many conditions in which the zzso zzso become enlarged such as Alzheimer's disease and zzso accurate measurement of the zzso provides a valuable and safe means of aiding the diagnosis of such conditions and also provides important follow-up information in affected zzso The objective was pursued in a three phase zzso This paper presents the data obtained from the first zzso This first phase demonstrated the possibility of measuring fluid filled spaces by zzso in three phantom preparations zzso zzso and large zzso The results were compared with those obtained from computerized zzso zzso scans of the same zzso These zzso calculations were done with the aid of a zzso 9,000 digital zzso programmed to compensate for the scale factor and slice thickness of the zzso The phantom study showed that the results obtained from the zzso scans were better than those obtained from the CT scans in measuring the volume of zzso cavities zzso in gelatin zzso The average percent difference between volumes obtained by an imaging procedure compared to the actual volume as determined by water displacement was zzso for CT scanning and a more impressive zzso for zzso
