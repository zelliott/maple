This study aimed to investigate if treatment response could zzso be related to inflammatory or zzso pathology as measured by plasma surrogate zzso 

In this zzso zzso study 30 multiple sclerosis zzso patients with zzso disease were treated with intramuscular zzso or subcutaneous zzso zzso and zzso were defined according to clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso The control group consisted of 14 healthy zzso Plasma levels of surrogate markers for inflammation zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso damage zzso were measured using standard zzso 

There were 11 zzso and 19 zzso to zzso zzso Median zzso levels were elevated in a higher proportion of treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso exact zzso and controls zzso 2 zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso were found to be more frequently elevated in zzso zzso 39 zzso compared to healthy controls zzso 37 zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso were more frequently elevated in zzso zzso 300 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 500 zzso P zzso zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso who had surrogate marker supported evidence for zzso zzso responded more frequently to treatment with zzso
