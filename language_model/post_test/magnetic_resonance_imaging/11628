Our ability to treat zzso zzso has improved zzso The degree of collapse and bone loss can be accurately assessed in waist fractures using zzso images on CT zzso These zzso require reduction and bone zzso to re-establish the normal geometry of the zzso zzso resonance imaging helps evaluate whether or not avascular necrosis is present in the zzso zzso Because of the poor prognosis of conventional bone zzso a zzso bone graft is recommended as the primary treatment when AVN is zzso The zzso collapse of the zzso zzso is best corrected with a zzso approach and the zzso pole zzso is best approached using a zzso zzso Nearly all zzso pole zzso require a zzso bone graft and all acute zzso pole fractures require open reduction and internal zzso Using specially designed zzso screws, the zzso can be stabilized accurately to decrease the time to resolution of the zzso and minimize the amount of time in a zzso zzso fixation requires that the screw fixation target the central portion of the zzso regardless of the type of screw design zzso Using these techniques, the hand surgeon should be able to provide a reasonable prognosis for patients presenting with a zzso zzso and the treatment should result in functional range of motion, grip strength, and relief of zzso
