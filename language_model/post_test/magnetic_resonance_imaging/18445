To investigate the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso 51 patients with zzso were evaluated by zzso examinations and zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso muscles zzso was measured by zzso zzso Signal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso were measured by short inversion time inversion recovery zzso image and expressed as a ratio by comparison to the signal intensity of cerebral zzso zzso zzso signal intensity zzso zzso enlargement of one or more zzso was observed in zzso of patients with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso was significantly increased compared with control values zzso zzso 16; zzso zzso zzso zzso test, p zzso zzso zzso of zzso tended to be greater than that in the control group, although the difference was not zzso There was a significant positive correlation between thickness of zzso and severity of zzso assessed as an zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso of neither zzso nor zzso correlated with the severity of the eye zzso To investigate whether zzso findings could predict the outcome of zzso pulse therapy, we studied 23 patients with zzso who received this zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the 12 patients giving favorable responses were significantly greater than those in the 11 patients without good response zzso test, p zzso zzso On the other hand, the thickness of eye muscles did not correlate with the outcome of treatment except for that of zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso of zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso suggesting possible similar zzso processes in these zzso in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
