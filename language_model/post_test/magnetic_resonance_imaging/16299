The zzso obtained with zzso zzso CT zzso for coronary artery evaluation can be used to calculate important left zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso parameters derived by new, commercially available, fully automated software for zzso zzso zzso Siemens, zzso to cardiac magnetic resonance zzso as a reference zzso Twenty patients underwent zzso after completing a clinically indicated zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso stroke volume zzso and zzso mass zzso for zzso were obtained using automated software and were compared to zzso zzso with zzso muscles zzso included in, or excluded from, the blood zzso The zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso method were used to determine agreement between zzso When zzso were included in the blood pool, the correlation was excellent for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso were excluded from zzso correlation was still very good for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values for zzso and zzso showed a good correlation compared to both zzso zzso When zzso were included, the correlation was good for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso when they were zzso the correlation was less robust but still significant for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso and zzso obtained by zzso using simple, automated software correlated very well with zzso zzso and zzso showed good zzso zzso analysis of zzso parameters by zzso can be reliably zzso for clinical zzso
