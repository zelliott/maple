zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has provided a novel approach for examining zzso interaction, demonstrating a high degree of functional connectivity between zzso regions in opposite zzso However, zzso zzso functional connectivity zzso remains relatively zzso In the present study, we examine zzso regions, characterizing zzso zzso and comparing it to zzso zzso to examine the impact of zzso separation on the integration and segregation of processing in the zzso zzso zzso scans were acquired from 59 healthy participants to examine zzso correlations in spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in zzso zzso Using a zzso atlas, we correlated zzso time series from 112 regions zzso per zzso distributed throughout the entire zzso We compared zzso for pairings of zzso regions located in different zzso zzso zzso to zzso for the same pairings when located within zzso zzso zzso For positive connections, connectivity strength was greater within each hemisphere, consistent with integrated zzso zzso However, for negative connections, zzso strength was greater between the zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso These patterns were particularly notable for connections involving frontal and zzso zzso The distribution of positive and negative connectivity was nearly identical within and between the zzso though we demonstrated detailed regional variation in zzso We discuss implications for leading models of zzso zzso The future application of our analyses may provide important insight into impaired zzso processing in clinical and aging zzso
