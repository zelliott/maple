The increasing interest in zzso zzso zzso for diagnosis and monitoring of acute stroke in humans calls for a sound understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this image contrast in acute cerebral zzso The present study aimed to show that a rapid decrease in zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso occurs zzso with zzso zzso and that this change is delayed by zzso and sodium channel blockade but accelerated by zzso 

zzso were divided into groups: zzso zzso and zzso and those given local zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest was zzso by intravenous zzso injection during serial high-speed diffusion and blood zzso zzso echo zzso Brain DC potential was recorded zzso zzso zzso maps were calculated from the zzso data and fitted to a model function to measure the delay between cardiac arrest and rapid zzso zzso 

The time of zzso zzso indicated by DC change agreed well with the rapid drop in zzso in all zzso both were accelerated with zzso and delayed by zzso A more gradual zzso decline occurred before zzso zzso which was more pronounced in zzso animals and less pronounced in zzso zzso Rapid drop in zzso was also delayed by local zzso zzso Changes in zzso echo image intensity were not significantly different among zzso 

While much of the zzso decrease in zzso occurs during zzso zzso significant but gradual zzso changes occur earlier that may not be due to a massive loss in zzso zzso
