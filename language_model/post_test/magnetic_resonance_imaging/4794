zzso alcoholism is associated with smaller volumes of cortical gray matter and white matter and a complementary increase in brain zzso fluid zzso volumes, relative to age zzso This zzso study zzso the extent of brain volume changes associated with zzso and drinking at three time points in chronic zzso We obtained magnetic resonance imaging zzso on 58 alcoholic men after an average of 12 days zzso and 32 days zzso of zzso In addition, 58 healthy control subjects were scanned at a comparable zzso At zzso 11 controls and 39 zzso were zzso zzso months after zzso 19 zzso had zzso and 20 had resumed zzso zzso zzso slices were segmented into cortical gray matter, white matter, and zzso and summed over seven zzso lateral and third zzso volumes were also zzso zzso volume changes were corrected using an estimate of zzso measurement error caused by head positioning differences, and then divided by the zzso to yield rates of change zzso From zzso to zzso the alcoholic group showed declines in zzso volumes of the lateral zzso and zzso cortical zzso and a trend toward an increase in anterior cortical gray matter volume relative to the control zzso From zzso to zzso third zzso volumes decreased in the zzso relative to the zzso and zzso cortical white matter volume decreased in the zzso In the zzso lifetime consumption of alcohol (as of zzso predicted later vulnerability to white matter volume decline and third zzso enlargement with resumption of zzso These data suggest that improvement in cortical gray matter, zzso and lateral zzso volumes occur early in the course of zzso and that improvement in third zzso volume appears later with continued zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
