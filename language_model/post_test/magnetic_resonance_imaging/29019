The zzso effect of zzso of the internal carotid artery zzso can be assessed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso the carbon dioxide zzso zzso of the cerebral zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether a decreased zzso zzso is associated with a compromised cerebral zzso as evaluated with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso patients with unilateral or bilateral zzso of the zzso who were scheduled for carotid zzso zzso and who had undergone both a zzso zzso zzso test and a MRS examination, were included in this zzso The zzso zzso on one side zzso zzso was always more than zzso and the extent of the zzso on the zzso side zzso 

The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso ratio were correlated in both zzso zzso zzso P zzso Patients with an zzso zzso zzso to the zzso side are especially at risk for zzso cerebral zzso and zzso in the zzso hemisphere, the mean zzso zzso and zzso ratio were abnormal zzso and zzso respectively), and zzso was present in zzso of the zzso Changes indicative of zzso zzso were found more often in symptomatic than in zzso zzso 

A decreased zzso zzso appears to be associated with a zzso cerebral zzso Patients with severe bilateral zzso zzso are at risk for zzso cerebral metabolism and zzso zzso the indication for zzso based on the degree of zzso zzso and clinical grounds might be refined with an additional test, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso
