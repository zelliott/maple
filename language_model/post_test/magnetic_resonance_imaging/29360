Many centers have reported that zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of seizure onset with greater sensitivity and specificity than zzso zzso Here we report zzso and zzso zzso scan results in both zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso these scans were done in 52 patients with partial and zzso generalized zzso Twenty-five had normal zzso and 27 showed structural zzso None had zzso zzso sclerosis clearly identified on zzso All 52 subsequently had zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies that appeared to zzso the seizure zzso Thirty-nine patients had surgery and have been followed for 2 or more zzso zzso zzso scans showed focal zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso of the seizure focus in zzso of zzso In another zzso there was correct zzso but not zzso zzso zzso scans showed focal zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso of the seizure focus in zzso of zzso In another zzso there was correct zzso but not zzso The presence or absence of structural zzso on zzso did not affect zzso zzso or its correlation with zzso zzso Thirty-nine patients had zzso surgery, of whom zzso had class I zzso There was a trend towards better outcome when zzso zzso data were zzso with zzso zzso zzso The presence or absence of structural zzso on zzso did not affect the likelihood of class I zzso zzso zzso is superior to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso seizure zzso Its results correlate well with zzso zzso but in more than one third of cases, the latter shows focal seizure onset in areas that do not show focal zzso zzso outcome tends to be better when the two zzso give zzso zzso
