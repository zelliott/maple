The feasibility and diagnostic value of real-time magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism zzso was evaluated by comparing zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso In 39 consecutive patients with suspected zzso real-time true fast imaging with zzso zzso zzso was zzso compared with zzso zzso on a zzso MR zzso The zzso sequence used allowed acquisition of zzso images at zzso s per image so that the pulmonary zzso could be zzso in three zzso in zzso zzso without the need for breath holding or contrast media zzso zzso of additional zzso pulmonary zzso examinations were available from 17 zzso All 39 primary zzso examinations zzso and 30 of 39 zzso examinations zzso were of diagnostic zzso The reasons underlying failure to achieve diagnostic quality for zzso were breathing artifacts among zzso patients in all 9 zzso Compared with zzso the sensitivities and zzso of zzso sequences for zzso were 93 and zzso zzso zzso 96 and zzso zzso artery zzso and 97 and zzso zzso artery zzso zzso Compared with zzso the sensitivity and specificity of zzso were 83 and zzso zzso The zzso reached zzso sensitivity and specificity in this zzso The zzso proved to be very robust and undisturbed by respiratory movements and patient zzso Its image quality assured fast diagnostic zzso and its sensitivity and zzso compared with zzso and zzso were sufficient to allow the diagnosis of acute central, zzso and zzso zzso therefore, the emergency diagnosis of zzso using zzso is feasible and zzso
