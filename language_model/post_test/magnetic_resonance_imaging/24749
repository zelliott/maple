Recent findings from zzso zzso studies suggest that the enhancement of cognitive processes during development may be the result of a zzso of the structural and functional organization of brain with zzso However, the details regarding the zzso trajectory of large-scale structural brain networks are not yet zzso Here, we used graph theory to examine zzso changes in the organization of structural brain networks in zzso normally growing children and zzso zzso brain networks were constructed using zzso correlations in cortical thickness for 4 age groups zzso zzso zzso year; late zzso zzso year; early zzso zzso year; late zzso zzso zzso Late childhood showed prominent changes in zzso properties, specifically a significant reduction in local efficiency, zzso and increased global efficiency, suggesting a shift of zzso organization toward a more random zzso An increase in number and span of distribution of zzso hubs was found in this age zzso Finally, zzso connectivity analysis and zzso measures indicated early maturation of primary zzso regions and protracted development of higher order association and zzso zzso Our finding reveals a time window of plasticity occurring during late childhood which may accommodate crucial changes during zzso and the new zzso tasks that an adolescent zzso
