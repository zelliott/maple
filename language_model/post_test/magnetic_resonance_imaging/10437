We tested functional zzso for faces in patient zzso who following acquired brain damage has a profound deficit in object recognition based on form zzso form zzso and also zzso that is zzso to zzso zzso imaging demonstrated that like our control observers, zzso shows significantly more zzso when passively viewing face compared to scene images in an area that is consistent with the zzso face area zzso zzso zzso zzso Control observers also show zzso face area zzso zzso however, whereas zzso zzso appear to overlap the zzso zzso We asked, given that zzso shows zzso zzso for faces, to what extent is she able to recognize zzso zzso demonstrated a severe impairment in higher level face zzso could not recognize face identity, gender or emotional zzso In contrast, she performed relatively normally on many face categorization zzso zzso can differentiate faces from zzso given sufficient texture information and processing time, and she can do this is independent of color and zzso zzso zzso can use zzso information for zzso faces when they are presented in an upright but not a sideways orientation and given that she also cannot discriminate zzso she may rely on a zzso zzso feature zzso zzso appear to be a unique category, which she can zzso even when she has no advance knowledge that she will be shown face zzso Together, these imaging and behavioral data support the importance of the integrity of a complex network of regions for face zzso including more than just the zzso particular the zzso a region believed to be associated with low-level zzso
