zzso zzso masses often contain zzso zzso and zzso do zzso Standard and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of the adrenal zzso in 31 patients with 45 adrenal masses were reviewed to determine if simple visual analysis of these images would increase diagnostic zzso zzso was considered present if signal intensity of the adrenal mass relative to other zzso decreased on chemical shift images relative to comparable standard zzso Both zzso and 26 of 27 benign cortical masses displayed a loss of signal intensity on at least one chemical shift image; all 12 zzso the three zzso and a zzso did zzso zzso images were slightly more sensitive than zzso images in depicting zzso within benign cortical zzso All masses had higher signal intensity than that of the liver on standard zzso MR zzso Chemical shift MR imaging can demonstrate zzso within benign zzso masses and thus increase zzso potentially obviating biopsy and aggressive zzso
