Although decreased zzso connectivity in white matter has been reported to be a key mechanism of vascular zzso assessment of white matter changes by zzso MR imaging in relation to measures of zzso function has not been previously zzso We evaluated the loss of zzso zzso connectivity in vascular zzso by measuring zzso zzso of the corpus zzso and determining its relationship to the regional cortical activity as reflected by cortical zzso 

Nine patients with multiple zzso zzso and six healthy volunteers zzso years old) were zzso We developed a method to determine the active cortical volume zzso by masking zzso zzso zzso scans to eliminate the effect of brain zzso The zzso rate zzso was calculated as a ratio of two perpendicular diffusion zzso in zzso MR zzso 

Compared with the zzso of the healthy volunteers, there were significant decreases in the zzso in the frontal zzso areas in the patients, and these were significantly correlated with cognitive zzso The frontal zzso showed good correlations with the zzso of the anterior corpus zzso among all zzso however, only insignificant trends toward correlation were observed between these two parameters within the patient zzso 

A possible relationship between zzso zzso of the anterior corpus zzso and frontal zzso function was zzso however, an zzso of the decrease in zzso connectivity in patients with multiple zzso zzso in terms of the deterioration in zzso zzso requires further zzso
