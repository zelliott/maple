The aim was to compare left zzso ejection fraction zzso and left zzso zzso global strain by zzso tracking as zzso of final zzso zzso 

zzso global strain and zzso by zzso were assessed in the acute phase and after zzso in 39 patients with zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso 

After zzso global strain and zzso correlated well with zzso size measured by zzso cardiac magnetic zzso A zzso value of zzso for global strain had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso to identify zzso zzso larger than zzso zzso zzso expressed by zzso correlation zzso for global strain and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso global strain is a more precise diagnostic predictor of large zzso compared with zzso and is more zzso Global strain measured after zzso demonstrates advantages over zzso in the evaluation of zzso injury in patients with zzso zzso zzso
