Although recent zzso and therapeutic zzso magnetic zzso stimulation zzso studies suggest imbalance between left and right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso in major depressive disorder zzso the fundamental zzso characterization of left zzso zzso and right zzso zzso in zzso remains poorly zzso 

We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate neural activity in left and right zzso related to unattended zzso and attended zzso judgment of zzso Participating in the study were 20 zzso patients with zzso and 30 healthy zzso 

The zzso patients showed zzso in the left zzso during both unattended and attended emotional judgment and zzso in the right zzso during attended emotional zzso In contrast to healthy subjects, left zzso activity during emotional judgment was not zzso modulated by negative emotional zzso and was zzso modulated by positive emotional zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the right zzso correlated with depression zzso 

zzso demonstrate that left zzso zzso is associated with negative emotional judgment rather than with emotional perception or attention while right zzso zzso is linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso imbalance is characterized in zzso regard, which bridges the gap from resting metabolism and therapeutic repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation effects to functional zzso of altered zzso interaction in zzso
