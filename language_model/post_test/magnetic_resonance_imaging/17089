zzso ultrasound surgery zzso is usually based on zzso below 5 zzso around 1 zzso Although this allows good penetration into zzso it limits the minimum zzso dimensions that can be zzso In this study, we investigate devices to allow zzso at much higher zzso in principle, reducing the minimum zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso can produce zzso zzso between viable and zzso zzso zzso devices may allow this to be exploited in superficial applications which may include zzso zzso treatment of the vascular system, and treatment of early zzso in zzso zzso In this paper, we explain the methodology we have used to build zzso high-intensity zzso using zzso zzso zzso This material was chosen because its low losses give it the potential to allow zzso operation at zzso of the fundamental operating zzso A range of zzso zzso with center zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were built and the zzso efficiency and acoustic power output were zzso A focused zzso zzso was built with multiple elements operating together and tested using an ultrasound phantom and zzso zzso It was shown to increase phantom temperature by zzso in a localized area of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the plane of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tests on poultry tissue were also performed and shown to create zzso of similar zzso This study, therefore, demonstrates that it is feasible to produce zzso zzso capable of high-resolution zzso using zzso zzso
