The appearance of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso fast imaging sequence zzso is zzso Images were obtained using a zzso zzso T zzso operating at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso imaging sequence at different values of repetition time, different values of zzso zzso and different numbers of acquisitions are described both zzso and zzso At low flip angles, both zzso and zzso appear brighter than surrounding white zzso zzso the flip angle tends to make zzso brighter than both zzso and white matter and increasing the flip angle still further makes zzso and zzso darker than white zzso A major limitation of this technique is that the low flip angle images, in particular, suffer from low zzso zzso High flip angle zzso images have higher zzso ratios but show similar contrast zzso to zzso zzso images and are likely to be no better as a screening sequence for zzso zzso All the zzso sequences showed a sensitivity to changes in magnetic zzso This made small zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso easier to detect than on zzso images but also caused zzso zzso in images around the base of the zzso
