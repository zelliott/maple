With age, the brain zzso both structural and functional zzso Overall, the literature consistently reports global brain zzso in normal adults, generally more pronounced in frontal zzso As a result of different zzso and inclusion criteria, other brain areas have been the matter of conflicting findings, notably the zzso Regarding zzso PET studies, they have consistently highlighted a zzso deterioration of the frontal and anterior zzso zzso By contrast, relatively few investigations have sought to identify those areas that remain intact with aging, or undergo the least zzso We report a study designed to establish a comprehensive profile of both structural and functional changes in the aging brain, using up-to-date zzso methodology in 45 zzso healthy subjects aged zzso zzso One of the main findings is that the lesser structural deterioration of the anterior zzso region, together with the lesser functional zzso of the zzso zzso cortex, appear to mark the parting of the ways between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by early and prominent deterioration of both zzso This paper also deals with studies set out to establish the relationship between changes in episodic memory retrieval in normal aging on the one hand and gray matter volume and zzso zzso on the other zzso zzso areas dysfunction is involved in memory decline in older subjects, at least in some conditions, a finding which clearly contrasts with that found in Alzheimer's disease where the zzso plays a key zzso Finally, zzso mechanisms are reviewed through zzso studies which often show supplementary zzso in old subjects compared to young as well as in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy elderly zzso Paradoxically, those mechanisms seem to be zzso at least zzso by frontal areas in both zzso but researches are needed to better identify which zzso are zzso
