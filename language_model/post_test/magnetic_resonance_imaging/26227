The purpose of the study was to investigate the feasibility and the zzso of zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso in patients with head and neck zzso From February 1997 to November 1997, 17 patients with zzso cell zzso of the head and neck were treated with zzso Patients were immobilized with a zzso mask and treated using a serial zzso device on a 6 zzso linear zzso Treatment planning was performed on a zzso inverse planning system and prescription zzso was used to achieve the best plan for target coverage and zzso zzso The treatment planning system process has a zzso characteristic of delivering different doses to different target structures simultaneously in each daily zzso therefore, the biological equivalent dose was implemented using the zzso model to adjust the total dose to the target volume receiving a daily dose of less than zzso zzso All eight patients with gross disease (six in the zzso two in the zzso and one patient with zzso zzso zzso received concurrent zzso zzso Six zzso patients were treated with zzso zzso Median follow-up was zzso years zzso zzso zzso All patients completed the prescribed treatment without unexpected zzso Acute side effects were comparable to those of patients treated with conventional beam arrangements during the same zzso No patient required zzso during zzso The preliminary experience showed that the zzso zzso mask yielded high positioning zzso for our zzso To spare the zzso zzso which is in the proximity of the target, a fraction of the target volume may not receive the prescribed zzso In the zzso plan of our studied zzso only zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso volumes were treated to more than 30 zzso while an average of zzso zzso zzso of the target volume received less than zzso of the prescribed zzso This is mainly related to the steep dose zzso in the region where the target zzso the zzso zzso The inverse planning system allowed us the freedom of weighting normal zzso and target coverage to select the zzso zzso Local control was achieved in eight patients with gross zzso six were treated zzso Of three zzso patients, two had symptomatic improvement but persistent disease, and one is without evidence of zzso In zzso a system for patient zzso setup zzso and dose zzso for head and neck cancer with zzso sparing without significantly compromising target coverage is being implemented for a zzso zzso plan at the zzso Institute of zzso The initial clinical experience in tumor control is promising, and no severe adverse acute side effects have been zzso Further refining of delivery technology and the inverse planning system, gaining clinical experience to address target definition and dose zzso within the targets, and understanding the partial volume effect on normal tissue tolerance are needed for zzso to excel in the treatment of head and neck zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso 90, zzso zzso
