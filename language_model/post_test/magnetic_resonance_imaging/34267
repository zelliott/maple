The purpose of this study was to zzso cerebral zzso zzso with zzso dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso using a zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed zzso zzso with zzso sequence in 19 normal zzso After zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso images of two sections were acquired for the simultaneous creation of zzso zzso in the internal carotid artery and in brain zzso Absolute regional cerebral blood volume zzso regional cerebral blood flow zzso and mean transit time zzso values of brain tissue were calculated on a base of the indicator dilution theory, and all values were corrected on the assumption that zzso of white matter is constant in 22 zzso g zzso without zzso zzso A decrease in zzso and zzso of gray matter was age dependent, while zzso of white matter did not show significant change with zzso The mean zzso value in gray matter was zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso The mean zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso g tissue in gray matter and zzso + zzso zzso g tissue in white zzso The zzso and zzso values of gray and white matter obtained from zzso zzso with zzso sequence were slightly lower than the published data calculated by zzso zzso We were able to perform absolute zzso of the zzso blood volume and flow, using a zzso zzso which would not have been possible with a zzso zzso This technique provides a new method for zzso cerebral zzso zzso
