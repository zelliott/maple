The purpose of this article is to determine whether the peak integral and zzso ratio zzso of total zzso compounds obtained by MR zzso zzso correlate with zzso zzso currently used for predicting prognosis in patients with breast zzso 

zzso zzso MRS using a zzso scanner was performed in 184 patients zzso age, 48 years; range, zzso zzso with breast zzso We obtained absolute total zzso compound peak zzso total zzso compound peak integral zzso for the volume of interest, and zzso after zzso On surgical pathology, zzso zzso and zzso factors such as nuclear grade, zzso grade, zzso zzso zzso zzso extensive zzso component zzso zzso invasion, and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso U test and zzso rank zzso 

The total zzso compound zzso absolute total zzso compound peak zzso and zzso total zzso compound integral were significantly higher for invasive zzso zzso cancer of high nuclear or zzso grade, and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso than for in zzso or other invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer of low nuclear or zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso There was a significant difference in the total zzso compound zzso between zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation was found between the volume of interest zzso zzso zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso and three MRS parameters zzso zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that zzso MRS can play a role in predicting zzso indicators of tumor aggressiveness in patients with newly diagnosed breast zzso
