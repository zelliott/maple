To compare liver zzso zzso using torso zzso zzso and body coils with two pulse zzso 

Sixty patients with 125 focal zzso zzso underwent zzso fast zzso zzso and fast zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging with a standard body zzso and with a zzso zzso The first 30 patients were scanned zzso in both coils with four zzso the second 30 were scanned with four acquisitions in the body zzso and two in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher for the zzso zzso both with four acquisitions zzso zzso and with two acquisitions zzso zzso zzso using zzso compared to with four acquisitions in the body zzso zzso zzso for zzso was equivalent in both zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso for zzso than zzso both in the body zzso and in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly higher using the zzso zzso rather than the body zzso Imaging time can be reduced by decreasing the number of acquisitions with the zzso zzso
