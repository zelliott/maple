The precise evaluation of electromagnetic field zzso zzso inside biological samples is becoming an increasingly important design requirement for high field zzso zzso In evaluating the induced fields caused by magnetic field zzso and zzso zzso zzso a multilayered zzso zzso head model is proposed to provide a better understanding of electromagnetic interactions when compared to a traditional homogeneous head zzso This paper presents zzso potential zzso and zzso Green's function zzso solutions of the zzso inside a zzso zzso sphere with similar zzso zzso and zzso profiles as a human zzso The zzso approach is formulated for the zzso case in which the source is a circular loop carrying a zzso current over a wide frequency zzso The zzso method is developed for generic cases in which the source may be any kind of zzso zzso whose current distribution can be evaluated using the method of zzso The calculated zzso can then be used to deduce zzso imaging zzso The proposed methods, while not representing the full complexity of a head model, offer advantages in rapid zzso as the zzso times are much lower than a full finite difference time domain calculation using a complex head zzso Test examples demonstrate the capability of the proposed zzso It is anticipated that this model will be of particular value for high field zzso applications, especially the rapid evaluation of zzso zzso zzso and volume zzso and high performance zzso set zzso
