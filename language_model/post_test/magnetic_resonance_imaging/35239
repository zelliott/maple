zzso magnetic resonance imaging is used to assess the roles of zzso zzso in aggressive motivation and zzso zzso in maternal zzso In the case of zzso male rats are triggered to show the zzso signs of impending attack zzso by simulating a zzso conflict in the bore of the magnet during the imaging zzso zzso injection of zzso alone causes robust changes in brain activity mirroring many areas selective for zzso zzso binding and overlapped with many of the same areas activated during zzso zzso with an orally active zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks aggression in zzso studies and suppressed the pattern of brain zzso caused by the intruder or administration of zzso These findings using imaging corroborate and extended our understanding of the neural zzso of aggression and the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the case of maternal zzso zzso zzso are zzso during nursing with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso alone activates many cortical and zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso stimulates brain activity in areas selective to zzso zzso binding and overlap with many of the same areas activated during pup zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso suppresses the pattern of brain zzso caused by zzso or administration of zzso The data suggest that zzso may strengthen zzso bond formation partly by acting through brain areas involved in regulating zzso discrimination, emotions and zzso
