zzso laser zzso zzso is an effective treatment for relief of zzso zzso This benefit may be zzso by increase in zzso zzso or by cardiac zzso We investigate the efficacy of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for relief of angina and whether any clinical benefit is associated with enhanced zzso zzso 

Twenty consecutive patients with zzso coronary arteries and intractable angina were zzso zzso to have zzso by zzso zzso aluminum zzso laser or zzso zzso were clinically evaluated before, and for 42 months after, zzso They underwent exercise tolerance testing and rest and stress quantitative zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso before, and 6 months after zzso 

The demographics of the two groups were zzso There was no zzso zzso however, two patients died in the zzso group during zzso The Canadian zzso Society angina score improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group at 6 months but returned to zzso zzso zzso at 42 months, while in the zzso group it improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 6 months and deteriorated to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 42 months of zzso The zzso patients showed significant improvements in the zzso scores and Seattle zzso zzso only at 6 months, whereas zzso patients did not show zzso at any time during zzso The zzso protocol was completed in 15 of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) patients and no significant differences in qualitative or quantitative zzso variables were demonstrated in either zzso 

A greater clinical benefit was obtained with zzso than with zzso early after surgery but this clinical effect did not seem to be associated with improvement in zzso zzso as assessed by zzso and part of the beneficial effect was lost by 42 months after zzso
