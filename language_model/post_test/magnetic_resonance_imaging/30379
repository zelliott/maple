To evaluate the effect of experience on zzso staging of zzso cancer using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso ultrasound zzso 

From January 2002 to May 2006, zzso consecutive patients with zzso zzso cancer were examined with a zzso zzso unit and zzso using a zzso zzso An experienced gastrointestinal zzso zzso or a general zzso zzso performed the zzso All patients (78 M, 56 zzso mean age zzso years, range zzso were treated with surgery zzso The mean size of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso A complete zzso zzso examination was used as the gold zzso 

At pathology, 42 of zzso zzso zzso were classified as zzso and 92 zzso were classified as zzso The zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso specificity was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso the specificity was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso There was no difference in the results of zzso between zzso and zzso for either zzso or zzso 

Reader experience had a statistically significant positive effect on the zzso prediction of zzso involvement of the zzso zzso To obtain high-quality zzso prediction of zzso cancer zzso it is suggested that zzso zzso and zzso staging should be supervised by an expert in the zzso cancer zzso In addition to this zzso the person responsible for staging should be trained through a defined training zzso
