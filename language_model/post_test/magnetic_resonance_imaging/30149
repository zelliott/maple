The zzso of vanishing white matter zzso disease is characterized by a loss of white matter zzso Although recent zzso studies suggest a primary zzso dysfunction, the purpose of this work was to assess the extent of zzso involvement in zzso using long-term follow-up zzso MR zzso White and gray matter of nine children with genetically proven zzso and late zzso childhood onset were investigated with zzso time, zzso zzso MR zzso over up to 8 years starting as early as less than 2 years after the onset of symptoms (5 zzso Total zzso zzso from normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were reduced in zzso at early disease zzso zzso compounds were less severely decreased zzso zzso investigations revealed progressive reduction of all zzso in zzso In gray matter, no distinct changes were detected at early zzso Later total zzso decreased slightly zzso Assuming the zzso zzso to primarily reflect changes in cellular zzso the observed pattern indicates early zzso involvement or loss as well as relatively enhanced turnover of zzso These early stages are followed by a complete cellular loss in cerebral zzso
