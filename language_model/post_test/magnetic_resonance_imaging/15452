To evaluate the detection and the size of focal zzso cartilage zzso in zzso mapping as compared to standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso 

Fifty-five consecutive clinical patients referred to knee zzso were zzso both with a standard knee zzso protocol zzso zzso and zzso series, zzso zzso and zzso series, and zzso zzso series) and with an zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement to determine the zzso relaxation time of the zzso zzso MR images and zzso maps of zzso cartilage were evaluated for focal zzso The zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso zzso zzso depth zzso zzso or zzso of cartilage zzso and zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso based on visual zzso 

Altogether, 36 focal zzso cartilage zzso were detected from 20 human subjects (11 male, nine female, mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected both on zzso and zzso zzso while eight zzso were only visible on zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly wider zzso zzso zzso and thicker zzso on zzso maps as compared to standard knee zzso Most zzso 27 had moderately zzso zzso zzso increased zzso values, while two zzso had slightly zzso zzso zzso and seven zzso remarkably zzso zzso zzso increased zzso relaxation zzso 

zzso mapping of zzso cartilage is feasible in the clinical setting and may reveal early cartilage zzso not visible with standard clinical zzso
