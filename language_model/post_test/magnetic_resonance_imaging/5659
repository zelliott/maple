The neural zzso of zzso working memory are zzso We addressed the questions of whether zzso working memory involves a verbal representation of the zzso or a sensory image of the zzso or both, and the location of the neural zzso of these zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activity in the brains of subjects who were remembering either zzso or zzso zzso We found a double zzso zzso remembering zzso zzso was reflected in sustained activity in prefrontal language areas, and remembering zzso zzso was reflected in sustained activity in primary zzso zzso 

These findings suggest a novel dedicated mechanism in primary zzso cortex, where odor information is maintained in temporary storage to zzso ongoing zzso
