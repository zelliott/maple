Patients with symptomatic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso artery zzso have a poor zzso and those with zzso zzso and zzso zzso have worse outcomes despite medical zzso A study was undertaken to investigate the long-term outcome and zzso rates of patients with symptomatic zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and the zzso artery zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

From July 2004 to July 2008, 24 consecutive patients zzso age 65 zzso with this condition underwent zzso zzso Technical success was defined as zzso placement of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with complete zzso coverage of the zzso and residual zzso of zzso The study end point was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days and zzso stroke in the zzso territory after 30 zzso 

Technical success was obtained in all patients without any stroke or death within 30 zzso During a median follow-up duration of 35 months, zzso zzso zzso developed in two cases zzso at 12-month zzso These two patients were free from stroke zzso Thus, the annual stroke rate in the zzso territory (including any stroke or death within 30 zzso was zzso 

This pilot study confirms that zzso placement for patients with symptomatic zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso has an acceptable long-term outcome and may be considered as an alternative to medical zzso
