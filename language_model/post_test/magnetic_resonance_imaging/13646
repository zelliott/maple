The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of different real-time true fast imaging with steady zzso zzso sequences regarding their ability to depict the swallowing process and delineate zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso of swallowing was performed in 8 volunteers and 6 patients with zzso using a zzso T scanner zzso zzso Siemens, zzso zzso equipped with zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso Image quality of four different real-time zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso TE zzso zzso zzso 63 zzso zzso zzso zzso field of view 250 zzso acquisition time per image zzso zzso was zzso Water, zzso and zzso pudding were assessed as oral contrast zzso zzso exploration of the zzso apparatus was best possible using the fastest real-time zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso TE zzso zzso zzso 63 zzso zzso Increased acquisition time resulted in blurring of anatomical zzso As the image contrast of zzso sequences depends on zzso properties, all tested zzso were well suited as oral contrast agents, but image quality was best using zzso zzso zzso zzso of swallowing is possible using real-time zzso sequences in conjunction with oral contrast zzso For the functional exploration of swallowing high zzso resolution is more crucial than spatial zzso
