zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso for the quantitative assessment of neurodegenerative zzso remain to be established in this zzso We attempted to zzso global and zzso zzso in zzso using analysis of apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

zzso images zzso zzso 1000 zzso by zzso sequences were obtained with the use of a zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso and region of interest zzso analyses of zzso values as well as conventional MR imaging studies were performed in 6 patients with genetically confirmed zzso 

zzso demonstrated significantly higher mean zzso values in the patients than in zzso and zzso control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the patients had significantly higher zzso values in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso affected regions zzso zzso zzso but not in the thalamus, the region relatively spared in this zzso zzso values in the white matter were higher only in patients with zzso zzso zzso analyses could more sensitively identify abnormalities than zzso zzso because the former avoided errors associated with setting zzso and thus had smaller P values on statistical analysis than the zzso 

zzso zzso analyses were more sensitive for the detection of zzso in zzso than zzso zzso whereas zzso analyses revealed regional zzso reflecting the distribution of zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso analyses complement each other and may permit the sensitive, quantitative evaluation of zzso in zzso especially that involving the zzso zzso showing normal zzso zzso
