zzso zzso exhibited high efficiency as magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast zzso In this paper, we report the zzso of the newly zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of green zzso protein zzso as a model for zzso zzso imaging agents based on zzso zzso In this model system, the activity of the zzso zzso can be zzso detected by green zzso protein zzso leading to in zzso experiments more direct and facile than those of tumor zzso zzso total internal reflection zzso zzso revealed that each zzso zzso zzso on average five zzso and the activity of zzso was preserved after zzso In addition, the zzso zzso exhibited higher water zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso than the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso in zzso zzso saline at zzso zzso as also confirmed by zzso images of zzso These observations clearly indicate that the zzso zzso zzso not only has targeting potential, but also exhibits higher efficiency as an zzso contrast zzso
