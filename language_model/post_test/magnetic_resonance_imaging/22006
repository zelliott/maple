The aim of the present study was to validate a simple zzso for zzso assessment of regional cerebral blood zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso (30 minutes) in the territory of the middle cerebral artery was induced in 14 zzso zzso The zzso consisted in an intravenous zzso injection of zzso recording of the cerebral contrast zzso with a zzso pulse zzso and measurement of the zzso concentration change at a chosen reference point of zzso To measure zzso zzso a zzso technique, an accepted reference technique was zzso With both methods a zzso index related to the zzso side was zzso 

In all cases decreased zzso was detected by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated with a zzso of correlation of r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that zzso zzso with zzso injection can be implemented with clinical potential as a zzso instrument for the assessment of cerebral zzso Regional cerebral blood volume and collateral blood flow may interfere with the estimate of blood zzso
