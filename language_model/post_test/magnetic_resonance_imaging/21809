An automatic zzso method has been developed for cardiovascular zzso zzso A zzso model based on a curve shaping and an zzso process is used to detect zzso zzso on zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso zzso of a reduced set of zzso points was made according to a zzso zzso regional and local minimum energy zzso A continuous regional zzso process was also integrated into the deformation model, it takes into account a cubic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The constraints provided rapid convergence toward a final zzso position by successively stopping zzso zzso
