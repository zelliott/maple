We report the development of intractable zzso in 3 patients treated with zzso to zzso scalp zzso in zzso zzso radiation was used (12 and 13 zzso in 2 of the zzso The clinical evolution suggested a recognizable and distinctive zzso zzso There was zzso between the site of radiation as shown by localized zzso the clinical features of the partial seizures, and zzso zzso The clinical picture was unlike delayed cerebral radiation necrosis of adulthood, which is not thought to occur at doses below 50 zzso in zzso zzso Neurological deficits were not progressive and in 2 patients there was no evidence of zzso injury on zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso These differences suggest zzso differences to cerebral radiation injury of adulthood, probably relating to the interaction between nervous system development, individual zzso and the low doses of radiation zzso
