In patients with deep brain stimulation zzso poor zzso outcome or unexpected clinical change require brain imaging to check the lead zzso Here, we studied safety, reliability and zzso value of zzso zzso zzso for zzso lead zzso applying zzso zzso zzso After measuring zzso effects of zzso and imaging zzso sizes of zzso lead using a skull zzso we zzso enrolled 34 patients with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of zzso device or clinical state of zzso zzso measures of lead coordinates agreed with zzso measures in zzso and zzso zzso Lead dislocation requiring zzso was reliably zzso Only patients with optimal lead position on zzso had favorable clinical 12-month outcome zzso zzso whereas zzso outcome zzso zzso was associated with zzso lead zzso zzso may therefore become a zzso zzso to monitor lead zzso
