zzso for cerebral zzso receptors were used in the past to indicate the zzso of cortical zzso in zzso to chronic states after stroke and thus to differentiate among brain regions with complete or incomplete zzso and with functional zzso For planning acute zzso therapy, however, a marker of irreversible damage in early zzso is zzso We studied the zzso of zzso zzso for differentiation between tissue with and without potential of recovery in the first hours after focal experimental zzso 

In 11 zzso cerebral blood flow, cerebral zzso rate for zzso oxygen extraction zzso and zzso binding were studied repeatedly by zzso zzso zzso before, zzso and up to 12 hours after transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso (30 minutes in 2, 60 minutes in 7, and 120 minutes in 2 zzso zzso Development of the defects in energy metabolism were compared with the defects in zzso binding (2 to 3 hours and 8 to 9 hours after zzso with the pattern of disturbed zzso metabolism zzso 12 hours after zzso and with the size of the zzso zzso approximately 15 hours after zzso 

zzso of the level of zzso defects in zzso binding (2 to 3 hours after zzso were closely related to areas with severely depressed oxygen consumption and predicted the size of the final zzso whereas preserved zzso binding indicated intact zzso Depression of zzso metabolism was in all animals larger than the defects in zzso binding and the zzso indicating functional zzso of brain areas beyond the permanent zzso zzso In addition, zzso distribution within 2 minutes after injection was significantly correlated to flow and yielded reliable zzso zzso 

The reduction of zzso binding early after focal zzso reflects irreversible zzso damage that otherwise only can be detected by zzso zzso Our experimental data and first clinical applications suggest that zzso has potential as an indicator of developing zzso Since zzso distribution additionally images zzso this zzso might be useful for the selection of patients who would benefit from acute therapeutic zzso
