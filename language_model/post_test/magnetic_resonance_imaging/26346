The blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso method, which is sensitive to vascular zzso zzso is dependent on regional values of cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso zzso blood flow zzso and volume zzso zzso changes in zzso function as an zzso contrast agent, which in turn affects the zzso relaxation rates of tissue water that can be measured by zzso and zzso sequences in zzso zzso The purpose here was to define the quantitative relation between zzso signal change and underlying zzso zzso To this end, magnetic resonance imaging and zzso methods were used to measure zzso zzso zzso and relaxation rates (with zzso and zzso zzso at 7 zzso in rat zzso cortex, where cerebral activity was altered zzso within the zzso zzso The changes in tissue zzso relaxation rates were zzso and zzso correlated with changes in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are the dominant zzso parameters that zzso the zzso zzso zzso where the ratios of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso signals zzso resolution of 48 zzso from zzso and zzso sequences were used to predict changes in zzso using measured changes in zzso zzso and zzso relaxation zzso The excellent agreement between measured and predicted values for changes in zzso provides experimental support of the current theory of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso contrast is affected by zzso processes such as zzso zzso and slow zzso whereas in zzso sequences these effects are refocused and are mainly altered by zzso spin zzso This study provides steps by which zzso zzso zzso can be used to obtain zzso resolution zzso zzso
