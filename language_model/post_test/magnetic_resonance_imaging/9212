It has been hypothesized that high structural stress in zzso plaques at critical sites may contribute to plaque zzso To test that hypothesis, zzso zzso interaction models were constructed based on in zzso zzso data of human zzso carotid plaques to assess structural stress behaviors of plaques with and without zzso 

In zzso zzso data of carotid plaques from 12 patients scheduled for zzso were acquired for model zzso zzso confirmed that 5 of the 12 plaques had zzso zzso wall stress zzso and flow maximum zzso stress were extracted from all zzso points on the zzso surface of each plaque for zzso A critical zzso zzso of zzso values from all possible vulnerable zzso was determined for each zzso 

Mean zzso from all zzso zzso in zzso plaques was zzso higher than that from all zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Mean flow maximum zzso stress from all zzso zzso in zzso plaques was zzso higher than that from all zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Mean critical zzso from the 5 zzso plaques was zzso higher than that from the 7 zzso ones zzso versus 108 zzso zzso using log zzso 

The results of this study show that plaques with prior zzso are associated with higher critical stress conditions, both at zzso sites and when compared with zzso zzso With further zzso plaque stress analysis may provide additional stress indicators helpful for zzso plaque vulnerability zzso
