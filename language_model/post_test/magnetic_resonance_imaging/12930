zzso studies in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso investigating movements of the hands have in general found increased zzso compared to healthy controls, which has been interpreted in terms of cortical adaptation as a result of zzso tract zzso Here, we investigated brain zzso to vertical tongue movements using functional zzso at 3 zzso Whereas healthy controls, patients with Kennedy syndrome, and ALS patients without zzso involvement showed robust and indistinguishable zzso in zzso and zzso areas and the thalamus, ALS patients with zzso involvement showed a significant decrease of cortical activity and missing zzso zzso This decrease stands in marked contrast to the increase of activity observed in ALS patients when performing limb zzso We discuss these divergent findings with regard to the different zzso properties of tongue and limb zzso These findings may also help to explain the faster zzso of the disease in patients with zzso zzso
