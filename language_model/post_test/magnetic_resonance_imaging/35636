The purpose of this study was to compare zzso function and mass zzso derived from cardiac zzso CT zzso exams with those obtained by zzso in heart transplant zzso Twelve heart transplant recipients who underwent cardiac zzso and zzso examination were zzso zzso zzso zzso slice thickness images were zzso Left zzso ejection zzso zzso volume, zzso volume, stroke volume, cardiac output and zzso mass were manually assessed for each patient by two blinded zzso A systematic zzso of all left zzso volumes by zzso when compared with zzso was zzso Mean difference was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso lower values for left zzso ejection fraction with zzso compared with zzso were observed zzso difference zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso for left zzso mass was excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso and Altman plots and CCC indicated good agreement between zzso and zzso left zzso function and mass zzso The zzso correlation was zzso In conclusion, zzso accurately estimates left zzso ejection zzso volumes and mass in heart transplant zzso
