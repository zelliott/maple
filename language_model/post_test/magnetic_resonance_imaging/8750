zzso relaxation refers to zzso of zzso zzso caused by a combination of zzso relaxation and magnetic field zzso zzso relaxation is seen only with zzso zzso imaging because zzso relaxation caused by magnetic field zzso is eliminated by the 180 degrees pulse at zzso zzso zzso relaxation is one of the main zzso of image contrast with zzso sequences and forms the basis for many magnetic resonance zzso applications, such as zzso zzso imaging, zzso MR imaging, and functional MR zzso zzso sequences can be made predominantly zzso weighted by using a low flip angle, long echo time, and long repetition zzso zzso sequences with zzso contrast are used to depict zzso zzso and iron deposition in various zzso and zzso SW imaging uses phase information in addition to zzso contrast to exploit the magnetic zzso differences of the blood and of iron and zzso in various zzso zzso MR imaging exploits the signal intensity decrease that occurs with the passage of a high concentration of zzso zzso through the zzso Change in oxygen zzso during specific tasks changes the local zzso which leads to the blood oxygen zzso effect seen at functional MR zzso The basics of zzso relaxation, zzso zzso and their clinical applications are zzso followed by the principles, techniques, and clinical uses of four zzso applications, including SW imaging, zzso MR imaging, functional MR imaging, and iron overload zzso
