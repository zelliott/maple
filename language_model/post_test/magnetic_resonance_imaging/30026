We present a framework for modeling zzso growth and their mechanical impact on the surrounding brain tissue (the zzso zzso We employ an zzso zzso approach that results in a strongly coupled system of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso model for the tumor growth and a zzso zzso elastic material for the background zzso To estimate unknown model parameters and enable zzso simulations we formulate and solve a zzso zzso zzso Our two main goals are the zzso zzso to improve the zzso registration from images of brain tumor patients to a common zzso space, thereby assisting in the construction of statistical anatomical zzso and zzso to develop zzso capabilities for zzso growth, after the model parameters are estimated for a given zzso To our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to introduce an zzso zzso zzso zzso in the context of zzso modeling zzso tumor zzso In this paper, we present the zzso and the solution method and we conduct zzso zzso experiments for preliminary evaluation of the overall zzso
