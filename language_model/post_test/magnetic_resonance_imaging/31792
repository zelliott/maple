The extent of zzso impairment following unilateral zzso in the auditory cortex, its zzso or zzso zzso was studied with zzso zzso zzso for the discrimination of signal frequency, intensity and duration were acquired under three different conditions of headphone stimulation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso The different test alternatives generated distinct auditory zzso which is in accordance with the assumption of specific signal processing at the level of the auditory zzso and at zzso auditory zzso zzso patients from neurology were studied who suffered from unilateral zzso in the auditory cortex, the auditory thalamus, or the acoustic zzso zzso and extent of the zzso were assessed by magnetic resonance zzso zzso tests of either ear revealed no deficits in auditory zzso The patients showed impaired discrimination of signal frequency, intensity and duration in the zzso zzso tests, when the signals were presented to the ear zzso and the noise zzso to the zzso With zzso signal and noise zzso however, the thresholds were in the range of zzso zzso All patients were able to master the zzso tests, which indicates the preserved ability to zzso sound sources to the left and to the right with either one of the auditory zzso left zzso Another 24 patients were studied who had zzso mostly close to but sparing the zzso auditory zzso All of them showed zzso performance in all test zzso The results indicate the specificity of the zzso zzso tests for the identification of unilateral zzso in zzso auditory zzso In addition, the results also point to the capacity of each zzso zzso to process the full range of auditory zzso from left to zzso
