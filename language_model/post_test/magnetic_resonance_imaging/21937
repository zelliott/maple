To assess the usefulness of fast zzso zzso zzso MR sequences in the diagnosis of zzso infectious zzso 

We compared fast zzso images with conventional zzso images zzso and zzso obtained in 20 patients with infectious diseases (six with encephalitis, five with brain zzso three with meningitis, two with zzso two with zzso disease, one with zzso zzso and one with zzso Two zzso independently reviewed the zzso images and compared them with the conventional zzso images, obtaining agreement in all zzso 

zzso images of diagnostic quality were obtained in 18 zzso In two patients, zzso images were zzso by zzso zzso in the patients with encephalitis and zzso were better delineated on zzso images than on zzso zzso zzso images clearly depicted zzso in the zzso zzso in both patients with zzso zzso In patients with brain zzso meningitis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso images provided no more information than conventional zzso images, and the zzso were seen better on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Fast zzso images showed zzso changes in zzso infectious diseases better than or as well as conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso sequences resulted in better visibility of zzso meningitis, zzso and zzso zzso than did zzso zzso
