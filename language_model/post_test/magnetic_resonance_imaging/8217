The zzso of zzso the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic zzso is largely unknown, although several lines of research zzso long-term zzso loss of zzso The evidence to date suggests that the zzso zzso are likely to be found in multiple brain zzso The present study used zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory zzso of rats with zzso evidence of chronic zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso contrast agent, accumulates in active zzso through zzso calcium channels, primarily at zzso and serves as both a structural and functional zzso zzso images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external zzso sound, and from zzso subjects treated with zzso a zzso zzso shown to eliminate the zzso evidence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In rats with evidence of zzso activity was generally elevated in the auditory zzso with significant zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso cochlear nucleus, and the inferior zzso in general zzso structures showed decreased activity, although zzso may be a less sensitive indicator of zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso in normal rats exposed to a zzso sound, a similar pattern of elevated zzso activity and decreased zzso activity was zzso with the notable exception of the zzso where artificial zzso had no effect and zzso zzso decreased zzso activity to control levels, in rats with prior evidence of zzso and decreased zzso activity to below control zzso It was concluded that chronic zzso in rats is associated with focal activity zzso in the auditory zzso and increased activity in the zzso that may be unique to zzso
