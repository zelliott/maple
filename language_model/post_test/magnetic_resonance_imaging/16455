zzso of the zzso zzso is a conspicuous pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and related to a loss of zzso Similar to zzso zzso has zzso properties resulting in signal increase on specific zzso magnetic resonance zzso The aim of this study was to assess signal changes in the zzso zzso in patients with Parkinson's disease using an zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 matched controls underwent high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance imaging with zzso transfer effect at zzso The size and signal intensity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined as the number of zzso with signal intensity higher than background signal zzso standard zzso and regional contrast zzso Patients were zzso as early stage zzso and late stage zzso using the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso Parkinson's disease staging zzso The zzso zzso area in the zzso zzso was substantially smaller in patients compared with controls zzso zzso and contrast was reduced zzso zzso zzso reduction was even more pronounced in more advanced disease zzso than in zzso disease zzso We present preliminary findings using a modified zzso magnetic resonance imaging technique showing zzso zzso zzso signal reduction in Parkinson's disease as a putative marker of zzso zzso Our data suggest that reduction in the size of zzso zzso zzso zzso well with zzso observations of zzso zzso zzso Further validation of our results could potentially lead to development of a new zzso of disease progression in Parkinson's zzso
