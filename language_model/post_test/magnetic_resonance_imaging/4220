The most common zzso sequence used to study skeletal conditions is the STIR sequence which has shown high sensitivity in the detection of skeletal zzso and whose main drawback is its long acquisition zzso Currently, zzso zzso sequences can shorten the acquisition zzso The purpose of this study was therefore to compare the conventional STIR sequence with the new zzso sequence in the study of skeletal conditions to compare their diagnostic zzso 

Twenty patients with different types of skeletal zzso were zzso MR examinations were performed with a Philips zzso zzso II unit zzso zzso All the patients underwent a STIR sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso zzso zzso 204 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, slice thickness zzso 5 zzso acquisition time zzso 9 zzso 24 zzso and a zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso zzso zzso 204 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, slice thickness zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 3, acquisition time zzso 3 zzso 33 zzso The images were evaluated by measuring both quantitative zzso contrast zzso contrast to noise ratio zzso signal to noise ratio zzso qualitative zzso zzso margins and extension, motion artifacts, image zzso 

The only statistically significant difference between the two sequences was image quality, which was superior in the conventional STIR sequence zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was demonstrated with the quantitative zzso 

In this study, zzso sequences were performed with zzso acquisition profile to acquire an actual echo time of 20 zzso which permits to obtain optimal zzso with good spatial zzso zzso zzso sequences with zzso acquisition profile provides better results than zzso sequences with linear acquisition profile which permits to obtain an actual echo time of 40 zzso 

This work shows that zzso sequences can replace conventional STIR sequences in the study of skeletal conditions reducing the acquisition time by zzso This result can be obtained only by an accurate zzso of acquisition zzso
