Evidence from zzso studies has shown the superior zzso zzso zzso to be a site of zzso integration, with zzso response to zzso stimuli exceeding the sum of independent responses to zzso audio and visual zzso However, zzso have yet to elicit zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso dependent zzso zzso from zzso in humans using zzso zzso Other studies have found integration in the zzso signal with objects, but only using less stringent criteria to define zzso Using video clips and sounds of hand held tools presented at zzso zzso we were able to elicit zzso zzso to zzso objects that surpassed the sum of the zzso zzso to audio and visual stimuli presented zzso Our findings suggest that the properties of the zzso signal do not limit our ability to detect and define sites of integration using stringent zzso
