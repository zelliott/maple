During the last years, many investigations focused on spontaneously active cerebral networks such as the zzso zzso A zzso technique, the independent component analysis, allows segregating such spontaneous zzso maps zzso from noise in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso time zzso The zzso reliability of manual selection of not only the zzso network but all zzso remained to be zzso 

The current study was performed on 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso time series of 30 healthy zzso zzso selection criteria were first established on past experience and from the zzso The zzso reliability of zzso vs zzso manual selection was then investigated from 250 independent components per zzso 

zzso Kappa zzso was of zzso zzso zzso on whole analysis, and zzso zzso zzso on participant per participant zzso 

Without focusing on specific and predetermined zzso only, our criteria allow a reliable selection of all zzso including the idiosyncratic zzso 

The proposed zzso selection criteria are reliable enough to allow scientific exploration of all zzso at the single subject zzso
