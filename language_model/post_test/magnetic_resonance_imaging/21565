To test if the zzso fields of a magnetic resonance zzso could cause focal heating, two zzso zzso were made from a mixture of zzso and zzso The first phantom was zzso the second was zzso in that a narrow bridge of zzso was zzso Both zzso were exposed to high levels of zzso power zzso zzso at 63 zzso and the temperature rises were zzso In the uniform zzso the temperature increased as the radius zzso In the bridge zzso the narrow bridge heated three times greater than at the opposite uniform zzso and over five times the average of the uniform zzso This experiment demonstrates that the zzso fields of magnetic resonance zzso can cause focal heating if the exposed object is zzso Since zzso is present in the human body, as the zzso power of magnetic resonance imaging techniques increases, focal heating in patients is a zzso
