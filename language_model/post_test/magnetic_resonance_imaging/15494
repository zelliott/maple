zzso disease zzso progressive zzso zzso type 2; zzso is an zzso zzso disorder caused by zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is characterized by the presence of strongly zzso zzso inclusions zzso zzso in several zzso zzso storage disease type IV zzso zzso disease) is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso leading to severe liver zzso zzso has been associated with zzso in the zzso branching zzso gene zzso zzso changes of the liver in both diseases show an identical appearance, although zzso has never been described in patients with zzso We report a zzso family in which the zzso presented severe liver failure at onset of the zzso 

Clinical zzso physical and zzso examination, laboratory tests, zzso zzso of the brain, and liver or zzso skin zzso were performed in the two affected zzso The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular genetic analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso 

During the first decade of life, abnormalities in liver function tests were detected in the two affected zzso The zzso liver dysfunction was severe enough to require liver zzso zzso both zzso developed zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso in both zzso 

This is the first description of severe zzso dysfunction as the initial clinical manifestation of zzso The zzso differences between the two affected siblings suggest that modifier genes must condition clinical expression of the disease outside the zzso
