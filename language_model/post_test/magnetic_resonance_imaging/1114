Evidence now exists for a zzso role for zzso in acute cerebral zzso We have studied the patterns and zzso profile of cerebral zzso recruitment to areas of acute zzso stroke zzso and have attempted to correlate this with neurological status and zzso 

Patients with cortical middle cerebral artery zzso IS were recruited within 24 hours of clinical zzso zzso recruitment was studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Volume of brain zzso was calculated from concurrent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sections were obtained zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso Rankin, and National Institute of Health Stroke zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients were zzso zzso zzso recruitment to zzso hemisphere, as measured by asymmetry index zzso was demonstrated within 24 hours of onset in 9 zzso this response was zzso between patients and on repeated measurement attenuated over zzso zzso recruitment was confirmed within zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso response did not correlate with zzso volume or zzso In an exploratory analysis, zzso zzso appeared to correlate significantly with zzso expansion zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso recruit to areas of zzso brain within 24 hours of symptom zzso This recruitment zzso over time and is confirmed zzso While zzso zzso may be associated with either the magnitude or the rate of zzso growth, these results require confirmation in future zzso
