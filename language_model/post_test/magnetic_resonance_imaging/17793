zzso drugs have been reported to reduce the levels of serum zzso and affect the production and levels of certain zzso We investigated the effects of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso on the blood levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in children with idiopathic generalized and partial zzso 

Forty zzso children aged zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso female and zzso zzso male, with idiopathic generalized or partial zzso diagnosed in the child neurology zzso clinic were zzso The patients were divided into two treatment groups: 20 were treated with zzso and 20 with zzso The plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured using zzso method before the initiation of treatment and at the 6th and 12th months of the zzso The zzso test was used to compare qualitative zzso To compare the zzso recurrence zzso were done using zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was considered as statistically zzso 

In the zzso group, the levels of zzso significantly increased at 12 months while the levels of zzso decreased at 6 months of treatment compared to values before treatment zzso There was no significant difference in levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, lower levels of zzso were observed at 6th and 12th months compared to the onset of treatment zzso 

The results of this study demonstrated that zzso and zzso might lead to changes in the levels of zzso in zzso zzso The next step would be to investigate the relation of these findings to the outcome of zzso and response to zzso
