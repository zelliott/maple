During the past few years magnetic resonance imaging zzso has gained increasing importance in the zzso examination of zzso heart zzso Practically all existing examinations have been carried out with a magnetic field strength exceeding 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be an advanced zzso application and, in the past, has been available for zzso systems zzso Therefore until recently, functional examinations such as zzso zzso flow zzso were reported exclusively for zzso zzso zzso From December 1998 to December 1999, nine patients (five girls and four boys, mean age 130 plus minus zzso months, range zzso zzso were investigated by means of zzso after a previous surgical repair or zzso balloon zzso of a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso time period 23 plus minus zzso zzso The examination was carried out without sedation in an open zzso unit zzso zzso Open zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were used with a zzso to zzso slice thickness in an zzso and a double zzso zzso The measurement of the immediate zzso flow zzso was done by zzso sequences developed for the study zzso flow measurement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso flip angle, 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso All patients were examined on the same day with comparative zzso zzso In all cases, an excellent anatomical evaluation of the zzso arch was zzso The diameters of the residual zzso were measured by zzso and correlated well r zzso zzso p ? zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso No wall damage was observed in any of the cases zzso The pressure zzso of the zzso calculated from the flow sequence was between 17 and 50 zzso and corresponded well zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso 11 zzso with the results obtained from zzso The study demonstrates that examination of the zzso arch is possible in a zzso zzso system, with its significant advantages zzso patient discomfort and more cost-effective zzso In addition, a quantitative flow measurement in zzso zzso was realized for the first zzso zzso zzso therefore seems to be a good, zzso method for examining patients with a poor zzso representation of the zzso zzso
