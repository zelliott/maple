Recent clinical experience with zzso zzso in patients without acquired immune zzso syndrome showed that they tended to have zzso features seen on conventional MR zzso The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MR imaging features of zzso zzso in patients without AIDS and to compare these imaging findings with those of zzso zzso 

MR images were obtained in 55 consecutive patients with zzso proved zzso zzso zzso 10) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We statistically analyzed the differences between the patient groups regarding the occurrence of tumor necrosis or zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratio in the tumor zzso 

zzso necrosis and zzso were observed in 9 zzso and 7 zzso respectively, of the patients with zzso zzso necrosis was observed in 8 zzso and zzso in 3 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso core was zzso relative to zzso white matter, as seen on zzso in 4 patients with zzso zzso though the zzso between the 2 patient groups did not differ zzso zzso zzso and the zzso ratios did not differ significantly between the 2 zzso The sensitivity and specificity of necrosis and zzso for zzso the 2 groups were zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

Our initial clinical experience with a small number of patients suggests that zzso zzso in patients without AIDS tends to present with zzso MR imaging zzso
