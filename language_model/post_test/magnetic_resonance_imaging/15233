A variety of zzso brain anomalies have been described in individuals with fetal zzso regardless of zzso Examples include zzso zzso zzso gray matter zzso zzso and white matter zzso and cortical zzso The present report draws attention to another anomaly not reported in previous case series of fetal zzso focal cerebral mantle zzso Neonatal imaging findings (where zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, or pathological findings were reviewed in 77 subjects with fetal zzso (55 zzso 16 sporadic zzso zzso 6 zzso Of these, 12 subjects zzso demonstrated a combination of absence of the zzso zzso and severe thinning or absence of the zzso cerebral zzso On zzso zzso this combination created the illusion of a common zzso as in zzso zzso All 12 subjects had massive zzso at birth, accompanied in 7 by zzso zzso zzso Two subjects, and one other subject with distinct lateral zzso demonstrated unilateral or bilateral mantle zzso suggestive of zzso Close zzso zzso zzso 2) or pathological zzso zzso 1) inspection showed that the zzso were only partially lined with gray matter and contained a zzso zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that massive early fetal zzso may completely disrupt cerebral mantle formation, particularly in the zzso zzso
