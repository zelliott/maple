More than half of zzso stroke survivors have long-term zzso including zzso and neurological zzso Although the immature brain has tremendous potential for recovery, mechanisms governing repair are essentially zzso We investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso early or late after transient middle cerebral zzso zzso in zzso day zzso 10 rats can serve as an intermediate zzso for long-term zzso Injured animals selected by zzso zzso during middle cerebral zzso zzso were scanned using zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso volumes on zzso and zzso were zzso or were subjected to zzso zzso at zzso to characterize cerebral zzso disturbances and zzso barrier zzso zzso volume during middle cerebral artery zzso did not predict zzso outcome at 2 zzso Major reductions in injury volume occurred by zzso with no further changes by zzso and correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in the injured zzso but zzso barrier leakage was zzso zzso conventional zzso zzso performed during a zzso injury phase predicts a long-term zzso outcome after experimental zzso focal zzso
