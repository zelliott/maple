To describe the MR imaging findings in eight patients with cavernous zzso of the zzso 

CT, MR imaging and zzso studies of eight patients with cavernous zzso localized in the orbit were zzso All patients presented with a progressive zzso in seven cases with a painless zzso in one case with a failing of visual acuity of the concerned zzso The patients were examined with zzso and zzso spin echo zzso before and after intravenous administration of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In seven patients, a fat zzso zzso was given after the zzso zzso Two patients were also examined with CT zzso with and without intravenous contrast zzso Three patients underwent a zzso color-coded zzso zzso The analyzed criteria were: location, form, margins, size, signal or zzso Seven patients underwent surgery with zzso proved cavernous zzso In one patient, therapy was conservative, because of the absence of significant clinical zzso 

In all cases, zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso to muscle on the zzso sequence and zzso to muscle on the zzso zzso In five cases, a peripheral zzso zzso to the mass on the zzso and zzso sequences could be zzso After zzso six zzso showed initial central zzso zzso On the three following zzso zzso these zzso showed total and homogeneous zzso In two patients, the zzso showed immediate homogeneous zzso On CT, the zzso masses were spontaneously zzso with associated focus of zzso On zzso the zzso appeared zzso heterogeneous, with zzso of small areas of very slow zzso 

From the analysis of the MR appearance of an zzso zzso mass, zzso homogeneous zzso zzso to muscle on zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and especially progressive filling on zzso zzso the diagnosis of cavernous zzso may be highly zzso in a patient presenting a painless progressive zzso
