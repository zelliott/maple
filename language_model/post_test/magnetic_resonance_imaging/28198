The aim of this investigation was to assess the capacity of MR imaging to identify the zzso components of cerebral zzso and thus to grade and delineate these zzso A comparative analysis between MR examinations and zzso zzso sections was performed in 5 brain specimens from patients with zzso zzso zzso All cases were examined with MR imaging in zzso In 2 cases a close comparison with the MR examination in zzso was also zzso The homogeneous zzso zzso core was not an isolated entity with typical signal characteristics in any sequence zzso However, the zzso core was better observed in zzso than in zzso or zzso its signal characteristics both in zzso and in zzso being more zzso than the zzso zzso The use of image zzso and zzso maps in combination with zzso increased our capacity to correctly distinguish the most zzso part, compared with using each of these methods zzso In all cases, zzso zzso cells were found in the most peripheral aspects of the zzso zzso These cells were not separately identified by any MR sequence or MR imaging method zzso In 4 of the 5 cases of zzso zzso zzso we found isolated zzso cells and even larger zzso cell areas, though consisting of zzso cells, in areas that were zzso as normal in all sequences and MR imaging methods zzso In all cases the zzso were zzso This zzso was best reflected in the zzso zzso were the most conspicuous zzso components in cases of zzso zzso and best reflected the underlying zzso zzso A comparison between zzso CT, zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso was performed in 14 zzso In all patients except one, the area of increased zzso zzso on zzso indicating viable zzso zzso was the same size as, or larger than the extension of the contrast enhancement on both CT and zzso zzso MR and CT gave similar results as regards zzso zzso The increase in signal intensity 5 zzso zzso tended to be greater in the high-grade than in the zzso zzso zzso In order to evaluate the zzso and long-term effects of zzso fixation on zzso and zzso of cerebral zzso and white matter, MR imaging was also performed in 5 zzso specimens from patients with no known brain zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
