zzso gels whose zzso and optical properties change when zzso offer unique advantages for measuring radiation dose zzso To date, all acrylic zzso gel zzso must be zzso stored and zzso in hypoxic conditions which severely limits their use and zzso A new zzso of acrylic dosimeter gel has been developed that responds well in normal atmosphere and which we have named zzso zzso and zzso acid in zzso zzso by zzso To produce dosimeter gels, an zzso solution of zzso open to the atmosphere, is mixed with zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso It is believed that the zzso and zzso acid form a complex with oxygen which (with zzso of water) serves as a free radical source for the initiation of the zzso of zzso zzso At room air the water zzso spin relaxation rate zzso in zzso gels is zzso to absorbed dose though the precise relationship depends on the composition of the gel and the initiating zzso For example, in the range zzso zzso the slope of the response of zzso versus dose at 20 zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, when the concentration of zzso was 3, 6 and zzso The slopes increased to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 85 zzso An important zzso of the sensitivity to detect small dose changes is shown to be the zzso ratio of the zzso zzso These varied from zzso to zzso comparable to hypoxic gels described zzso zzso gels can be manufactured and used much more easily than the previous zzso and can be zzso by magnetic resonance imaging or optical zzso and thus they will likely be of considerable interest to radiation zzso
