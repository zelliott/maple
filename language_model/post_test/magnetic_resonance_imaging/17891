zzso is essential for interpreting sensory stimuli and guiding our zzso Recent studies have revealed robust zzso category representations in the lateral zzso area zzso Here, we examine the specialization of zzso for categorization and the roles of other zzso areas by comparing zzso and the zzso zzso area zzso during a visual categorization zzso zzso is involved in zzso arm movements and zzso coordination but has not been implicated in zzso cognitive functions, such as zzso As expected, we found strong category zzso in zzso Interestingly, we also observed category signals in zzso However, category signals were stronger and appeared with a shorter zzso in zzso than zzso In this task, monkeys indicated whether a test stimulus was a category match to a previous sample with a manual zzso zzso activity in zzso showed category zzso and distinguished between matches and zzso In contrast, zzso primarily reflected the zzso status of test zzso with a strong preference for matches (which required a motor zzso This suggests that, although category representations are distributed across zzso cortex, zzso and zzso play distinct roles: zzso appears more involved in the categorization process itself, whereas zzso is more closely tied to zzso motor zzso
