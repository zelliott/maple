Spinal manipulative therapy is used millions of times every year to relieve symptoms from zzso dysfunction of the cervical zzso Concern about cerebrovascular accidents after cervical manipulative therapy is common but rarely zzso zzso tests of the zzso artery are presumed to identify patients at risk but controversy exists about their zzso 

The aim of this study was to examine zzso artery blood flow in patients with a positive zzso test for zzso to spinal manipulative therapy and to investigate if zzso would reconsider treating such patients if dynamic vascular zzso examination was zzso 

A prospective study at a university hospital vascular zzso 

zzso in private practice from 3 Danish counties referred patients with a positive zzso test for an examination of zzso artery blood zzso zzso testing was performed by an experienced zzso zzso zzso were measured in both zzso arteries by color duplex zzso In addition, zzso were asked if they would treat their patient despite a positive zzso test if the vascular ultrasound examination was zzso 

A total of 20 consecutive patients with a positive zzso test were zzso Five were excluded because symptoms could not be reproduced during the vascular zzso In the remaining patients, no significant difference in peak flow zzso or zzso mean flow zzso with different head positions was zzso zzso of 21 zzso would treat a patient with a positive zzso test if the vascular examination was zzso Eight of the patients with a positive manipulative test were treated without zzso Six are now zzso and 2 have improved zzso The remaining 8 patients refused manipulation and continue to have the same zzso 

It appears that a positive zzso test is not an absolute zzso to manipulation of the cervical zzso If the test is able to identify patients at risk for cerebrovascular zzso we suggest patients with a zzso positive test should be referred for a duplex examination of the zzso artery zzso If duplex flow is normal, the patient should be eligible for cervical manipulation despite the positive zzso zzso
