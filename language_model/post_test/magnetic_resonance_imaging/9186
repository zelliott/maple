zzso evolution of the water apparent diffusion zzso zzso parallel zzso zzso and perpendicular zzso zzso to the human white matter tract following zzso has not been investigated zzso We attempted to zzso the evolution of zzso parallel and zzso perpendicular and examine whether it can be interpreted by a model of zzso zzso 

We zzso selected 53 patients with zzso zzso involving the zzso limb of the internal capsule zzso and placed regions of interest in the right and left zzso on zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis of zzso ratios of zzso parallel and zzso perpendicular against the time zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso We then fitted the estimated time courses of zzso parallel and zzso perpendicular obtained from the analysis to a model of nerve tissue composed of zzso zzso and spheres corresponding to zzso structures, particularly focal zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso seen in zzso white zzso 

The evolution of zzso perpendicular and zzso parallel zzso The estimated time course of zzso parallel in zzso was zzso + zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso zzso zzso 54 h and zzso + zzso for zzso zzso 54 h zzso normal value, zzso That of zzso perpendicular was zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso zzso zzso 54 h and zzso + zzso for zzso zzso h zzso value zzso The model fitted to these values showed that the volume of the zzso zzso that of the spheres increased, and zzso volume changed little from one hour to approximately one day after stroke zzso 

In the human zzso zzso parallel continued to decrease from one hour to a few days after stroke zzso and zzso perpendicular tended to zzso The zzso evolution could be interpreted by progression of the focal zzso swelling of zzso cells and zzso previously observed in animal zzso
