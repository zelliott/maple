zzso may improve drug delivery to tumors by zzso of vascular zzso However, toxicity zzso its systemic administration in zzso zzso comprises zzso coupled to the zzso zzso which is a zzso for zzso zzso is expressed on tumor zzso zzso to assess the efficacy of zzso its biological effect on tumor zzso should be measured rather than its effect on tumor zzso The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a low dose of zzso (5 zzso on vascular zzso tumor zzso zzso and proliferation in zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso with blood pool contrast agent showed an increased leakage of the contrast agent from the zzso in zzso treated tumors compared with controls zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso vascular zzso zzso analysis two hours after zzso treatment showed a decrease in tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in labeling index of the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso possibly due to an increase in tumor blood flow after zzso zzso Although a decrease in tumor zzso and an increase in labeling index could have lead to increased tumor growth, in this experiment after one day a decrease in tumor volume was zzso zzso the effects on tumor zzso and proliferation two hours after treatment are transient and overruled by other, more zzso zzso For example, the observed increase in vascular zzso may lead to zzso and increased zzso pressure, ultimately resulting in an reduction of tumor blood flow and thus a decrease in tumor zzso A beneficial effect of zzso in combination with other zzso agents may therefore critically depend on the sequence and timing of the zzso Currently, zzso is being tested in clinical zzso
