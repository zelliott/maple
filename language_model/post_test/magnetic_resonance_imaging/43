Since the invention of zzso spin labeling zzso it has been acknowledged that zzso does not allow reliable detection of a white matter zzso zzso zzso However, recent developments such as zzso labeling and background suppression have improved the zzso The goal of this research was to study the ability of these newer zzso sequences to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso was implemented at zzso with zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso In five volunteers it was shown that 10 zzso scanning resulted in significant zzso signal in zzso of zzso zzso zzso the labeling and delay time did not lead to a higher zzso In 27 normal volunteers it was found that 35 averages are necessary to detect significant zzso zzso but 150 averages are needed to detect signal in the deep zzso Finally, it was shown in a patient with a cerebral zzso zzso that zzso zzso enabled the depiction of zzso zzso zzso zzso although dynamic zzso contrast zzso showed that this region was merely showing delayed arrival of contrast agent than zzso It can be concluded that, except within the deep zzso zzso is sensitive enough to detect zzso zzso signal and zzso zzso
