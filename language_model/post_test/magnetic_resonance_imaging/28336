The zzso and functional properties of food components are related to their molecular structure, zzso and atomic zzso zzso provides a powerful tool for zzso chemical structures, molecular zzso and interactions of components in food zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and other principal compounds in complex food systems was achieved by high-resolution liquid zzso In addition to information available from liquid experiments, zzso zzso experiments can reveal differences and changes in crystal packing of structures in food model zzso zzso of experimental results is enhanced by molecular modeling of key food zzso Models for fat zzso are carried out to enhance understanding of the molecular structures involved in the fat zzso zzso Recently, zzso has also shown significant impact on food science and zzso Some examples of zzso applications are given in this zzso
