To examine the zzso basis for the pronounced differences in zzso and zzso that distinguish the predominantly inattentive type of zzso disorder zzso from the combined type of the disorder zzso 

zzso brain responses to a zzso test of zzso control were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 11 children with zzso and 9 children with zzso aged 7 to 13 years, who were matched for age, sex, and zzso 

There were no significant group differences in task zzso Children with zzso and zzso activated overlapping regions of right inferior frontal zzso right superior zzso zzso and left inferior zzso lobe during zzso zzso However, the magnitude of the zzso in the zzso and zzso regions, as well as in the bilateral middle frontal zzso was greater in children with zzso than those with zzso zzso children with zzso activated bilateral zzso zzso lobe to a greater extent than children with zzso 

The results provide preliminary evidence that zzso differences between the zzso and zzso zzso are associated with differential zzso of regions that have previously been implicated in the zzso of zzso and are thought to mediate executive and zzso zzso
