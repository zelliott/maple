A study was carried out in 14 patients to assess the location and differential diagnosis of bone and soft tissue zzso with a zzso zzso zzso using water and fat images obtained by the zzso Dixon zzso We compared the magnetic resonance imaging findings obtained with this technique with conventional zzso zzso images, and zzso zzso acid enhanced zzso zzso zzso was better with the zzso Dixon technique than with conventional magnetic resonance zzso zzso between the fat and water component around the zzso was zzso The zzso zzso acid enhanced water images were very sensitive to enhancement of the zzso The zzso Dixon technique is useful when the zzso area is difficult to detect by conventional magnetic resonance imaging and information about its components is zzso these images can be made at the low magnet zzso
