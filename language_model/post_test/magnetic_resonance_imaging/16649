The purpose of this study is to develop a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso survival model with the use of zzso vascular access zzso Such a model would ease the administration of sedative agents, reduce the number of animals required in survival experiments and eliminate zzso zzso seen in previous zzso Seven male zzso rats underwent surgical placement of an zzso vascular access port, followed by zzso zzso placement on the right median zzso zzso zzso during nerve stimulation and zzso functional connectivity zzso zzso were performed at times 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks zzso using a zzso zzso zzso was maintained using intravenous zzso and reversed using zzso There were no fatalities or infectious complications during this zzso All vascular access ports remained zzso Blood oxygen level dependent zzso zzso by electrical stimulation of the median nerve using implanted zzso was seen within the zzso sensory region zzso for all animals at all time zzso The number of activated zzso decreased at time points 4 and 8 weeks, returning to a normal level at 12 weeks, which is attributed to zzso tissue formation and resolution around the embedded zzso The applications of this experiment extend far beyond the scope of peripheral nerve zzso These vascular access ports can be applied to any survival zzso study requiring repeated medication administration, intravenous contrast, or blood zzso
