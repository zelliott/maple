We report on a zzso zzso zzso observed in two patients, which provides additional information on the central pathways zzso this zzso zzso was performed in one patient and zzso in the zzso In the first patient there was a small zzso at the zzso middle third of the lateral zzso field and in the second patient at the level of the zzso lower third of the zzso zzso In both patients the common finding was the absence of the late response zzso zzso to the side of the zzso while the zzso response on the unaffected side was normal regardless of the side of the zzso nerve zzso The zzso responses were zzso This type of zzso zzso zzso has not been reported before and is referred to by us as zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results led to the conclusions that: zzso the crossed and zzso ascending zzso connections are zzso through the lateral zzso field; zzso the zzso zzso connection originates at the level of at least the lower zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso response is established by way of an ascending pathway, which crosses the zzso at the level of at least the lower third of the zzso zzso
