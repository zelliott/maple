To develop and apply a semiautomatic method of zzso zzso tissue to zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging contrast zzso zzso of breast background zzso zzso and zzso throughout the zzso of the zzso cycle in women with benign and zzso zzso 

The institutional review board approved this retrospective zzso study, and informed consent was zzso From December 2008 to August 2011, 58 zzso women who had undergone contrast zzso MR imaging and MR zzso biopsy were zzso The longest time from the start of the last known period was 34 zzso One zzso per patient zzso benign and 21 zzso was zzso The patient groups were zzso according to the week of the zzso cycle when MR imaging was zzso A method based on principal component analysis zzso was applied for quantitative analysis of signal enhancement in the zzso and zzso by using the percentage of slope and percentage of zzso Linear zzso and the zzso U test were used to assess the association between the kinetic parameters and the week of the zzso zzso 

In the women with benign zzso percentages of slope and enhancement for both zzso and zzso during week 2 were significantly zzso zzso zzso lower than those in week zzso Percentage of enhancement in the zzso in week 2 was lower than that in week 3 zzso zzso zzso The MR images of women with zzso zzso showed no significant difference between the weeks for any of the zzso There was a strong positive correlation between zzso and zzso percentage of slope zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso percentage of enhancement zzso zzso zzso in the benign zzso There was also a significant zzso zzso zzso difference in zzso percentage of slope between the benign and zzso groups at week zzso 

The zzso method can zzso contrast enhancement zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso vary according to the week of the zzso cycle in benign but not in zzso zzso
