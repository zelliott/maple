The purpose of this study was to describe the normal magnetic resonance zzso imaging characteristics of the zzso structures of the zzso zzso apparatus by means of retrospective evaluation of MR imaging studies of 16 zzso zzso The zzso aspect of the zzso zzso bone was not evaluated in this zzso zzso digits were zzso with a human knee zzso zzso in a zzso T magnetic field, using spin echo zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso density zzso zzso with and without fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The limbs were dissected after imaging to validate the absence of gross abnormalities of the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso bone, of the deep digital zzso tendon, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven deep digital zzso zzso were subjected to zzso examination to exclude any microscopic zzso zzso The zzso structures of the zzso apparatus were easily identified on MR zzso Compact bone of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bone had low intensity signal on all zzso In 11 digits an increased signal was seen within the thickness of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso images and in zzso zzso images without zzso zzso bone had a zzso appearance and high signal in zzso zzso sequences and zzso images without zzso The deep digital zzso zzso had low signal on zzso zzso images, while on short echo time sequences zzso and zzso zzso the zzso signal varied depending on the relative orientation between its fibers and the zzso magnetic zzso Seven zzso had stippled appearance due to small zzso zzso of slightly increased signal on zzso zzso zzso MR imaging provides a thorough evaluation of the anatomical structure of the zzso zzso A good knowledge of the MR imaging appearance and anatomy and an awareness of potential pitfalls will improve diagnostic specificity for the detection of zzso zzso
