A disadvantage of magnetic resonance imaging zzso is the high level of noise produced zzso between 122 zzso and 131 zzso We used zzso emissions zzso as a method to zzso the effect of zzso noise on the zzso zzso were measured in 16 patients before and after zzso and in 16 zzso zzso decreased in patients after zzso but the controls, who were not exposed to zzso noise, showed no decrease over the same zzso The change in zzso shows a clear effect of zzso noise on cochlear function, despite use of zzso The importance of correctly fitted zzso cannot be zzso
