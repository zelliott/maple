The objective of our study was to identify whether a substantive difference exists between the imaging interpretations of zzso at outside referring institutions and those of zzso at a zzso care children's hospital and whether such reinterpretation affects the clinical management of pediatric zzso 

This retrospective chart review examined the diagnostic imaging reports of all pediatric patients referred to a zzso care zzso children's hospital over a zzso period (January 1, zzso 31, zzso zzso examinations met the inclusion zzso The original and second interpretations were zzso A zzso pediatric zzso and zzso zzso each case using the content of the two zzso reports as agreement versus minor or major zzso and the results were analyzed for statistical zzso A cohort of cases in which a final diagnosis could be confirmed was also analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of both zzso 

zzso were found in 323 of zzso reports zzso zzso zzso were major and 155 zzso zzso zzso studies were most frequently requested for zzso zzso zzso most commonly in the setting of zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso studies, major and minor disagreements occurred in 54 zzso and 91 zzso cases, zzso Major disagreements most frequently observed were about the presence of fracture and zzso Among zzso body imaging cases, major and minor disagreements occurred in 99 zzso and 57 zzso cases, zzso The most common setting for zzso body imaging was concern for zzso zzso zzso this indication for imaging was responsible for zzso of major disagreements in zzso abdominal zzso zzso was rarely requested for zzso studies zzso zzso which had major and minor disagreement rates of zzso and zzso zzso In the cohort of cases analyzed for final diagnosis, the second interpretation was more accurate than the original in zzso of cases with a p value of less than zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso rates for second interpretations in studies of pediatric patients transferred to zzso care pediatric institutions are zzso Although the original and second interpretations in the majority of cases were in agreement, major discrepancies were zzso and zzso of zzso and body studies, zzso the second interpretations were significantly correlated with the final zzso These results indicate that interpretations by zzso zzso at a zzso facility provide important clinical information about the pediatric patient and should be recognized by zzso as integral to optimal zzso
