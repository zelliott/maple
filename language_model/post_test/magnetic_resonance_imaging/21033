zzso disease zzso is a rare type of inherited progressive zzso zzso resulting from zzso in the zzso B zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso K, and altered zzso bone zzso activity are interconnected in zzso This study evaluated the skeletal characteristics of patients with zzso 

zzso genetically verified zzso patients and 50 healthy controls underwent head zzso Skull dimensions and regional zzso thickness was measured perpendicular to each zzso bone from zzso zzso images using multiple zzso reconstruction zzso All clinical X-ray files of zzso patients were collected and reviewed by an experienced zzso A total of 337 X-ray studies were zzso and zzso structural anomalies, zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso patients exhibited significant zzso in all measured zzso bones compared to healthy zzso The mean skull thickness was zzso in zzso patients and zzso in healthy controls zzso The difference was evident in all age groups and was not explained by former zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in other skeletal structures in zzso patients included zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso spine zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso accessory zzso of the foot, and zzso zzso 

Skull zzso and an increased prevalence of abnormal findings in skeletal zzso of patients with zzso suggest that this condition is connected to defective zzso B zzso These findings further emphasize the role of zzso B in bone metabolism in zzso
