zzso zzso with fetal zzso growth restriction zzso is an important cause of zzso mortality and morbidity and is subsequently associated with significant zzso impairment in cognitive function, attention capacity, and school zzso The underlying zzso cause for this association is zzso zzso zzso infants zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by early and term magnetic resonance imaging zzso An advanced quantitative zzso three-dimensional zzso technique was used to measure brain tissue volumes in 14 premature infants with zzso zzso defined by abnormal zzso zzso zzso and mean birth weights zzso zzso zzso zzso 299 zzso zzso and in 14 zzso infants matched for zzso age with normal mean birth weights zzso zzso 246 g zzso zzso outcome was measured at term in all infants by a specialized assessment scale of zzso infant zzso zzso infants with zzso had a significant reduction in zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and in cerebral cortical gray matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso when measured within the first 2 zzso of life compared with control premature zzso These findings persisted at term with zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and cerebral cortical gray matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus 189 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso assessment at term showed a significantly less mature score in the zzso of zzso availability in zzso infants zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical gray matter volume at term correlated with zzso capacity measured at term zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso with zzso have specific structural and functional consequences on cerebral cortical brain zzso These findings may provide insight into the zzso correlate for the zzso deficits associated with zzso
