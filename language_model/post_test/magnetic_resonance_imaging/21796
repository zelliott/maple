Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we found an area in the zzso zzso in 12 of the 15 subjects tested that was significantly more active when the subjects viewed faces than when they viewed assorted common zzso This face zzso was used to define a specific region of interest individually for each subject, within which several new tests of face specificity were zzso In each of five subjects tested, the zzso candidate zzso zzso also responded significantly more strongly to passive viewing of zzso intact than scrambled zzso faces, zzso full zzso face photos than zzso photos of houses, and (in a different set of five subjects) zzso zzso face photos (with hair zzso than photos of human zzso it also responded more strongly during zzso a consecutive matching task performed on zzso faces versus zzso Our technique of running multiple tests applied to the same region defined functionally within individual subjects provides a solution to two common problems in functional zzso zzso the requirement to correct for multiple statistical comparisons and zzso the inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of any study in which only two or three conditions are zzso Our data allow us to reject alternative accounts of the function of the zzso face area zzso zzso that appeal to visual attention, zzso zzso or general processing of any animate or human forms, demonstrating that this region is selectively involved in the perception of zzso
