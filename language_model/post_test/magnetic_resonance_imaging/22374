To achieve a deeper understanding of the brain, scientists, and clinicians use zzso zzso and zzso zzso inverse methods to reconstruct sources in the cortical sheet of the human zzso The influence of structural and electrical zzso in both the skull and the white matter on the zzso and zzso source reconstruction is not well zzso In this paper, we report on a study of the sensitivity to tissue zzso of the zzso forward problem for deep and superficial zzso sources with differing orientation components in an zzso accurate model of the human zzso The goal of the study was to gain insight into the effect of zzso of skull and white matter zzso through the zzso of field zzso zzso surfaces, and return current flow and through statistical error zzso One implicit premise of the study is that factors that affect the accuracy of the forward solution will have at least as strong an influence over solutions to the associated inverse zzso Major findings of the study include zzso zzso white matter zzso causes return currents to flow in directions parallel to the white matter fiber zzso zzso skull zzso has a zzso effect on the forward potential zzso and zzso the deeper a source lies and the more it is surrounded by zzso zzso the larger the influence of this zzso on the resulting electric and magnetic zzso zzso for the zzso the presence of tissue zzso both for the skull and white matter compartment substantially compromises the forward potential zzso and as a consequence, the inverse source zzso In contrast, for the zzso only the zzso of the white matter compartment has a significant zzso Finally, return currents with high zzso were found in the highly conducting zzso fluid zzso zzso the need for accurate modeling of this zzso
