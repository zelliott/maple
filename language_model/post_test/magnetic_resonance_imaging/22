To evaluate the association between occupational kneeling and degenerative zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso of both knees was conducted in 92 male floor layers and 49 male graphic designers zzso with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso zzso The presence of grade 3 zzso signal zzso indicating degenerative tears of the zzso middle, and zzso one-third of the lateral and zzso zzso was assessed on zzso zzso zzso The odds ratio zzso of zzso tears was determined among floor layers compared to graphic zzso Using zzso regression, models were adjusted for age, body mass index, and zzso zzso 

zzso tears were significantly more prevalent in the zzso zzso among floor layers than among graphic designers zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and significantly more floor layers had zzso tears in both knees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Tears extending to the zzso aspect and localized in the middle and zzso one-third of the zzso zzso were most zzso zzso zzso tears were predominantly unilateral and the prevalence of lateral tears did not differ between the 2 study zzso zzso complaints occurred in about 50% of all floor zzso irrespective of the presence of zzso zzso 

Occupational kneeling increases the risk of degenerative tears in the zzso but not the lateral zzso in both zzso
