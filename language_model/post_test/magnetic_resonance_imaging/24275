zzso pelvis dimensions have been shown to differ in women with and without pelvic floor zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso pelvis dimensions are different when comparing women with severe bilateral zzso zzso defects zzso with those with normal zzso 

This is a secondary analysis of a zzso study comparing women with and those without pelvic organ zzso zzso underwent pelvic organ zzso zzso zzso examination and were classified as either having zzso or being zzso All underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso defects were assessed based on the zzso appearance on imaging and subjects were zzso into two zzso with normal muscles zzso and women with severe bilateral zzso zzso zzso pelvis dimensions were measured via zzso zzso The zzso angle, zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso point zzso lengths were zzso 

Both groups had similar zzso The zzso length was zzso % (3 zzso shorter in women with severe zzso than in those without defects zzso The zzso measured 4 % (5 zzso less in women with zzso and severe zzso than in subjects with zzso but normal muscles zzso zzso zzso identified zzso length and history of zzso delivery as being independent zzso of severe bilateral zzso 

Severe bilateral zzso are associated with shorter zzso length and zzso zzso zzso
