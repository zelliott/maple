zzso object position is one of the most critical functions of the visual system, but this task is not as simple as reading off an zzso retinal zzso A rich body of literature has demonstrated that the position in which we perceive an object depends not only on zzso but also on factors such as attention, eye movements, object and scene motion, and frames of reference, to name a zzso Despite the distinction between perceived and retinal position, zzso little is known about how or where perceived position is represented in the zzso In the present study, we zzso retinal and perceived object position to test the relative precision of zzso versus zzso position coding in a number of independently defined visual zzso In an zzso experiment, subjects performed a zzso zzso position discrimination zzso our analysis focused on the trials in which subjects zzso the positions of the zzso Using a zzso pattern analysis to track the zzso of the zzso response with incremental changes in physical and perceived position, we found that activity in higher level zzso zzso complex, zzso face area, zzso place area, lateral zzso cortex, and zzso zzso zzso precisely reflected the reported positions than the physical positions of the zzso In early visual areas, this preferential coding of perceived position was absent or zzso Our results demonstrate a new kind of spatial topography present in higher level visual areas in which an zzso position is zzso according to its perceived rather than retinal zzso We term such zzso zzso zzso
