To evaluate detection of zzso zzso at magnetic resonance zzso imaging as a zzso means to monitor early signs of chronic zzso rejection in the zzso zzso rat kidney transplantation zzso 

zzso followed the Swiss federal regulations of animal zzso Male Fisher zzso zzso zzso and Lewis zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso After removal of a native recipient kidney and transplantation of a donor zzso the recipient zzso zzso kidney was zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso from Fisher and Lewis donors transplanted into Lewis zzso zzso were zzso by using a zzso MR sequence 24 hours after intravenous administration of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso analyses of blood and zzso as well as assessments of zzso scores zzso standard for zzso zzso of graft zzso were zzso zzso tests used were analysis of zzso for multiple comparisons with zzso tests, zzso tests, and zzso correlations with zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso decrease in cortical MR signal intensity occurred in zzso between 8 and 16 weeks after zzso A strong significant negative correlation zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso dose, P zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was found between MR signal intensity and zzso scores, which deteriorated over the experimental zzso zzso occurred at 16 zzso Blood and urine zzso levels remained unchanged up to week zzso 

This MR imaging method is more robust than the usually adopted zzso clearance method for the detection of early signs of zzso chronic rejection in the zzso rat kidney transplantation zzso
