With expanding potential clinical applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso it is important to test how reliable different measures of zzso zzso are between subjects and sessions and between zzso This study compared zzso across 17 patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and 22 zzso healthy controls zzso in 5 European zzso performing an zzso block design with hand zzso We recruited subjects from sites using zzso T scanners from different zzso 5 healthy volunteers also were studied at each of 4 of the zzso We found that zzso between runs and sessions for single individuals was consistently much greater than between zzso There was greater zzso zzso for zzso patients than for zzso zzso of maximum signal change zzso appeared to provide higher zzso within individuals and greater sensitivity to differences between individuals than region of interest zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso between zzso was not as great as that between zzso zzso with these zzso we estimated that power should not be reduced substantially with use of zzso as opposed to zzso zzso study designs with similar numbers of zzso zzso zzso studies in which zzso is used as an outcome measure thus appear practical even when implemented in conventional clinical zzso
