zzso in the slice profile of the zzso inversion induced by relaxation effects are shown to cause signal variations in zzso zzso tagging schemes on the order of magnitude of zzso changes, and result in gross errors in zzso zzso zzso improvement can be made with minor modifications to the inversion pulse which facilitate the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso images, as demonstrated in both a phantom and a normal human zzso
