Recently a novel zzso selective imaging method based on linear combination zzso filtering was zzso By zzso combining images acquired with different echo times zzso filtering is able to generate images showing only zzso with a zzso range of zzso relaxation zzso In this study the use of zzso filtering in knee imaging was zzso Three zzso filters were zzso a short zzso filter for imaging the knee zzso a medium zzso filter for zzso cartilage, and a long zzso filter for zzso zzso To verify the filter designs, eight zzso with different zzso relaxation times were zzso In addition, in zzso images were acquired from four zzso volunteers and a subject with cartilage zzso zzso maps were also generated using the same source zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were made of the zzso cartilage, and fluid regions on the three zzso filtered zzso The highest zzso was seen in the target tissue on each of the zzso filtered zzso zzso filtering is a new method that can selectively image knee zzso based on their zzso
