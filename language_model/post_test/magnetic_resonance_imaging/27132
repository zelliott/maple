Previous works have shown that placement of a zzso pad can improve image intensity in a region adjacent to the pad, or that placement of zzso pads around a large surface of the head can improve image zzso on an entire plane through the head in zzso zzso Here, experimental results show that use of zzso pads around the human head can reduce the required input zzso power by 50% while enhancing image zzso ratio by zzso throughout the zzso at 3 zzso Thus, zzso pads may be used to provide a relatively simple and low-cost method for improving quality and safety of zzso in a variety of applications at 3 zzso
