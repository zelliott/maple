It has been suggested that zzso zzso zzso acid zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso may provide clinically useful zzso for personalized cancer zzso In this zzso study, we investigated the potential of zzso as a zzso method for assessing the zzso and zzso potential of zzso 

zzso melanoma zzso growing in zzso zzso mice were used as experimental tumor zzso Fifty tumors were subjected to zzso and zzso images of zzso (the volume transfer constant of zzso and zzso (the fractional distribution volume of zzso were produced by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso The tumors were zzso after the zzso either with a single dose of 10 zzso for detection of zzso zzso (30 zzso or with five zzso of 4 zzso in 48 h for assessment of zzso (20 zzso The host mice were then zzso and examined for zzso zzso zzso and the primary tumors were zzso for measurement of cell survival in zzso 

zzso with hypoxic cells showed significantly lower zzso values than tumors without significant zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased with increasing cell surviving fraction for tumors given zzso radiation treatment zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice had significantly lower zzso values than tumors in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso correlations between zzso and tumor zzso zzso or zzso potential could not be zzso 

zzso tumors with low zzso values are likely to be resistant to radiation treatment and have a high probability of developing zzso zzso zzso The general zzso of these observations should be investigated further by studying zzso tumor models with biological properties different from those of the zzso zzso
