The authors evaluate the use of magnetic resonance zzso to image pulmonary zzso in healthy controls and to detect pulmonary defects in patients with unilateral lung zzso using dynamic images after contrast zzso 

Five patients with right lung transplantation and nine healthy volunteers underwent MR zzso Twenty-five zzso zzso MR images zzso zzso shot zzso were obtained at the level of the pulmonary arteries after a single injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso lung zzso was done within 24 hours after the MR imaging examination in the transplanted zzso 

Before administration of contrast material, MR images showed both lungs to be homogeneous and of low signal intensity in healthy controls and in patients with lung zzso After contrast administration in controls, the mean signal intensity of the dependent lung increased markedly to zzso zzso zzso above zzso whereas the zzso signal intensity lung increased by only 105 zzso zzso these changes were significantly zzso In all patients with lung zzso a clear zzso zzso was demonstrated in the native zzso This zzso was confirmed in all cases by zzso nuclear zzso which showed that the majority of lung zzso is directed to the transplanted zzso compared with the native zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that dynamic zzso MR imaging is a potential method for detecting pulmonary zzso defects in patients with lung zzso
