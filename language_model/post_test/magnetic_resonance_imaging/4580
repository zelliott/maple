zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso offer zzso ways to observe structural and zzso changes which might serve as valuable diagnostic markers for detecting brain damage from prenatal ethanol zzso zzso MR imaging and zzso were performed on 20 nonhuman primates zzso zzso with known prenatal ethanol zzso and well-documented cognitive and behavioral levels of zzso The zzso zzso ratio detected by zzso in the brain increased significantly with increasing duration of in zzso ethanol zzso These signal zzso occurred in the absence of gross structural brain anomalies zzso by zzso and were significantly correlated with alcohol-related cognitive and behavioral zzso These observations are consistent with reports of elevated zzso zzso ratios associated with various zzso insults and disease zzso The association observed between brain zzso ratios and in zzso ethanol exposure suggest a role for zzso in zzso mechanisms of ethanol zzso
