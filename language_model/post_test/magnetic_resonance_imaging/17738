Regional zzso zzso a processed data from zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, provides information about spontaneous brain activity in focal zzso zzso zzso in brain regions has been reported in Parkinson's disease zzso We compared zzso of 22 patients with zzso in their zzso state to 25 healthy zzso We observed decreased zzso in the right primary sensory cortex, the right primary motor zzso and the right middle frontal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in the left inferior zzso zzso the angular zzso the zzso zzso the middle zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In the right primary sensory cortex, zzso showed a positive association with disease duration which proposed the low level of zzso in the early phase of zzso zzso was decreased in the seven de zzso zzso patients with disease duration less than 1 year as compared to the control which corresponded to the zzso In both the zzso and de zzso zzso patients, zzso decreased in the right primary sensory zzso and increased in the angular zzso as compared to the zzso Potential zzso of zzso zzso backwards to zzso may provide a clue for zzso zzso
