zzso of zzso promotes zzso cell growth, zzso zzso plus maintenance of vascular stability and is associated with cancer progression in several human zzso zzso zzso is expressed also on zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso zzso tested in the present study, can exert a direct zzso zzso 

Adult patients with advanced solid zzso expressing zzso on zzso zzso carried out in the previous 12 months received escalating zzso doses of zzso given weekly zzso for 3 of 4 weeks, then every zzso Plasma zzso zzso was studied at cycle zzso Blood flow changes were assessed after first dosing in all patients treated in the initial zzso 

In all, 129 patients were screened, 65 zzso were zzso positive, and 30 were zzso The doses ranged from 150 to zzso zzso no maximum tolerated dose was zzso Treatment was well tolerated with zzso as the most frequent adverse zzso Two patients with zzso cancer showed prolonged disease zzso while one patient with zzso tube zzso achieved a mixed zzso zzso was linear in the range of doses zzso 

zzso is the first zzso compound tested in zzso In zzso patients, zzso showed an acceptable toxicity profile, linear zzso and hints of zzso activity in zzso zzso
