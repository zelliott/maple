zzso resonance imaging zzso techniques were used to determine the effect of zzso zzso on the extent of cerebral zzso injury and the level of cerebral zzso Middle cerebral artery zzso zzso was induced by a zzso zzso zzso Forty one rats were divided into zzso and zzso groups with either 4 hours of continuous zzso or 2 hours of zzso followed by 2 hours of zzso zzso imaging zzso was performed at 4 hours after zzso to zzso the degree of injury in 6 brain zzso Relative cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso were estimated using zzso echo zzso zzso tracking and zzso spin echo zzso imaging techniques, zzso Brain injury correlated with the zzso level measured in both zzso zzso and dynamic GE zzso zzso In the temporary zzso model, mean zzso size in zzso was zzso larger and zzso zzso was reduced by 37% in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso did not significantly exacerbate brain injury or zzso deficit in permanent zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso increases acute zzso zzso brain cellular injury in proportion to an associated increased zzso zzso
