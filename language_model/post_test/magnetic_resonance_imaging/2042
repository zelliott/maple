To test further the hypothesis that zzso dominant zzso diabetes zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso in the zzso II zzso gene that exert a dominant negative effect by producing a precursor that zzso accumulates and eventually destroys the zzso zzso 

zzso function, magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso gene analysis were performed in 10 affected members of three zzso families with zzso 

As in previously studied patients, zzso apparently zzso after birth, was due to a partial or severe zzso of zzso and was associated with absence or diminution of the zzso zzso signal normally zzso by the zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In family A, a transition zzso which predicts replacement of zzso 92 by zzso zzso was found in the index patient, but not in either parent, indicating that it arose de zzso The six affected members of family B had a zzso zzso which predicts replacement of zzso 54 by zzso zzso It appeared de zzso in the oldest affected member, and was transmitted in a dominant zzso In family C, six of 15 living affected members were tested and all had a novel transition, zzso which predicts replacement of zzso 105 by zzso zzso It, too, was transmitted in a dominant zzso As in other patients with zzso the zzso acids replaced by the zzso in these three families are known to be particularly important for correct and efficient folding of the zzso 

These findings are consistent with the zzso hypothesis underlying the zzso of zzso Moreover, they illustrate the value of genetic analysis in all patients who develop idiopathic diabetes zzso in childhood, even if no other family members are zzso
