The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction in patients with open zzso 

zzso zzso reconstruction was performed in 26 patients with open zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by use of zzso quadrupled zzso as zzso zzso tearing was found in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso injury on the zzso zzso zzso was found 6 months after injury in only 2 patients zzso of all zzso The mean follow-up period was 45 zzso zzso zzso Clinical outcomes were evaluated by use of the International zzso Documentation Committee score and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso stability was zzso measured by use of zzso zzso zzso San Diego, zzso zzso length and angular discrepancies were observed by conventional zzso in a long film and zzso of the lower zzso 

The mean length zzso between the operated lower limb and the zzso limb was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 7 zzso The mean angular zzso difference between the lower limbs was zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso New traumatic injuries developed in 3 patients, in whom surgical revision was zzso 1 patient underwent a late zzso The mean difference in zzso measurement was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso International zzso Documentation Committee score was zzso zzso zzso and the mean score on the modified zzso scale was zzso zzso zzso Of the patients, 3 zzso of all zzso could not return to the same level of physical activity as before zzso 

zzso reconstruction by use of the zzso technique in an immature skeleton with a hamstring zzso with careful attention being paid to the technique, resulted in good clinical outcomes and no growth zzso
