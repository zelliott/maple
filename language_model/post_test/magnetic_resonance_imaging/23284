The aim of this study was to determine the neural zzso of different stages of episodic memory function and their zzso by Alzheimer's disease zzso Several decades of work has supported the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in episodic memory zzso However, a more recent work, derived in part from functional zzso studies, has suggested that other brain structures make up a large-scale network that appears to support successful zzso and retrieval of episodic zzso Furthermore, controversy exists as to whether zzso zzso regions support zzso different aspects of memory zzso contextual memory or zzso zzso zzso zzso item memory or zzso There is limited zzso support for these models and most work in zzso only has examined free recall memory zzso We studied the relationship between performance on different stages of the zzso zzso zzso Learning Test zzso a zzso word list learning task, and structural zzso measures in mild zzso zzso zzso measures included zzso volume and cortical thickness of several zzso known to undergo zzso in zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso controlling for age, education, and zzso were performed in 146 mild zzso patients zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso of these zzso similar analyses were performed with additional standardized verbal memory zzso Early immediate recall trials zzso Trial 1 of the zzso were not associated with the size of zzso regions, but correlated most strongly with inferior zzso middle frontal zzso and zzso pole zzso After repeated exposure zzso Trial 5 of the zzso immediate recall was correlated with both zzso and a similar distribution of zzso structures, but most strongly the zzso zzso For delayed recall, only the zzso correlated with zzso In contrast, for delayed recognition discrimination, the zzso zzso correlated more strongly than the zzso no other zzso regions were strongly associated with zzso zzso results were found for immediate and delayed trials of other memory zzso The current results suggest that a richer understanding of the memory deficits in zzso can be gained by examining multiple measures, which tap different aspects of memory zzso Furthermore, the present findings are consistent with models zzso different stages of verbal list learning map onto zzso brain zzso These data have implications for understanding the zzso basis of processes underlying episodic memory, particularly related to a division of labor within the zzso zzso zzso and within the large-scale zzso memory zzso
