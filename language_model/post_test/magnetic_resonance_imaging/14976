Working memory zzso deficits and associated brain dysfunction are among the most well zzso candidate zzso processes in zzso However, previous studies demonstrate inconsistent zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso during zzso performance, as well as zzso structures including the zzso and dysfunctional connectivity among zzso regions in zzso However, no previous study has investigated zzso functional connectivity zzso of zzso and zzso regions using a zzso zzso here we employed this method to assess patterns of cortical and zzso functional connectivity among zzso structures during a standard zzso zzso task performed by 28 schizophrenia zzso and 28 healthy controls zzso zzso group comparisons of blood zzso level dependent zzso responses during the zzso task revealed significantly greater bilateral activity in the zzso in zzso relative to zzso but there was no significant group difference in zzso cortical activity zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso network in the HC group revealed positive zzso zzso between the right zzso and the right zzso and between the right zzso and the right zzso this pattern was absent in zzso In contrast, zzso patients showed negative zzso functional connectivity between the left zzso and the right zzso zzso group comparisons in functional connectivity showed significantly greater zzso zzso between the zzso and bilateral zzso as well as unilaterally between the zzso and the right zzso in zzso zzso suggest a critical dysfunction of zzso connectivity underpinning information retrieval for zzso patients during zzso zzso
