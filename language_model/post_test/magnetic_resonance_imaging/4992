The goal of this study was to determine whether a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol combining carotid zzso plaque and brain imaging can identify features of high-risk acutely symptomatic plaque that correlate with brain zzso 

It has previously been demonstrated that, in zzso patients, zzso can identify features of carotid plaque that are associated with stroke, such as the presence of a large zzso zzso We hypothesized that the early phase zzso zzso after a cerebrovascular event, when risk of recurrence is zzso may be associated with particular plaque characteristics that associate with cerebral zzso 

Eighty-one patients (41 presenting acutely with transient zzso attack zzso or minor stroke and 40 zzso zzso underwent zzso carotid artery zzso on 2 separate occasions, each accompanied by zzso imaging zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging of the zzso 

Complex (American Heart Association zzso type zzso plaques were seen in 22 of 41 patients zzso in the symptomatic group versus 8 of 40 zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso They were caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso 17 of 30 zzso cases of zzso type VI plaque were in vessels with zzso zzso At follow-up scanning zzso weeks zzso only 2 cases of symptomatic zzso type VI plaque showed evidence of full zzso The presence of zzso cap zzso was associated with higher zzso brain injury at presentation and higher total cerebral zzso signal at follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

Early carotid wall zzso in patients experiencing minor stroke or zzso showed a higher proportion of zzso plaques compared with zzso zzso a majority were in arteries of zzso zzso zzso cap zzso was associated with increases in zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso Combined carotid plaque and brain zzso may aid risk zzso and treatment selection in acute stroke and zzso
