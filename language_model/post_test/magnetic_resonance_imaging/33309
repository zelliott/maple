Few articles have been published regarding the imaging characteristics of soft tissue solitary zzso tumors zzso The aim of this study is to describe the zzso features in a series of nine patients and to compare these results with pathological and clinical zzso 

Nine cases of soft tissue zzso confirmed by an experienced tumor zzso were studied with imaging techniques zzso and zzso zzso location, size, zzso local invasion, zzso zzso signal zzso and dynamic zzso patterns were zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso and giant cell forms zzso 

The most common findings were a zzso zzso mass that tended to zzso adjacent zzso The zzso were the most frequent site of zzso The tumors showed high zzso in all imaging zzso The zzso features that correlated better with zzso criteria were tumor size, zzso signal intensity, and zzso zzso of contrast on zzso On dynamic zzso zzso zzso three tumors showed a zzso curve zzso zzso and one a progressive zzso curve zzso zzso The latter recurred twice after extensive local surgery and was classified as a giant cell zzso 

In this study a retrospective review of nine new cases of soft tissue zzso was carried zzso The presence of a large solid, highly zzso mass with a prominent vascular zzso that zzso adjacent structures may suggest the diagnosis of an zzso zzso sequences might help identify those tumors with worse clinical outcome, but a study with a larger series of patients is zzso
