A range of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso techniques are employed to provide novel, zzso zzso of both the structure and transport properties of porous media following a biologically zzso zzso zzso zzso Both a model glass zzso pack and a sandstone rock core were zzso zzso was zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso via a combination of quantitative one-dimensional profiles and three-dimensional images, applied before and after the formation of zzso in order to zzso the spatial distribution of the zzso It was shown through modification and variations of the zzso zzso treatment that differences in the zzso fill would occur but all methods were successful in partially blocking the different porous zzso zzso was seen to occur predominantly at the inlet of the zzso pack, whereas zzso occurred almost zzso along the sandstone zzso Transport properties are zzso using pulse field zzso zzso zzso zzso which provide probability zzso of molecular displacement over a set observation time zzso supplementing conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso the local effect of zzso formation on system zzso and the extent of stagnant region zzso zzso the combination of zzso zzso zzso here provides a zzso for determining the efficacy of a zzso reaction for partially blocking porous zzso
