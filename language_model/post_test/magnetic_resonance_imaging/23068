From its inception zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was envisioned to have significant applications in neurosurgery in general and pediatrics zzso Over the last 9 years we have noted a dramatic shift in our zzso usage from zzso tumors to zzso fluid management and complex zzso Here we present seven selected cases to illustrate lessons learned from our operative experience within the GE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These cases including a zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso as well as zzso zzso complex cyst, and zzso drainage reflect our current use of zzso in pediatric zzso zzso zzso that zzso is optimal for zzso zzso of small tumors with poorly differentiated tumor margins, zzso large tumors with mass effect, and zzso shunt or zzso placement requiring either extreme accuracy or zzso confirmation of zzso zzso We also comment on the legitimate limitations of this technology in certain zzso zzso emphasized are cases in which zzso imaging drives operative decision making, highlighting the unique and zzso abilities of this technology for a subset of pediatric zzso zzso
