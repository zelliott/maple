The calculation of zzso zzso and zzso images from a minimal set of source images is considerably simplified if proper values for the sequence parameters are zzso For the zzso technique a setup is suggested - a ratio of three between the effective repetition time of the zzso and the zzso acquisitions - which not only produces the desired zzso but which also is entirely compatible with normal diagnostic practice and close to optimum for zzso zzso
