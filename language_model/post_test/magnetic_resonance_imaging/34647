The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of zzso fast zzso MR sequences to provide improved zzso ratios for zzso zzso during acquisition times shorter than those used for conventional zzso zzso MR zzso 

We compared zzso ratios of 32 enhancing brain zzso in 25 patients on zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso acquisition time, 4 zzso 12 zzso and on fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4; echo zzso 10 zzso two zzso acquisition time, 1 zzso 45 zzso MR images obtained at zzso T after zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso fast zzso MR images showed approximately a zzso reduction in the zzso ratios of the background white matter without an accompanying reduction in the zzso ratios of the enhancing zzso or zzso when compared with the zzso zzso zzso MR zzso The zzso zzso fast zzso MR images provided a zzso improvement in the zzso ratios of enhancing zzso over the zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso fast zzso MR imaging showed a statistically significant improvement in zzso ratios at much shorter scan times than those used in conventional zzso zzso zzso MR zzso
