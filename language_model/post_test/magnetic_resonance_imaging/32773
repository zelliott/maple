The purpose of this study was to determine influences of cervical spine positions, turning times, and cervical segments on zzso zzso pressure zzso during cervical spinal manipulative therapy zzso 

We simulated cervical zzso with stretching and rotation on 7 fresh adult zzso specimens in the material test system zzso The changes in zzso for cervical zzso disks zzso zzso and zzso during 4 different stages of cervical zzso zzso state, end of the traction stage, turning stage, and finish zzso were zzso Five different cervical positions zzso zzso extension zzso neutral position, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 different turning times zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso using zzso zzso 

The variable tendency of cervical zzso presents a zzso curve during zzso The 4 stages of zzso had significantly different zzso zzso zzso There were also significant differences in zzso between 5 cervical positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 turning times zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 cervical segments zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure was lowest at zzso extension combined with a turning time of zzso zzso 

Different cervical positions, turning times, and cervical segments largely influence zzso during the process of zzso Further research using human subjects should determine if these findings contribute to greater patient zzso safety, and clinical efficacy with zzso
