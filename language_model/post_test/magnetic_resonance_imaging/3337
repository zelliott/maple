An alternative hypothesis has been proposed implicating chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso as a potential cause of multiple sclerosis zzso We aimed to evaluate the zzso of this hypothesis in a controlled animal zzso Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care zzso The jugular veins in zzso mice were zzso zzso zzso and the mice were observed for up to six months after zzso zzso mice zzso and mice induced with experimental zzso zzso zzso were used as negative and positive controls, zzso The animals were evaluated using CT zzso and zzso to assess for structural and zzso zzso Imaging was performed to evaluate for signs of zzso barrier zzso breakdown and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed to assess inflammatory cell populations and zzso There were both structural changes zzso zzso in the jugular zzso drainage and zzso disturbances in the brain on zzso zzso zzso In the zzso mice, zzso zzso and zzso imaging for barrier molecules did not reveal evidence of zzso breakdown zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecular imaging did not reveal signs of increased zzso (all zzso zzso zzso and zzso also did not reveal increase in inflammatory cell zzso or population zzso No evidence of zzso was found, and the mice remained without clinical zzso Despite the structural and zzso changes, we did not identify changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or clinical signs in the zzso group compared to the sham zzso zzso our zzso model does not support zzso as a cause of zzso diseases such as multiple zzso
