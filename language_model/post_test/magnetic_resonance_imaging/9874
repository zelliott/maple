In an zzso study, effects of contingency awareness on zzso responses were assessed in three groups zzso 118 zzso A differential zzso paradigm with visual zzso zzso an electrical zzso stimulus and two zzso was zzso The instructed aware group was informed about the zzso whereas the zzso prevented contingency detection in the unaware zzso The third group zzso zzso was not informed about the zzso but learned them despite the zzso Main effects of contingency awareness on zzso responses emerged in several brain zzso Post hoc tests revealed differential zzso anterior cingulate, zzso and zzso zzso responses in aware conditioning only, whereas the zzso was activated independent of contingency zzso zzso responses of the zzso were specifically observed in learned aware subjects, indicating a role in the development of contingency zzso The zzso zzso showed varying response zzso lateral structures showed higher responses in instructed aware than unaware subjects, the opposite was true for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses emerged only in the two aware zzso These results confirm the independence of zzso zzso responses from contingency awareness and indicate specific neural circuits for different aspects of fear acquisition in unaware, learned aware and instructed aware zzso
