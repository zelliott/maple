zzso zzso zzso is commonly evaluated using zzso zzso to indicate the diagnosis, to determine disease extent, to guide zzso sampling location and to plan zzso With the expanding use of magnetic resonance imaging in veterinary medicine, this zzso has been recently applied for the same zzso The aim of this study was to compare the features of canine zzso zzso using zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso dogs with confirmed zzso zzso underwent both zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The images were reviewed zzso for the zzso and soft tissue features of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging performed very zzso However, zzso of bones bordering the zzso cavity and zzso zzso was found on zzso zzso images more often than on magnetic resonance zzso Small amounts of fluid in the zzso cavity were more often seen on magnetic resonance zzso However, fluid in the frontal zzso was seen equally well with both zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso is satisfactory for evaluation of canine zzso zzso and no clinically relevant benefit is gained using magnetic resonance imaging for zzso zzso without extent into the zzso zzso
