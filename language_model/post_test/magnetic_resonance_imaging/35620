zzso deficits are very common in Parkinson's disease particularly for zzso zzso associated with frontal zzso zzso Previous work has identified deficits in tasks that require zzso control like zzso and reward-based tasks like gambling or reversal zzso However, there is a complex relationship between the specific cognitive problems faced by an individual patient, their stage of disease and zzso zzso We used a zzso continuous performance task during zzso to examine how patients with Parkinson's disease represent the prospect of reward and switch between competing task rules zzso The zzso was not separately cued but was based on the implicit reward relevance of spatial and verbal dimensions of successive compound zzso zzso patients were studied in relative zzso and zzso states, induced by zzso medication withdrawal zzso and zzso stages zzso Patients were able to successfully complete the task and establish a bias to one or other dimension in order to gain zzso However the lateral prefrontal zzso and zzso nucleus showed a zzso zzso relationship between motor disease severity and regional brain zzso zzso treatment led to a shift in this zzso function, supporting the hypothesis of differential zzso in separate motor and cognitive zzso zzso In addition, anterior zzso zzso associated with reward expectation declined with more severe disease, whereas zzso following actual rewards increased with more severe zzso This may facilitate a change in zzso zzso from deferred predicted rewards to immediate actual zzso particularly when on zzso zzso We discuss the implications for investigation and optimal treatment of this common condition at different stages of zzso
