The zzso relaxation rate, zzso measured as a function of the effective field zzso zzso using a zzso zzso pulse train, is well suited to detect zzso exchange in zzso The zzso data are commonly fitted by a zzso zzso a and b) exchange model with four zzso the relative population, zzso the difference in chemical shifts of the two sites, zzso the correlation time for exchange, zzso and the intrinsic relaxation rate zzso zzso relaxation rate in the absence of chemical zzso zzso Although the intrinsic relaxation rates of the two sites, zzso and zzso can zzso they are normally assumed to be the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when fitting zzso zzso The purpose of this investigation is to determine the zzso of the errors in the zzso exchange parameters that are introduced by the assumption that zzso zzso zzso In order to accomplish this goal, we first generated synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso data assuming zzso exchange with zzso not equal zzso and then fitted the synthetic data assuming zzso exchange with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although all the synthetic data generated assuming zzso not equal zzso were well fitted zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso values of zzso and zzso differed from their true values, whereas the zzso values of zzso values did zzso A theoretical analysis using the zzso equation explains these results, and yields simple, general equations for zzso the zzso of the errors in the zzso zzso as a function of zzso - zzso
