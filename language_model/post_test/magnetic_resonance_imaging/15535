To evaluate the relationship between cerebral zzso zzso on zzso and visual suppression of zzso zzso zzso in elderly patients with zzso zzso 

zzso elderly patients with no zzso abnormalities in the zzso region aged zzso years complaining zzso symptoms were zzso Cases with whom a definitive diagnosis of peripheral or central disease could be established were not zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso white matter and zzso white matter were zzso zzso in darkness and zzso zzso using zzso rotation stimuli were recorded to calculate visual suppression zzso zzso between visual suppression rate and zzso scores for severity of zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso in the zzso exhibited significantly lower visual suppression rate than those without zzso in the zzso Multiple zzso analysis showed that visual suppression rate was significantly and zzso correlated with severity of zzso in the zzso zzso but not with patient age, severity of zzso white matter zzso or that of zzso white matter zzso 

In elderly patients with zzso with a zzso history and zzso findings, fixation suppression of zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
