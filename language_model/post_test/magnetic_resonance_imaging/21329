It is not known how zzso zzso zzso childhood adversity zzso interactions that are associated with an increased risk for affective disorders in population studies operate at the neural systems zzso We hypothesized that healthy adolescents at increased genetic and environmental risk for developing mood disorders zzso and zzso would demonstrate increased zzso zzso to emotional stimuli compared to those with only one such risk factor or those with zzso Participants zzso were classified into one of 4 groups dependent on being zzso for the long or short zzso within the zzso zzso region zzso of the zzso gene and exposure to CA in the first 11 years of life zzso or zzso A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation was undertaken which involved viewing zzso face zzso In addition, we assessed the role of other variables hypothesized to influence zzso zzso namely recent negative zzso zzso assessed at ages 14 and 17, current anxiety symptoms and psychiatric zzso We zzso prior findings demonstrating moderation by gene zzso in zzso but found no support for an effect of CA on zzso zzso We also found a significant effect of zzso aged 17 with zzso zzso demonstrating zzso but not interactive effects with zzso A zzso analysis found a zzso interaction in the zzso zzso zzso CA appears to zzso modify neural zzso depending on zzso These results demonstrate that two different forms of environmental zzso interplay with zzso and thereby zzso impact zzso and cortical zzso
