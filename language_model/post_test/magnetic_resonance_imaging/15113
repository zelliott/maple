zzso zzso zzso in the adult central nervous system zzso is a mechanism that provides regions of the brain with more oxygen and zzso upon increased levels of neural zzso zzso changes that go along with neural zzso evoke a blood oxygen zzso zzso signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso that can be used to study brain activity zzso A correct correlation of the zzso signal to neural activity is pivotal to understand this signal in zzso development, health and zzso However, the function of zzso during development is largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso well established model to study zzso zzso Using zzso zzso recordings and zzso zzso we show in the zzso barrel zzso of zzso day 7 zzso and zzso mice in zzso that zzso zzso a zzso shift during the first month of zzso In the mature zzso it is well accepted that cortical sensory processing results in a rise in regional cerebral blood flow zzso We show in zzso animals that zzso decreases during prolonged zzso stimulation and goes along with zzso unit activity zzso zzso In contrast at zzso zzso remains stable during repetitive stimulation and is associated with an increase in zzso Further we characterize in both age groups the responses in zzso to single sensory zzso We suggest that the observed shift in zzso is an important process in cortical development that may be of high relevance for the correct interpretation of brain activity zzso in zzso studies of the immature central nervous system zzso
