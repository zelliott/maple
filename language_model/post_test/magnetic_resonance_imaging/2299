Today, zzso is an integral part of the zzso evaluation of patients suffering from partial zzso These patients frequently show focal zzso abnormalities with potential zzso character and surgical zzso of these zzso is associated with superior zzso outcome as to seizure zzso Apart from easily zzso zzso such as post-traumatic zzso or cerebral zzso as wide variety of mainly small abnormalities can be detected using zzso 

In this study, 484 patients suffering from partial zzso of zzso or frontal onset were evaluated for the zzso of different zzso in this zzso 

All zzso found were included without evaluating their potential zzso which remains to be proven using other procedures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso formation was a major finding in zzso lobe zzso which could be detected as sclerosis zzso zzso zzso or zzso or both zzso In addition and in declining frequency various tumors zzso post-traumatic zzso zzso and focal cortical zzso or other disturbances of cortical integrity zzso were zzso These zzso are zzso with best contrast on different zzso As a consequence it is suggested to acquire sequences in 3 dimensions including a zzso two zzso and zzso zzso sequences and similarly two zzso The application of contrast media can be restricted to special questions, derived either from the first imaging results or from the patients zzso 

Using qualitative data for zzso the sensitivity as to the detection of any focal pathology of a zzso zzso in this population was zzso with zzso for zzso lobe zzso and zzso for frontal lobe zzso zzso zzso of zzso volume or signal seem to be able to increase the sensitivity of the zzso
