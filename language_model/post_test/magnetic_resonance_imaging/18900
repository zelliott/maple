We reviewed the MR appearance of motor zzso of the third zzso division of the zzso nerve zzso and of the zzso zzso 

Six cases of tumor of the head and neck with motor zzso were zzso zzso These comprised two patients with zzso zzso three patients with zzso nerve zzso and one patient with both zzso and zzso zzso The observation was conducted for 6 to 44 months after zzso In zzso muscles, changes in signal intensity in zzso and zzso images, degree of contrast enhancement, and volume of muscle were estimated during the follow-up zzso 

In all cases of zzso zzso the muscles showed no change in signal intensity in the zzso images up to three months after zzso In two cases of zzso zzso the tongues appeared zzso zzso in the zzso images within the first three zzso In one case with zzso zzso and two cases with zzso zzso zzso muscles appeared zzso in the zzso images up to three months after zzso At three months after zzso the signal zzso of all zzso areas increased in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images obtained within the first three months displayed contrast enhancement of all zzso zzso In three cases of zzso zzso the volumes of the affected muscles were reduced after the first three zzso In three cases of zzso zzso the zzso volume of the tongue decreased at three months after zzso 

Up to three months after zzso the zzso muscles appeared zzso in the zzso images and contrast enhancement in zzso zzso images before fatty zzso and volume loss were zzso zzso with the MR appearance of zzso muscles accompanying tumors of the head and neck is important to avoid confusion with inflammatory or zzso zzso
