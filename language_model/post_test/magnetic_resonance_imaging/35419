Numerous improvements in the understanding of the biology of primary brain tumors have been zzso The zzso application of this information to the therapy of these zzso offers promising zzso For any of a number of reasons delivery of these therapies to the target zzso can be zzso zzso enhanced delivery has been established as a zzso that has been shown to circumvent some of the impediments to treatment agent zzso This report described the preliminary zzso use of a balloon tipped zzso with a channel built in for infusion of therapy directly into the zzso A series of 10 zzso were studied using zzso and continuous infusions with the balloon either inflated or zzso The zzso contained zzso to allow imaging of the zzso zzso The character of the cerebral penetration is described ranging from minimal cerebral penetration with zzso balloons used with zzso injections to extensive bilateral penetration using inflated balloons and continuous zzso This data demonstrates the feasibility and potential value of such a system and warrants a more detailed analysis of the device using a wider variety of infusion zzso assessment of larger zzso zzso sizes likely to be solely dependent on zzso and direct comparison to standard zzso zzso zzso
