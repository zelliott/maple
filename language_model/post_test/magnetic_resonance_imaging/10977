zzso zzso plaques exhibit zzso of zzso that may indicate the potential for a future zzso However, current methods for evaluating the stage of an zzso zzso only involve characterizing the level of vessel zzso without zzso which zzso are beginning to zzso Previous work has shown that zzso liquid zzso zzso which carry a high payload of zzso have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting zzso with clinical zzso zzso In this work, the zzso content of the targeted zzso is exploited for the purposes of zzso imaging and zzso to demonstrate a method for quantifiable molecular imaging of zzso in zzso at zzso zzso Additionally, the quantity of bound zzso formulated with different zzso species was calculated using zzso zzso indicate that the high degree of zzso binding to zzso clots and the lack of background zzso signal allow accurate zzso using zzso at zzso zzso as zzso with zzso relaxation rate zzso at zzso T and trace element zzso zzso Finally, the extension of these techniques to a clinically relevant application, the evaluation of the zzso burden within an ex zzso human carotid zzso sample, demonstrates the potential use of these particles for uniquely identifying unstable zzso zzso in zzso
