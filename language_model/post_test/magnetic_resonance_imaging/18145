zzso based analyses of resting state functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso data have been used to map the network organization of the zzso While numerous analyses of resting state brain organization exist, many questions remain zzso The present study examines the stability of findings based on this approach over repeated resting state and working memory state sessions within the same zzso This allows assessment of stability of network zzso within the same state for both rest and working memory, and between rest and working memory as zzso 

zzso scans were performed on five participants while at rest and while performing the zzso working memory task five times each, with task state alternating while they were in the zzso zzso whole brain network analyses were performed on the resulting data along with analyses of functional connectivity in regions associated with resting state and working zzso Network zzso was fairly stable across repeated sessions of the same task, but varied significantly between rest and working zzso In the whole brain analysis, local efficiency, zzso differed significantly between rest and working zzso zzso of network statistics for the zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso revealed significant differences in degree as a function of task state for both regions and in local efficiency for the zzso zzso no significant differences were observed across repeated sessions of the same zzso 

These findings suggest that network zzso is fairly stable within individuals across time for the same state, but also fluid between zzso Whole brain zzso network analyses may prove to be a valuable tool for exploring how functional connectivity changes in response to task zzso
