zzso necrosis can occur during zzso coronary intervention zzso despite optimal zzso pharmacology and careful zzso We investigated the mechanisms of procedural zzso using zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso who underwent complex zzso were zzso All patients were preloaded with zzso and received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as the presence of an area of new zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso zzso was defined as situated at least 10 zzso downstream from the zzso Fifteen vessels zzso had evidence of new zzso after zzso Of these, 8 zzso had the zzso type, and 7 zzso had the adjacent zzso zzso ultrasound showed a significantly greater reduction in plaque volume zzso versus zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the group with zzso zzso compared with patients without new zzso or adjacent zzso In the entire sample, a significant correlation was seen between changes in plaque volume zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso after zzso and the mass of new necrosis measured by magnetic resonance zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso grade assessment of a closed zzso after zzso carried an odds ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso for the occurrence of zzso whereas zzso zzso was associated with an odds ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso However, a closed zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was associated with adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso of plaque material occurs in contemporary zzso of native coronary zzso Efforts to minimize procedural necrosis may require careful review of side branch anatomy and/or use of zzso protection during extensive coronary zzso
