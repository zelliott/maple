In the last few years fetal magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been proposed as a second level technique in the evaluation of fetal brain zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso is highly accurate in illustrating the zzso changes of developing brain and fetal brain abnormalities being a useful procedure when zzso is zzso or zzso Starting from the zzso weeks zzso age zzso zzso can reliably depict fetal brain anatomy and locating pathology, offering a robust and reliable tool in the assessment of fetal zzso zzso In this review both in zzso zzso quantitative and qualitative data about fetal zzso development are presented and compared with zzso zzso Fetal zzso development is zzso steady, and largely comparable to the development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures develop first, whereas zzso zzso zzso develop slowly and largely after zzso
