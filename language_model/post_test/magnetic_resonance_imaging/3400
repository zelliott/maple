The imaging of zzso zzso zzso zzso the first defense against primary tumor zzso has been considered as an important strategy for zzso tracking tumor zzso in zzso In this study, we report the development and application of zzso zzso zzso zzso that integrate multiple functional zzso to facilitate zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After embedding zzso dye zzso the zzso was labeled with zzso contrast agent zzso and zzso zzso through zzso zzso High stability and long zzso retention time of the zzso was confirmed by in zzso zzso which facilitate long-term in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was subsequently achieved to zzso tumor draining zzso up to 3 weeks in a zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso rate, amount of zzso and contrast between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso These findings provide very helpful guidance for the design of robust zzso zzso in zzso mapping and tumor zzso zzso
