The best choice of zzso drainage of pancreatic zzso complicating chronic zzso is currently unknown, with zzso zzso drainage competing with zzso zzso zzso However, recent studies currently recommend the use of both techniques in complex zzso 

We present the case of a 60-year-old male patient with chronic zzso zzso with severe zzso obstruction and multiple zzso pancreatic zzso The patient presented in the emergency department with weight loss, zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging evaluation (by zzso zzso zzso and zzso depicted a zzso common zzso zzso zzso zzso ducts and zzso main pancreatic duct (up to 1 zzso with multiple stones, as well as three zzso at the level of the pancreatic head and one zzso at the level of the pancreatic zzso zzso with direct zzso and zzso drainage of the zzso duct or pancreatic duct was zzso zzso a zzso rendezvous zzso of the pancreatic duct was done, with the zzso placement of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was also possible with the placement of a double zzso zzso zzso in the common zzso zzso zzso evolution was rapidly favorable with the disappearance of the pancreatic zzso on the control CT after 24 zzso 

Our case clearly showed the benefit of combined draining procedures even in cases of chronic zzso with multiple zzso where surgical drainage was previously deemed zzso
