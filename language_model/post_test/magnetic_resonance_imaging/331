Recent developments in the statistical physics of complex networks have been translated to zzso data in an effort to enhance our understanding of human brain structural and functional zzso This review focuses on studies using graph theoretical measures applied to structural zzso diffusion zzso functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Complex network properties have been identified with some consistency in all zzso of zzso data and over a range of spatial and time zzso zzso properties include small zzso high efficiency of information transfer for low wiring cost, zzso and the existence of network zzso zzso and functional network metrics have been found to be zzso and to change with normal zzso Clinical studies, principally in Alzheimer's disease and zzso have identified abnormalities of network zzso in zzso Future work will likely involve efforts to zzso structural and functional networks in integrated models and to explore the zzso of network zzso and cognitive zzso 

zzso theoretical analysis of zzso data is growing rapidly and could potentially provide a relatively simple but powerful quantitative framework to describe and compare whole human brain structural and functional networks under diverse experimental and clinical zzso
