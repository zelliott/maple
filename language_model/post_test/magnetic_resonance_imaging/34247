We compared the ability and zzso of a fast zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence with and without a zzso transfer zzso pulse for detecting and measuring multiple sclerosis zzso abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans from 20 zzso The zzso ratios between zzso and zzso white matter, zzso numbers, zzso volumes and the zzso of such zzso were similar for the two zzso This suggests that the addition of zzso to zzso sequences as currently implemented on standard zzso scanners does not improve the detection of zzso zzso
