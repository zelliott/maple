The anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important neural zzso for the integration of zzso zzso and zzso information, as well as the coordination of responses to anticipated zzso Increased neural zzso within these structures has been observed in individuals with anxiety and depressive zzso Selective zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the most effective and frequently prescribed zzso agents, yet it is not known whether zzso or zzso zzso the effects of these zzso We examined whether zzso administration of a zzso to healthy volunteers zzso zzso in zzso or zzso during zzso an important emotional process underlying zzso Support for this hypothesis would help to understand where and by what process zzso may exert beneficial effects as zzso and would provide further zzso evidence for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a zzso for the development of zzso Fifteen volunteers participated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants completed a pleasant and aversive zzso anticipation task during zzso after taking either zzso (10 zzso or zzso for 21 zzso We found that zzso significantly decreased zzso in bilateral zzso and middle zzso during the anticipation condition irrespective of stimulus zzso and in zzso prefrontal and zzso during anticipation of aversive zzso pleasant zzso zzso insular and zzso zzso in healthy controls during anticipation may be integral to the therapeutic efficacy of zzso and may provide a zzso approach for the use of zzso in the identification of novel zzso agents in patient zzso
