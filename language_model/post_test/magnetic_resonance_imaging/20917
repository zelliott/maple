Studies of cognitive and neural aging have recently provided evidence of a shift from an zzso to zzso cognitive control strategy, linked with temporally extended activity in the prefrontal zzso zzso It has been uncertain, however, whether this age-related shift is unique to zzso and executive control tasks or whether the functional location might vary depending on the particular cognitive processes that are zzso The present study tested whether an zzso shift in aging zzso might emerge in the zzso zzso zzso zzso during a protracted context memory task zzso both anticipatory cue zzso zzso and retrieval probe zzso zzso zzso First, we found reduced zzso activity in older adults during the early retrieval preparation phase coupled with increased zzso activity during the late retrieval completion zzso Second, we found that functional connectivity between zzso and zzso regions was higher during retrieval preparation in young adults but higher during retrieval completion in older adults, suggesting an important interactive relationship between the zzso pattern in zzso and zzso Taken together, these results critically suggest that aging results in temporally lagged activity even in regions not typically associated with cognitive control, such as the zzso
