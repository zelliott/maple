To establish a nude mouse model mimicking zzso zzso of human colon zzso and study its magnetic resonance imaging zzso features and the quality of zzso images zzso 

Human colon zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regions of 2 nude mice, and after successful tumor formation, the generated tumors were harvested and cut into tissue blocks of 1 zzso The tissue blocks were subsequently implanted into the liver of 36 nude mice, from which zzso zzso and zzso were obtained after tumor zzso 

The success rate of zzso tumor zzso was zzso zzso and the tumors grown in the liver measured zzso to 2 zzso in diameter 2 to 6 weeks after zzso All the tumors were clearly zzso on zzso and zzso images, with zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso Compared with the zzso zzso showed conspicuous geometry deformation in 4 mice to cause difficult zzso moderate to slight geometric deformation in 14 mice which remained zzso and no geometric deformation in 18 zzso 

The nude mouse model of zzso zzso of zzso colon cancer cell line, with ideal zzso and tumor growth rate, allows convenient tumor observation on MR zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso findings of the tumor are well consistent with those by pathological examination, suggesting the zzso of this model for molecular imaging research of human colon zzso
