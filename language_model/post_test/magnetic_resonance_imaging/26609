zzso zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies enables to zzso investigate human brain function and to find the direct correlation of these two important measures of brain zzso zzso evaluation of patients with zzso is one of the areas where zzso and zzso integration has considerable clinical relevance for zzso the brain regions generating zzso zzso zzso The conventional analysis of zzso data is based on the visual identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on scalp zzso The zzso of these zzso events, represented as stick functions, with a model of the zzso response, zzso the zzso response function, provides the zzso for general linear model zzso analysis of zzso zzso However, the conventional analysis is not automatic and suffers of some zzso in zzso zzso Here, we present an zzso and automatic approach for combined zzso analysis able to improve zzso identification based on Independent zzso Analysis and zzso zzso zzso signal due to zzso is reconstructed and its zzso power is used as a zzso in zzso The method was validated on simulated data and then applied on real data set consisting of 2 normal subjects and 5 patients with partial zzso In all continuous zzso recording sessions a good quality zzso was obtained allowing the detection of spontaneous zzso and the analysis of the related zzso zzso The main clinical finding in zzso studies of patients with partial zzso is that focal zzso zzso activity was invariably associated with increased focal zzso responses in a zzso related brain zzso Our study extends current knowledge on zzso zzso zzso and confirms previous reports suggesting that zzso zzso associated with slow activity might have a role in zzso the zzso region even in the absence of clear zzso zzso
