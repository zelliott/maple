This study examined the usefulness of the zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso published by the Quality zzso zzso of the American Academy of zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso according to three levels of certainty zzso guidelines, and zzso and suggest indications for the use of zzso zzso 

We reviewed 119 consecutive cases referred for assessment of memory loss to a zzso interdisciplinary zzso We assessed the diagnostic value of laboratory, zzso and zzso studies above the standard history, zzso and mental status zzso We also assessed the sensitivity and specificity of four clinical indicators zzso early symptom zzso zzso course, focal zzso signs or symptoms, and gait zzso for predicting the diagnostic utility of zzso zzso 

The largest changes in diagnostic categories between the standard and the comprehensive diagnostic process was a zzso decrease in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, a zzso increase in the diagnosis of mixed zzso zzso largely to laboratory zzso and a zzso increase in the diagnosis of vascular zzso zzso to zzso The clinical indicators were zzso sensitive and 50% specific in predicting that zzso studies would change the zzso In six cases, meaningful zzso findings were not associated with any clinical indicator zzso false zzso In 43 cases, zzso provided no significant clinical findings despite the presence of an indicator zzso false zzso 

In this convenience sample, diagnostic accuracy was improved to a comparable degree by laboratory and zzso studies, although at a significant difference in zzso Use of the four clinical indicators would have reduced the frequency of zzso studies by zzso but missed clinically meaningful information in zzso Although imperfect, the zzso zzso represent a first step toward improving the cost effectiveness of the zzso zzso
