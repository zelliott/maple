A method is described for zzso zzso data sets using singular value decomposition zzso Images are acquired using a multiple zzso or zzso zzso and the variation of the signal with echo time zzso in all zzso is subjected to zzso analysis to determine the components of the signal zzso The least significant components are associated with small singular values and tend to characterize the noise zzso zzso a zzso zzso filter to the singular values suppresses the noise components in a way that zzso zzso the underlying zzso zzso The result is a reduction in noise in the individual TE images with minimal degradation of the spatial resolution and zzso Phantom and in zzso results are zzso
