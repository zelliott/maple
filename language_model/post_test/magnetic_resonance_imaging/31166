zzso zzso or zzso of pain as awful, horrible and zzso is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the experience of zzso The purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between zzso as measured by the zzso Strategies zzso zzso zzso and brain responses to blunt pressure assessed by functional zzso among 29 subjects with zzso Since zzso has been suggested to augment pain perception through enhanced attention to painful zzso and heightened emotional responses to pain, we hypothesized that zzso would be positively associated with zzso in structures believed to be involved in these aspects of pain zzso As zzso is also strongly associated with depression, the influence of depressive zzso was statistically zzso zzso scores of zzso controlling for depressive zzso were significantly associated with increased activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Analysis of subjects classified as high or low zzso based on a median split of residual zzso scores, showed that both groups displayed significant increases in zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso although the magnitude of zzso was twice as large among high zzso Both groups also had significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and zzso High zzso displayed unique zzso in the zzso anterior zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso Both groups also displayed significant zzso zzso in zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and superior and inferior frontal zzso These findings suggest that pain zzso independent of the influence of depression, is significantly associated with increased activity in brain areas related to anticipation of pain zzso frontal cortex, zzso attention to pain zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso emotional aspects of pain zzso closely connected to zzso and motor zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso influences pain perception through altering attention and zzso and zzso emotional responses to zzso zzso associated with zzso in motor areas of the brain may reflect expressive responses to pain that are associated with greater pain zzso
