To describe magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings at long-term follow-up after rotator cuff zzso tear using standard zzso sequences without fat zzso 

zzso patients aged zzso underwent zzso examination zzso years after surgery for zzso zzso Standard sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso planes were zzso The zzso including zzso and zzso zzso was independently evaluated by two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and narrowing of the zzso space were zzso The clinical outcome was evaluated with the zzso score and compared with the zzso zzso 

The zzso tear was traumatic in 18 zzso patients and degenerative in 10 zzso At zzso 11 zzso had normal zzso zzso with good clinical zzso Four zzso patients had painful zzso without zzso zzso A zzso zzso tear was found in 7 zzso patients and a partial tear in 6 zzso In one patient with a zzso zzso and in two with partial zzso zzso was found in another of the zzso zzso The zzso space was narrowed in 13 zzso of the zzso A narrowing of the zzso space correlated with zzso zzso 

The zzso may be evaluated with standard zzso sequences without fat zzso at long-term zzso A normal appearance of the zzso is correlated with good clinical outcome, while zzso and zzso are associated with zzso
