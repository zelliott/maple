The relevance of zzso processes has been frequently discussed and studied in the context of zzso zzso Experimental and clinical studies indicate that directing attention to either of the two simultaneously presented zzso zzso but especially to the zzso stimulus increases the requirements for zzso zzso Here, we extend this view by reporting the results of a zzso and a functional zzso imaging zzso experiment designed to zzso the involvement of zzso processes also in a zzso zzso zzso It was zzso that zzso presented pairs of zzso syllables would provide different demands for zzso processes as a function of the zzso overlap of the two zzso zzso in zzso 1 it was shown that zzso syllables of high zzso zzso and zzso as opposed to low zzso overlap zzso zzso and zzso produce significantly faster and more correct answers, and are more often perceived as one zzso In zzso 2 it was further shown that pairs of low as compared to high zzso overlap trigger a more pronounced zzso predominately in zzso zzso brain regions, namely left zzso inferior zzso zzso in zzso motor and zzso zzso as well as in the inferior zzso zzso Taken together, zzso and functional data indicate a stronger involvement of zzso cognitive control in the processing of zzso as opposed to zzso stimulus zzso This supports the notion that zzso zzso zzso processes also are involved in a zzso zzso zzso
