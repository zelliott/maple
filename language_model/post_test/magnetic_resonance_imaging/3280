Prospective study of 30 patients suspected of suffering from far lateral zzso disk zzso 

To assess the diagnostic and clinical value of a new technique zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in patients with far lateral disk zzso 

No studies have reported regarding the usefulness of zzso images in assessing far lateral disk nor correlated it with clinical zzso 

We evaluated zzso zzso of 30 patients, whom we suspected of suffering from far lateral disk zzso Using an assessment scale, 5 observers independently examined the zzso We analyzed observer agreement and the zzso of each zzso 

We found complete match and observer agreement for zzso zzso for diagnosing far lateral disk zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso revealed the zzso severity on the basis of the nerve root exit zone angle zzso 

zzso is an appropriate diagnostic tool and reduces the chance of zzso in far lateral disk zzso Furthermore, through the use of this technique, we can evaluate zzso clinical zzso
