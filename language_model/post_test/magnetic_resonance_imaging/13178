zzso high oxygen extraction fraction zzso in acute stroke is of considerable interest to depict the zzso zzso Being sensitive to zzso zzso zzso has been suggested as a potential marker of high zzso 

We compared zzso images from zzso arrival zzso scans against quantitative zzso zzso zzso in 5 patients studied zzso h after onset of carotid territory zzso zzso and zzso signal were obtained in the zzso with significantly high zzso 

All patients showed increased zzso No significant relationship between zzso and zzso signal was found either within or between zzso 

We found no indication that zzso zzso in the way implemented in this investigation was sensitive to high zzso in acute zzso
