To assess the zzso of zzso pathology in young children who had brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate apparently isolated zzso noted within the first few years of zzso 

zzso institutional review of such children (up to 5 years zzso 

Twenty-six patients (17 boys, 9 zzso were zzso zzso was clinically bilateral in 22 zzso and unilateral in 4 zzso zzso cases zzso were described as horizontal zzso zzso 5 zzso as horizontal zzso zzso 2 zzso as vertical zzso zzso and 1 each as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three of the 26 patients zzso had significant zzso findings and all three had zzso zzso nerve head zzso noted during clinical zzso zzso was horizontal zzso in two patients and rotary in the zzso 

The zzso nerve head should be carefully assessed for signs of zzso in young children with zzso and, if present, brain zzso should be zzso Otherwise, isolated early childhood zzso is unlikely to be associated with zzso zzso Clinical description of zzso did not predict zzso pathology in this zzso
