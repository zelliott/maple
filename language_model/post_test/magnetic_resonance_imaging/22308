The zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain maps with respect to the sites of zzso zzso is still zzso One source of zzso error may be zzso with large signal zzso since such zzso may be expected to zzso large vessels, running remote from the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, zzso was used to determine the zzso of zzso zzso in a simple finger tapping zzso The zzso accuracy of conventional zzso depending on zzso signal enhancement was investigated relative to the zzso zzso The results show a deterioration of zzso zzso with increasing signal zzso related to increased contributions from large zzso We conclude that zzso data analysis should exclude large signal zzso and that zzso may help to improve zzso brain mapping results in a zzso zzso
