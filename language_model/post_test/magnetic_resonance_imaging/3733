The zzso zzso zzso system zzso is known to undergo moderate neurodegenerative changes during normal aging as well as severe zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso However, there is a controversy regarding how the zzso zzso in zzso relates to early and zzso stages of the zzso In zzso imaging studies on the structural integrity of the zzso in normal and zzso aging are zzso 

We applied automated zzso techniques in combination with zzso image zzso and a zzso map of zzso zzso zzso zzso to a large zzso data set of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans, covering the whole adult age range zzso years; zzso zzso zzso as well as patients with very mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinically manifest zzso zzso Clinical zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso For comparison, we investigated zzso volume using automated zzso 

Volume of the zzso declined from early adulthood on, and zzso aggravated in advanced zzso Volume reductions in very mild zzso were most pronounced in zzso parts of the nucleus zzso of zzso whereas in zzso zzso was more extensive and included the whole zzso In clinically manifest zzso the diagnostic accuracy of zzso volume reached the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso zzso in zzso occurs against a background of age-related zzso and that exacerbated zzso in zzso can be detected at earliest stages of cognitive zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso may become a useful tool to assess zzso zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso
