zzso of zzso fluid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are used to determine the functional significance of zzso zzso Type I zzso zzso higher peak zzso are found in adult patients with zzso than in adult control zzso In addition, it appears that higher zzso zzso are found in pediatric patients with zzso than in adult zzso Variations in zzso zzso across age groups in healthy individuals, however, have not been systematically zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 10 pediatric patients after induction of zzso to evaluate conditions thought not to affect zzso flow in the zzso zzso The peak zzso and zzso zzso were plotted with respect to age and compared with zzso obtained in a group of 10 healthy adult zzso zzso between the adult and pediatric groups were tested for significance by using the Student zzso Peak zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in the pediatric group and from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso A trend line fitted to the data showed a decrease in zzso with age in the first two decades of life, and little change zzso zzso in the pediatric and adult groups were significant at a level of zzso 

Peak zzso zzso vary significantly with zzso To determine the zzso of a zzso flow zzso it must be compared with zzso zzso zzso
