This study aimed to review the use of two methods of zzso zzso a zzso zzso system where zzso is diluted in zzso zzso using the rule of six zzso 1 ] or an infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso compatible zzso System zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine the difference, if any, between the total amount of drug delivered, the impact on vital signs, sedation status and discharge time of the zzso With Institutional Review Board zzso approval, 140 children aged 0 to 18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists zzso physical status I or II requiring sedation for zzso zzso brain zzso zzso Imaging zzso examination were included in the zzso A total of 70 patients in each group were zzso The zzso zzso zzso total amount of zzso infused was significantly less in the infusion pump group zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were also significant mean differences in awakening times zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and discharge times zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in the infusion pump group versus the zzso infusion zzso This study demonstrates that both infusion techniques preserve zzso stability and are associated with minimal zzso The use of an infusion zzso which consistently maintains accurate zzso reduces the amount of zzso judged adequate by the zzso to achieve sedation in zzso This leads to a more consistently faster emergence and early discharge after sedation in children undergoing zzso zzso
