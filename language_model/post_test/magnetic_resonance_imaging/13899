The association between regional measures of cortical zzso and zzso zzso dysfunction was studied in 35 multiple sclerosis zzso zzso Patients underwent neurological examination, zzso and zzso zzso Blind quantitative zzso analysis yielded total zzso zzso area zzso and third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rated by blind visual inspection, was more extensive in superior frontal and zzso zzso than in other zzso No zzso measures were correlated with depression zzso zzso and zzso were significantly correlated with each zzso zzso zzso zzso measures for bilateral superior frontal zzso were retained in zzso models predicting zzso in verbal learning, spatial learning, attention, and conceptual zzso The authors conclude that cerebral zzso predicts zzso impairment while accounting for the influence of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso most susceptible to zzso and cognitive changes in zzso are the right and left superior frontal zzso
