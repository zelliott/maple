We compared the effectiveness of zzso zzso transfer contrast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso in detecting tumor zzso 

zzso cells were transplanted in the zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso To induce various degrees of tumor zzso the rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) zzso 2) localized zzso 3) zzso zzso and 4) zzso plus zzso zzso At day 7 after treatment, the rats were zzso using a zzso zzso with 1) zzso zzso echo sequence zzso zzso degrees with and without zzso transfer contrast zzso 2) zzso zzso and 3) zzso zzso pulse zzso The rats were then sacrificed and zzso specimens were prepared using MR images as zzso zzso and ratios of signal intensity after zzso to signal intensity before zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and viable tumors were determined in 10 zzso 

Compared with standard zzso images, zzso images with zzso provided better contrast between the zzso zzso and normal zzso However, zzso values were more useful than zzso ratios in distinguishing zzso areas from viable zzso The zzso values of zzso necrosis and zzso tissue were significantly different from that of viable zzso No significant difference between the zzso ratios of the different zzso zzso and normal liver was zzso 

zzso zzso transfer contrast zzso was inferior to zzso zzso in distinguishing zzso from viable tumors in rat zzso using the pulse sequences zzso and none of the sequences studied was thought to be reliable enough for this zzso
