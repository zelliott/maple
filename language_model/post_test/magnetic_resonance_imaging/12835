In this retrospective study, we assessed tumor growth patterns as zzso on MR images, and examined whether tumor growth patterns correlate with zzso zzso In addition, we also evaluated the relationship between patient outcome and tumor growth pattern in the whole study cohort and in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed 347 patients with zzso stage zzso and zzso stage II zzso that was treated with surgery and zzso chemotherapy at our zzso Patients were divided into three groups based on tumor growth pattern, zzso concentric, zzso and zzso zzso zzso exact test was performed to analyze correlations between tumor growth patterns and zzso zzso zzso zzso survival and overall survival were evaluated using zzso and zzso zzso 

In terms of tumor growth patterns, 225 patients zzso had a concentric, 71 zzso an eccentric and 51 zzso a zzso zzso zzso tumors were usually small and responded well to chemotherapy, whereas concentric tumors were large and responded zzso The zzso zzso of tumor growth patterns were confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso Among zzso stage zzso patients, no survival difference was found according to growth pattern, whereas in zzso stage zzso patients, zzso tumors were associated with significantly better survival than concentric zzso 

zzso growth pattern was found to be an independent zzso factor in stage II zzso Moreover, zzso growing tumors were associated with better survival in zzso stage zzso zzso Our results suggest that tumor growth pattern could be used as an indicator of zzso therapy when combined with other zzso zzso
