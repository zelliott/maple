The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and extent of zzso zzso in patients with isolated left zzso zzso zzso and to determine its relation to clinical status and zzso zzso zzso 

The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso database of our institution was searched for all patients with a first diagnosis of isolated zzso The diagnosis of isolated zzso was based on the presence of standard cardiac zzso and clinical zzso For each patient, zzso and zzso cardiac MR images were zzso to evaluate zzso zzso function and the prevalence and extent of late zzso enhancement zzso a surrogate of zzso zzso A total of 42 patients zzso age 46 zzso 20 years, zzso zzso were zzso Late zzso enhancement was observed in 23 zzso patients with isolated zzso occupying zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Both the presence and extent of zzso were significantly related to the number of abnormal clinical features zzso symptomatic status, resting zzso zzso and 24 h zzso monitoring zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso was more prevalent and extensive in patients with zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso 50% compared with patients with zzso zzso 50% (90 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso analysis, both the presence and extent of zzso zzso were independently related to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is related to clinical disease severity and zzso zzso dysfunction in isolated zzso
