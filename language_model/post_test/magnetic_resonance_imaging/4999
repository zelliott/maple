The zzso application of zzso zzso has been shown to influence behavioral and neural zzso of social zzso These effects are probably zzso by genetic variations within the OT zzso One potential candidate could be the zzso zzso which codes for a zzso protein engaged in OT zzso zzso A common variation in this gene zzso was recently found to be associated with zzso spectrum disorders zzso Using an imaging zzso approach, we studied differential effects of an zzso OT application on neural processing of social stimuli in 55 healthy young men depending on their zzso gene zzso in a zzso zzso crossover zzso zzso had a significant influence on both behavioral and zzso measures of social zzso zzso risk zzso carriers showed slower reaction times zzso and higher zzso of left zzso zzso during visual processing of social zzso Under OT zzso differences between zzso were more evident (though not statistically significantly zzso and zzso were accelerated in zzso risk zzso zzso According to our data, zzso mainly influences zzso zzso zzso an area which has been widely discussed in zzso zzso OT seems to zzso this effect by enhancing zzso differences between zzso groups, which suggests an interaction between genetic makeup and OT availability on zzso zzso zzso These results support recent approaches to apply OT as a pharmacological treatment of zzso zzso
