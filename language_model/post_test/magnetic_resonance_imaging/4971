To zzso the movement of pancreatic juice zzso by using an zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this zzso A zzso technique of zzso labeling inversion pulse zzso technique was applied using both zzso and selective inversion zzso to label, or tag, pancreatic juice to move out of the zzso Ten normal zzso men, two zzso age range, zzso years; mean age, 35 zzso and two zzso conditions were examined on a commercially available zzso zzso MR zzso with zzso zzso zzso All images were evaluated by two zzso to assess depiction of the pancreatic juice movement or pancreatic juice zzso as compared to the pancreatic duct or the common zzso duct on zzso obtained before zzso zzso 

The zzso pancreatic juice was satisfactory zzso after applying the pulse zzso zzso zzso of pancreatic juice movement, including normal pancreatic juice movement and zzso from the main pancreatic duct into the common zzso zzso was possible by using the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of pancreatic juice movement is possible by using the zzso MR imaging zzso zzso
