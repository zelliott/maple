zzso and zzso outcomes of zzso term zzso are difficult to predict applying clinical or laboratory zzso In this study, we investigated the association of MR zzso zzso results with zzso status at age 12 zzso 

Thirty-one term zzso who were enrolled in a prospective study of the utility of MR imaging for the determination of zzso and zzso status, underwent zzso zzso MRS of the zzso zzso and zzso boundary zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were calculated and tested for association with zzso scores and Mental Development Index of the zzso Scores of zzso Development obtained at age 12 zzso 

zzso zzso and diminished zzso were the most common findings in infants with zzso and zzso abnormalities at age 12 zzso Although many ratios had statistically significant associations with outcome zzso the highest significance was obtained with zzso ratios in the zzso zzso A zzso finding was seen in a patient who was born after a zzso gestation period zzso zzso but normal zzso status at 12 zzso and in three patients with apparent watershed injury zzso watershed zzso but normal zzso status at 12 zzso A zzso MRS finding zzso zzso but abnormal zzso was seen in a patient who had an apparent prenatal zzso 

zzso MRS appears to be a useful tool for assessing brain injury in zzso who have suffered zzso or zzso zzso with zzso age and imaging findings are essential for proper interpretation of the zzso Patients with apparent watershed injuries may have normal zzso status at age 12 zzso
