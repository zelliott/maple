To examine the long-term effects of stress experienced early in gestation on the programming of offspring feeding behaviors and energy balance, pregnant mice were exposed to stress during early pregnancy zzso zzso and adult offspring examined on zzso and high fat diets for long-term zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso type 2 (11 zzso and zzso growth factor 2 zzso expression was measured to determine the possible zzso contribution of prenatal stress zzso on fetal programming of zzso growth and development during early zzso zzso mice showed a zzso zzso when on zzso zzso zzso treatment differences were ameliorated when adult mice were on a high fat zzso Interestingly, zzso male mice also had significantly reduced body weights compared to control males on both zzso and high fat zzso Body composition analyses revealed reduced body fat and increased lean mass in zzso mice on the high fat diet, but no differences were detected in plasma zzso or zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso zzso examination of gene expression in embryonic day 12 zzso found that early zzso was associated with increased zzso expression and zzso effects of stress on 11 zzso supporting specific aspects of early zzso These studies suggest that the long-term effects of stress during pregnancy on programming of feeding behavior and energy zzso begin much earlier in development than previously zzso
