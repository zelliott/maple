zzso zzso is a rare cause of back pain, and spontaneous zzso zzso has not been reported zzso 

We describe a patient with acute low back pain and signs of zzso nerve root zzso due to zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso signs of zzso led to a search for an infectious cause, which was negative, and her symptoms responded rapidly to zzso treatment zzso Her symptoms recurred 18 months later, and further imaging studies again revealed zzso zzso but with a changed zzso Her symptoms were relieved once more by zzso treatment zzso 

We propose that zzso zzso secondary to zzso zzso is the main cause of acute back pain in this zzso A possible mechanism may be the zzso effects of calcium zzso or zzso crystal deposition within the zzso zzso
