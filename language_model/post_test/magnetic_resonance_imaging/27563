The surgical management of pancreatic zzso tumors in patients with multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso is controversial and complicated by the fact that these tumors are frequently zzso The degree of tumor zzso is determined by weighing the risk of zzso or tumor recurrence against the risks of zzso zzso with complete zzso zzso 

A retrospective review was performed identifying 4 patients with zzso and pancreatic zzso tumors treated with pancreatic zzso over a zzso period at our zzso 

Mean age at operation was 35 zzso zzso approach was determined by size of zzso and presence of zzso zzso and zzso were performed in all zzso While zzso identified a greater number of tumors when compared to zzso zzso 5 versus 1), both studies zzso underestimated the total number of tumors found on final zzso Three patients underwent zzso total zzso for zzso disease with diffuse pancreatic involvement, finding a median of 12 zzso One patient underwent zzso zzso zzso for a presumed single pancreatic tail mass, but was found to have zzso disease on final pathology consisting of 7 zzso The average number of tumors found on final pathology was zzso with an average size of zzso zzso The median number of zzso zzso analyzed was zzso zzso zzso disease was present in all 4 zzso No major zzso complications were zzso 

In patients with zzso and pancreatic zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso extent of disease and total zzso should be considered for complete tumor zzso
