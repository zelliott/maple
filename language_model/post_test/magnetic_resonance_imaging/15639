zzso within the visual zzso can be influenced by the emotional zzso of a zzso but it is not clear whether such cortical activity is modulated by the affective status of the zzso This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine the relationship between affect ratings on the Positive and zzso zzso Schedule and activity within the zzso zzso of 13 zzso women while viewing images of high calorie and low calorie zzso zzso analyses revealed that when participants viewed high calorie foods, Positive zzso correlated significantly with activity within the zzso zzso and zzso cortex, whereas zzso zzso was unrelated to visual zzso zzso In contrast, during presentations of low calorie foods, affect ratings, regardless of zzso were unrelated to zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest a mechanism zzso positive affective state may affect the early stages of sensory processing, possibly influencing subsequent zzso experience of a zzso
