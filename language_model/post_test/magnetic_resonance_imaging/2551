To compare an zzso zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence with fast zzso zzso sequences in MR imaging of brain zzso 

Fast zzso and zzso images of 34 consecutive patients over the age of 50 years or with suspected zzso disease were reviewed independently by two zzso for the number of zzso less than 5 zzso and greater than or equal to 5 zzso and for zzso zzso zzso matter zzso and extent of zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso also assessed for the presence of zzso and extent of motion zzso 

zzso patient, the mean number of zzso or larger zzso detected on fast zzso images zzso relative to the number detected on zzso images zzso was not statistically zzso For zzso less than 5 zzso fast zzso images showed more zzso zzso than zzso images did zzso The fast zzso images were better at depicting zzso matter zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signal zzso Of four zzso zzso zzso seen on fast zzso images, none was detected on zzso zzso 

Although the zzso technique might be useful for rapid imaging of the brain, our study shows a diminished sensitivity for the detection of zzso less than 5 zzso in diameter and for zzso zzso zzso
