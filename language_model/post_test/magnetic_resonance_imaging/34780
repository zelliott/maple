To determine the zzso appearance and topographical distribution of primary cerebral zzso zzso zzso 

CT and MR examinations of 68 patients with primary cerebral NHL were zzso The zzso were classified by the zzso zzso and zzso data, as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type B zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tended to predominate in the zzso lobe zzso and the corpus zzso zzso while zzso zzso were mainly distributed in the frontal lobe zzso About 2/3 of all zzso showed a zzso zzso Important for differential diagnosis, zzso involvement was proved in zzso of these zzso In the remaining 26 patients with a solitary lymphoma, a zzso location could be detected in only 8 zzso Central zzso were frequent in zzso patients zzso zzso but rare in the zzso patients zzso zzso On zzso zzso MR images, zzso zzso zzso gave a signal that was zzso with, or lower than, that of the zzso white matter, while zzso zzso zzso gave a higher zzso 

The zzso finding of zzso brain zzso with zzso involvement is relatively specific for primary cerebral zzso However, zzso on the basis of the CT or MR imaging results is not yet zzso
