We explored the effect of zzso stress and its possible clinical implications in different groups of zzso patients with chronic right zzso zzso pressure overload due to zzso heart zzso zzso zzso and minimally symptomatic patients with chronic RV pressure overload were zzso 24 patients with systemic right zzso (16 surgically corrected zzso of the great arteries zzso zzso or zzso 8 zzso corrected zzso 23 patients with chronic pressure overloaded zzso right zzso and 11 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was performed both at baseline and during zzso stress to determine RV volumes and ejection zzso At zzso RV ejection fraction in patients with surgically corrected zzso was significantly lower than in controls zzso zzso zzso vs 70 zzso zzso p zzso zzso During zzso stress, RV ejection fraction increased significantly in controls and patient groups except for patients with pressure overloaded zzso right zzso RV stroke volume increased in controls (21 zzso zzso p zzso zzso RV stroke volume remained unchanged in patients with zzso corrected zzso and surgically corrected zzso (2 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A significant RV stroke volume decrease was observed in patients with zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The changes in RV stroke volume were accompanied by a significant decrease in RV zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in patients with zzso right zzso and in patients with surgically corrected zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In controls and in patients with zzso corrected zzso there was no change in RV zzso volume (3 zzso zzso p zzso zzso -5 zzso zzso p zzso zzso There is a clear zzso in response to zzso zzso stress between different groups of patients with chronic RV pressure zzso Our data suggest impaired filling in surgically corrected zzso and decreased zzso in patients with chronic pressure overloaded zzso right zzso zzso stress zzso may facilitate follow-up of RV zzso in patients with chronic RV pressure overload due to zzso heart zzso
