zzso cause and effect is a fundamental aspect of human zzso When shown videos of simple two-dimensional shapes zzso humans experience one object causing the other to move, zzso one zzso ball seeming to hit and move the zzso The impression of causality can also occur when people attribute social interactions to moving zzso Whether the judgment of social and physical causality engages distinct or shared neural networks is not zzso In a functional magnetic imaging zzso study, participants were presented with two types of dynamic zzso a blue ball zzso with a red ball zzso physical zzso and a blue ball zzso zzso passing a red ball zzso zzso without making contact zzso social zzso Participants judged zzso relationships zzso or movement direction zzso control zzso in both video types, resulting in four conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso We found common neural zzso for physical and social causality judgments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the right zzso frontal zzso right inferior zzso zzso the right supplementary motor area, and bilateral zzso For social zzso judgments zzso zzso zzso we found distinct neural activity in the right zzso junction zzso These results provide evidence for a common neural network underlying judgments of causality that apply to both physical and social zzso The results also indicate that social causality judgments recruit additional neural resources in an area critical for determining zzso and zzso
