zzso pursuit eye movements are evoked by retinal image motion of visible moving objects and can also be driven by the internal representation of a target due to zzso mechanisms zzso zzso zzso To delineate the corresponding zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging at zzso T was applied during smooth pursuit at 10 degrees zzso with continuous target presentation and target zzso for 1 s to 16 right-handed healthy zzso Eye movements were assessed during scanning sessions by zzso reflection zzso zzso pursuit performance was optimal when the target was visible but decreased to a residual zzso of about zzso of the zzso observed during continuous target zzso Random effects analysis of the imaging data yielded an zzso pattern for smooth pursuit in the absence of a visual target (in contrast to continuous target zzso which included a number of cortical areas in which zzso information is available such as the frontal eye field, the superior zzso zzso the anterior and the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cortex, and also the supplementary and the zzso eye field, the zzso zzso the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso areas and the zzso zzso We suggest that cortical mechanisms such as zzso zzso attention and zzso zzso zzso control and working memory are of special importance for maintaining smooth pursuit eye movements in the absence of a visible zzso
