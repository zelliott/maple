In the present study, functional zzso of the frontal lobe and zzso system could be uncovered as emotion processing neural zzso zzso was used to test the influence of induced emotions on a zzso zzso cognitive zzso 

6 zzso versus 7 controls were analyzed by zzso with a zzso after emotion zzso 

zzso induction zzso influenced cortical zzso patterns in emotion related brain areas like the zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso 

zzso neural areas of emotion regulation in zzso show zzso zzso patterns in zzso The neural basis of emotional impairment could be a dysfunctional zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso
