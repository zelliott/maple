We present a novel method for the automatic zzso and grading of liver zzso based on zzso zzso changes measured zzso from functional zzso zzso scans combined with zzso and zzso The supervised learning method automatically creates a zzso and grading model for liver zzso grade from training zzso It zzso a statistical model of liver zzso by evaluating the signal intensity time course and local zzso in zzso zzso scans acquired during the breathing of air, zzso dioxide, and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso support zzso machine zzso zzso Two experimental studies on 162 slices from 34 mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yield zzso separation accuracy between healthy and zzso zzso graded subjects, and an overall accuracy of zzso for healthy, zzso and zzso zzso These results outperform existing zzso methods that can discriminate between healthy and zzso zzso zzso
