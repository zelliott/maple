zzso zzso zzso mapping zzso is a validated tool to evaluate right zzso zzso zzso When using the zzso zzso system zzso Jude Medical, St Paul, zzso geometry reconstruction by dragging the mapping zzso zzso allows for quicker acquisition of a large number of points and better definition of zzso but it is not validated for zzso zzso 

This study evaluates the feasibility and accuracy of zzso 

Thirteen patients zzso age 38 zzso 12 zzso with RV zzso and an apparently normal heart underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso The 2 maps were compared in terms of mapping procedural time, radiation time, and total number of points zzso We finally compared the number and characteristics of zzso areas on each patient's zzso zzso and cardiac zzso 

zzso required significantly shorter mapping and radiation times in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Furthermore, zzso was based on a significantly higher density of points in comparison to zzso zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso zzso 38, P zzso Taking into consideration the total number of RV regions zzso the zzso and zzso disagreed in 2 of 65 zzso regions zzso zzso zzso which only zzso identified as zzso areas and indeed corresponded to wall motion abnormalities on zzso 

zzso maps obtained through RV geometry acquisition have accuracy comparable to that of conventional point-by-point mapping in detecting zzso areas, have a good correlation with zzso wall motion zzso and allow a significant reduction in procedural time and zzso zzso
