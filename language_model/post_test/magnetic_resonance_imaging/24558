Twin studies have long suggested a genetic influence on zzso variations in mathematical abilities, and candidate genes have been identified by zzso association zzso However, the zzso of the brain regions under genetic influence during number manipulation is still zzso Here we investigated zzso data from a group of 19 zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso adult twin pairs, scanned during a mental calculation zzso We examined both the zzso and the degree of functional zzso in regions of interest zzso centered on the main activated zzso zzso was first investigated by comparing the respective zzso and zzso zzso Then, genetic and environmental contributions were jointly estimated by fitting a zzso model classically used in twin zzso We found that a subset of the activated network was under genetic influence, encompassing the bilateral zzso superior zzso zzso zzso the right zzso zzso zzso and a left superior frontal zzso An additional region of the left inferior zzso zzso zzso whose zzso correlated with a behavioral calculation score, also presented higher similarity between zzso than between zzso zzso thus offering a plausible zzso basis for the zzso inheritance of math zzso Finally, the main impact of the shared environment was found in the zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso These maps of genetic and environmental contributions provide precise candidate zzso for further genetic association zzso and illuminate how zzso and education shape the development of number processing zzso
