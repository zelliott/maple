To investigate blood zzso of zzso zzso using dynamic zzso zzso 

Dynamic MR studies were performed for cases of acute zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso A total of 42 patients (71 zzso zzso were zzso Five types of zzso zzso zzso were defined zzso nearly no enhancement zzso zzso slow enhancement zzso B), a rapid contrast zzso followed by an equilibrium phase zzso zzso a rapid contrast zzso followed by early zzso zzso zzso and a rapid contrast zzso with a second zzso slope zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with or without fracture had a higher peak enhancement percentage and steeper enhancement slope than those of chronic zzso zzso but had no difference as compared to those of acute zzso zzso The type D curve had high positive zzso value for zzso group zzso and the type E curve had high positive zzso value for benign zzso fracture zzso 

Type D and E zzso are valuable in the differentiation of benign and zzso zzso zzso
