Many studies have reported zzso effects for brain zzso however, no study has investigated whether zzso zzso intensity zzso zzso correction processing results in reduced system dependency when using an zzso zzso To address this zzso the present study assessed whether zzso correction processing provides reduced system dependency in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso images of the brain were obtained from 21 healthy participants, by using five magnetic resonance zzso After image zzso using the zzso zzso zzso 5 software, we measured the structural volume of the segmented images with the zzso zzso We applied six different zzso levels zzso 10, zzso zzso zzso 0, zzso 10 with zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso 0 with zzso to each set of zzso The structural volume change ratio zzso was defined as the change ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume - mean volume of five magnetic resonance zzso zzso mean volume of five magnetic resonance zzso for each zzso zzso 

A low change ratio was synonymous with lower system zzso The results showed that the images with the zzso correction had a lower change ratio compared with those without the zzso zzso 

The present study is the first zzso zzso study to show that the precision of zzso zzso improves when using zzso zzso zzso correction for signal intensity zzso is strongly advised for zzso or zzso imaging zzso
