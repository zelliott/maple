zzso zzso zzso echo sequences offer the advantage of volume imaging within a few minutes scanning time and creating thin zzso zzso An zzso sequence zzso zzso 40) was evaluated for its potential to detect zzso of the zzso cruciate ligaments, and zzso cartilage in 80 patients compared to zzso as the zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso for zzso zzso and a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso for zzso of the cruciate zzso Based upon zzso criteria normal cartilage was identified in zzso but zzso of different depths zzso zzso was poorly zzso All zzso defects zzso 4) were zzso zzso of mean signal intensity zzso confidence zzso was more useful to discriminate normal from abnormal cartilage zzso zzso This method promises the capability to detect early stages of zzso in zzso The present results show zzso of the knee joint with a 3-D fast imaging technique to be a zzso alternative to diagnostic zzso
