In zzso localized zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso became a powerful and unique technique to zzso investigate brain metabolism of zzso and zzso The main goal of zzso MRS is the reliable zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso region of the zzso The availability of very high magnetic field strengths combined with the possibility of acquiring zzso at very short echo time have dramatically increased the number of constituents of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso measured at short echo times is complicated by the presence of zzso signals of particular importance at high magnetic zzso An error in the zzso zzso can lead to substantial errors in the obtained zzso zzso The purpose of the present review is to overview methods of high field zzso MRS with a focus on the zzso zzso in particular in handling signals of zzso Three main approaches of handling signals of zzso are zzso namely mathematical zzso of zzso measurement of zzso in zzso and direct acquisition of the in zzso spectrum without the contribution of zzso
