zzso zzso zzso is an important prognosis factor in the anatomical and functional outcomes of rotator cuff zzso The objective of this study was to analyze the natural history of muscle zzso and better evaluate its onset and zzso time zzso 

A total of zzso medical charts of patients operated on for rotator cuff tear and with a zzso CT zzso zzso or an zzso zzso were zzso Surgery was performed between 1988 and zzso The zzso of each muscle was assessed as minimal (in zzso stages 0 and 1), intermediate (in stage zzso and severe (in stages 3 and zzso Regarding zzso we retained the mean zzso observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and the zzso we retained the observed mean on two views at the upper and lower levels of the zzso in the zzso zzso 

We found a statistically significant correlation zzso between zzso the type of zzso zzso and patient age for the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso significantly increased zzso with time elapsed for the zzso and the zzso but not significantly for the zzso The mean time to zzso zzso observed for intermediate zzso was three years for the zzso and zzso years for the zzso and the zzso when their zzso zzso The mean time observed to severe zzso was five, four, and three years for the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso 

The more extensive the zzso the longer the time following zzso and the older the patient is, the more severe the zzso zzso The objective of surgery is to intervene before intermediate zzso sets in, which means irreversible functional zzso
