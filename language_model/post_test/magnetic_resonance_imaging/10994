This study used a model for zzso transfer zzso to estimate two underlying zzso the zzso zzso fraction zzso and the bound pool zzso zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso Sixty patients with clinically zzso zzso and 27 healthy controls were zzso zzso zzso a dual echo fast spin echo zzso zzso a zzso sequence (with ten zzso power and offset frequency zzso and zzso zzso density and zzso weighted sequences (for zzso relaxation time zzso Fourteen zzso white matter zzso regions of interest zzso and six zzso gray matter zzso zzso were outlined in all zzso zzso were also contoured in subjects affected by zzso The model was fitted to the data leading to estimates of zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso was increased in zzso whereas f was zzso In zzso f was decreased while zzso was only increased in secondary progressive zzso zzso f correlated modestly with zzso Further studies are needed to investigate the pathological basis of the abnormalities zzso
