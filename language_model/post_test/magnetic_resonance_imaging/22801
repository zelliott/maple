To report, in a population of fetuses diagnosed with partial zzso of the corpus zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso anomalies, and zzso In addition, in some of our cases a comparison was made between findings on ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

This was a retrospective study of all cases of zzso seen at two referral centers for prenatal diagnosis of zzso anomalies over a 10-year zzso The following variables were zzso indication for zzso additional cerebral and zzso zzso zzso zzso and pregnancy and zzso zzso 

Among 54 cases of fetal zzso of the corpus zzso detected in the referral centers during the observation period, zzso was diagnosed at prenatal zzso in 20 cases and confirmed at zzso zzso and zzso examinations in 19 cases zzso These 19 constituted the study zzso The diagnosis was made in the zzso planes and in 12 cases it was made prior to 24 zzso In most cases the indication for referral was the presence of indirect signs of zzso anomalies, such as zzso In 10 cases zzso occurred in association with other anomalies and in nine it was zzso zzso was particularly useful for demonstrating some additional cerebral anomalies such as late zzso zzso pathological conditions and zzso Regarding pregnancy outcome, of those diagnosed before 24 weeks which had associated anomalies, all except two were zzso Of the nine cases with isolated zzso all were zzso zzso was available in eight, and two of these zzso showed evidence of significant zzso zzso In our series the outcome of isolated zzso was not better than that of complete zzso of the corpus zzso reported in other zzso 

zzso can be diagnosed reliably and characterized in prenatal zzso The zzso sign present in most cases is zzso zzso zzso can be performed to confirm the zzso It is particularly useful to demonstrate some additional cerebral anomalies such as late zzso zzso pathological conditions and zzso The relatively poor survival rate is due to the high rate of zzso and associated major zzso
