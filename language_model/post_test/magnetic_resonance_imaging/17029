This study measured episodic memory deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment zzso as a function of their vascular zzso zzso burden was determined clinically by computing the number of vascular risk factors and diseases and zzso by assessing the presence and severity of white matter zzso zzso Strategic memory processes were measured with free recall and zzso contextual memory tasks requiring zzso zzso zzso memory retrieval processes were zzso with a zzso recognition zzso zzso showed that zzso participants with high vascular burden displayed impairment of strategic memory zzso whereas zzso participants with no vascular burden showed impairment of both strategic and zzso memory zzso A similar pattern was found whether vascular burden was measured using a clinical index of vascular risk profile or whether it was measured zzso by assessing the extent and severity of zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on memory differed as function of level of education, used here as a proxy for cognitive zzso Among participants with zzso those who had higher education and no zzso were the least memory zzso The study also examined memory as a function of whether patients later progressed to zzso after a three-year zzso When examining zzso performance, strategic and zzso processes were both impaired in zzso with no zzso vascular conditions, whereas zzso with a high vascular burden showed less impairment of zzso than strategic zzso Overall, results indicate that the presence of vascular burden in zzso is associated with selective impairment of strategic memory zzso
