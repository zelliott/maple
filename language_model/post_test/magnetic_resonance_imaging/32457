zzso zzso zzso have been recorded in response to the offset of sensory stimulation in both the auditory and visual zzso The present experiment employed zzso stimulation to characterize zzso zzso in response to different duration zzso In two separate experiments, we recorded attended and unattended zzso zzso to 70 zzso sine wave stimuli using the following zzso 20 zzso 50 zzso 70 zzso 150 zzso 170 zzso 250 zzso and 1000 zzso An zzso zzso delivered stimuli through a zzso to digits 2 and 3 of the right zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a later negative component zzso were analyzed using zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso values of the zzso and zzso but as the duration increased, there was a significant increase zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso appeared 130 zzso zzso 9 zzso following the offset of the zzso zzso values of the zzso and zzso components decreased as the stimulus duration increased and this effect became significant zzso zzso zzso as the duration difference zzso zzso of 150 zzso or greater evoked a negative baseline shift that persisted for the duration of the stimulus and area zzso in 7 out of the 10 subjects showed a significant increase in zzso when the stimulus was zzso An zzso case study supported these zzso The characteristics of the zzso component indicate it is a zzso off response, and it, in conjunction with the zzso and sustained potential, may reflect activity of a neural system that is responsive to changes in the tactile zzso
