zzso stimulation of human peripheral nerves activates the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso and the secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso We aimed at characterizing phase zzso between zzso and zzso in response to electric stimuli applied once every 3 s to the right median nerve at the zzso phase zzso between brain regions has been proposed to either reflect joined processing or information zzso zzso zzso activity of healthy volunteers was recorded with 204 zzso zzso covering the whole zzso After selecting a sensor zzso sensitive to activity in the left zzso zzso phase zzso between this sensor and the other zzso sensors was examined from single trial zzso zzso significant phase zzso was found at approximately 20 zzso zzso zzso after the stimuli between the left zzso and the right zzso in 9 of 10 zzso zzso with high zzso values over the left zzso and right zzso were separated by sensors with no zzso activity over the scalp zzso indicating that the phase zzso was not caused by the sensors seeing activity from the same zzso The observed zzso phase zzso would not be reflected in the evoked responses because a considerable part of it was not zzso to the zzso Thus, our finding reveals a unique interaction in the zzso zzso
