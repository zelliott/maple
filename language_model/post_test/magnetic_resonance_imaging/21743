Several studies have been performed in the last years to evaluate zzso zzso particularly of the zzso in hypertension and to estimate the changes of this zzso after zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the zzso zzso in a group of 10 patients with essential hypertension in comparison with a control group, with regard to the vascular effects of a long-term zzso treatment with zzso and zzso All patients were studied using zzso imaging, a technique with several peculiarities zzso zzso intrinsic contrast, zzso that allows simple and quick assessment of the zzso vascular parameters in the ascending and descending zzso The results of our study show the absence of a significant improvement of zzso vascular areas, and therefore of vessel zzso even in the presence of a complete blood pressure zzso in all patients after a zzso zzso These data do not confirm previous reports in this setting, based on the zzso techniques zzso and zzso zzso Two major reasons may explain our zzso first, the rigorous criteria of patient enrollment that we have stated in order to avoid any influence of age and/or other zzso second, the ability of MR imaging to allow accurate zzso of zzso vascular parameters and to achieve an excellent zzso and zzso zzso in comparison with other zzso We conclude that MR imaging is the method of choice for the assessment of cardiovascular function and zzso
