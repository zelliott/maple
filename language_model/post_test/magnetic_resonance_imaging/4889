zzso studies suggest that zzso and zzso are important features of plaque vulnerability for zzso Our aim was to determine the associations of these features in carotid plaques with previous cerebrovascular zzso events by using high-resolution zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso 10 zzso underwent zzso and zzso examinations for carotid plaque at zzso zzso presence was zzso zzso was zzso by the degree of zzso enhancement zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso Reader zzso was assessed by using weighted zzso zzso with events were determined by using multivariable zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso agreement for grading zzso enhancement were good to zzso zzso was present in zzso of patients and was associated with events zzso zzso zzso Patients grouped by categories 0, 1, and 2 zzso enhancement had increasing zzso of events zzso category 0, zzso category 1, zzso category 2; P zzso zzso Events were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhancement zzso with category zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for category 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for category 2) after controlling for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, wall zzso and zzso zzso was not associated with zzso 

zzso enhancement and zzso are independently associated with previous events and may provide important insight into stroke risk not achievable by zzso
