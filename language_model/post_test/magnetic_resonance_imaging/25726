To evaluate a zzso MR sequence in normal zzso flow and in zzso flow zzso in cases of spinal zzso 

The method was tested for flow sensitivity and applied to 67 sites of spinal canal zzso 

Phantom studies show that flow can be depicted at a zzso of zzso zzso On clinical images, stagnant zzso is black, flowing zzso is zzso Typically, in high-grade zzso zzso zzso above and below the site of spinal canal compromise zzso is zzso With intermediate zzso zzso zzso above the SCC remains white but becomes black zzso to the zzso zzso zzso shows only localized flow zzso 

This zzso sequence can solidify the MR diagnosis of high-grade zzso when a distinct flow pattern is zzso zzso patterns for intermediate and zzso zzso are less zzso
