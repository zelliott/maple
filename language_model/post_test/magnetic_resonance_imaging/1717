zzso prefrontal zzso zzso volume reduction has been reported in middle age adults with major depression zzso or bipolar affective zzso In this study, the authors test the hypothesis that zzso reduction is present in adolescent onset MD, and examine differences in the magnitude of reduction in younger versus older zzso 

zzso prefrontal zzso volume was measured from zzso weighted MR images in zzso 30 young women with early onset MD versus eight zzso controls, and zzso 18 middle aged women with zzso MD versus nine zzso zzso 

Left zzso volume was reduced in adolescent and middle aged females with zzso The magnitude of the difference between depressed and control groups zzso zzso zzso was similar in younger and older zzso 

Left zzso zzso volume reductions are present in young women with adolescent onset zzso
