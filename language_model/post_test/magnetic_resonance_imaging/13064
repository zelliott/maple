zzso magnetic stimulation zzso is increasingly used in zzso zzso to study functional contributions of a zzso brain region to cognitive and zzso zzso zzso zzso effects are often interpreted as reflecting selective disruption of processing primarily within the zzso region zzso This approach is now being extended by studies that combine zzso with concurrent zzso measures, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We discuss some recent combined zzso studies and their implications for zzso investigations of zzso and zzso An emerging theme is that zzso does not affect only the zzso region, but can also influence remote brain areas interconnected with the stimulation zzso Such zzso effects of zzso can be zzso specific, but also zzso changing with the current functional state of the targeted network rather than simply reflecting just zzso zzso anatomical zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso may zzso involve zzso influences on remote interconnected brain regions, not solely on the zzso region zzso Thus, zzso can now be used to study the consequences of functional interactions between the zzso region and other parts of the zzso This may lead beyond strictly modular views of brain function, that emphasize functional properties of single brain areas, towards new perspectives on how functional interactions between remote but interconnected brain regions may support perception and zzso
