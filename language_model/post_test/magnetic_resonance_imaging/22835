In patients with zzso functional changes have been described in the red nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gray matter zzso 

To evaluate whether and at which frequency these structures are involved by zzso structural abnormalities in zzso and to investigate the zzso role of these abnormalities by assessing their frequency and extent in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso 

On brain zzso scans obtained from 58 zzso (40 without and 18 with zzso 37 zzso patients with migraine without aura and 42 zzso patients without zzso the presence of zzso zzso involving the zzso structures was zzso A test of zzso between groups was used to compare the presence of zzso among patient zzso 

zzso of RN, zzso and zzso were found in all patient groups, with frequency from zzso to zzso zzso zzso differences for all these regions were zzso No difference was found between migraine patients with and without zzso Compared with zzso patients without zzso zzso patients with migraine had more significant involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with migraine patients, zzso patients with migraine had more significant involvement of the zzso and zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso are frequent in patients with zzso but do not seem to be associated with the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the RN, zzso and zzso might be among the factors responsible for the presence of migraine in patients with zzso
