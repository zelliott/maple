The pathological differences underlying the clinical disease zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso are poorly zzso We sought to explore the relationship between the distribution of white matter zzso zzso in zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso zzso and the normal regional zzso of cerebral zzso 

zzso zzso were identified and zzso on a single magnetic resonance imaging scan from zzso patients with zzso The spatial distribution of zzso was compared between early zzso late zzso and SP zzso in the context of normal cerebral zzso patterns provided by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of healthy zzso 

Patients with SP zzso had more distinct and larger zzso than patients with zzso zzso Across all subjects, zzso were present in regions of relatively lower normal zzso than normal appearing zzso Further, zzso in SP zzso were more common in areas of lower zzso as compared to the zzso distribution in early and late zzso zzso 

zzso plaques were more prevalent in zzso regions with lower relative zzso zzso in more highly zzso regions were more commonly observed in early zzso zzso and therefore, may be more likely to successfully zzso and zzso
