Experimental brain zzso were produced in adult cats by zzso zzso of the rat zzso clone zzso Regional zzso zzso and zzso were measured after 2-4 weeks on zzso zzso sections by zzso zzso zzso content was zzso by the zzso sodium zzso method, and regional pH by zzso zzso sections with the fluorescent zzso zzso The regional zzso zzso were correlated with magnetic resonance imaging and tissue water zzso zzso changes were zzso in zzso but exhibited a rather uniform pattern in zzso zzso zzso was consistently reduced, zzso and zzso were increased and pH was more alkaline than in normal white zzso The decrease of zzso matched the increase of water, indicating that zzso decline represents fractional dilution in the zzso tissue rather than zzso of energy zzso The increased zzso levels, therefore, may originate from the zzso and not from a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The implications of this interpretation for the zzso of zzso zzso are zzso
