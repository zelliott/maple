There is increasing recognition of major depressive disorder zzso in zzso In adult zzso abnormalities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cognitive control functions have been implicated in the zzso and been related to problems with controlling negative zzso No zzso studies of cognitive control functions, however, exist in zzso zzso This study investigated whether zzso adolescents with zzso show abnormal brain zzso of zzso and zzso networks when performing tasks of zzso and cognitive zzso 

zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare brain zzso between 21 zzso adolescents with a zzso of zzso aged zzso years and 21 healthy zzso matched for zzso age, sex, demographics and zzso zzso zzso were tasks of selective attention (Simon zzso zzso switching zzso zzso and motor response zzso and error detection zzso zzso 

In all three tasks, adolescents with depression compared to healthy controls demonstrated reduced zzso in zzso right zzso zzso inferior prefrontal zzso (IFC) and anterior zzso zzso zzso Additional areas of relatively reduced zzso were in the zzso zzso during the Stop and zzso tasks, zzso zzso and zzso zzso during the zzso task and zzso during the Simon zzso 

This study shows first evidence that zzso adolescents with zzso are zzso by abnormal function in zzso and right lateral prefrontal zzso during tasks of attention and performance monitoring, suggesting an early zzso of these functional abnormalities attributed to zzso
