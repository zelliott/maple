The purpose of this study was to investigate if magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be used to image the presence of zzso in bruises and if there was the potential for this technique to be applied as a zzso method to estimate the age of zzso To achieve this aim an animal model to produce zzso resembling bruises was created by injecting blood obtained from the tail vein zzso into an area of the abdominal zzso The animals were zzso at 3, 6, 12 zzso 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days post injection and the skin of the abdominal wall was excised for zzso scanning and zzso zzso The injected blood appeared as zzso zzso areas on the zzso zzso at 3 and 6 zzso The image of the injected areas became zzso at 12 h and continued to be zzso at 1 and 2 days, although there appeared to be transitioning from zzso to zzso zzso The magnetic resonance image appeared to better zzso to the zzso appearance at 3 and 5 days, with the zzso appearing zzso zzso however, some zzso zzso areas at 3 day possibly corresponded to the development of zzso At 7 day the injected blood had been converted to zzso with possible correlation between areas of blue zzso in zzso stained zzso sections and areas of extreme zzso in the zzso magnetic resonance zzso This study has shown that a series of changes occur on zzso of bruises in an animal model that may relate to zzso zzso Although zzso in the intensity of the zzso signal and considerable soft tissue artifact currently make interpretations difficult, this may be a technique worth pursuing in the zzso evaluation of zzso
