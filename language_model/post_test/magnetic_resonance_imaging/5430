Silent zzso zzso are commonly found on brain zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso among elderly subjects, but their risk factors and impact on outcome in stroke patients are zzso We evaluated the zzso risk factors and impact of zzso on the outcome of patients admitted with zzso zzso stroke or transient zzso attack zzso 

A prospective study of zzso patients admitted zzso to the neurology service with a diagnosis of zzso or stroke between July 2003 and June 2005, including 226 without any history of prior zzso or zzso All patients underwent brain CT on the day of admission to the zzso zzso factors analyzed included age, history of hypertension, diabetes zzso cardiovascular disease or stroke, smoking habit and alcohol zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured on the second day of zzso We monitored these patients for 24 months after stroke zzso 

The frequency of zzso among the 226 patients with zzso stroke or zzso was zzso Most of the zzso were small and zzso zzso disease was more frequently observed in patients with zzso Age, hypertension, diabetes zzso zzso zzso alcohol use, smoking habits and zzso zzso did not significantly differ between patients with zzso and those without zzso During the zzso follow-up period, the frequency of zzso stroke was higher in patients with zzso than those without zzso The mortality rate was higher in patients without zzso than those with zzso The zzso from stroke onset to zzso was shorter in patients without zzso than in those with zzso 

The study showed a higher frequency of small artery disease in patients with zzso zzso stroke patients with zzso should be considered at high risk for zzso zzso
