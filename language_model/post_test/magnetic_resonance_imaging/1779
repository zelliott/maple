Despite the zzso central role in sexual function, little is known about relationships between brain zzso and sexual zzso In this study, we employed functional zzso zzso to examine relationships between brain zzso and sexual zzso in a group of young, healthy, zzso zzso Each subject was exposed to two sequences of video material consisting of explicitly erotic zzso relaxing zzso and sports zzso segments in an unpredictable zzso Data on penile zzso was collected using a zzso zzso pressure zzso Both traditional block analyses using contrasts between sexually zzso and zzso video clips and a zzso using penile zzso as the zzso of interest were zzso In both types of zzso contrast images were zzso for each subject and these images were subsequently used in a random effects zzso Strong zzso specifically associated with penile zzso were observed in the right zzso region including the zzso left zzso and zzso right middle zzso middle zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and right zzso and zzso zzso zzso but significant zzso was observed in the right zzso Few significant zzso were found in the block zzso zzso of the findings are zzso Our study demonstrates the feasibility of examining brain zzso response relationships in an zzso environment and reveals a number of brain structures whose zzso is zzso to sexual zzso
