To assess the functional status and zzso of liver zzso by quantitative zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

A total of 80 patients with liver zzso of different zzso and functional status described by zzso score were examined and compared to 11 healthy zzso MR examination was performed on a zzso T zzso using a zzso surface zzso by the zzso chemical shift imaging zzso Absolute zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

MRS changes reflected the degree of liver dysfunction in all the patients as well as in individual zzso zzso The most important change was a decrease of zzso It was possible to distinguish zzso viral and zzso zzso based on MR zzso zzso and viral zzso differed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the control zzso Unlike viral zzso patients with alcoholic zzso also differed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso No significant changes were found in patients with zzso disease and zzso zzso this group differed from both alcoholic and viral groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso MRS can significantly help in zzso separation of different zzso groups leading to liver zzso In addition, MRS changes reflect functional liver zzso
