Current techniques for three-dimensional zzso optical zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso zzso generate zzso data by zzso zzso the zzso This places severe constraints on the maximum thickness of a zzso that can be zzso We have developed a zzso technique that uses optical projection zzso zzso to produce high-resolution zzso images of both fluorescent and zzso biological specimens with a thickness of up to 15 zzso zzso zzso allows the rapid mapping of the tissue distribution of zzso and protein expression in intact zzso or organ systems and can therefore be instrumental in studies of zzso biology or gene zzso
