The integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso with cognitive and affective zzso zzso enables examination of the brain systems underlying the behavioral deficits zzso in zzso there have been a remarkable increase in the number of studies that apply zzso in zzso studies of this zzso This article summarizes features of zzso methodology and highlights its application in zzso studies in zzso Such work has helped zzso potential neural zzso of deficits in zzso and affect by providing measures of zzso to zzso zzso and connectivity among brain zzso Studies have demonstrated abnormalities at early stages of sensory processing that may influence downstream abnormalities in more complex zzso zzso The methodology can help bridge integration with zzso and zzso zzso
