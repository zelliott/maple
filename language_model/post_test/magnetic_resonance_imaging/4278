To investigate focal zzso in the internal capsule zzso on magnetic resonance images zzso and its clinical significance, 80 patients with zzso lateral sclerosis zzso and 80 zzso and zzso normal control subjects were zzso On zzso images, zzso zzso were found in the zzso part of the zzso limb zzso of the zzso in 41 zzso of 80 control zzso However, no subject showed increased signal zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also observed in the zzso part of the zzso of the zzso on zzso images in 52 zzso of 80 ALS patients and on zzso zzso images in 26 zzso of 40 ALS zzso the zzso intense zzso were seen at the same anatomical location in the zzso as those in the normal control zzso On zzso zzso the zzso intense zzso were found in the zzso part of the zzso of the zzso in the zzso brains from 9 ALS zzso Three normal control subjects did not show signal intensity changes on zzso zzso On zzso examination of 9 ALS zzso distinct zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso third of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso images appear to be useful to distinguish zzso changes in the zzso tract of ALS zzso
