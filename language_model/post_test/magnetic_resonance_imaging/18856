A PC based system for simulating zzso zzso zzso procedures for physician training and patient specific zzso planning is zzso The system allows physicians to manipulate and interface zzso devices such as zzso zzso zzso and coils within zzso and hybrid surface and volume rendered 3-D patient vascular images in real zzso A finite element method is employed to model the interaction of the zzso and zzso with the vascular zzso zzso zzso and volume rendered 3-D presentations of the zzso are zzso System software libraries allow for the use of commonly employed zzso zzso zzso and zzso coils of various shapes and zzso The results of an initial clinical validation suggest that the experience gained from our simulator is comparable with that of using a vascular zzso We are conducting further validation with the aim of providing patient specific zzso zzso
