A zzso model of carotid zzso may greatly facilitate the identification of imaging characteristics of vulnerable plaques and the zzso evaluation of zzso zzso In this study we assess the association of zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso in carotid zzso plaques with zzso patterns in a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso models were created in zzso using a combination of partial zzso and a high cholesterol zzso The animals were zzso in a zzso T MR scanner at 3 months and carotid arteries were obtained for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso was used to match the zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso of the plaques on zzso and zzso zzso were measured and the association of zzso expression and zzso in the carotid plaque with zzso on zzso was zzso 

Forty carotid artery segments were matched between zzso and zzso All segments were advanced carotid zzso zzso The matched zzso zzso and zzso slices showed good correlation for ratio of plaque size to zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso was higher in plaques with strong zzso expression than in those with weak zzso expression zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso was also higher in plaques with marked zzso than in those without zzso 

Increased plaque zzso on zzso zzso is associated with zzso expression and zzso in carotid zzso plaques and may be used to identify vulnerable zzso
