zzso of the zzso zzso and facial zzso is a characteristic pathological feature of zzso zzso We assessed whether this finding can be detected by conventional brain magnetic resonance zzso A total of 17 patients with genetically confirmed zzso disease, 15 disease controls zzso zzso type 6 and zzso zzso and 17 normal subjects were examined using a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso of the facial zzso zzso zzso and zzso base and the area of the fourth zzso were measured on zzso zzso zzso zzso examination was performed in 9 zzso disease zzso In addition, visual inspection of the facial zzso was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic zzso The zzso of the facial zzso was significantly smaller in zzso disease patients zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso standard zzso than in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso zzso was smaller in both zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients than in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Visual evaluation of the facial zzso showed sufficient area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso to differentiate zzso disease from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type 6 zzso zzso evaluation showed significant zzso of the facial zzso in all zzso disease zzso zzso of the facial zzso is a feasible magnetic resonance imaging finding for diagnosing zzso disease, and it is easily found as a zzso of the fourth zzso zzso
