zzso cycle disorders zzso several zzso deficiencies that can result in cerebral damage, with a wide clinical spectrum from zzso to zzso 

The goal of this study was to correlate brain zzso abnormalities in zzso cycle disorders with clinical neurological zzso to evaluate whether zzso abnormalities can assist in guiding difficult treatment zzso 

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with zzso cycle disorders and symptomatic zzso Brain zzso images were reviewed for abnormalities that correlated with severity of clinical neurological zzso 

Our case series comprises six zzso cycle disorder patients, five with zzso zzso zzso and one with zzso type zzso The observed trend in distribution of brain zzso abnormalities as the severity of neurological zzso increased was the zzso region first, extending into the zzso zzso zzso and, finally, the zzso zzso There was zzso restricted diffusion in three children with prolonged zzso Prior to death, this site is typically reported to be spared in zzso cycle zzso 

The pattern and extent of brain zzso abnormalities correlate with clinical neurological outcome in our case zzso This suggests that brain zzso abnormalities may assist in determining prognosis and helping clinicians with subsequent treatment zzso
