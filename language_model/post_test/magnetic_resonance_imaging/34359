To evaluate the zzso of the follow up and the reference population sizes needed to achieve optimal and stable statistical powers for two period cross over and parallel group design clinical trials in multiple zzso when using the numbers of new enhancing zzso and the numbers of active scans as end point zzso 

The statistical power was calculated by means of computer simulations performed using zzso data obtained from 65 zzso zzso or secondary progressive patients who were scanned monthly for 9 zzso The statistical power was calculated for follow up zzso of 2, 3, 6, and 9 months and for sample sizes of zzso patients for parallel group and of zzso patients for two period cross over design zzso The stability of the estimated powers was evaluated by applying the same procedure on random zzso of the original zzso 

When using the number of new enhancing zzso as the end point, the statistical power increased for all the simulated treatment effects with the duration of the follow up until 3 months for the parallel group design and until 6 months for the two period cross over zzso Using the number of active scans as the end point, the statistical power steadily increased until 6 months for the parallel group design and until 9 months for the two period cross over zzso The power estimates in the present sample and the comparisons of these results with those obtained by previous studies with smaller patient zzso suggest that statistical power is significantly overestimated when the size of the reference data set decreases for parallel group design studies or the duration of the follow up decreases for two period cross over zzso 

These results should be used to determine the duration of the follow up and the sample size needed when planning zzso monitored clinical trials in multiple zzso
