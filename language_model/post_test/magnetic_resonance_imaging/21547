The sensitivity of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is such that inflamed areas of individual nerves can be zzso Given this, might the lateral extent of an acoustic zzso in the internal auditory canal be zzso depicted by zzso with zzso contrast due to variable enhancement in inflamed neural zzso The authors studied the correlation between zzso zzso and zzso observation of the lateral extent of tumor in the internal auditory canal zzso of 82 patients with acoustic zzso The surgeon made a visual determination of tumor extent when the zzso aspect of the tumor was zzso The zzso blind to surgical findings, noted the degree of extension into the zzso based on the zzso The majority zzso of the tumors involved the lateral third and zzso of the zzso zzso between scans and surgical findings was excellent for tumors extending into the lateral third of the zzso with a test sensitivity of 94 percent and a positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso of the accuracy of zzso in demonstrating extent of tumor in the zzso is important in making decisions regarding surgical zzso
