In this study, we evaluated a large number of subjects using zzso zzso to provide more information about oxygen metabolism in the normal function of transplanted zzso and to distinguish acute graft rejection from normal function zzso This study included 122 subjects (20 volunteers, 72 patients with normal functioning transplants, and 21 patients with acute zzso and 9 patients had normal function zzso received examination while zzso dysfunction occurred within 6 months during the zzso The zzso zzso values in the zzso and zzso as well as the zzso ratio of the zzso to zzso zzso ratio of zzso were zzso The zzso values of the zzso were higher than those of the zzso in the normal function group and the volunteers which have a steep zzso ratio of zzso All the zzso values in the acute rejection group were lower than those in the normal function zzso group zzso Moreover, in the 9 patients as normal function, the zzso values of the zzso and zzso were different from the normal function zzso which was lower in 5 patients and was higher in the 4 remaining zzso zzso the zzso ratios of zzso of the 9 patients were similar to those in the normal function zzso zzso zzso shows that decreased zzso values of the zzso and zzso and zzso ratio of zzso suggest acute zzso graft zzso zzso a steep zzso ratio of zzso zzso is an important reason for keeping clinical normal zzso
