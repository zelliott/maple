In the last 2 years, we have examined zzso patients experiencing back pain or zzso using zzso There were 13 zzso patients who had zzso symptoms that clinically zzso zzso disc zzso or spinal zzso All of these patients had inferior zzso zzso obstruction or zzso that caused zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso system, causing nerve root zzso 

To illustrate the imaging characteristics of 13 patients with zzso zzso veins due to inferior zzso zzso obstruction or zzso causing zzso and low back zzso 

zzso or pathological changes of zzso zzso network may give rise to symptoms similar to or mimicking zzso disc zzso or spinal zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso can cause nerve root and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been infrequently described in the zzso To date, the cause of anterior zzso zzso enlargement has been poorly zzso and both zzso and acquired causes have been zzso This report describes enlarged zzso veins in patients with inferior zzso zzso zzso or obstruction presenting with zzso zzso 

The authors have seen 13 patients with zzso zzso All of the patients had inferior zzso zzso obstruction or zzso that caused zzso in the zzso zzso causing nerve root zzso The ages of these patients ranged from 20 to 53 zzso 30) zzso All of the patients were examined with color zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

Ten of 13 patients had inferior zzso zzso zzso located just under the zzso vein zzso In two patients, there was zzso to inferior zzso zzso due to zzso In the remaining patient, a huge zzso mass was observed, and this mass was causing inferior zzso zzso obstruction and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated in all of these zzso All of the patients presented with the acute onset of low back pain followed shortly thereafter by acute zzso zzso The zzso to inferior zzso zzso could not be treated in one patient because of zzso zzso The remaining 12 patients with inferior zzso zzso obstruction or zzso experienced complete resolution of symptoms after treatment or zzso 

The authors believe that zzso zzso zzso should be considered when the symptoms of patients with deep zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso are accompanied by zzso and/or back pain, because zzso processes zzso a nerve root can cause zzso
