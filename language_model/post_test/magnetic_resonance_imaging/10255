The zzso nerve zzso zzso and corpus zzso can reduce seizure frequency when zzso are zzso to zzso However, the efficacy and safety of these two procedures have not been zzso This study evaluates the two procedures for generalized zzso 

All patients with zzso generalized zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso who underwent a corpus zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso without other forms of zzso surgery and those who underwent zzso placement zzso zzso 25) were evaluated for this zzso zzso response and procedure complications were zzso 

For those with a corpus zzso and generalized zzso zzso zzso zzso 50), zzso had zzso decrease in the frequency of generalized zzso seizures, and zzso had zzso seizure zzso For those with a zzso and generalized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50% had zzso seizure reduction, and zzso had zzso seizure zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased after either zzso or a corpus zzso The complication rate for corpus zzso was higher zzso all zzso zzso zzso than that for zzso zzso none zzso but complications for both corpus zzso and zzso were rarely zzso 

Both corpus zzso and zzso are effective in reducing generalized zzso Corpus zzso is associated with greater efficacy but higher risk for zzso although these were generally zzso
