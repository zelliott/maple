Our experience indicates that the most accurate information concerning abnormalities in the breast is obtained by a dynamic technique, in which the signal intensity before and after contrast medium injection is zzso Up to the present, only a small number of sections (1 to 5) could be obtained by dynamic zzso so that only zzso of the breast, depending on its size, could be zzso The availability of zzso systems, with rapid switching and high zzso zzso and duty cycle, makes it possible to obtain a larger number of zzso A new zzso zzso echo sequence is zzso which enables one to examine the entire breast using a dynamic technique zzso images of both breasts in zzso zzso zzso automatic zzso using a graphic zzso results in quantitative evaluation of the contrast zzso This new sequence can be applied to dynamic MR investigations of all large zzso
