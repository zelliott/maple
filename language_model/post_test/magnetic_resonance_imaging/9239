zzso is associated with structural brain zzso but the timing of onset and course of these changes remains zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have demonstrated progressive brain volume decreases in patients around and after the onset of illness, although considerable discrepancies exist regarding which brain regions are zzso The anatomical pattern of these progressive changes in schizophrenia is largely zzso In this study, zzso scans were acquired repeatedly from 16 schizophrenia patients approximately 2 years apart following their first episode of illness, and also from 14 zzso healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso Image zzso using zzso of zzso was applied to compare the rates of cortical surface contraction between patients and zzso Surface contraction in the zzso surfaces of the frontal lobe was significantly greater in patients with zzso schizophrenia zzso compared with healthy zzso Overall, brain surface contraction in patients and healthy controls showed similar anatomical patterns, with that of the former group exaggerated in magnitude across the entire brain zzso That the pattern of structural change in the early course of schizophrenia zzso so closely to that associated with normal development is consistent with the hypothesis that a zzso factor interacts with normal adolescent brain zzso processes in the zzso of zzso The exaggerated progressive changes seen in patients with schizophrenia may reflect an increased rate of synaptic zzso resulting in excessive loss of zzso zzso as predicted by the late zzso hypothesis of the zzso
