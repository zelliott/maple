Our objective was to investigate the potential of muscle volume, measured with magnetic resonance zzso as a zzso to zzso disease progression in patients with zzso lateral sclerosis zzso In this zzso pilot study, we first sought to determine the stability of zzso muscle MR zzso in 11 control subjects at two zzso We assessed feasibility of detecting zzso in four patients with zzso followed at three-month intervals for 12 zzso Muscle power and MR volume were measured in zzso zzso zzso first zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso Changes over time were assessed using linear zzso models and zzso zzso demonstrated that, in controls, no zzso MR changes were seen zzso volume variation in all muscles zzso zzso p zzso zzso In patients, zzso zzso was zzso Trends for volume loss were found in zzso zzso - zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or tongue zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso muscle MR appears a stable measure in controls, and progressive volume loss was zzso in individuals with ALS in whom clinical weakness zzso In this small study, zzso zzso was not zzso using muscle zzso zzso zzso between muscle weakness and MR zzso could reflect a contribution of upper motor zzso zzso
