To zzso evaluate zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for zzso staging in patients with urinary zzso zzso 

zzso patients with proved zzso cancer were zzso zzso of MR imaging performed before and after injection of zzso were compared with zzso results in surgically removed zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso rapid acquisition zzso zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were performed before and 24 hours after injection of zzso zzso zzso iron per zzso of body zzso On zzso images, zzso zzso were defined as zzso by using size and shape criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso oval, zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso images, zzso were considered benign if there was homogeneous decrease in signal intensity and zzso if decrease was absent or zzso zzso evaluation was performed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values, and accuracy were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso 

In 58 patients, zzso zzso zzso with use of zzso were matched and correlated with results of zzso zzso Of these, 122 were benign and 50 were zzso With zzso size and shape criteria, zzso sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative zzso values on zzso images were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding values on zzso images were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the depiction of pelvic zzso sensitivity and negative zzso value improved significantly at zzso compared with those at zzso imaging, from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso were zzso found in 10 of 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso were not detected on zzso zzso zzso images also showed zzso zzso that were missed at pelvic zzso dissection in two zzso 

zzso MR imaging significantly improves zzso staging in patients with zzso cancer by depicting zzso even in zzso zzso zzso
