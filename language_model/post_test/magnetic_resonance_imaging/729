zzso contributes to brain damage caused by zzso zzso zzso as the prevailing inflammatory cell population in stroke zzso can be zzso using zzso zzso iron oxide zzso as a zzso contrast agent for zzso In this zzso zzso clinical phase II study we tested the potential of zzso zzso for zzso imaging in human zzso stroke zzso In a series of 10 consecutive patients, zzso contrast agent was infused at the end of the first week after symptom zzso Two follow-up zzso scans were performed zzso h and zzso h after zzso Two distinct components of zzso signal changes were zzso one associated with blood vessels and one representing zzso zzso zzso changes appeared as signal loss on zzso images and decreased from the first to second scan after zzso infusion, most likely reflecting a transient blood pool effect of the contrast zzso zzso zzso enhancement was mainly evident on zzso images, increased over time, and matched with the expected distribution of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso throughout differed from signatures of conventional zzso zzso thus being independent from breakdown of the zzso zzso We suggest that increasing zzso on zzso images indicates brain zzso by zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may provide an in zzso surrogate marker of cellular inflammation in stroke and other zzso zzso
