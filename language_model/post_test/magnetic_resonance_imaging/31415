The aim of this study was to determine the performance of zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in detecting the narrowing of the zzso fluid zzso space at the high zzso and high zzso areas, which is speculated to be one of the clinical characteristics of idiopathic normal pressure zzso zzso 

We zzso examined zzso and zzso zzso images of 14 zzso patients and 12 zzso zzso The narrowness of the zzso space at the high zzso was blindly evaluated by five zzso using a continuous confidence rating scale for receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso imaging accurately determined the presence of the narrow zzso at the high zzso and was capable of predicting zzso zzso with a high degree of zzso there were also no significant differences in the detection of this finding between the zzso and zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso can detect the narrow zzso space at the high zzso accurately and may therefore facilitate clinicians in choosing a management strategy for zzso zzso
