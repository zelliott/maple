One of the zzso zzso features of Alzheimer's disease zzso is the formation of zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice have been developed that express one or more of the genes responsible for familial zzso in zzso zzso transgenic mice develop zzso zzso providing a mechanism to study zzso plaque biology in a controlled zzso Imaging of labeled plaques has been accomplished with other zzso but only zzso has sufficient spatial and contrast resolution to zzso individual plaques zzso zzso to zzso zzso of plaques in zzso in transgenic mice at zzso T using a spin echo sequence based on zzso zzso are zzso zzso results indicate that a spin echo acquisition more accurately reflects plaque size, while a zzso weighted zzso echo sequence reflects plaque iron content, not plaque zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations are zzso zzso verified plaques as small as 50 zzso in diameter were zzso in living zzso To our knowledge this work represents the first demonstration of zzso in zzso zzso of individual zzso plaques without the use of a contrast zzso
