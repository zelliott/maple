Parkinson's disease zzso traditionally considered a movement disorder, has been shown to affect executive function such as the ability to adapt behavior in response to new environmental zzso 

to identify the impact of zzso on neural zzso zzso two specific components of normal movement which we refer to as zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso a cued zzso 

We used zzso to measure zzso processes associated with zzso an zzso response and zzso a cued response plan in 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 13 control zzso zzso were shown a visual zzso cue followed by a matched or mismatched response target that instructed them to respond with a right, left, or bilateral button zzso In mismatched trials, an zzso zzso response was zzso or the previously cued response was zzso 

We were able to isolate zzso responses in zzso prefrontal cortex, specifically in the right zzso During the zzso of an zzso movement, zzso subjects showed decreased activity in the zzso and increased cortical activity in bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso During zzso of a previously cued movement, the zzso group showed increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso 

Right zzso plays a role in zzso zzso and zzso activity is abnormal in zzso zzso specificity of responses was observed in multiple zzso The zzso zzso are involved in circuits that coordinate zzso and zzso involved in action selection as well as zzso
