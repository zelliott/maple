zzso on brain zzso is the most sensitive marker of disease activity in multiple sclerosis zzso but its clinical consequences remain zzso 

Here we investigated the clinical consequences of zzso activity in zzso subjects treated with two different first line disease zzso zzso 

Seventy-five zzso subjects with zzso zzso zzso or clinically isolated syndromes at risk of zzso zzso from the zzso study that had been zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and followed for up to two years by monthly brain zzso zzso to detect inflammatory activity were studied for the clinical consequences of lack of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso occurred in zzso of participants zzso and in zzso completely while it was never achieved in zzso There was no difference by treatment in zzso zzso progression of physical zzso or cognitive zzso The percentage of zzso subjects was zzso for the group in complete zzso zzso zzso in the group never in zzso and zzso in the group in transient zzso zzso Similar differences were observed for zzso worsening of ambulatory function as measured by the timed 25 foot walk zzso and by Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function was lowest at baseline for the group that never reached zzso zzso on zzso this group improved the least upon repeated cognitive testing during the two years of treatment zzso 

Lack of zzso zzso during treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso is associated with higher zzso rate and worsening of physical and cognitive zzso
