In adults, the zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso are zzso activated during zzso zzso including normal sadness and pathological zzso It is not clear, however, whether similar regional activity is also characteristic of depressed mood during zzso We correlated whole brain activity during a fear face perception task with scores on the zzso Depression zzso in 16 adolescents undergoing functional magnetic resonance zzso After controlling for age, depressed mood scores correlated with increased activity within the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso consistent with findings previously reported for sadness and depression in adults, suggesting that the neural zzso of depressed mood are established early in life and remain relatively consistent across development into zzso
