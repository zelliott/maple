The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in predicting the zzso grade of zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso Eighty-one consecutive patients with 122 zzso proven zzso who underwent zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso in 42 zzso or transplantation zzso zzso in 39 zzso were analyzed zzso We calculated the relative enhancement ratios zzso which is the ratio of the relative intensity of a tumor versus the surrounding zzso on zzso phase images to the relative intensity on zzso zzso zzso We then analyzed the correlation between the zzso and the tumor differentiation grade in patients with various degrees of zzso zzso The degree of tumor enhancement, which included the zzso relative intensity ratio zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than the degree of tumor enhancement for moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso and P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively, for zzso In a zzso analysis based on liver function, the correlation between the zzso grade and the enhancement ratio was demonstrated only in the group of patients with zzso class A zzso The accuracy of zzso zzso for predicting zzso and zzso zzso was zzso the areas under the receiver operating characteristic zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso phase of zzso zzso may help to predict the differentiation of zzso especially in zzso patients with zzso class A zzso before liver transplantation or zzso
