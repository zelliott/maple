zzso a humanized zzso zzso against vascular zzso growth factor, has shown promising activity in zzso zzso zzso We reported the treatment response for the combination of zzso and chemotherapy in a series of six patients with zzso zzso zzso and investigated the molecular zzso in cancer pathways using the surgical zzso from these zzso 

Standard therapy with primary zzso followed by zzso zzso had failed in all zzso zzso was administered at a dose of 10 zzso every 2 zzso zzso four patients received zzso zzso zzso one patient zzso zzso zzso every 2 weeks) and one patient zzso zzso zzso Response to therapy was mainly determined by magnetic resonance zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso were zzso assessed by zzso using surgical zzso before the initial zzso 

Five of the six patients had a zzso zzso Three were complete response, and two were partial zzso Only one patient had progressive zzso The zzso zzso survival zzso was zzso and the median zzso was 15 weeks, with a range of 6 to more than 60 zzso Of the three core pathways analyzed in this study, the zzso and zzso zzso pathways were more likely to be associated with the treatment response to zzso In two younger patients zzso zzso 50) with complete response, simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso and zzso might be the crucial zzso 

zzso in combination with zzso agents may be an effective strategy for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso might be possible zzso for selecting suitable patients for this targeted zzso
