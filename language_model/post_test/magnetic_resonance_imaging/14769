A positive family history zzso of alcohol use disorders zzso is linked to increased risk for personal zzso but the mechanisms behind this risk are zzso Previous research suggests that a subtle zzso lag in zzso adolescents may contribute to risk for future zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso response to a spatial working memory zzso task was examined for markers of zzso delay in 85 youth with and without zzso It was hypothesized that zzso adolescents zzso zzso 24, ages zzso zzso as compared to matched zzso youth zzso zzso 26, ages zzso zzso would show less similarity to brain connectivity observed in older adolescents zzso zzso 35, ages zzso zzso and that statistical comparison of zzso functional connectivity models would differentiate zzso and zzso zzso zzso equation modeling tested the fit of brain response connectivity between FH groups and against the zzso zzso 

zzso of connectivity were more similar between older adolescent and zzso than zzso zzso zzso youth demonstrated higher association between right zzso and left frontal brain regions than zzso and older adolescent zzso zzso of FH groups indicated a significant difference on the zzso from the right superior zzso zzso to the left middle frontal zzso 

These findings provide additional support for the notion of a zzso lag in zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a mechanism by which FH increases risk for alcohol zzso and this less mature neural connectivity pattern may provide a novel zzso for identifying youth at risk for drinking zzso
