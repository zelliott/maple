A total of zzso zzso of the zzso women aged 65 to 95 years zzso age zzso on whom zzso was performed in zzso

Current use of zzso was reported by zzso and past use by another zzso of zzso zzso of all women had zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso did not differ in current or past users from those who had never used zzso zzso zzso distance, the largest distance between frontal zzso and the size of zzso were larger among current zzso users compared to past users or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted for all other zzso but no zzso relationship to current or past zzso use was zzso zzso of zzso use was not associated with any zzso zzso zzso zzso measure, zzso zzso or white matter disease did not differ significantly by zzso use or duration of zzso Central measures of zzso zzso distance, and zzso size were significantly associated with zzso as measured by zzso 

Current zzso users had much more clinically significant central zzso than zzso but the implications remained zzso
