The objective of this study was to determine the zzso zzso of quantitative measures of zzso size and position, and to compare the zzso zzso and agreement between a double echo steady state water zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight knees (four healthy, four with zzso knee zzso from the zzso Initiative cohort were zzso Manual zzso of the zzso was performed by three observers and quantitative measures of zzso size and position zzso zzso zzso using image analysis zzso The root mean square zzso zzso error zzso zzso for zzso zzso volume with double echo steady state and zzso with zzso zzso zzso was found considerably smaller than the zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso The lowest zzso zzso error for zzso zzso was obtained for the central five zzso slices across the zzso zzso zzso zzso measures from double echo steady state and zzso zzso zzso were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso
