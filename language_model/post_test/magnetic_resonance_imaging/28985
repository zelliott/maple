There is only limited information about late neurological complications after bone zzso transplantation zzso The purpose of this study is to describe a cerebral zzso syndrome after zzso zzso 

Clinical and diagnostic findings of 5 zzso patients with chronic graft versus host disease and zzso data of 1 patient were zzso 

In the described patients, focal neurological signs and zzso abnormalities occurred years after zzso zzso revealed zzso white matter zzso zzso or territorial zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the central nervous system was confirmed in 1 patient at autopsy, and an zzso syndrome was suspected in the other patients because of the clinical course and response to zzso Three patients received zzso and steroids (2 improved, 1 zzso 1 patient improved after steroids alone, and 1 patient without zzso therapy deteriorated zzso 

We propose that an zzso syndrome of the central nervous system can be a neurological manifestation of graft versus host disease, which should be considered a possible cause of cerebral zzso episodes and pathological zzso scans in zzso patients with graft versus host zzso
