To describe the recent advances in the diagnostic procedures for zzso and explore future zzso 

Novel imaging techniques have been explored in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso using zzso which is more specific for zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso The combined zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso could successfully discriminate zzso from zzso The finding of delayed enhancement in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging could identify cardiac involvement of zzso with higher sensitivity than zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso needle aspiration is a safe and useful tool for diagnosing zzso with a diagnostic zzso sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso have demonstrated that zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso syndrome show a spontaneous zzso in contrast to only zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso could be novel promising factors for discriminating a prognosis in zzso zzso 

Recent development including novel imaging techniques, novel biopsy procedures, and genetic analyses could be of value for the diagnosis of zzso
