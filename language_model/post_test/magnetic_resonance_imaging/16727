zzso resonance imaging zzso and/or zzso are commonly used for follow-up in children after treatment of acute zzso zzso zzso imaging reveals pathological findings even if serum inflammatory parameters and clinical presentation are zzso We analyzed combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso 

Six children received zzso after treatment of acute zzso zzso zzso had revealed suspicious residual and/or additional zzso All patients had zzso serum infection parameters and no clinical zzso 

Median patient age was zzso months zzso zzso No increased zzso zzso was observed in 3 zzso In 3 patients, there was minimal activity at the site of infection, which, however, did not reach the presumed range of zzso All children were taken off zzso zzso No clinical symptoms zzso in any of them, and repeatedly controlled serum infection parameters were all zzso Median follow-up was 33 months zzso zzso 

The zzso was superior to zzso in distinguishing between infection and zzso activity within the musculoskeletal system in selected children after acute zzso The termination of zzso treatment for children after acute zzso seems justified when laboratory parameters as well as clinical presentation are normal, and zzso scan is zzso
