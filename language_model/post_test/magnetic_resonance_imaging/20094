The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of zzso to characterize zzso indeterminate zzso masses and to define the zzso features contributing to indeterminate zzso 

Two blinded zzso zzso reviewed the zzso examinations of 87 patients with 95 zzso indeterminate zzso zzso zzso determined the origin of a mass, its tissue content zzso solid, complex zzso or zzso and zzso tissue characteristics zzso blood, zzso or zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso were reviewed by three zzso to determine the origin of a mass, its tissue content, and reasons for an indeterminate zzso zzso and specificity of zzso were zzso and agreement of zzso and zzso with the final diagnosis was determined using zzso zzso The final diagnosis was determined by zzso surgical findings, or imaging or clinical zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso for identifying zzso zzso zzso 5) was zzso and its specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Excellent agreement was seen between zzso and the final diagnosis for determining the origin zzso zzso zzso tissue content zzso zzso zzso and tissue characteristics zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso had poor agreement with the final diagnosis for the origin zzso zzso zzso and tissue content zzso zzso zzso of a zzso The main reasons for indeterminate zzso diagnoses were the inability to determine origin because of location and large mass size and the appearances of purely solid or complex zzso zzso 

zzso indeterminate zzso masses of uncertain origin and solid or complex zzso content benefit from further evaluation with zzso which is highly accurate for identifying the origin of a mass and characterizing its tissue content, obviating zzso
