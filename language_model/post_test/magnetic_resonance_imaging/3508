It is hypothesized that the development of substance abuse zzso may be due to imbalance in functions of the zzso and behavioral zzso systems in the zzso This speaks to the search for biological risk factors for zzso in zzso children who also exhibit motivational and zzso control zzso however, this type of research is currently zzso The objective of this study was to establish a zzso basis for addiction vulnerability using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso youth with attention zzso disorder zzso We hypothesized that children with zzso alone would show higher activity in regions of the zzso and behavioral zzso systems than children with zzso and a parental history of zzso Toward this goal we scanned 20 zzso children with zzso ages zzso while performing an zzso reward zzso High zzso and low zzso risk subjects were identified, based on parental history of zzso The effects of zzso conflict, and reward were assessed with appropriate linear zzso and zzso differences were assessed using statistical zzso zzso The two groups did not differ on behavioral measures of the zzso The zzso results show heightened zzso in the brain zzso system and reduced zzso of the zzso control system in high-risk compared to low-risk zzso These results suggest that a functional mismatch between these two systems may represent one possible biological underpinning of zzso risk, which is zzso by a parental history of zzso
