The purpose of our study was to zzso compare a recently developed method of zzso zzso fast zzso zzso with extended zzso acquisition zzso with zzso zzso and zzso fast recovery zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso 

Institutional review board approval, Health Insurance zzso and zzso Act zzso compliance, and informed consent were zzso We studied 10 healthy volunteers and one volunteer with knee pain using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Images were obtained both with and without fat zzso zzso and muscle zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso were compared using a zzso zzso zzso We also compared zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso images directly acquired in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was higher with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Muscle zzso was significantly higher with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, p zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso zzso due to higher cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired zzso data sets with zzso zzso zzso images in the zzso plane were similar to zzso zzso zzso acquisitions but with thinner zzso 

zzso zzso zzso acquires high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso data with intermediate and zzso that may be zzso in arbitrary zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising technique for zzso of the zzso
