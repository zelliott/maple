In zzso effective relaxation rates in normal rat liver were evaluated for four zzso coated iron oxide zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso with a mean particle diameter of zzso zzso a zzso agent zzso with a larger mean diameter of 12 zzso and these two agents labeled with the zzso zzso protein for high zzso zzso binding affinity zzso and zzso Using echo zzso imaging at 2 zzso dose response was measured with measured with high zzso resolution for 3 h after injection of agent, and by comparing with zzso in zzso and in brain, dominant in zzso contrast phenomena were zzso While zzso zzso for zzso exceeded that for zzso by almost a factor of 2 in solution, relaxation rates in zzso became zzso Liver relaxation using zzso agents was consistent with rapid water exchange between vascular and zzso zzso which dominated relaxation as a result of agent zzso in zzso zzso
