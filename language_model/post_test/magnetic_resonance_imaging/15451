zzso zzso is a main zzso of zzso injury and graft quality in liver zzso One of the important diagnostic procedures to recognize zzso failure is zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso 

To examine the additional effect of contrast media zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cellular damage in the phase of early zzso injury of the rat zzso 

The partial warm zzso injury model of rat liver was zzso zzso and zzso interaction were measured by zzso zzso zzso cellular damage was indicated by liver zzso activity in the zzso The evaluation parameters were measured at baseline and at 30, 60, and 90 zzso after zzso The contrast media zzso group, zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso group, zzso zzso 6) or zzso solution zzso group, zzso zzso 8) were applied after 30 zzso of zzso 

No additional injury to the zzso injury of the liver after intravenous application of zzso contrast media was zzso Some protective effect was even recorded after application of zzso contrast zzso 

The use of contrast media during diagnostic procedure of the liver seems to be relatively safe, even in the stage of early zzso after liver zzso
