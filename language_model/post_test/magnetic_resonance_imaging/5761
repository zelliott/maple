The purpose of this study was to investigate what proportion of cases showing a well differentiated zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso removed at two UK cancer zzso had adverse pathological features or advanced stage disease at the time of zzso 

zzso patients who were operated on at either the South East London Cancer Centre, London or the Kent Oncology Centre, zzso had a zzso diagnosis of well differentiated zzso 1) zzso zzso in their zzso zzso These were identified using the multidisciplinary meeting database as well as the respective pathology department zzso The zzso reports for these patients were examined and zzso for the purpose of this zzso 

Of the initial 98 cases, 65 patients zzso were referred with a zzso zzso showing a well differentiated zzso zzso 25 cases zzso were referred with zzso zzso zzso seven patients zzso were referred with a moderately differentiated zzso zzso and one case zzso was referred with a possible zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso specimens revealed that all of these cases had a well differentiated zzso zzso In 20 of the 98 cases zzso there was no zzso invasion, 56 cases zzso showed invasion of the inner half of the zzso and 22 cases zzso showed outer half zzso There was no cervical involvement in 78 cases zzso zzso zzso involvement in eight patients zzso and cervical zzso involvement in 12 patients zzso The total percentage of cases with cervical involvement was zzso zzso cases (out of the zzso underwent a bilateral pelvic zzso Of these 38 cases, four cases had zzso zzso zzso zzso of the patients who underwent zzso There were zzso zzso in one case and zzso to one zzso tube in zzso From our study, zzso of cases with a well differentiated zzso zzso of the zzso were Stage zzso or more at the time of zzso zzso were at least zzso Stage zzso eight patients zzso were zzso Stage zzso seven patients zzso were Stage zzso and six patients zzso were Stage zzso In these patients a full surgical staging operation with a pelvic zzso was indicated according to zzso zzso 

A significant proportion zzso of well differentiated zzso in a zzso were found to have Stage zzso disease or more at the time of zzso and thus full surgical staging including a zzso should have been carried out in these zzso Cases with a zzso biopsy showing zzso zzso or well differentiated zzso should have a zzso zzso scan or preferably an zzso frozen section examination to identify those cases with adverse pathological features which need to be fully staged with pelvic and zzso zzso
