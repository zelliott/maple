zzso integrated boost zzso for prostate cancer allows increases in tumor control probability while respecting normal tissue dose zzso Biological zzso functions that zzso based on treatment outcome can be used to create zzso prostate zzso This study investigates the feasibility of biologically zzso zzso modulated arc therapy zzso for zzso prostate zzso 

Five prostate cancer patients with zzso MR images were selected for zzso A zzso zzso zzso was performed, which consisted of an initial biological zzso of a zzso zzso angle delivery followed by conversion of the zzso delivery to a single arc zzso zzso A zzso analysis was performed on the resulting zzso 

The zzso plans resulted in a zzso between the prostate and the boost volume of between zzso and zzso zzso volumes receiving zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso normal tissue complication probabilities were between zzso and zzso zzso zzso doses ranged from zzso to zzso zzso treatment time was 120 s or zzso 

The presented biological zzso method resulted in deliverable zzso plans that achieved sufficient zzso for zzso without violating zzso and zzso dose zzso 

This study presents a method for creating simultaneous integrated boost zzso treatments using biological outcome objective zzso
