To zzso and directly compare zzso zzso zzso with zzso CT for pulmonary functional loss and disease severity assessment in zzso tissue disease zzso patients with zzso lung disease zzso 

zzso CT, zzso zzso pulmonary function test and serum zzso were administered to 36 zzso patients with zzso zzso men, 13 zzso mean age: zzso zzso and nine zzso patients without zzso (six men, and three zzso mean age: zzso zzso A zzso ratio zzso map was generated from zzso zzso and mean relative enhancement ratio zzso for each subject was calculated from all zzso zzso zzso disease severity was evaluated with a visual scoring system from each of the zzso CT zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso of zzso patients with and without zzso were then statistically zzso To assess capability for pulmonary functional loss and disease severity assessment in zzso patients, correlations of zzso and zzso disease severity with pulmonary functional parameters and serum zzso in all subjects were statistically zzso 

zzso and zzso disease severity showed significant differences between zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease severity correlated significantly with pulmonary functional parameters and serum zzso in all subjects zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was found to be as useful as zzso CT for pulmonary functional loss and disease severity assessment of zzso patients with zzso
