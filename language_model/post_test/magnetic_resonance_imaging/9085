Water content and mobility, which are factors known to be associated with dormancy induction in woody plants on a tissue level, were measured using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso Two cultured zzso clones zzso - zzso dormancy and zzso - zzso zzso were subjected to dormancy zzso temperature zzso zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C zzso under a short zzso zzso diffusion zzso an indicator of water mobility, correlated with dormancy development in the zzso bud and vascular bud trace zzso In contrast, zzso relaxation time, an indicator of zzso zzso water properties, did not correlate significantly with dormancy in the regions that were zzso Although zzso studies using zzso relaxation zzso have dominated the zzso field, our work indicates that water mobility is an important factor in studies examining water changes during dormancy induction in the critical zzso of woody zzso
