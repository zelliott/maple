An individual, human or animal, is defined to be in a conscious state zzso by the behavioral ability to respond zzso to zzso whereas the loss of consciousness is defined by zzso PET zzso of zzso or oxygen consumption show a widespread approximately zzso reduction in cerebral energy consumption with zzso loss of zzso Because baseline brain energy consumption has been shown by zzso magnetic resonance zzso to be almost exclusively dedicated to zzso zzso we propose that the high level of brain energy is a necessary property of the conscious zzso Two additional zzso properties of the conscious state change with zzso The zzso zzso activity patterns in rat brain during sensory stimulation at a higher energy state (close to the zzso collapse to a zzso zzso response at lower energy state zzso zzso zzso rates of an ensemble of zzso in the rat zzso zzso shift from the zzso range zzso zzso at higher energy state to zzso zzso at lower energy zzso With the conscious state defined by the zzso behavior and maintained by high cerebral energy, measurable properties of that state are the widespread zzso patterns and high frequency zzso activity, both of which support the extensive zzso communication characteristic of zzso This usage of high brain energies when the person is in the zzso of consciousness differs from most studies, which attend the smaller energy increments observed during the zzso that form the zzso of that zzso
