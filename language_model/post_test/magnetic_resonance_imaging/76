zzso disease zzso has been associated with depression and a host of zzso conditions including zzso This study assessed the relationship between cerebrovascular findings reported on zzso brain scans and zzso symptoms zzso and zzso problems in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso 

Medical notes were zzso reviewed in patients undergoing brain zzso following referral for cognitive impairment to a memory clinic between January 2004 and June zzso Patients with zzso were graded into four categories of zzso severity based on zzso reports and assessed for zzso and zzso and activities of daily living using zzso zzso zzso Geriatric Depression zzso zzso and Bristol zzso of Daily Living zzso zzso lobe symptoms and zzso features were also zzso 

Of the initial 232 patients who underwent zzso zzso were diagnosed with zzso zzso of zzso patients had zzso findings reported on zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso of zzso None of the zzso patients satisfied a diagnosis of vascular zzso There was no significant relationship observed between level of zzso zzso findings and scores on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso severity did not appear to influence frontal lobe and zzso assessments zzso zzso zzso 

The contribution of zzso to the zzso of various zzso is still zzso Our study, based on patients diagnosed with zzso in a memory clinic setting, suggests that there is no relationship between the extent of zzso pathology and zzso and zzso measures in zzso zzso Further prospective quantitative studies are needed to assess the role of zzso if any, in zzso and zzso symptoms in zzso It is possible that the relatively small pathological contribution of zzso to the development of these symptoms is obscured by the effect of the wider zzso encountered in zzso
