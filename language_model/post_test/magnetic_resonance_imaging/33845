zzso zzso enables computer-generated zzso zzso of a cavity by reconstructing zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso The technique has been used zzso to study the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Here, virtual zzso were created from the zzso image data of 3 zzso The cases represented a normal zzso a zzso cell zzso of the zzso fold, and a zzso zzso zzso These reconstructions included zzso anatomy that is not typical of current virtual zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images of the patients underwent zzso for zzso zzso The resulting models were imported into an experimental virtual zzso program for 1) airway zzso generation and 2) interactive zzso Though they could not be used for zzso the virtual zzso zzso in a zzso fashion, good simulation of zzso zzso zzso also gave the added benefits of the ability to assess the zzso extent of disease and view the airway zzso to areas of zzso zzso This technology may well provide clinical benefit in zzso planning, staging, and zzso guidance for head and neck disease and merits further zzso
