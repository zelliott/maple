Total brain water content changes in several cerebral pathological conditions and the measurement of brain water content are important for the selection of appropriate therapeutic zzso We present a zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso method and propose its use for the accurate assessment of brain water content among human zzso 

zzso zzso is based on the zzso of an applied current in the brain zzso Application of an zzso current of 800 zzso at 50 zzso via two zzso placed on the eyelids with the eyes closed, and detection of the zzso drop with two zzso placed in the zzso region allow brain resistance and zzso to be zzso By means of an equation that considers zzso circumference and resistance, it is possible to zzso the total brain water content, expressed as the zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with a series of healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso for determination of average brain water content zzso The method was then applied to 50 patients with brain tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for assessment of changes in global brain water zzso Data were compared with those obtained for healthy zzso 

zzso significant differences zzso zzso zzso were observed between the two zzso Mean brain water content values zzso as zzso volume zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for healthy volunteers and zzso zzso zzso zzso for patients with cerebral pathological zzso zzso significant differences zzso zzso zzso were also observed among patients with cerebral pathological zzso 

The results of this study suggest that zzso applied to the cerebral zzso is a valid method for the prediction of brain water contents under both normal and pathological zzso However, further studies are needed to establish whether it is sensitive and reliable enough for future clinical zzso
