We reviewed 100 cases of zzso zzso in zzso patients who underwent complete evaluations at the University of California, San Francisco, zzso 

zzso were the presenting symptom of zzso illness in 18 patients, six of whom developed no other zzso illness until at least four months after the first zzso Common causes in the 100 patients included mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso No cause for the zzso was found in 23 patients despite a complete zzso An underlying cause was found in all patients with focal zzso deficits but in only two of 24 who had normal results on an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features were not zzso of zzso A cause was found in all 12 patients with status zzso or medically zzso zzso A total of 12 of the 87 zzso patients who received zzso developed a hypersensitivity zzso Despite the zzso of follow-up in some patients, many patients, including those with no zzso cause, had multiple zzso prior to the administration of zzso 

The direct effects of zzso on the brain may be the single most common cause of zzso in this zzso We favor treatment of a single seizure in patients with zzso zzso
