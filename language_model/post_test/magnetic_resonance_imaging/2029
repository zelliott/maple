Most studies of the impact of alcohol dependence on the brain have examined individuals in zzso Such samples represent a small proportion of zzso in the general zzso Such samples may embody a bias zzso zzso if the association between variables (for example, alcoholism and cortical gray matter zzso differs between the population of zzso in treatment and zzso in the general zzso Our objective was to determine if zzso zzso show structural brain changes versus controls and to compare our findings with reports evaluating alcoholic samples drawn from treatment zzso 

zzso zzso was used to assess whole brain and regional volumes of cortical gray matter and white matter in 24 young to middle-aged zzso zzso males versus 17 zzso 

zzso gray matter volumes in zzso individuals were zzso associated with age and lifetime duration of alcohol use (which were highly zzso These subjects showed reduced whole brain zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical gray matter compared with zzso White matter and zzso cortex, zzso that usually show volume reductions in samples drawn from treatment, did not differ between zzso zzso and controls (all p zzso zzso 

Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that structural brain changes in zzso zzso are less severe than those reported in clinical samples of zzso perhaps due to less zzso zzso and a reduced severity of alcoholism in zzso zzso However, caution must be taken when comparing our findings with results from clinical samples, as we did not directly compare zzso zzso with treated zzso and our zzso sample tended to be younger than the zzso samples reported in the zzso Nevertheless, we suggest that most of the reports of the central nervous system consequences of alcoholism may not accurately describe the majority of zzso zzso
