Iron deposits in the human brain can be considered as intrinsic contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and are used as markers of zzso accompanied by zzso zzso We studied one of them - zzso associated zzso zzso - by using zzso at zzso zzso and 7 T in a group of six zzso we also measured a group of five volunteers for zzso Based on the magnetic field dependency of zzso zzso and zzso iron oxide zzso zzso we derived a zzso model for the description of iron deposits in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso According to this model, we estimated the iron content in zzso patients as 391 zzso of zzso iron zzso and zzso zzso of zzso iron, compared with 178 zzso of iron in zzso found in zzso This zzso model explains the zzso shape of the zzso zzso in in zzso zzso of the relaxation rates of zzso patients and is supported by zzso findings in the original reports on zzso zzso
