We studied 23 patients with zzso and 14 with zzso using dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso were classified according to the 1993 WHO zzso zzso images were obtained every 30s for zzso after rapid injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso was divided into three zzso a sharp rise with a peak within 60 s zzso a relatively rapid increase with a peak between 60 and zzso zzso a slow increase without a peak zzso The patterns were correlated with the zzso of the zzso The signal zzso of the zzso on zzso images were also analyzed and correlated with the dynamic zzso zzso had more varied dynamic patterns than zzso Almost half of the zzso showed pattern A, and one third pattern zzso Of six zzso zzso showed pattern zzso all zzso and zzso zzso showed pattern zzso Various patterns were observed in transitional zzso Of the 8 zzso showing pattern C, only one gave high signal on zzso images, and could not be differentiated from the zzso Thus, one third of zzso could not be differentiated from zzso by the dynamic contrast enhancement zzso However, when this was combined with the signal intensity on zzso images, most zzso could be differentiated from zzso
