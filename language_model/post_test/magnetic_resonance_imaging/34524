To evaluate zzso zzso size in cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cavernous zzso and to correlate the size with the degree of zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images in 21 patients with zzso proved zzso zzso zzso of the cavernous zzso were zzso zzso In four patients, findings obtained before and after zzso therapy were zzso 

The 21 patients were divided into group 1 zzso zzso zzso and group 2 zzso or mild zzso zzso The superior zzso of the zzso zzso was convex or flat in group 1 and flat or zzso in group zzso The mean height of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in group 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso in group 2 zzso zzso zzso After zzso therapy, zzso zzso height decreased and signal intensity voids improved in the four patients and no zzso zzso was observed in zzso 

In cases of severe zzso zzso zzso in the cavernous zzso the zzso zzso is zzso which should not be zzso as zzso
