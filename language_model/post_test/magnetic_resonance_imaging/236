Changes in liver zzso are considered essential in assessing zzso injury, which in turn has an impact on liver graft function and outcome following liver transplantation zzso The aim of this study was to introduce dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a new technique for overall zzso of zzso zzso and compare it to zzso measured by laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso diffusion zzso The study included 3 groups, measuring zzso blood flow and zzso with the help of zzso zzso and zzso In group I (9 zzso zzso 26 zzso 5 zzso the native liver before and after partial portal zzso was zzso in group II (6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the liver 24 hours after zzso was zzso and in group III zzso zzso the liver on days 4 to 7 following zzso was zzso A close correlation was found between zzso zzso and TD zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in 4 defined regions of zzso zzso blood flow and partial zzso of the portal vein were accurately detected by zzso zzso and correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the clinical setting, representative TD zzso in segment zzso of the transplanted liver correlated well with zzso analysis in other zzso zzso of the portal blood flow and imaging of the whole liver could be performed simultaneously by zzso In conclusion, zzso has been proved to be a sensitive zzso for the zzso of liver zzso and zzso blood flow in experimental and clinical zzso It allows for a zzso zzso assessment of zzso and zzso of the liver and could become a valuable diagnostic tool in advanced liver surgery and zzso
