The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data recorded on several subjects resorts to the so-called spatial zzso in a common reference zzso This zzso is usually carried out on a zzso basis, assuming that after zzso of the functional images with an anatomical template image in the zzso reference system, a correct zzso zzso can be carried out across zzso zzso of such approaches are often dealt with by zzso smoothing the data to increase the overlap between zzso activated zzso This zzso however, cannot adapt to each zzso subject zzso We introduce a novel technique for zzso zzso based on spectral zzso that zzso homogeneous and connected zzso We also propose a zzso method to derive group parcels that are zzso coherent across subjects and functionally zzso We show that we can obtain groups (or zzso of parcels that well zzso zzso zzso We also show that the spatial relaxation embedded in our procedure improves the sensitivity of zzso zzso
