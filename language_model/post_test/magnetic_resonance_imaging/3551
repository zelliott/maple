No study has done a comparative analysis of zzso imaging findings between primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso images and to evaluate the maximum standardized zzso value zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso knowing the imaging features that distinguish zzso from zzso

University zzso care zzso 

The authors analyzed the features on CT, MR imaging, and zzso of 16 patients diagnosed with zzso and 32 patients diagnosed with zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso had a larger tumor volume and showed symmetry of tumor shape than did patients with zzso Patients with zzso also had higher tumor zzso than zzso patients on CT, zzso and zzso MR zzso All zzso patients showed a high degree of enhancement without invasion to the adjacent deep zzso The involvement of the zzso ring was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso max showed no significant difference between zzso and zzso 

If the images present a zzso zzso zzso mass with marked zzso a high degree of enhancement, and a higher zzso ring involvement combined with no invasion into the deep structure, zzso should be considered over zzso
