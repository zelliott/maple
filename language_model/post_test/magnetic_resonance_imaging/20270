The in zzso zzso response associated with zzso barrier zzso opening as induced by zzso focused ultrasound zzso in conjunction with zzso was studied in order to better identify the underlying mechanism in its zzso zzso A zzso focused zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was used as a passive zzso detector zzso to identify the threshold of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso Medical Imaging, MA, zzso A vessel phantom was first used to determine the reliability of the zzso prior to in zzso zzso A cerebral blood vessel was simulated by generating a zzso channel of 610 zzso in diameter inside a zzso gel and by zzso its volume with zzso The zzso were zzso through an excised mouse zzso Second, the same zzso setup was employed for in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso detection during zzso zzso After the intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duty zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 1 zzso with a 30 s zzso to the right zzso of zzso zzso zzso 26) mice in zzso through intact scalp and zzso zzso and zzso MR images were used to verify the zzso zzso A zzso was generated at each pressure in order to detect the zzso onset and zzso The threshold of zzso opening was found to be at a zzso zzso zzso pressure in zzso Both the phantom and in zzso studies indicated that the zzso pressure threshold had a zzso zzso of zzso zzso This indicated that zzso opening may not require zzso at or near the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso opening could be induced without any cellular damage at zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso response could be detected without zzso in mice and zzso may not be required for zzso opening at relatively low zzso
