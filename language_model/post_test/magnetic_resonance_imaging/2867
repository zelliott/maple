To assess the efficacy of fetal zzso zzso in Parkinson's disease, it is important to know if the grafted cells survive and are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been used to demonstrate the survival of the grafted cells, but the relationship of zzso zzso changes in the grafted zzso to motor function remains zzso We investigated this question with 16 serial PET scans in 5 severe zzso patients unilaterally grafted in whom we found a significant and progressive increase of the zzso zzso in the grafted zzso The number of patients was too small to assess the sensitivity of zzso PET scans in individual zzso Yet, by analyzing the 16 serial PET scans we found a correlation between the zzso zzso zzso in the grafted zzso and the percentage of daily time spent zzso suggesting that Ki changes have a functional zzso In addition, the Ki values were correlated with the zzso finger zzso to the same extent in both the grafted and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso reflects the motor function of the opposite side of the body, similarly in the grafted and zzso zzso at least in terms of these zzso Finally, zzso from these correlations offers the suggestion that clinical optimal results of the graft could be achieved if the graft brings the Ki values in the zzso to about two standard zzso of mean control zzso
