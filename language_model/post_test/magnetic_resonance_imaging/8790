zzso treatment appears to be associated with zzso volume increase, but how early this change occurs is still zzso 

A single prospective cohort of 20 zzso patients, newly diagnosed with zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging brain scan at zzso This was repeated following up to 8 weeks of zzso zzso Ten patients had repeat scan within only 3 zzso The choice of zzso medication was zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy individuals were also scanned to control for zzso changes over a zzso zzso 

After 3 weeks of zzso treatment, significant zzso matter volume increase in the right zzso superior and inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso and left inferior zzso zzso was zzso However, after 8 weeks of zzso treatment, volume increase in the right zzso and bilateral zzso was zzso zzso zzso matter reduction was detected in the left zzso frontal zzso at both 3- and zzso zzso 

Early increase in zzso volume change occurs as early as 3 weeks after zzso treatment, whilst zzso volume increase is apparent later, by 8 weeks of zzso We speculate that zzso zzso may provide a zzso for clinical zzso
