zzso zzso usually develop in the zzso space in the anterior spinal zzso and rarely occur inside the zzso Most zzso zzso zzso develop in the zzso zzso We report the first case of an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

The patient was a zzso man who suffered from gait zzso for 6 zzso Although head zzso zzso zzso scanning 4 years previously did not show any zzso zzso CT and magnetic resonance imaging zzso on admission showed a zzso zzso extending from the zzso zzso to the right ambient zzso The zzso was zzso removed via a zzso zzso zzso The zzso wall consisted of a layer of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the results of zzso it was diagnosed as an zzso zzso 

It is possible that the increase of zzso from the cells lining the zzso may have caused a difference in zzso pressure between the zzso fluid and the zzso zzso leading to rapid enlargement of the zzso An zzso zzso should be removed as completely as possible because its cells have the ability to grow and produce zzso
