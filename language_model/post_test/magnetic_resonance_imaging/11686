The ability to provide a complete characterization of elastic properties of bone has vastly improved our understanding of zzso bone mechanical zzso Based on this information, it was possible to validate several mechanical concepts related to the elastic behavior of zzso bone that could not be validated zzso With recently developed zzso scanners and the availability of large parallel computer systems, this technique has also enabled the determination of zzso bone tissue loading conditions from very large zzso models that can represent whole human bones in zzso Such analyses can provide the data needed for a better understanding of bone failure processes or cell zzso load zzso zzso zzso zzso demands for whole bone zzso however, are still zzso Unlike linear stress and strain zzso the application of zzso to study zzso zzso in particular bone failure mechanisms, is still in an early phase zzso of recent studies, however, are promising and indicate that an accurate prediction of bone failure with these techniques is zzso zzso features of such analyses are that they enable zzso failure criteria at the apparent level to be developed using primarily zzso methods as well as that they can provide a basis for detailed analysis of zzso associated with zzso failure at the apparent zzso The application of zzso techniques to analyze bone in zzso is in an early stage as zzso First results have indicated that, although the resolution of presently available in zzso imaging techniques zzso zzso and zzso is much less than that of images used so far for zzso zzso the technique can provide meaningful elastic properties of zzso bone in zzso in most zzso It is expected that the remaining uncertainties in the zzso results can be eliminated as soon as the resolution of in zzso images is zzso With the fast developments in zzso and MR zzso this will probably be in the near zzso
