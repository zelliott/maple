zzso research has identified several brain systems sensitive to statistical zzso within environmental zzso However, the continuous input zzso on sensory zzso is rarely stationary and its degree of zzso may itself change over zzso The goals of the current zzso study were to identify systems sensitive to changes in statistical zzso within an ongoing zzso and determine to what extent sensitivity to such changes depends on intentional monitoring of zzso We predicted that changes in zzso would be coded for in systems previously associated with statistical coding zzso and middle frontal zzso or event zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants listened to a rapid train of four different tones whose order levels zzso over zzso In an active task, participants monitored the tones and indicated when they perceived a change in zzso in a passive task, they performed a concurrent zzso task and could ignore the auditory zzso zzso responses in the active task were used to define points of consensus between participants regarding changes in zzso zzso in zzso epochs that preceded these zzso points was contrasted with activity during zzso epochs where no participant indicated a change in zzso We found that brain regions zzso these two types of epochs matched those identified in prior research as zzso event zzso in narratives and zzso These consisted mainly of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions, with limited involvement of zzso and lateral frontal zzso and no zzso zzso In both tasks, zzso epochs were associated with a higher zzso response than zzso zzso but the specific regions showing this pattern varied across zzso We suggest that zzso an input stream on the basis of statistical shifts constitutes a basic neural function underlying the ability to segment both semantic and zzso zzso We further discuss the implications of these findings for zzso theories of statistical coding and event zzso
