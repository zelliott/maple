Recent zzso and zzso data suggest that speech perception is supported in zzso auditory zzso We evaluate this issue building on well-known behavioral zzso While undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects performed standard auditory tasks: direction discrimination of zzso zzso tones, zzso perception zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso judgments zzso decision, zzso Compared to rest, the three conditions led to bilateral zzso of the auditory zzso However, zzso patterns differed as a function of stimulus zzso the zzso task generated stronger responses in the left, the zzso task a stronger response in the right zzso Contrasts between either words or syllables versus zzso were associated with significantly greater activity zzso in superior zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso These zzso extended into the superior zzso zzso zzso and the middle zzso zzso zzso and were greater in the zzso The same areas were more active in the zzso than the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso task was associated with significantly greater activity in the right zzso zzso and lateral zzso The findings argue for a view in which speech perception is zzso zzso in the auditory zzso and that the well-documented zzso is likely associated with processes subsequent to the auditory analysis of zzso
