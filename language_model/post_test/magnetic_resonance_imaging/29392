Sex and zzso differences in the volumes of cerebral zzso were studied in 20 zzso and 21 left-handed zzso To assess the volumes of cerebral zzso zzso method was used using zzso In zzso the volume of the lateral zzso was higher in the right side than in the left side, but, in zzso it was higher in the left side than in the right zzso The volumes of zzso and third zzso were larger in right-handers than in left zzso There were no sex related differences in terms of the volumes of zzso and left zzso third, and fourth zzso These results suggest that zzso is an important factor reducing the sizes of all the brain zzso
