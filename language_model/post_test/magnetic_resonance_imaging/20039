zzso resonance zzso spin labeling zzso at 3 zzso has been investigated as a quantitative technique for measuring regional cerebral zzso zzso in newborn zzso zzso values were measured in 49 healthy zzso 32 zzso infants born before 34 zzso of gestation and 17 zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso infants at zzso age of zzso zzso in both zzso Due to motion, reliable data were obtained from 23 zzso and 6 term zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso for zzso and term zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than in cortical gray matter (19 and 16 zzso zzso and white matter (15 and 10 zzso zzso both in zzso zzso at zzso age and in term zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group than in the term zzso indicating that zzso may be influenced by zzso and zzso zzso This study zzso for the first time, that zzso zzso at zzso may be used to measure zzso in healthy zzso zzso and term zzso zzso is, therefore, a viable tool that will allow serial studies of zzso in high-risk zzso
