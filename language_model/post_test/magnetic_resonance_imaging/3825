zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a useful technology for investigating regional zzso activity in the zzso Many experiments using zzso have been performed, but because of variations in protocols and zzso techniques, the results zzso When a zzso information of the task is known, a zzso technique, such as statistical zzso zzso is often used for zzso In the case of acid stimulation of the esophagus the task model is zzso so we analyzed brain activity during an acid or zzso saline infusion to the esophagus using independent component analysis zzso which does not depend on a zzso information of the zzso 

Six healthy male volunteers zzso zzso participated in the zzso A zzso zzso was inserted zzso and zzso infusions ports were approximately 15 zzso zzso to the lower zzso zzso The experimental protocol was zzso zzso zzso saline infusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso and a final zzso zzso After magnetic resonance zzso zzso image data were analyzed using group zzso 

The cerebral regions activated during the first zzso saline infusion, and zzso infusion were the thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso pole and some parts of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso occurred during both zzso but was not observed during the first zzso 

zzso which can show the cerebral areas activated in relation to liquid in the zzso may be a powerful technique for studying the zzso response to visceral zzso
