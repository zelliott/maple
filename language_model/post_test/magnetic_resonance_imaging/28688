To investigate the association between pulmonary function and zzso cerebral zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso identified by zzso and believed to represent zzso zzso of zzso generalized zzso or zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Two communities in the United zzso 

A sample of zzso African-American and white men and women 55 to 72 years old who were selected from the second follow-up examination of the zzso zzso in Communities Study zzso 

zzso zzso 

The lung function indexes, zzso and zzso were assessed according to American zzso Society zzso zzso cerebral zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso After adjusting for age, ethnicity, zzso zzso and height zzso a zzso decrease of zzso in nonsmokers was associated with odds ratios zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso Of those in the lowest zzso of zzso zzso had zzso and zzso in contrast to zzso of the individuals in the uppermost zzso of zzso zzso associations were also observed by using zzso as an index of pulmonary zzso Similar patterns of association were found among current zzso The associations were not altered by additional adjustment of conventional risk factors of cardiovascular disease, zzso or cognitive zzso 

The results from this zzso study suggest that lower pulmonary function is associated with zzso cerebral zzso
