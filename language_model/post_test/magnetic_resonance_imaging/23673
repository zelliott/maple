zzso of surgical treatment for zzso in functional cerebral areas depend on the ratio between the definitive neurological deficit and the beneficial effect of zzso zzso of eloquent zzso is difficult because of important individual zzso zzso direct cortical and zzso electrical zzso zzso provide the most precise and reliable method currently available allowing identification and preservation of zzso essential for zzso zzso and zzso We report our preliminary experience with zzso in surgery of zzso zzso tumors with a consecutive series of 15 patients operated from November 96 through September 97 in our zzso zzso symptoms in the 15 patients (8 zzso 7 zzso mean age 43 zzso were zzso in 11 cases zzso and neurological deficit in 4 cases zzso Clinical examination was normal in 11 patients and revealed zzso in zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso with three-dimensional reconstruction showed a zzso tumor in 10 cases, central zzso in one patient, zzso zzso in two cases, right insular tumor zzso zzso in one zzso All patients underwent surgical zzso using zzso with detection in 13 cases of motor zzso and zzso pathways under zzso zzso in one case of zzso area under local zzso and in one case of language areas also under local zzso The tumor was zzso in two patients had been operated earlier but without zzso zzso verified by zzso zzso was total in 12 cases zzso and estimated at zzso in 3 zzso zzso examination revealed an zzso zzso in 12 cases (8 low grade zzso 3 low grade zzso and one zzso zzso and zzso in 3 zzso Eight patients had no zzso deficit, while the other 7 patients were impaired, with, in all cases except one, complete recovery in 15 days to 2 zzso zzso cortical and zzso electrical zzso offer a reliable, precise and safe method, allowing functional mapping especially useful in case of zzso cerebral tumors in eloquent zzso This technique allows improvement in the quality of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso of the risk of definitive zzso neurological zzso
