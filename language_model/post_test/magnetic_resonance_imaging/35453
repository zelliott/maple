Experimental evidence suggests that zzso which zzso the opening of zzso zzso zzso zzso lethal zzso injury that occurs at the time of zzso In this pilot trial, we sought to determine whether the administration of zzso at the time of zzso coronary intervention zzso would limit the size of the zzso during acute zzso zzso 

We randomly assigned 58 patients who presented with acute zzso zzso zzso to receive either an intravenous zzso of zzso zzso of zzso per zzso of body weight zzso zzso or normal saline zzso zzso immediately before undergoing zzso zzso size was assessed in all patients by measuring the release of zzso zzso and zzso I and in a zzso of 27 patients by performing magnetic resonance imaging zzso on day 5 after zzso 

The zzso and control groups were similar with respect to zzso time, the size of the area at risk, and the ejection fraction before zzso The release of zzso zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso group as compared with the control group zzso The release of zzso I was not significantly reduced zzso On day 5, the absolute mass of the area of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso group as compared with the control group, with a median of 37 g zzso range, 21 to zzso versus 46 g zzso range, 20 to zzso zzso No adverse effects of zzso administration were zzso 

In our small, pilot trial, administration of zzso at the time of zzso was associated with a smaller zzso by some measures than that seen with zzso These data are preliminary and require confirmation in a larger clinical zzso
