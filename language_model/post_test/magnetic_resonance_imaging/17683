zzso of new Multiple zzso zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso is important as a marker of disease activity and as a potential surrogate for zzso We propose an approach where sequential scans are jointly zzso to provide a temporally consistent tissue zzso while remaining sensitive to newly appearing zzso The method uses a zzso zzso process: 1) a zzso zzso provides a zzso brain tissue zzso at each zzso of reference and follow-up scans, and 2) a zzso based zzso zzso provides a final identification of new zzso zzso models are learned based on 364 scans from 95 subjects from a zzso clinical zzso The method is evaluated on sequential brain zzso of 160 subjects from a separate zzso clinical trial, and is compared to 1) zzso generated ground truth zzso and 2) fully manual identification of new zzso generated independently by nine expert zzso on a subset of 60 zzso For new zzso greater than zzso zzso in size, the zzso has near perfect performance zzso sensitivity, zzso false detection zzso as compared to ground zzso The proposed method was also shown to exceed the performance of any one of the nine expert manual zzso
