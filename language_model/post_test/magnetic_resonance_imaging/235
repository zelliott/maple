This study examined midterm results after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso graft zzso Santa Rosa, zzso in patients with acute or chronic zzso zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso zzso 180 patients were treated for acute or chronic zzso dissection zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had acute zzso complications with signs of zzso zzso zzso or persistent zzso the remainder were in stable zzso zzso diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso the distance from the left zzso artery to the zzso entry tear was zzso zzso zzso zzso and dissection extended beyond the zzso axis in zzso of zzso zzso of covered zzso measured zzso zzso zzso zzso with one zzso graft used in 125 zzso zzso 

zzso success was zzso Nine patients died within 30 days, yielding an overall early mortality of zzso For zzso outcome, zzso analysis showed that age greater than 75 years zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso P zzso zzso American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and emergency status zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were independent zzso of major adverse zzso Compared with zzso treated patients, emergency status was associated with a higher zzso of zzso mortality zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and zzso events zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso However, patients with acute dissection had a smaller baseline diameter and were less often identified to have secondary zzso and progressive zzso Average follow-up for hospital survivors was zzso zzso zzso months with an estimated survival of zzso zzso zzso at 30 days, zzso zzso zzso at 12 months, zzso zzso zzso at 24 months, and zzso zzso zzso % at 36 zzso During zzso 30 patients required a total of 32 secondary interventions including 12 open and 20 zzso procedures, accounting for an estimated zzso freedom from zzso at 36 zzso zzso imaging revealed stable or decreasing zzso zzso diameter in zzso of zzso 

zzso treatment for zzso dissection is associated with reasonably low morbidity and zzso zzso surveillance is crucial to define more zzso the durability of zzso graft treatment of zzso dissection and to determine which patients are appropriate candidates for zzso graft zzso
