The American Academy of zzso now recommends that all cases of cerebral zzso of unknown origin undergo zzso zzso surrounds this recommendation because of concerns about the zzso of the supporting zzso This article reviews the evidence provided by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging studies in cerebral zzso and discusses the potential benefits of imaging, techniques in current use, and future directions, with a focus on improving zzso zzso Most zzso children with cerebral zzso have abnormal zzso findings, with white matter damage the most common zzso Combined gray and white matter abnormalities are more common among children with zzso isolated white matter abnormalities are more common with bilateral zzso or zzso and with zzso isolated gray matter damage is the least common zzso About zzso of cerebral zzso is attributable to brain zzso and zzso of cerebral zzso cases have no zzso zzso by conventional MR or CT zzso Although zzso studies have increased our understanding of the abnormalities in brain development in cerebral zzso they are less zzso than they might be because of 4 common problems: zzso inappropriate assignment of zzso to zzso findings, zzso inconsistent descriptions of zzso findings, zzso uncertain relationship of zzso findings to brain insult timing estimates, and zzso study designs that are not based on zzso zzso zzso is not necessarily required for diagnosis of cerebral zzso because the disorder is based on clinical zzso The principal contribution of imaging is to the understanding of zzso and zzso including ruling in or out conditions that may have implications for genetic counseling, such as zzso In the future, as more sophisticated imaging procedures are applied to cerebral zzso specific zzso findings may be linked to zzso events or zzso thus leading to potential pathways for zzso
