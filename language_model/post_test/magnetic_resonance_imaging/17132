zzso competency in mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso carriers was used as an zzso and gray matter volume in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso controls was zzso zzso gray matter volumes were correlated with age of acquisition values for words from a category zzso task, an index of semantic zzso zzso patients had significantly impoverished zzso output compared with controls, more marked in zzso zzso zzso Smaller volumes in the left zzso bilateral regions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were associated with a tendency to retrieve earlier acquired words in the category zzso task in zzso zzso carriers, whereas poor semantic performance in zzso zzso was associated with smaller volumes in the left zzso bilateral regions of the zzso zzso and zzso and also in a large number of zzso zzso There was a significant semantic competency by zzso interaction in the left zzso cortex, in a number of left frontal and zzso areas and in the right inferior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso carriers, when compared with zzso had lower gray matter volume values confined to the right zzso and the zzso zzso but the converse comparison showed that zzso zzso had lower values in extensive zzso zzso and zzso regions of the zzso Similar brain zzso variations linked to zzso were found in zzso zzso The results suggest a relatively specific impact of zzso E zzso zzso burden and underline the value of linguistic assessment in zzso zzso
