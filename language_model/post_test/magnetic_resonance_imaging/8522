To describe the effects of smoking on change in knee cartilage volume and increases in knee cartilage zzso and to test for interaction between smoking and family history of zzso zzso 

zzso with at least 1 parent having severe primary knee zzso zzso and randomly selected controls without this history (a total of 325 subjects with a mean age of 45 zzso were measured at baseline and zzso years zzso zzso cartilage volume and zzso score (on a zzso zzso were determined using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Smoking status and duration and number of cigarettes were recorded by zzso 

In zzso smoking was associated with annual change in zzso and lateral zzso cartilage volume zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso respectively, for current smokers versus former smokers and those who had never zzso beta zzso zzso at both zzso sites, for smoking zzso in zzso zzso Smoking was also associated with increases zzso zzso in zzso and lateral zzso cartilage zzso scores zzso ratio zzso zzso and OR zzso respectively, for current smokers versus those who had never zzso OR zzso and OR zzso respectively, for heavy smoking zzso of zzso zzso versus never zzso (all P zzso zzso In contrast, smoking was not associated with any of the above in controls except for change in lateral zzso cartilage zzso There was significant interaction between smoking and zzso status for change in zzso zzso cartilage volume zzso zzso zzso and increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso 

Smoking leads to knee cartilage loss and zzso development primarily in individuals with a family history of knee zzso This provides evidence for a zzso interaction in the zzso of knee zzso
