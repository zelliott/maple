This zzso study investigates the neural mechanisms supporting the retrieval of action zzso A novel motor imagery task was used in which participants were required to imagine planning actions with a familiar object zzso a zzso or with an unfamiliar object zzso a pair of zzso based on either zzso information zzso where to move the zzso or zzso information zzso how to grasp the zzso Planning actions with unfamiliar compared to familiar objects was slower and was associated with increased zzso in the bilateral superior zzso zzso the right inferior zzso lobe and the right zzso The stronger zzso in zzso areas for unfamiliar objects fits well with the idea that zzso areas are involved in motor imagery and suggests that this process takes more effort in the case of novel or unfamiliar zzso In contrast, the planning of familiar actions resulted in increased zzso in the anterior prefrontal cortex, suggesting that subjects maintained a stronger zzso when planning actions with familiar compared to unfamiliar zzso These findings provide further insight into the neural structures that support action semantic knowledge for the functional use of real-world objects and suggest that action semantic knowledge is activated most readily when actions are planned in a zzso zzso
