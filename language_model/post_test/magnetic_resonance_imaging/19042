Previous studies have provided preliminary zzso evidence supporting the theory that symptoms of zzso disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso may be zzso of prior zzso zzso It is zzso however, whether previously reported associations with zzso infection were obscured by the presence of diagnostic zzso It is also unknown whether zzso infection is associated in zzso with anatomical zzso of the brain structures that have been implicated in the zzso of these zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were measured in 105 people diagnosed as having zzso zzso or zzso disorder zzso and in 37 community controls without a zzso zzso were zzso with regard to their history of zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were measured in 113 of these subjects (79 patients and 34 zzso 

A zzso diagnosis of zzso was associated significantly with zzso of 2 distinct zzso zzso zzso O and zzso zzso These associations remained significant after controlling for the effects of zzso and zzso zzso No significant association was seen between zzso zzso and a diagnosis of either zzso or zzso When zzso zzso volumes were included in these zzso the relationships between zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were significantly different in zzso and zzso subjects compared with other diagnostic zzso Higher zzso zzso in these subjects were associated with larger volumes of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that the prior reports of an association between zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso may have been zzso by the presence of zzso They also support the hypothesis that in susceptible persons who have zzso or zzso chronic or zzso zzso infections are associated with structural zzso in zzso zzso zzso
