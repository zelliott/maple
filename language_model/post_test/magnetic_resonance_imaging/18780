To examine with magnetic resonance imaging zzso resonance zzso zzso the long-term effects of zzso in a canine cardiac zzso zzso 

Twenty-two zzso underwent a zzso zzso followed by 10 days of zzso zzso zzso and zzso MRS were performed to monitor function and metabolism of the heart in the control (N zzso 10) and zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso were injected to determine coronary blood flow, and zzso ex zzso zzso assessed zzso zzso 

zzso produced a significant reduction zzso controls, in zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso and at days 3 and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery of the zzso was significantly improved immediately upon zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for controls, zzso zzso zzso for zzso and at day 3, but not by day zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were similar for controls and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso early functional recovery, while delaying zzso of zzso pH following zzso but zzso neither long-term functional or zzso protection nor, most importantly, zzso zzso
