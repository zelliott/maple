Changes in collateral blood flow, which sustains brain viability zzso to zzso zzso may impact zzso evolution but have not previously been demonstrated in zzso We correlated zzso collateral flow, assessed using novel zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso processing at baseline and 3 to 5 days, with simultaneous assessment of zzso zzso zzso raw data were averaged across three consecutive slices to increase zzso collateral vessel continuity after zzso of baseline signal analogous to digital zzso zzso Changes in collateral quality, zzso zzso severity, and zzso growth were assessed between baseline and days 3 to 5 zzso zzso Acute zzso was zzso for 88 patients zzso 3 to zzso after zzso stroke zzso Better collateral flow at baseline was associated with larger zzso mismatch zzso zzso zzso zzso and smaller baseline diffusion zzso volume zzso zzso zzso In 30 patients without zzso at day 3 to 5, deterioration in collateral quality between baseline and zzso imaging was strongly associated with absolute zzso and relative zzso zzso zzso The deterioration in collateral grade correlated with increased mean zzso zzso severity zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso severity was also significantly associated with absolute zzso and relative zzso zzso zzso zzso flow is dynamic and failure is associated with zzso zzso
