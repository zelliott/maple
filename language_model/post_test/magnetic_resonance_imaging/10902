zzso zzso can be very beneficial for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no mention in any literature regarding the use of zzso zzso for the treatment of spinal burst zzso 

A preliminary study was conducted on 6 patients with traumatic burst fractures of zzso treated with zzso zzso starting in June zzso zzso involving the anterior and middle columns of the zzso and the canal were mildly compressed by the zzso bone zzso However, there was no obvious zzso deficit in these zzso They initially underwent conservative treatment and zzso spinal zzso zzso brace for at least 3 months, but the intractable pain caused patients to be bedridden for prolonged periods of time and limited daily zzso As a result, the patients underwent zzso zzso with zzso zzso for treatment of spinal burst zzso 

Six male patients zzso age: zzso who suffered from burst fractures of zzso with disabling back pain zzso to zzso therapy and zzso brace were treated in this zzso The duration of conservation treatment period was zzso months to 8 months zzso zzso zzso There was no zzso However, 4 zzso zzso on zzso revealed evidence of zzso leakage through the zzso fracture site into either the disc space or the zzso space, without any evident clinical zzso No zzso leakage was seen, and no patient needed a secondary surgical zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso zzso at the third zzso day, zzso zzso zzso at 3 months and 24 zzso zzso zzso at 12 zzso The reduction in pain from baseline to the zzso and 3 month mark was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The mobility was at least 2 levels of improvement zzso improvement zzso points) at zzso zzso 

In highly selective patients, zzso zzso can be an alternative method for the treatment of spinal burst fractures and the prevention of complications from major surgical zzso However, this procedure still has potential risks and should be employed with extreme caution to prevent zzso of zzso into the spinal zzso
