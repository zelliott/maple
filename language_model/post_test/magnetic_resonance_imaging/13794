The purpose of this investigation was to prove that a partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament zzso at the zzso attachment of the zzso bundle can result in mechanical knee zzso and trigger the injury mechanism of an isolated zzso zzso 

Case zzso 

From February 1993 through June 1999, 19 cases of knee zzso with observation of a torn zzso confirmed under zzso were zzso zzso ages ranged from 22 to 54 zzso The causes of injury were sporting activities in 14 patients (8 skiing, 4 soccer, and 2 zzso slipping and falling in 2 zzso a pedestrian car accident in 2 zzso and an unknown zzso injury in 1 zzso 

On physical examination, each patient indicated that the chief complaint was knee zzso all had a locked knee at 5 degree to 20 degree of full extension and 4 cases showed a locked knee at full zzso Of the 19 cases, zzso testing was positive in zzso With respect to zzso injuries, 3 patients had a tear in the zzso zzso and 1 had a tear in the lateral zzso The average time span between zzso examinations was 3 months with a range of 1 to 10 zzso zzso diagnosis and treatment were performed and zzso tear was ruled out as the cause of zzso in all zzso 

The mechanisms of injury for isolated zzso were knee zzso and internal rotation of lower zzso brought on especially by a zzso zzso The partial zzso tears were found on the zzso attachment site of the zzso zzso The torn segment of the zzso was zzso between the lateral zzso zzso and the lateral zzso zzso and acted as a mechanical zzso giving rise to the zzso zzso In all 19 cases, the torn portion of the zzso was excised under zzso and the locked knees were treated zzso
