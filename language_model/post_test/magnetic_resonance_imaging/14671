zzso individuals make poor decisions on the Iowa zzso zzso a zzso decision-making task that involves risk and zzso Task performance depends on several factors, including how sensitive individuals are to feedback and how well they learn based on such zzso A zzso signal that guides decision making based on feedback is prediction zzso The authors investigated whether disruptions in the neural systems underlying prediction error processing in zzso individuals could account for decision-making performance on a modified Iowa zzso zzso 

zzso zzso individuals and 30 healthy comparison subjects played a modified version of the Iowa zzso Task during MR zzso zzso behavior and functional zzso zzso zzso zzso signal were analyzed using a zzso model of prediction error based on internal zzso The authors investigated how well zzso signal tracked prediction error in the zzso and the zzso zzso as well as over the whole brain in patients relative to comparison zzso 

Compared with healthy subjects, zzso patients were less sensitive to loss compared with gain, made less consistent choices, and performed worse on the modified Iowa zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not track prediction error as strongly in patients as in healthy zzso 

zzso tracking of prediction error in zzso relative to healthy individuals suggests that altered zzso error learning signals may zzso decision-making zzso in drug zzso zzso zzso may help bridge the knowledge gap between physiology and behavior to inform research aimed at substance abuse zzso
