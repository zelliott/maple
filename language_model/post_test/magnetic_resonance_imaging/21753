We studied 18 zzso brains using zzso and correlated our data with subsequent gross and microscopic zzso 9 of our patients died from brain diseases zzso due to zzso 4, stroke due to zzso 1, encephalitis 2, head injury 1, brain tumor zzso 9 of our patients died from zzso diseases zzso cancer 1, colon cancer 1, liver zzso 1, zzso zzso 2, trauma zzso In zzso of zzso brain, zzso and T zzso was able to clearly show the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso internal capsule and zzso radiation in a 2 zzso The findings were similar to zzso of live zzso In normal adult zzso zzso the zzso showed a relatively low signal intensity of white matter as compared to gray zzso The pictures were similar to zzso density images, not zzso of normal adult zzso The reason why the signal intensity of the white matter was lower than the gray matter may have been due to zzso of zzso of zzso sheath in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to detect the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso spots (which corresponding to the widening of the zzso zzso space because of zzso in the brains of our elderly zzso zzso zzso detected the zzso zzso which appeared as a dark signal in both short and long zzso zzso However, zzso did not show blood in the zzso zzso or superficial zzso in the zzso of zzso Brain zzso was revealed in the zzso zzso and appeared as low signal intensity in zzso and zzso in zzso It was associated with a significant mass zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
