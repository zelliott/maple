Conventional zzso or statistical analysis methods for functional zzso zzso are easy to zzso and are effective in analyzing data with simple zzso However, they are not zzso in situations in which patterns of neural response are complicated and when zzso response is zzso In this paper the zzso zzso network is adapted and zzso studied for analyzing zzso zzso The zzso supports spatial connectivity aiding in the identification of zzso sites in functional brain zzso A comparison of this new method with zzso zzso map and with a fuzzy zzso scheme based on deterministic zzso is done in a systematic zzso study showing comparative quantitative zzso The most important findings in this paper are: zzso both zzso zzso and the fuzzy zzso technique outperform zzso map in terms of identifying signal components with high correlation to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the two other methods with respect to the zzso error, and zzso zzso map zzso the two other methods in terms of zzso zzso The zzso of the new zzso is demonstrated on experimental zzso
