Small vessel diseases have been studied zzso with magnetic resonance zzso zzso observation or zzso of the connected zzso to the zzso however, was not possible due to the limited zzso zzso one could not determine whether vessel zzso or abnormal narrowing is the cause of an zzso 

In this report, we demonstrate that the small vessel related to the zzso can be detected using zzso (7 zzso magnetic resonance imaging and a three zzso image analysis and modeling technique for zzso which thereby enables us to zzso the vessel zzso directly, that is, zzso the vessel that is related to the zzso We compared vessels of selected stroke patients, who had recovered from stroke, with vessels from typical stroke patients, who had after effects like motor zzso and zzso healthy subjects to demonstrate the potential of the zzso 

The experimental results show that typical stroke patients had overall degradation or loss of small vessels, compared with the selected patients as well as healthy zzso The selected patients, however, had only minimal loss of vessels, except for one vessel located close to the zzso zzso 

These preliminary results demonstrated that 7 T magnetic resonance imaging together with a three zzso image analysis and modeling technique could provide information for detection of the vessel related to the zzso In addition, three zzso image analysis and modeling of vessels could further provide quantitative information on the zzso structures zzso diameter, length and zzso
