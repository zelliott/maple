zzso of a moving visual stimulus can be suppressed or enhanced by surrounding context in adjacent parts of the visual zzso We studied the neural processes underlying such contextual zzso with zzso We selected motion selective regions of interest zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso with sufficiently well defined topography to zzso direct zzso by the zzso zzso signal in the zzso was suppressed when surround motion direction matched central stimulus direction, and increased when it was zzso With the exception of zzso inserting a gap between the stimulus and the surround abolished surround zzso This zzso between zzso and other motion selective regions prompted us to ask whether motion perception is closely linked to processing in zzso or reflects the net activity across all motion selective zzso The motion zzso zzso provided a measure of motion perception, and the same stimulus zzso that were used in the zzso experiments served as zzso Using a linear model, we found that the zzso was predicted more accurately by the zzso signal in zzso than it was by the zzso signal in other motion selective zzso However, a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy could be achieved by using the net activity across all motion selective zzso as a zzso suggesting the overall conclusion that visual motion perception depends upon the integration of activity across different areas of visual zzso
