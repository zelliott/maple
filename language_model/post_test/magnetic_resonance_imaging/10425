zzso embolism and stroke are feared complications of left zzso zzso zzso such as pulmonary vein zzso zzso In order to assess the zzso of left zzso zzso zzso knowledge of both clinically evident as well as silent cerebral embolism is zzso The aim of the current study was to examine the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for detection of cerebral zzso apparent as well as silent, caused by zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty consecutive patients without structural heart disease undergoing lasso zzso zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and zzso zzso spin echo sequences were performed the day after the zzso zzso Ten patients also underwent zzso cerebral zzso All zzso procedures were performed without acute zzso A mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso per zzso No patient had neurological symptoms following the zzso In 2 of 20 patients zzso zzso revealed new zzso zzso which were located in the right zzso white matter in one and in the left zzso lobe in the other zzso There was no statistically significant difference in age, history of hypertension, left zzso volume, and procedure duration between the 2 patients with and the 18 patients without cerebral embolism following zzso zzso 

This is the first study using highly sensitive zzso of the brain to detect zzso cerebral embolism after left zzso zzso zzso Even small, clinically silent, zzso zzso can be demonstrated with this zzso zzso can be used to monitor and compare the zzso of different zzso zzso zzso
