To evaluate the ability of zzso nerve zzso to zzso the face in patients with complete nuclear zzso facial nerve zzso 

zzso case zzso 

zzso academic medical zzso 

Four patients with complete facial nerve paralysis due to zzso of the facial nucleus in the zzso caused by zzso due to zzso or cavernous zzso zzso stroke, or injury after tumor zzso 

All patients underwent zzso zzso nerve zzso 

zzso nerve function using the zzso zzso scale and physical and zzso function using the facial disability zzso 

The mean age of the patients was zzso years zzso zzso There were 3 female and 1 male zzso All patients had zzso facial function HB zzso With a minimum of 12 months' follow-up after zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients regained function to HB grade zzso and zzso had HB grade zzso Average facial disability index scores were zzso for physical function and 78 for zzso comparable to results from complete zzso zzso after peripheral facial nerve zzso after acoustic zzso zzso 

Patients with nuclear facial paralysis who undergo zzso zzso nerve zzso achieve similar degrees of zzso compared with those with peripheral facial nerve zzso This raises the intriguing possibility that zzso may also be of benefit in patients with the vastly more common facial dysfunction because of cortical stroke or zzso
