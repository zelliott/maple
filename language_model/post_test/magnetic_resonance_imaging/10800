The influence of emotional contents on brain zzso was examined using functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso 100 zzso of the whole brain, series of positive and negative pictures from the International zzso Picture System zzso were shown to eight depressed males and to healthy zzso 

In depression, there was an zzso in zzso area during positive zzso whereas an zzso of amygdala, zzso and prefrontal regions was seen during negative zzso 

These results emphasize the importance of functional interaction between the neural network associated with zzso We could show that depression is connected to zzso and disturbed functional connectivity during emotional zzso
