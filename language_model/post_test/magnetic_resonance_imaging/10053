zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso are rare and extremely aggressive zzso seen primarily in zzso Imaging features are often considered zzso However, correct diagnosis of zzso is important because these tumors have a markedly different clinical prognosis and require more aggressive zzso 

To determine the imaging features of zzso 

We zzso analyzed imaging findings in 11 patients with primary zzso zzso presenting over a period of 5 zzso CT zzso MR zzso clinical zzso and pathological zzso features were zzso FISH analysis showing zzso of zzso 22 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was available for three zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was performed on all zzso 

There were 11 patients, 6 boys and 5 zzso The age of presentation varied from 1 month to 15 years zzso age 3 years 8 zzso Six tumors were located in the zzso zzso and five in the zzso zzso The tumors showed a zzso solid component zzso that showed moderate to marked enhancement with contrast zzso On MR imaging, the zzso signal pattern was zzso on zzso images zzso and zzso zzso with zzso on zzso images zzso All tumors were large in size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and there was a tendency for zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was also a high tendency for zzso zzso with five patients zzso demonstrating brain and/or spinal zzso At follow-up zzso six patients showed local zzso At the time of zzso all these patients showed extensive zzso spread of the disease in both zzso and zzso zzso 

There are no specific imaging features for zzso zzso But a high tendency toward large size, a zzso solid component on CT scan with zzso zzso necrosis and zzso spread suggest that this tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of large pediatric zzso zzso
