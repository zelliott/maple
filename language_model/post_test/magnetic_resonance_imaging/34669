zzso resonance imaging zzso has proven useful for zzso and functional evaluation of the zzso However, until recently assessment of zzso zzso has not been possible by zzso Using newly developed zzso imaging zzso images can be acquired rapidly with a high zzso resolution, which is a prerequisite for imaging the initial passage of a zzso of zzso medium through the zzso Only zzso zzso which rapidly diffuse out of vascular space, are currently approved for clinical zzso The first pass of a zzso of one of these agents through zzso zzso zzso to a coronary artery zzso enhances this area less as compared to normally zzso zzso This different zzso enhancement is often visible when looking at the series of MR zzso However, intensity differences are rapidly decreasing as zzso media are diluted in the zzso circulation after the first pass and diffuse to the zzso zzso only the first pass is of interest for zzso zzso Additional and often more precise information can be derived by measuring parameters of the signal intensity time curve such as mean transit time, maximum signal intensity increase, zzso zzso and delay before reaching maximum signal zzso zzso resolution is the crucial factor in zzso imaging because it takes only 20 to 60 seconds for the contrast medium to pass through the zzso zzso this dynamic process must be zzso with a high zzso zzso Moreover, image acquisition must be fast enough to minimize motion zzso and to maximize the spatial coverage of the zzso zzso zzso echo techniques and echo zzso imaging are in principle capable to fulfill these zzso While zzso zzso echo sequences enable one to acquire a maximum of 2 slices per zzso echo zzso sequences need only 30 to 50 zzso to completely acquire one image and are thus able to image the entire zzso within one zzso However, they are also more susceptible to image zzso As zzso capable of producing high quality echo zzso images are not widely available, zzso zzso echo techniques are commonly used for zzso zzso A good correlation between quantitative estimates of zzso zzso by zzso after injection of an zzso contrast agent and zzso zzso has been shown in animal experiments but quantitative MR zzso zzso have not yet been performed in zzso Clinical studies have until now focused on visual and zzso analysis of signal intensity time zzso From these studies, sensitivities and zzso in the range of 60 to zzso as compared to zzso coronary zzso and zzso were reported despite the fact that only parts of the left zzso zzso could be zzso However, a generally accepted method of acquiring and zzso MR zzso images does not yet zzso zzso future improvements of hardware and zzso as well as the development of new blood pool contrast agents are necessary before zzso imaging will become a widely accepted and clinically useful diagnostic zzso
