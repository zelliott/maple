We report the case of a zzso man with a recent anterior zzso zzso for which he did not receive prompt zzso zzso The patient underwent cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging, for the assessment of left zzso function and zzso zzso and coronary zzso two weeks after the acute cardiac zzso The zzso study demonstrated a moderately zzso left zzso with impaired zzso function and wall motion abnormalities in the zzso zzso and inferior left zzso zzso The zzso images obtained early after contrast administration demonstrated a dark rim in the zzso region of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso images demonstrated complete absence of signal at the same zzso adjacent to a zzso region that corresponded to the wall motion zzso These findings are suggestive of zzso obstruction in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary zzso zzso obstruction has been reported to correlate positively with the size of the zzso and the left zzso zzso volume, and zzso with the left zzso ejection zzso Furthermore, it has been reported as an independent predictor of future major cardiovascular zzso zzso obstruction should be routinely checked for in patients presenting in the zzso zzso period for zzso assessment of zzso zzso
