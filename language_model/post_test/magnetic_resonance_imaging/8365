The present experiment used zzso to investigate whether neural zzso of recognition memory behave in a manner consistent with the proposal that recognition decisions are based on a zzso memory strength zzso A modified zzso recognition test was used in which participants could indicate two levels of zzso Participants were required to indicate whether a test item was new, familiar zzso zzso recollection of general contextual details from the study episode zzso zzso or zzso a specific recollection of the item with which it was paired at study zzso zzso Little evidence could be found to support the view that zzso judgments reflect variations along a single strength zzso Instead, the findings zzso prior research in indicating that the neural zzso of recollection and familiarity can be doubly zzso Two zzso regions - left lateral inferior zzso and left zzso zzso - were found to be sensitive to amount of information zzso as zzso in the contrast between zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed that these regions may support the representation of zzso zzso
