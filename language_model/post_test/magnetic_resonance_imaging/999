Continuous surveillance of patients' zzso volume may be of benefit during the treatment of various zzso zzso In order to design optimal zzso volume monitoring equipment, information about the shape and position of the zzso not at least in relation to posture, is zzso The purpose of this study was consequently to evaluate the influence of body position on the change in shape and position of the zzso 

zzso was performed in three young volunteers during posture zzso zzso scans in the zzso frontal and zzso planes were recorded in zzso of various zzso The position of the zzso zzso in the three planes was zzso Moreover, to account for its shape, the zzso of the zzso of the zzso was calculated on the basis of its perimeter and zzso 

For the zzso and zzso positions, the zzso zzso were 4 and 5 zzso zzso In the zzso direction the displacement zzso but was zzso zzso The zzso changed zzso by zzso indicating a minimal change in zzso 

In young subjects, the position and shape of the zzso only change modestly for different body positions, thus eliminating the need for special correction measures when designing zzso volume monitoring zzso
