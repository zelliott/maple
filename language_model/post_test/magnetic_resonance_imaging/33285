The formation of new sound categories is fundamental to everyday zzso zzso zzso requires the abstraction of discrete classes from continuous physical features as required by context and zzso zzso in animals has shown that learning to categorize novel sounds alters their zzso neural representation at the level of early auditory zzso However, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies so far did not yield insight into the effects of category learning on sound representations in human auditory zzso This may be due to the use of zzso zzso categories and zzso zzso zzso leading to insufficient sensitivity to distinguish the responses to zzso novel sound zzso Here, we used zzso pattern analysis to investigate changes in human auditory cortical response patterns induced by category zzso We created complex novel sound categories and analyzed distributed zzso patterns during passive listening to a sound zzso before and after category zzso We show that only after training, sound categories could be successfully zzso from early auditory areas and that zzso pattern changes were specific to the zzso sound feature zzso zzso zzso the similarity between zzso response patterns for the sound zzso mirrored the zzso shape of the behavioral category identification zzso Our results indicate that zzso representations of novel sound categories emerge from neural changes at early levels of the human auditory processing zzso
