The goal of this article is to zzso the influence of zzso artifacts in the magnetic resonance zzso zzso map zzso on reconstructed zzso zzso zzso zzso image volumes and to propose a new method for minimizing this zzso 

PET data sets of 20 patients investigated in a Philips zzso zzso were reconstructed with and without applying two different methods for zzso compensation zzso zzso zzso newly zzso In this patient group, the extent of zzso artifacts and quality of the zzso compensation zzso was assessed visually in the zzso In three additional patients zzso generated by zzso zzso could be compared to the ground truth of zzso zzso maps obtained with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The influence of zzso on regional zzso in zzso other hot structures zzso zzso zzso and the arms was assessed in suitable volume of interests zzso 

zzso compensated zzso exhibited residual artifacts in the arms in 16 patients for zzso zzso and to a lesser extent in eight patients for zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso maps zzso zzso slightly overestimated the size of the truncated arms by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Without zzso compensation, zzso located in the trunk showed an average zzso zzso of less than zzso relative to the results obtained with zzso Inside the patients' arms zzso up to zzso were zzso 

In the zzso standardized zzso values zzso zzso due to zzso artifacts in the zzso are rather zzso Inside the arms, severe zzso zzso can zzso zzso reliable zzso is mandatory and can be achieved by applying the newly developed zzso zzso which has yielded promising results so zzso Implementation of the proposed method is straightforward and should be easily adaptable to other zzso zzso
