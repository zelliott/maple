zzso fatty liver disease is an emerging diagnosis in the pediatric zzso Previously, zzso and serum zzso have been used to estimate prevalence of the zzso A lack of zzso has been noted between these two diagnostic zzso To better understand the spectrum of fatty liver in obese children and the relationship of serum zzso to the severity of zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso fat zzso 

Twenty-two children, ages 6 to 18 years, with obesity zzso zzso 95th zzso for zzso and zzso zzso edge more than 2 zzso below the right zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso for fat zzso zzso zzso was performed using a modification of the Dixon method that used a fast zzso echo sequence rather than traditional spin zzso zzso times were sufficiently brief to allow completion within a single breath zzso zzso zzso were obtained within one month of zzso 

zzso of 22 subjects had an elevated zzso fat zzso Seven of 7 subjects with a fat fraction of zzso or zzso had a normal serum zzso Twelve of 13 subjects with fat fraction of zzso had an elevated serum zzso zzso fat fraction correlated with serum zzso but did not correlate with age, zzso or serum zzso 

The spectrum of fatty liver is larger than detected by screening for abnormal serum zzso zzso zzso in serum zzso occur exclusively in more severe cases of fatty zzso
