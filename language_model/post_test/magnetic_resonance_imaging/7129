The effects of zzso on rat cerebral blood flow, zzso and zzso levels were studied using in zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was used to determine the region of brain being zzso Blood flow was estimated by detecting the zzso of zzso using zzso zzso A dose of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso flow fourfold over control values for at least 1 zzso Even though zzso zzso a large increase in flow, there were no significant changes in levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso pH or zzso as determined by zzso zzso This was true for doses of 10 and 20 zzso zzso zzso No significant changes occurred in zzso zzso detected levels of zzso with a 20 zzso dose of zzso zzso levels increased slightly 30 zzso after administration of 10 zzso zzso zzso The results call into question the central role of changes in levels of zzso in zzso increased cortical activity to increases in zzso
