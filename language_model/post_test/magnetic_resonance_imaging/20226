zzso were performed to establish if repetitive arm cycling training enhances the zzso effect of intramuscular zzso toxin zzso injections in zzso zzso zzso zzso on cerebral zzso were evaluated by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Eight chronic zzso zzso patients zzso zzso 10 zzso after middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso was injected into the affected arm twice, 6 months zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso and range of motion before and 3 months after zzso zzso Images were analyzed using Brain Voyager zzso zzso and zzso signal changes were corrected for multiple zzso 

During passive movements of affected and zzso hands, zzso activity was increased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso areas zzso and supplementary motor area predominantly in the zzso hemisphere, compared with the zzso Following repetitive arm zzso zzso activity increased further in zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso For patients with residual motor activity, zzso zzso activity increases were associated with reduced zzso in completely zzso patients, there was no zzso activity change in zzso but increased zzso after zzso 

Increased activity in zzso of the zzso zzso and in zzso of the zzso zzso reflect a zzso effect in the zzso zzso It is hypothesized that the increased zzso activity results from increased zzso information related to the zzso zzso effect reinforced by zzso
