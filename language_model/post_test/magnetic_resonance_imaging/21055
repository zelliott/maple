zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso is a new technique to investigate the functional association of movement to brain zzso zzso zzso surgery is effective in reducing zzso However, while some patients have satisfying benefit, others have only partial or temporary zzso This could be due to zzso targeting in some zzso By identifying zzso areas, zzso could provide more insight into the zzso of zzso and be potentially useful in refining surgical zzso 

zzso of the study was to evaluate whether zzso could detect blood oxygen level dependent brain zzso associated with zzso in patients with Essential zzso Second, we explored whether zzso could improve the zzso of targets for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in six Essential zzso patients with unilateral zzso zzso was recorded from the trembling arm zzso zzso and from the zzso arm zzso zzso zzso were designed to study brain zzso related to voluntary muscle zzso and zzso zzso 

Analysis with the zzso zzso was able to show the association of voluntary movements with activity in the zzso motor zzso and supplementary motor area, and zzso zzso The zzso zzso frequency zzso showed an association between zzso and activity in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso spot in the zzso varied across patients and did not zzso to the zzso nucleus zzso zzso 

zzso is potentially useful in detecting brain zzso associated with zzso in patients with Essential zzso The technique must be further developed before being useful in supporting targeting for zzso zzso
