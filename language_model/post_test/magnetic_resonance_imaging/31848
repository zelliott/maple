The neural zzso zzso level zzso zzso of motor coordination of both hands were studied in adult right-handed volunteers and patients with zzso zzso 1 zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the entire zzso Each experimental condition consisted of five sets of alternate zzso and zzso tasks for either hand in a prescribed sequence as the active phase followed by a period of zzso An intricate network consisting of zzso cortex, supplementary motor area zzso zzso motor area zzso zzso and zzso was identified when the task was performed in healthy zzso However, zzso activity was largely absent with additional activity in zzso zzso and in zzso in patients with zzso This apparent decoupling of zzso cortical and zzso areas during coordinated movement in patients with zzso suggests that zzso zzso may be malfunctioning in zzso
