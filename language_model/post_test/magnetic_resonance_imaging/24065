zzso motor zzso zzso is a rare condition characterized by weakness limited to one limb without sensory zzso We report a 42-year-old woman with zzso of the right lower limb caused by a small zzso in the zzso motor zzso that could be detected by the magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso This case suggests that small zzso missed by carelessly performed scans, could be a potential cause of zzso This is especially true in the case of lower limb zzso because the zzso may be located in the top of the frontal lobe cortex, an area that can be easily missed by routine zzso zzso we should pay careful attention to the opposite side of the motor zzso in examining zzso of zzso zzso
