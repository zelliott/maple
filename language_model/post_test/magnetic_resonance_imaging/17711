zzso is one of several molecules that transmit information about energy balance to the zzso It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance fosters zzso zzso The objective of the current study was to characterize zzso brain responses to zzso stimuli in subjects with insulin sensitivities ranging from resistant to zzso 

Sixteen women diagnosed with zzso zzso syndrome zzso underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while viewing pictures of high calorie zzso foods, low calorie zzso foods, and control zzso zzso 

A region of interest analysis of the blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal revealed widespread zzso within zzso regions in response to food zzso zzso regions included the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso , zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso amygdala, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the anterior cingulate, zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso by HC food pictures zzso - zzso and zzso of the lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso and zzso by zzso food pictures zzso - zzso was zzso correlated with insulin zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the HC - zzso contrast was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity, whereas zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso 

The association between insulin sensitivity and zzso responses to food pictures may reflect abnormal brain responses to insulin feedback that contribute to the development and or perpetuation of obesity in zzso
