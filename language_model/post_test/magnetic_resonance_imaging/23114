zzso differences in local cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso contribute to differences in zzso signal zzso and, therefore, zzso zzso in group level zzso zzso A simple way of zzso blood zzso zzso to zzso subject differences in vascular zzso is through zzso but two aspects of this measure are often zzso zzso zzso are usually zzso as blocks even though zzso accumulates over time and zzso increases in zzso differ between zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso zzso response is best zzso by zzso the zzso zzso trace with a standard zzso response function and including its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso response as a zzso zzso in a group level analysis increases the spatial extent of zzso in stimulus evoked and resting state zzso By expressing the zzso zzso response as a percentage signal increase with respect to an absolute change in the partial pressure of zzso zzso in zzso the spatial extent of zzso zzso is further zzso This demonstrates that individual zzso zzso increases to zzso should be accounted for to provide an accurate measure of vascular zzso resulting in more statistically active zzso in group level zzso
