zzso zzso zzso are commonly found after stroke but have not previously been studied in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

To study the zzso zzso patterns, zzso and impact on outcome of zzso in patients with zzso 

We analyzed zzso 39 consecutive patients who underwent zzso zzso imaging within 7 days after onset of spontaneous zzso We report the frequency and location of zzso and show their association with zzso vascular risk factors, the zzso grade, the modified Fisher zzso the Acute zzso and zzso Health zzso II, magnetic resonance imaging findings including zzso imaging zzso and laboratory data, as well as data on zzso global cerebral zzso delayed cerebral zzso seizures, the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and the modified Rankin zzso 

zzso patients zzso had zzso Of these patients, 9 had multiple zzso and overall a total of 50 zzso were zzso The most common locations of zzso were zzso zzso zzso 23), followed by deep zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for age and history of hypertension, zzso were related to the presence of zzso imaging zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso Three months after zzso patients with zzso had zzso higher modified Rankin zzso scores zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso are commonly observed and associated with zzso imaging zzso in patients with zzso Our findings may represent a new mechanism of tissue injury in zzso Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical implications of zzso
