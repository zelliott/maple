What happens when the brain awaits a signal of uncertain arrival time, as when a sprinter waits for the starting zzso And what happens just after the starting pistol zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we have discovered a novel correlate of zzso expectations in several brain regions, most prominently in the supplementary motor area zzso zzso to expectations, we found little zzso activity during the waiting zzso however, a large signal appears after the zzso zzso the zzso of which reflects learned expectations about the distribution of possible waiting zzso Specifically, the zzso of the zzso signal appears to zzso a cumulative conditional zzso also known as the cumulative hazard zzso The zzso signal loses its dependence on waiting time in a zzso condition in which the arrival time of the go cue is known in advance, suggesting that the signal encodes zzso probabilities rather than simply elapsed zzso The dependence of the signal on zzso expectation is present in zzso conditions, demonstrating that the effect is not a consequence of motor zzso Finally, the zzso is not dependent on zzso operating in the same manner with auditory or visual zzso This finding extends our understanding of the relationship between zzso expectancy and measurable neural zzso
