zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to involve the whole zzso zzso Some surgeons have therefore changed their approach from relief of obstruction using a zzso to zzso reconstruction of the whole zzso root - zzso zzso The advantages are said to be preserved long-term zzso valve function and allowance for zzso This is zzso We compare growth and zzso root geometry in patients who have undergone relief of discrete zzso using either zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-five patients zzso male, 11 female, mean age of zzso years, range zzso underwent surgery for discrete zzso No patients with diffuse zzso were included in this retrospective zzso Twelve patients had features of Williams zzso Five patients had other zzso zzso A zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso which passed across the zzso into the zzso zzso in zzso A zzso technique was used in 11 zzso Changes in zzso root following repair were documented in patients using both zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

There were no operative zzso The mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso early zzso The late mean zzso was zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso across the repair between two techniques according to the zzso and zzso zzso 

According to our study, we cannot demonstrate any benefit in reconstructing the whole zzso root for discrete zzso A zzso technique is easy, safe and appears zzso
