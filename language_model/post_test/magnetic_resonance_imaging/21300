Only recently, brain imaging research has started to investigate the transformation of verbal instructions into efficient zzso A zzso network has been consistently shown to be involved in this zzso The existing studies, however do not allow distinguishing brain regions that are involved in creating the stimulus response link zzso zzso and brain areas involved in response preparation zzso The aim of the current study was to zzso brain regions associated with these different zzso In order to do so, we adopted a paradigm in which instructions were given using two successive instruction zzso Each cue instructing one component of an zzso zzso enabling the identification of areas that are involved in representing response information and areas that play a role in setting up the link between stimulus and response zzso zzso show that zzso zzso zzso motor area zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso are engaged in representing and preparing the instructed zzso zzso the left inferior frontal zzso zzso including the inferior frontal junction zzso was engaged in the formation of the stimulus and response zzso It is concluded that during the zzso of verbal instructions zzso zzso these instructions to guide zzso specific areas needed to perform the upcoming zzso
