zzso zzso of only clear zzso until 2 hours before induction of zzso is a common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso times, however, vary among clear zzso We therefore investigated the gastric zzso of 2 clear zzso zzso 

A zzso crossover study was performed in 10 healthy zzso After zzso the volunteers drank 500 zzso of either zzso an oral zzso solution, or zzso zzso a popular sports drink, over 3 minutes in a standing zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed before, immediately after, and 30 minutes after the drinking of each test zzso The difference in gastric zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated by comparing gastric fluid volume, flow rate, and residual zzso We also compared the flow rates of zzso zzso zzso and zzso active particles in the 2 test zzso 

zzso fluid volume 30 minutes after drinking was significantly smaller for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although the volumes did not differ before or immediately after zzso The flow rate was significantly faster for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the residual ratio was significantly smaller for zzso (21 zzso zzso than for zzso zzso (41 zzso zzso zzso The flow rates of zzso zzso and zzso differed significantly between zzso and zzso zzso whereas the flow rate of zzso active particles did zzso 

zzso zzso is significantly faster for zzso than for zzso zzso
