The treatment regimen for cerebral zzso is different, depending on the zzso grade of the zzso The therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso and zzso is more aggressive, including zzso zzso radiation and zzso The management for zzso zzso is still under discussion, operation or zzso and zzso tactics are possible zzso Therefore the diagnostic imaging procedures are crucial for further treatment zzso Although most of the zzso zzso appear as zzso zzso without contrast medium zzso enhancement on magnetic resonance images, in some cases zzso without CM enhancement can be zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed for zzso evaluation of non or low CM enhancing zzso zzso so-called suggestive zzso zzso 

20 patients zzso suggestive zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients were found to be candidates for open surgery and 3 patients were planned for zzso biopsy due to the zzso of the zzso zzso studies were performed a few days prior to zzso On the day of surgery zzso sequences for zzso planning were carried out zzso and zzso zzso All image data were fused for operation with zzso zzso or zzso biopsy zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso were taken from the zzso zzso areas as well as from areas without zzso zzso 

zzso patients showed sparse CM enhancement on zzso T zzso images, zzso patients had zzso without CM zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso cases zzso ratio zzso or more) and no zzso zzso was documented in zzso cases zzso ratio zzso zzso the 2 patients with sparse CM enhancement and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso and without CM enhancement had an zzso zzso WHO III, zzso with zzso zzso and no CM enhancement had an zzso zzso WHO III, and zzso had an zzso grade zzso The zzso of the 4 patients without zzso zzso and without CM enhancement were classified as zzso grade II in 2 cases, as zzso grade I in 1 case and as zzso III in one zzso 

According to the results of this study, we find zzso to be a helpful tool for zzso evaluation of zzso zzso suggestive zzso zzso zzso zzso adds valuable information for the decision-making for surgery or zzso zzso
