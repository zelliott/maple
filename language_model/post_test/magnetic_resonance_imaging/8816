The aim of the current prospective study was to zzso the zzso of zzso based diagnosis of zzso zzso which was verified by zzso biopsy and follow-up evaluation as well as to assess zzso factors and risk zzso 

Between 1998 and 2007, all consecutive adult patients with zzso suspected zzso zzso were zzso The zzso based diagnosis of the zzso was made independently by an experienced zzso zzso evaluation was performed in all patients from zzso embedded specimens obtained by zzso image guided zzso serial biopsy zzso zzso results were compared with prior zzso zzso zzso of survival was estimated with the zzso method and zzso factors were calculated using the Cox zzso 

46 adult patients were zzso zzso evaluation revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso WHO grade II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), inflammatory disease zzso zzso 2) or no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso morbidity was zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no permanent morbidity and no zzso All patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Patients with low grade zzso and zzso zzso showed a 1 year survival rate of zzso and zzso zzso the 1 year survival rate for patients with zzso or zzso was zzso In the zzso with a verified zzso zzso negative zzso for length of survival were higher zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso performance score zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with a zzso pattern of zzso represent a very zzso zzso group with completely different zzso zzso features alone are not reliable for diagnostic zzso zzso biopsy is a safe method to obtain a valid tissue diagnosis, which is zzso for treatment zzso
