To determine if magnetic resonance zzso zzso can yield images sufficient for discriminating early progressive zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in human coronary zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were not zzso zzso coronary artery segments zzso diameter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected within 36 hours after death from 11 zzso (six men, five zzso age range at death, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer zzso maps were acquired with a zzso zzso zzso zzso artery zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Internal zzso zzso landmarks and zzso were applied to zzso and zzso vessel surfaces and used to register zzso sections with MR images and thus enable comparison of MR images and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of interest were visually identified on quantitative zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso values were compared with Student zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

MR microscopic images of zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed two zzso zzso The zzso zzso had higher zzso and zzso values and lower zzso values than did the zzso zzso these findings were consistent with compositional differences observed in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso values of both zzso layers were markedly reduced when compared with zzso values of zzso zzso because of the zzso of zzso zzso in both zzso Progressive zzso zzso had a typical multilayered appearance or zzso with a short zzso relaxation time and low zzso values; these features were not observed in zzso or zzso zzso 

MR zzso enabled identification of zzso zzso wall features that enable discrimination of progressive zzso zzso from zzso zzso or zzso zzso
