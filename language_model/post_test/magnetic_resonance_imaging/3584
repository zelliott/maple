zzso zzso are brain tumors associated with a devastating zzso Recent studies have indicated that the combined use of zzso acid PET and zzso is superior to zzso alone to plan the surgical zzso of high-grade zzso The aim of the study was to analyze the zzso of the use of zzso acid PET for the surgical zzso of high-grade zzso compared with zzso alone, from the perspective of the national health insurance in zzso 

A zzso model was set up to compare 2 zzso the use of zzso alone and the combined use of zzso and PET for surgical zzso of high-grade zzso For the analysis, 2 scenarios were zzso a baseline scenario and a more expensive scenario, accounting for disease zzso To test the zzso of the results, zzso sensitivity analyses using zzso Carlo simulation were zzso 

Compared with zzso alone, the combined use of zzso and PET showed an incremental zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gained for the baseline scenario and an incremental zzso ratio of zzso per zzso gained for the zzso zzso In the zzso sensitivity analysis in about zzso of the zzso the combined use of PET and zzso was superior to zzso alone when assuming a zzso threshold of zzso 

The model indicates that the combined use of zzso and PET may be zzso The results of this analysis have to be considered carefully because there was only limited zzso evidence for several input zzso
