To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding the management of clinically zzso adrenal masses zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso panel representing the fields of medicine, surgery, zzso pathology, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso In addition, experts in these same fields presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of approximately zzso 

Presentations by zzso a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and zzso and an extensive bibliography of zzso research papers, prepared by the National Library of zzso Scientific evidence was given zzso over clinical anecdotal zzso 

Answering zzso questions, the panel drafted a statement based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific zzso The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the experts and the audience for zzso The panel then met in executive session to consider these comments and released a revised statement at the end of the zzso The statement was made available on the World Wide Web at zzso immediately after the zzso This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the zzso or the Federal zzso 

The management of clinically zzso adrenal masses is complicated by limited studies of zzso zzso and natural history, including the zzso impact on the patient who is informed of the zzso zzso in the resolution of abdominal imaging techniques combined with increased use of abdominal imaging suggest that the prevalence of clinically zzso adrenal masses will continue to zzso The low prevalence of adrenal cortical zzso and the relatively low zzso of progression to zzso call into question the zzso of the current practice of intense, long-term clinical followup of this common zzso All patients with an zzso should have a zzso zzso suppression test and a measurement of zzso zzso Patients with hypertension should also undergo measurement of serum zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso activity zzso A homogeneous mass with a low zzso value (less than 10 zzso on CT scan is likely a benign zzso Surgery should be considered in all patients with functional adrenal cortical tumors that are clinically zzso All patients with zzso evidence of zzso should undergo zzso Data are insufficient to indicate the superiority of a surgical or zzso approach to manage patients with zzso zzso adrenal cortical zzso zzso for surgery based upon tumor size are derived from studies not standardized for inclusion criteria, length of zzso or methods of zzso the risk of zzso Nevertheless, patients with tumors greater than 6 zzso usually are treated zzso while those with tumors less than 4 zzso are generally zzso In patients with tumors between 4 and 6 zzso criteria in addition to size should be considered in making the decision to monitor or proceed to zzso The literature on adrenal zzso has proliferated in the last several zzso Unfortunately, the lack of controlled studies makes zzso diagnostic and treatment strategies zzso Because of the complexity of the problem, the management of patients with adrenal zzso will be zzso by a multidisciplinary team approach involving physicians with expertise in zzso zzso surgery, and zzso The paucity of evidence-based data highlights the need for zzso prospective zzso Either open or zzso zzso is an acceptable procedure for zzso of an adrenal zzso The choice of procedure will depend upon the likelihood of an invasive adrenal cortical zzso technical issues, and the experience of the surgical zzso In patients with tumors that remain stable on two imaging studies carried out at least 6 months apart and do not exhibit hormonal zzso over 4 years, further followup may not be zzso
