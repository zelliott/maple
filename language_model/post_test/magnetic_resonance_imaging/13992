The balance between oxygen consumption and delivery in the rat brain after exposure to transient zzso was zzso studied with zzso echo zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso The rats were exposed to graded common carotid artery zzso using a modification of the zzso model of zzso zzso zzso and cerebral blood volume were zzso with magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso was measured with the hydrogen clearance zzso A transient common carotid artery zzso below the zzso value of approximately 20 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso was needed to yield a zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso milliseconds zzso zzso of cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso milliseconds zzso zzso of cerebral zzso after 7 and 15 minutes of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of 103 zzso zzso and in cerebral blood volume of 29 zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso These zzso changes alone could account for only approximately one third of the zzso increase in luxury zzso suggesting that a substantial increase in blood oxygen zzso zzso from reduced oxygen extraction by the zzso is needed to explain the magnetic resonance imaging zzso
