Previous work suggested a differential contribution of prefrontal zzso zzso to successful zzso depending on the stimulus zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso of words zzso involves the left zzso while zzso of zzso items zzso zzso relies on the right zzso We used an experimental design that evaluated zzso of both words and abstract shapes in the same healthy zzso A transient virtual zzso of the left or the right zzso was zzso with zzso magnetic stimulation zzso while subjects memorized verbal and zzso zzso We found that zzso of verbal material was disrupted by left zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso material was disrupted by right zzso zzso These results demonstrate a functionally relevant zzso of prefrontal contribution for verbal and zzso memory zzso
