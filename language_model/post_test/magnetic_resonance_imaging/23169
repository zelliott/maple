This study used zzso to examine individual differences in the neural basis of zzso zzso Participants with varying language skill levels, as zzso by scores on the vocabulary portion of the zzso Reading zzso read four types of zzso passages in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso and presence or absence of explicit zzso zzso were zzso varied to manipulate zzso and cohesion during zzso zzso zzso readers showed better neural efficiency (less zzso during all context sentences and during all zzso zzso Increased zzso in zzso readers was most extensively distributed in the right zzso zzso zzso of left zzso zzso language areas, especially in the most difficult passage zzso zzso readers also showed greater sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso and synchronization in moderately related than zzso related zzso whereas zzso readers showed sensitivity to cohesion zzso zzso and synchronization when zzso zzso were present than when they were zzso These finding support the hypothesis that skilled reading comprehension requires recruitment of the zzso on an zzso zzso zzso We describe the dynamic zzso hypothesis, a new theoretical framework that outlines the conditions under which zzso language contributions are most likely zzso
