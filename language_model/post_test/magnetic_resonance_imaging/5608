We present a zzso experiment that examines whether males and females use distinct brain systems while performing a confrontational naming task, with specific attention to the possibility of zzso differences, as suggested by some theories of sex differences in language zzso We further address whether zzso differences in functional brain organization might interact with object category zzso given that previous behavioral studies have shown some consistent processing differences between the sexes with respect to tools versus zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data were collected from 26 participants (13 males and 13 zzso Main effect and interaction analyses reveal no zzso zzso differences between the zzso All other results, however, were consistent with previous zzso zzso Global effects revealed dominant zzso in zzso zzso left zzso middle zzso zzso left zzso zzso left zzso frontal zzso left frontal zzso left supplementary motor zzso anterior cingulate, and left zzso zzso Main contrasts for tools versus plants were likewise consistent with previous zzso zzso Although men and women showed no zzso zzso differences, zzso or otherwise, when collapsed across object categories, zzso analyses showed selective zzso for females in zzso anterior zzso zzso and left zzso middle zzso zzso for tools, and selective zzso for males in left zzso middle zzso zzso for zzso We discuss the relevance of these zzso effects to previous behavioral findings and theories that relate to vocabulary differences between the zzso
