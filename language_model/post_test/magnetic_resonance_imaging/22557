Acute zzso is an uncommon complication following zzso zzso zzso A benign and zzso course has been described in the few reports found of this zzso 

We report two patients with an apparently zzso zzso acute zzso that resulted in zzso zzso Patients presented with a zzso syndrome including zzso zzso zzso speech and zzso which were preceded by signs of respiratory zzso zzso brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso in case 1 was normal but in case 2 it displayed striking zzso zzso small fourth zzso and zzso zzso which was zzso and did not require zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed a recent zzso zzso zzso Case 1 has followed an zzso clinical course, with incomplete resolution of zzso dysfunction, while case 2 has remained zzso zzso brain zzso have demonstrated prominent zzso zzso in both zzso 

zzso zzso infection should be considered in those patients with acute zzso showing an incomplete resolution of zzso dysfunction or those who develop early zzso zzso The presenting zzso findings do not seem to predict final neurological zzso
