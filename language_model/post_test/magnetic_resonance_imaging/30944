To evaluate the accuracy of calculation of zzso relaxation time with simplified zzso in characterization of liver focal zzso with zzso Spin Echo zzso zzso sequences with double echo time zzso 

We carried out a retrospective analysis of 113 zzso zzso focal zzso in zzso sequences zzso zzso 51 zzso and 10 zzso We have employed a single zzso zzso sequence with effective TE of 83 and 165 zzso and zzso factor zzso Signal intensity zzso of each zzso was measured on different zzso Using these values, we calculated zzso relaxation time by the following simplified zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation time has been correlated with the final diagnosis, obtained by zzso zzso surgical zzso or three months zzso 

The mean zzso relaxation time for zzso was zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 29) and for zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference between the mean zzso relaxation time for zzso and zzso was statistically significant zzso Most zzso were best characterized between the threshold value of 130 and 140 zzso The values of specificity and sensitivity of the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso was respective zzso and zzso All false positive diagnoses were zzso of less than one zzso 

zzso double echo time zzso sequences in the protocol of liver study concurs to obtain high diagnostic accuracy in the characterization of the zzso zzso The quantitative analysis of zzso represents a useful additional instrument to the zzso analysis in discrimination between zzso zzso and can be carried out by zzso sequences with elevated reliability reducing the imaging time compared with conventional zzso The evaluation of zzso zzso of less than one zzso should always include analysis of dynamic zzso zzso
