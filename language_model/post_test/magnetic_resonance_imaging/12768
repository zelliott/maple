Different zzso methods for zzso studies were evaluated using both simulations and clinical zzso 

zzso included zzso zzso plasma zzso simplified reference tissue input zzso and a modified zzso zzso The latter included an additional compartment for zzso zzso For plasma input models, binding potential, zzso was obtained both directly zzso zzso zzso and indirectly zzso volume of distribution zzso 

For clinical data, zzso was preferred over zzso according to zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso correlated better with zzso then direct zzso Fairly constant volume of distribution of zzso was found across brain and across subjects, which was strongly related to bias in zzso obtained from zzso as seen in zzso Furthermore, in simulations, zzso showed constant bias with best precision if zzso entered zzso 

zzso is the method of choice for quantitative analysis of zzso even if it is unclear whether labeled zzso enter the zzso
