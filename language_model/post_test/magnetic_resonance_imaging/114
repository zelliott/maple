The objective of this study was to evaluate by zzso imaging the prevalence and degree of cortical zzso by small eccentric zzso correlated with zzso diagnosis and patient zzso 

From 122 patients with zzso proven zzso and two patients without zzso but with zzso and clinical zzso 11 patients with small, eccentrically located zzso in the long bones had zzso imaging zzso The zzso were evaluated for location, size, presence, and degree of cortical zzso The patient's medical charts and microscope slides were reviewed for relevant clinical history, clinical management, and zzso 

The zzso ranged in size from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso were located in the zzso zzso zzso two in the zzso zzso zzso six in the zzso zzso zzso and one in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso due to diagnostic uncertainty, continued pain, marked zzso cortical zzso or due to patient insistence on zzso All 11 zzso were benign, nine zzso and two by stability over 4 and 7 zzso The prevalence of cortical zzso among eccentric zzso was zzso zzso zzso or occupancy ranged from 50 to zzso zzso zzso 

All small eccentric zzso in this study were associated with an appearance of cortical zzso of varying zzso All zzso zzso were zzso bland without nuclear zzso Based on the benign zzso of nine zzso and lack of growth of two zzso over several years, the degree of cortical zzso is felt to be a result of zzso location within the zzso rather than biological activity or zzso
