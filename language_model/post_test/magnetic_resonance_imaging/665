The influence of zzso interactions on zzso neural activity was studied in the human primary visual zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to determine the zzso of zzso with respect to adjacent zzso zzso zzso reported the orientation of a zzso patch at zzso zzso locations when it was salient among zzso zzso and when it was zzso zzso was caused by local orientation contrast between zzso mechanism that is thought to arise from zzso interactions in the zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso response for salient and zzso stimuli in zzso revealed that salient zzso caused a significantly smaller zzso response than zzso zzso This differential effect was not observed in zzso visual areas zzso zzso zzso When attention was not focused onto the target, the size of the zzso response was generally reduced in all visual areas, and no difference was seen in zzso for salient and zzso zzso These findings suggest that contextual interactions underlying zzso influence zzso zzso in zzso and support the view that zzso and zzso mechanisms share neural circuits at this early stage of visual zzso
