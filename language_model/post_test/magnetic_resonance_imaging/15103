We observed in a previous study zzso ONE zzso that the self-regulation of zzso activity via real-time zzso zzso zzso with positive emotion induction was zzso in healthy participants, with an enhancement in the functional connectivity between the left zzso zzso and six regions of the prefrontal zzso These regions included the left zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso zzso bilateral superior frontal zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with the zzso these six prefrontal regions thus formed the functional zzso network engaged during the zzso zzso Here we perform a structural zzso zzso zzso analysis of the effective connectivity for this zzso The zzso analysis demonstrates that the left zzso plays an important role during the zzso training, modulating the LA and the other network zzso According to the analysis, the zzso training leads to a significant enhancement in the zzso effect of the left zzso on the zzso potentially consistent with the zzso distribution of the zzso projections between these zzso The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous zzso effects of the left zzso on four other regions - the bilateral zzso the right zzso and the left zzso The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral zzso are also significantly zzso Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the zzso in emotion processing and zzso Our exploratory analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the zzso relationships within the network of regions engaged during the zzso procedure targeting the zzso It suggests that the zzso may constitute a promising target for zzso training along with the zzso in patients with affective disorders, particularly zzso stress disorder zzso
