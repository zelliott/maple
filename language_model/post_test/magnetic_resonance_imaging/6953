To define the role and reliability of MR imaging of the zzso during zzso in the evaluation of patients with zzso Sleep zzso zzso 

During a zzso period, 28 patients with clinical diagnosis of zzso Sleep zzso zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed during zzso by zzso zzso and zzso sequences in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and quantitative data of the imaging, the majority of which were obtained from the relevant Literature zzso zzso zzso area and its location and shape, increase of zzso tissue of the neck, tongue zzso zzso dislocation of the zzso soft and hard zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso evaluation of oral floor zzso were subsequently compared with zzso parameters zzso Mass Index, zzso index, zzso zzso oxygen partial pressure, average nocturnal zzso zzso and zzso percentage with oxygen zzso lower than zzso to assess zzso 

The minimal zzso zzso is significantly positively correlated with the zzso oxygen partial pressure and with the average nocturnal zzso zzso and is zzso correlated with the zzso index and with the zzso percentage with oxygen zzso lower than zzso the inverse correlation with the Body Mass Index is less zzso Furthermore, the minimal zzso zzso area is correlated with its shape on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tissue of the neck is significantly correlated with the Body Mass Index, with a low nocturnal oxygen zzso with a high percentage of sleeping time with oxygen zzso lower than zzso and with the zzso shape of the minimal zzso zzso An inverse correlation between the soft zzso length and the zzso oxygen partial pressure was zzso zzso floor lowering is significantly zzso correlated with the minimal area only if the minimal area is located at the tongue base level and is directly correlated with the Body Mass Index as well as with the zzso zzso The remaining MR findings appear to be independent parameters that may zzso the syndrome when associated with other zzso 

In patients with a clinical diagnosis of zzso MR imaging performed during zzso can provide reliable information on the causes, severity and zzso of zzso obstruction with important consequences on therapeutic zzso
