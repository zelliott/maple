We previously demonstrated the presence of activated areas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso of the area surrounding a brain zzso using a rat model of focal zzso induced zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance zzso Using this model, we next applied gene expression profiling to screen key molecules zzso in the activated zzso zzso was extracted from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the focal brain zzso and from the sham controlled cortex, and zzso to zzso profiling zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso receptors were zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso to the focal zzso zzso To prove the zzso significance of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, an zzso zzso to zzso receptors on zzso cells, was administered zzso As a result, the zzso acid significantly improved behavioral recovery within 10 days from paralysis induced by the focal zzso zzso zzso zzso as evaluated with beam zzso These results suggest that zzso administration of a zzso zzso zzso may facilitate behavioral recovery during the acute phase after brain zzso
