Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso selectively and progressively zzso with zzso functional connectivity of intrinsic brain networks zzso most prominent in the default mode zzso Given that zzso functional connectivity depends on structural zzso we zzso for our study selective and progressive changes of zzso based structural connectivity in zzso To achieve strong statistical evidence, we introduce a novel statistical method based on the edge frequency zzso of structural connectivity zzso Such zzso zzso are compared in a multiple testing zzso combining a flexible zzso test statistic with zzso based strong control of the family wise error zzso We assessed 26 healthy elderly, 23 patients with zzso and 28 patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso by zzso functional zzso diffusion zzso imaging, and zzso testing including annual follow-up zzso After zzso 50% of the patients with zzso converted to zzso zzso of diffusion zzso data identifies structural connectivity networks between regions of zzso which are detected by an independent component analysis of resting state zzso zzso We find that zzso structural connectivity is selectively and progressively disrupted with primary changes in the default mode zzso zzso results are found for zzso functional zzso In addition, structural connectivity across the zzso of all zzso separated individual zzso patients converting to zzso from zzso zzso our study provides a new approach to analyze connectivity networks by their zzso edge frequency zzso and achieves strong statistical evidence by application of the family wise error zzso Data analysis provides selective and progressive disruptions of zzso structural connectivity in zzso and demonstrates the increased power of our method compared to recent zzso
