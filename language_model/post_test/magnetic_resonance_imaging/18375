The first successful demonstrations of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso in bulk matter were reported in 1946 zzso Hansen and Packard zzso zzso zzso and Pound zzso Since then zzso has become a widespread technique for investigating matter of all zzso In the 1970's zzso was applied to living systems, including man, in 2 distinct zzso One application was in the production of images zzso zzso called zzso zzso Imaging or zzso and the other in the production of zzso zzso zzso and Richards 1973; zzso et zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso or zzso By appropriate manipulation of the zzso signal an zzso image may be zzso This can be a zzso image of a single zzso or a set of zzso images of parallel zzso or a zzso zzso zzso images may be obtained directly in any orientation, zzso zzso zzso The method uses no zzso radiation and is inherently zzso It is zzso although zzso solutions may be injected zzso to improve zzso zzso images observed in normal clinical practice are maps of the zzso signals from water and fat in the zzso they depend on zzso density, but also significantly on the relaxation times zzso and zzso Images can be provided of flow zzso zzso and diffusion zzso restricted or zzso Images are typically 512 zzso 512 zzso with spatial resolution of about zzso zzso The images can be correlated with anatomical structures and indeed zzso is a primary source of such structures with zzso precision of zzso zzso as in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
