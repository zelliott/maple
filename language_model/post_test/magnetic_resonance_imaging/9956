zzso properties have been demonstrated for many complex zzso Here, we applied the discrete zzso transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate zzso correlation zzso characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and zzso zzso After zzso the zzso correlation zzso to create zzso zzso of brain functional networks, we found a zzso zzso of sparse connections most salient in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Global mean path length zzso was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas zzso zzso was two times zzso similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the zzso zzso The human functional network was dominated by a zzso core of highly connected hubs and had an zzso truncated power law degree zzso zzso included recently evolved regions of the zzso association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more zzso connected regions of the zzso association and primary zzso zzso and zzso regions were zzso more zzso The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable zzso network, but about equally resilient to random zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso in human zzso data have a zzso architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the zzso Because the major hubs of this network are critical for zzso its slow dynamics could provide a zzso zzso for zzso and distributed information zzso
