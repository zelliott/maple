A new animal model was developed in rabbits zzso zzso using the zzso tumor zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging performed before and after intravenous zzso injection to assess zzso zzso and zzso 

Six New Zealand White rabbits with zzso zzso were studied on a zzso zzso Vision MR zzso zzso contrast was given zzso to the zzso before zzso to zzso the zzso under zzso Using a zzso zzso needle, zzso zzso of zzso screened zzso tumor was injected zzso into each kidney at the zzso zzso Animals were studied on day 7 after zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso zzso and fast spin echo zzso zzso scans were first zzso Then, an additional zzso zzso zzso scan was zzso After these scans, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso at a rate of zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso images were then obtained at 0, 6, 12, 19, 25, and 31 seconds after injection and at 1, 2, and 10 minutes after zzso The zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional scan was repeated at 10 minutes after zzso Imaging results were analyzed by region of interest measurement and correlated with tissue zzso 

On dynamic zzso zzso scans, zzso zzso specifically zzso increased from 7 zzso 7 signal intensity zzso to a maximum of 14 zzso 8 at 1 minute after zzso This increase was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso An initial rapid increase in tumor zzso occurred within the first 30 seconds after contrast, with the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso scans was 9 zzso 10, not statistically different from results with either of the zzso zzso scan zzso Using zzso zzso technique, zzso zzso increased from 10 zzso 5 zzso to 31 zzso 12 zzso As with zzso the improvement in tumor zzso after contrast on zzso scans was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso The difference between zzso zzso scans and zzso zzso scans also was statistically zzso with zzso scans superior for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each tumor was confirmed on zzso zzso 

This research establishes a model of zzso to the kidney for use in imaging zzso The zzso of a small zzso zzso is shown to be improved on early dynamic imaging, as well as at 10 minutes after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso Observation of dynamic signal intensity changes provides additional information regarding zzso zzso supplementing that from zzso zzso
