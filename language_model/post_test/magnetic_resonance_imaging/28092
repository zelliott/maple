The zzso zzso of increased signal in the white matter of the zzso zzso in zzso magnetic resonance imaging were investigated in an zzso series of 15 zzso Two types of magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be separated on the basis of size zzso zzso extensive and zzso The zzso basis of extensive zzso was large areas of zzso with zzso margins, located in the central white matter and sparing the zzso U fibers on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso these areas showed diffuse zzso and significant reduction in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This change was never seen in areas that did not show extensive white matter zzso on magnetic resonance zzso The zzso of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso were less well zzso zzso zzso spaces probably represent a common cause of this zzso
