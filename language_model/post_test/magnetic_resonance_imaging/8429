We examined whether the determination of zzso viability by zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso would be useful for planning surgical zzso restoration zzso 

Eight consecutive patients with poor cardiac function zzso fraction zzso zzso due to zzso zzso underwent surgical treatment based on findings of zzso zzso and zzso Our surgical strategy consisted of zzso complete zzso on viable zzso zzso zzso in a patient with extensive zzso zzso and zzso zzso valve zzso in a patient with a more than moderate degree of zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso four of the patients zzso zzso underwent isolated coronary bypass surgery, and the other four zzso zzso underwent zzso and zzso valve zzso zzso with coronary bypass zzso zzso changes in zzso function were zzso assessed in each zzso 

The mean zzso volume index was reduced from 115 zzso 29 zzso to 95 zzso zzso in group A and from zzso zzso zzso to 125 zzso zzso in group zzso The mean zzso volume index was reduced from 91 zzso zzso to 68 zzso zzso in group A and from 135 zzso zzso to 98 zzso 28 zzso in group zzso The mean ejection fraction increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in group A and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in group zzso The mean New York Heart Association zzso functional class was reduced from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in group A and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in group zzso 

zzso was highly effective in helping to select which patients and which areas of the left zzso are indicated for zzso which contributed to excellent early clinical zzso
