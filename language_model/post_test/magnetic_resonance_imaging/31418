To determine if zzso factors zzso on routine examination can be used to estimate zzso knee total zzso bone area zzso cartilage surface area zzso cartilage thickness zzso and cartilage volume zzso 

Young individuals zzso years old) without history of knee joint pain, injury or disease were zzso zzso resonance imaging of the right knee was used to determine zzso zzso zzso and VC for knee zzso zzso zzso and curve fitting by zzso zzso were used to model the zzso 

VC and zzso closely depended on zzso in both men and zzso This relationship zzso all dependency on sex, zzso weight and body mass zzso In zzso VC depended on height cubed and zzso on height zzso The relationship was much weaker in zzso zzso was poorly related to zzso and zzso zzso limits for VC standardized to zzso were zzso than zzso to zzso or zzso 

The absence of a tight relationship of VC and zzso with height in males suggests that the factors stimulating bone and cartilage growth may be different between zzso The high correlation between zzso and VC across both sexes suggests, however, that (opposite to measures from routine clinical zzso zzso can provide individual reference values for zzso against which changes with age and disease can be estimated with high zzso
