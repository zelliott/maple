In an artificial grammar learning task, subjects were asked to zzso short lists of letter strings formed according to complex rules for letter zzso After an zzso they were unexpectedly asked to discriminate new grammatical strings from strings which used the same letters but violated the sequential constraints of the zzso zzso grammar learning can be mastered successfully by zzso patients and is considered to be an implicit learning task independent of zzso learning and memory zzso In this study, 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso 21 Parkinson's disease zzso and 15 control subjects were tested on artificial grammar zzso zzso zzso patients with advanced disease were examined under adequate medication and zzso zzso All patient groups showed intact artificial grammar zzso Neither zzso damage nor zzso zzso dysfunction nor zzso medication zzso or affects artificial grammar zzso Although the patients showed significant executive dysfunction, implicit learning remains zzso The conclusion is that zzso and zzso zzso circuits play no essential part in this kind of implicit zzso The results suggest that artificial grammar learning is a zzso zzso function comparable to the mechanism of visual zzso
