The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging as an alternative to zzso zzso stimulation mapping for the zzso of critical language areas in the zzso zzso We investigated several requirements that functional magnetic resonance imaging must fulfill for clinical zzso high zzso power for the presence as well as the absence of critical language function in regions of the brain, zzso statistical methodology, and high spatial zzso Thirteen patients with zzso lobe zzso performed four different functional magnetic resonance imaging language tasks zzso verb generation, picture naming, verbal zzso and sentence zzso before zzso surgery that included zzso zzso stimulation zzso To assess the optimal statistical threshold for functional magnetic resonance imaging, images were analyzed with three different statistical zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging information was read into a surgical guidance system for identification of cortical areas of zzso zzso zzso stimulation mapping was recorded by video camera, and stimulation sites were zzso Next, a computer zzso indicated whether significant functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was present or absent within the immediate vicinity zzso of zzso zzso stimulation mapping zzso In 2 patients, zzso zzso stimulation mapping failed during zzso zzso zzso stimulation mapping detected critical language areas in 8 of the remaining 11 zzso zzso between functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso stimulation mapping depended heavily on statistical threshold and varied between patients and zzso In 7 of 8 patients, sensitivity of functional magnetic resonance imaging was zzso with a combination of 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging correctly detected all critical language areas with high spatial zzso In 1 patient, sensitivity was zzso in this patient, functional magnetic resonance imaging was included in a larger area found with zzso zzso stimulation zzso Overall, specificity was zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging reliably predicted the absence of critical language areas within the region exposed during surgery, indicating that such areas can be safely zzso without the need for zzso zzso stimulation zzso The presence of functional magnetic resonance imaging activity at zzso language sites limited the zzso value of functional magnetic resonance imaging for the presence of critical language areas to zzso Although this zzso current replacement of zzso zzso stimulation zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging can at present be used to speed up zzso zzso stimulation mapping procedures and to guide the extent of the zzso
