The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of zzso abnormalities in children with zzso single zzso zzso scheduled for zzso vault zzso surgery using zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

A retrospective analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging studies of 129 zzso single zzso zzso children undergoing zzso surgery between January, zzso 2010 was zzso zzso analysis was performed for child, maternal and sibling related zzso factors for abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso The mean age of these 121 patients at the time of imaging was zzso zzso The majority, zzso were males and zzso of the patients were zzso 

In 18 zzso patients abnormal brain findings were zzso The most common finding was zzso 1 zzso in 11 zzso zzso 1 zzso comprised over half zzso of the brain anomalies zzso None of these findings required any additional surgical zzso None of the statistical analysis reached statistical zzso 

Brain anomalies in connection with zzso single zzso zzso patients seem to be a coincidental zzso We did not establish any specific zzso form to be regularly associated with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso The routine use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging in zzso single zzso zzso patients seems to be of limited value in the search for associated zzso zzso zzso additional zzso
