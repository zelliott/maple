zzso artery disease characteristically impacts left zzso zzso function on a regional basis, although ultimately global function may be affected as zzso zzso is commonly clinically used for the assessment of regional zzso however, it is only zzso and in its current iteration is only two-dimensional in zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso with tissue tagging offers the possibility for zzso three-dimensional zzso assessment of zzso and zzso left zzso strain and, zzso zzso zzso we have explored zzso to accurately and zzso characterize regional zzso function in three dimensions in patients with zzso heart disease using zzso 

zzso zzso tissue tagging was performed at rest and during zzso administration (10 zzso on 10 normal volunteers zzso 26 zzso 6) and 8 patients with severe zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso 5, zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso global and regional zzso strain calculations were made based on zzso zzso point zzso and compared with conventional zzso 

Global left zzso strains were significantly decreased in zzso patients at rest zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the regional analysis zzso zzso wall zzso this methodology accurately differentiated normal from zzso contracting zzso 

zzso zzso zzso tissue tagging with calculation of zzso regional strains has significant promise as a clinical tool which is capable of the zzso zzso and display of regionally varying zzso zzso
