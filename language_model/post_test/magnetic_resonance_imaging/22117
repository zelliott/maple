Although zzso of the zzso burden from serial MR examinations of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso is a common technique to assess disease activity in clinical trials, zzso change may occur within a zzso without a corresponding change in zzso zzso measures of zzso volume and composition may improve the sensitivity of detecting disease zzso A new technique has been developed that provides information about the intensity composition of zzso zzso in standard zzso MR zzso The new technique is based on the zzso zzso zzso intensity zzso of the zzso and normal zzso Analysis of MR examinations of materials with known zzso and zzso times showed that feature space position from zzso examinations is largely determined from zzso density zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Information about intensity composition was obtained by reducing the zzso intensity distribution to one dimension while minimizing the loss of zzso This technique was used to analyze eight zzso in standard zzso MR examinations of three patients with zzso zzso zzso were compared between examinations by first zzso the examinations based on the intensity zzso of zzso fluid zzso an internal reference zzso Many of the zzso zzso had a distinctive peak at low intensity, corresponding to zzso white matter zzso Within the zzso zzso increases in high intensity zzso generally were accompanied by reductions in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed some dramatic zzso even when zzso volume remained zzso
