We describe a method for identification of brain structures from zzso data zzso The bulk of the paper concerns an automatic system for finding the anterior and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso These landmarks are key for the definition of the zzso space, commonly used in zzso zzso in the definition of common coordinate systems for the pooling of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso images and for zzso zzso The process works according to a zzso zzso it first analyzes the skull zzso A zzso zzso is then calculated and allows an automated selection of zzso Then, the zzso plane is zzso Following an advanced scene analysis in the zzso plane for anatomical structures, the zzso and the PC are zzso zzso with a set of 200 patients, the process never zzso Its performances and limits are comparable to that of zzso zzso Those results are due to a high degree of zzso at each step of the zzso
