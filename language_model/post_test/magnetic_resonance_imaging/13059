In this paper, we propose an improved zzso active zzso model in a zzso level set zzso We define an energy functional with a local intensity fitting term, which zzso a local force to attract the zzso and stops it at object zzso and an auxiliary global intensity fitting term, which drives the motion of the zzso far away from object zzso zzso the combination of these two forces allows for flexible zzso of the zzso This energy is then incorporated into a level set zzso with a level set zzso term that is necessary for accurate zzso in the corresponding level set zzso The proposed model is first presented as a zzso level set zzso and then extended to a zzso zzso Experimental results show the advantages of our method in terms of accuracy and zzso In particular, our method has been applied to brain MR image zzso with desirable zzso
