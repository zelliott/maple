The objective of this study was to explore the evolution of apparent diffusion zzso zzso values in magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso tissue of the corpus zzso during the 1st year after traumatic brain injury zzso and relate findings to zzso zzso patients zzso age 34 zzso zzso zzso with moderate to severe zzso were examined with diffusion weighted zzso at three time points zzso 7 days, 3 and 12 zzso and a zzso and zzso control group of 47 healthy individuals, were examined zzso The corpus zzso was subdivided and the mean zzso values zzso blinded in 10 regions of interests without any visible zzso in the zzso zzso zzso measures were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain scores at 12 zzso We found a gradual increase of the mean zzso values during the 12 month zzso most evident in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the healthy control group, we found higher mean zzso values in zzso zzso both at 3 months zzso and 12 months zzso zzso Patients with zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso in the corpus zzso in the early zzso and patients with disability zzso score zzso showed evidence of increased mean zzso values in the zzso and zzso zzso at 12 zzso Mean zzso values in zzso parts of the corpus zzso at 3 months predicted the zzso function domain score zzso During the 1st year after moderate and severe zzso we demonstrated a slowly evolving disruption of the zzso in normal appearing corpus zzso in the zzso map, most evident in the zzso zzso The mean zzso values were associated with both outcome and ability to perform zzso complex zzso zzso
