The diagnostic efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with that of zzso zzso zzso in patients with primary zzso tumors or zzso of the zzso 

A subset of patients was evaluated from the 410 enrolled in the United States in phase III central nervous system clinical trials with zzso zzso From these trials, there were 82 patients with zzso zzso zzso of the brain, the focus of the current zzso Patients were zzso to one of three incremental dosing zzso Imaging with zzso at doses of zzso and zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso at doses of zzso and zzso zzso and at doses of zzso and zzso zzso The on-site physician, patient, and all off-site zzso were blinded to the agent injected and the administered zzso zzso were obtained before contrast administration and within 5 minutes after administration of each zzso The two contrast injections in any one patient were separated by 15 zzso An independent laboratory performed signal intensity zzso The magnetic resonance zzso films were evaluated for level of diagnostic information, number of zzso zzso and confidence in MR imaging diagnosis by two independent zzso zzso zzso with any study zzso 

The zzso signal intensity ratio after a dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than that after a dose of zzso zzso zzso with this result statistically significant zzso zzso zzso After the second dose of contrast, results were comparable in all three zzso The level of diagnostic information contained on the MR films increased significantly for all three groups from zzso to zzso for both the first and second administered zzso In zzso zzso the level of diagnostic information was similar after the first contrast dose for all three dosing zzso This was also true after the second contrast zzso For all three groups, the number of zzso detected increased significantly zzso zzso first or zzso zzso in MR diagnosis increased from zzso to zzso for all three groups, with no statistically significant difference between zzso 

zzso zzso used at slightly lower doses, is comparable to zzso in terms of efficacy in imaging of zzso zzso brain zzso As with other zzso zzso higher doses zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso offer greater diagnostic zzso
