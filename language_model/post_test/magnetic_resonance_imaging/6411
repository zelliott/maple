To evaluate safety and mid term efficacy zzso or zzso 1 year zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso particles zzso in a study applying criteria identical to those submitted to the zzso for initial material zzso 

Twenty of the first 26 consecutive patients referred for potential zzso were enrolled in the zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso zzso to zzso The zzso procedures were performed from a unilateral zzso approach using zzso selective zzso in straight vessels, zzso 2 zzso in diameter, and zzso in smaller and tortuous zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was defined by reaching the zzso zzso zzso appearance and sluggish flow in the main stem of the zzso zzso Assessment of zzso mid term success was done by zzso 10 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after zzso The clinical mid term success was assessed by having questionnaires completed for zzso zzso retention of clinical zzso benefit and quality of zzso 

Technical success was 100 zzso with 8 minor (2 zzso collapses, 2 zzso 4 relevant zzso zzso 1 spontaneous expulsion of a zzso zzso and 3 major complications (1 zzso because of zzso bleeding for 5 weeks, 1 transient zzso and 1 spontaneous expulsion of zzso with transient bleeding requiring zzso In 17 of 19 patients, zzso showed total zzso zzso throughout the entire zzso The average shrinkage of the dominant zzso was zzso % at one zzso The zzso bleeding record in the cohort group fell from an average of zzso before treatment to zzso points at one zzso At the same time, the clinical symptoms significantly zzso The patient satisfaction with the applied therapy was zzso 95 % at 1 zzso One patient with residual zzso zzso underwent a second zzso which achieved complete zzso and adequate clinical success at one zzso The second patient with incomplete zzso had a persistent clinical zzso 

Under controlled study conditions, flow guided zzso with zzso particles achieves high overall success and patient zzso zzso provides exact zzso description of the zzso for the initial evaluation and for zzso zzso
