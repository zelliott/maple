zzso imaging is a novel zzso three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging technique with phase zzso that zzso the zzso properties of blood zzso The use of zzso imaging for zzso focus zzso in the acute stage of zzso in a child has not been zzso 

We report three pediatric patients with status zzso in the setting of fever, in whom zzso imaging showed transient prominence of the focal zzso zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso and zzso images and zzso images showed no zzso The prominence of the focal zzso zzso in these patients, as demonstrated by zzso imaging, was consistent with the zzso focuses suggested by both clinical symptoms and zzso findings and resolved completely without neurological zzso in all zzso 

zzso imaging may facilitate assessing zzso focus zzso in the acute stage of zzso in zzso
