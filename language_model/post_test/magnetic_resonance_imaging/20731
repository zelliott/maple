The zzso prefrontal zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of several psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder and zzso In this regard, the zzso has been targeted in repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso studies as a form of treatment to those patients who are resistant to zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for positioning the zzso magnetic stimulation zzso zzso over zzso have been zzso due to poor targeting zzso attributed to zzso zzso We evaluated the accuracy of such methods to zzso the zzso on the scalp in 15 healthy subjects and compared them with our novel zzso method, which first estimates the zzso position in the zzso based on a standard template and then determines the most appropriate position on the scalp in which to place the zzso zzso Our zzso method yielded a scalp position for the left zzso between zzso F3 and F5 in standard space and was closest to zzso F5 in individual zzso Further, we found that there was significantly less zzso zzso using our zzso method for zzso the zzso on the scalp compared with the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our findings also suggest that the zzso zzso is superior to the zzso zzso in reducing zzso zzso and that zzso F5 should be the stimulation location of choice when zzso zzso is not zzso
