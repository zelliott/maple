The aim of the work was to compare two different approaches - one zzso the other zzso - for zzso zzso data, in order to improve the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso Surface zzso filtering zzso and zzso Independent zzso Analysis zzso were applied on zzso scalp zzso signals zzso 128 zzso with zzso realistic zzso zzso a subset of 19 electrodes, no zzso prior to beta Event Related zzso zzso zzso after finger movement in 8 normal zzso zzso zzso was performed using standard zzso zzso zzso peak zzso and zzso in the most responsive channel were calculated and the effect of the two methods above was evaluated by one-way analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Both methods and their combination significantly improved zzso zzso zzso zzso peak zzso p zzso The results obtained after zzso on 19 zzso were not significantly different than the ones obtained with zzso zzso using 128 zzso and zzso for scalp modeling zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso (19 electrodes, no zzso zzso such method as a valid alternative to zzso zzso The employ of zzso after zzso filtering suggests that the zzso zzso zzso zzso would unify the two approaches, depending on both the scalp model and the zzso
