To report on the prenatal ultrasound findings in fetuses with zzso associated with zzso syndrome zzso and to compare these findings with those of magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Cases of zzso confirmed by zzso zzso zzso analysis were identified through review of patient zzso zzso ultrasound scans were reviewed zzso by two zzso For cerebral cortical development, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso over the cerebral zzso were zzso If one or more of these fissures or zzso were not zzso at the expected zzso age or their appearance was abnormal for zzso age, cortical development was considered zzso zzso and zzso zzso examinations were reviewed by a pediatric zzso 

There were seven cases of zzso In three cases, the prenatal diagnosis of zzso was zzso suspected by ultrasound at 23, 26 and 30 weeks, and subsequently confirmed by prenatal zzso When we zzso reviewed the prenatal ultrasound scans of all zzso all had delayed cortical development identified on ultrasound performed after 23 zzso zzso In all cases the zzso zzso was abnormal on both ultrasound and zzso In one zzso a normal cortical appearance for zzso age was seen at the initial zzso ultrasound examination, but delayed cortical development was identified at a zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in six fetuses and zzso of the corpus zzso in zzso zzso abnormalities were detected in five zzso Delayed cortical development was seen in two fetuses with mild zzso but no other fetal zzso 

In fetuses with zzso delayed cortical development can be suspected on ultrasound as early as 23 zzso zzso This finding warrants further investigations including zzso and FISH analysis for zzso zzso zzso
