The zzso visual zzso has a modular organization in which discrete and zzso regions show a much stronger response to certain object categories zzso faces, zzso than to other zzso The majority of previous studies have examined the response of these zzso regions to isolated images of preferred or zzso zzso Thus, little is known about the way these zzso regions represent more complex visual zzso which include both preferred and zzso zzso Here we examined whether glasses zzso modify the representation of simultaneously presented faces zzso in the zzso face zzso We used an zzso zzso paradigm in which faces were presented with glasses either on or above the face while subjects performed a face or a glasses discrimination zzso Our findings show that the sensitivity of the zzso face area to glasses was zzso when glasses were presented on the face than above the face during a face discrimination task rather than during a glasses discrimination zzso These findings suggest that zzso stimuli may significantly modify the representation of preferred zzso even when they are task zzso Future studies will determine whether this interaction is specific to faces or may be found for other object categories in zzso zzso
