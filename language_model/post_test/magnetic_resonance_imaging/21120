Data on clinical long-term outcome after the acute phase of zzso zzso zzso using validated outcome scales is currently zzso Here we report the results of a systematic literature search for studies on HE and data on long-term outcome in patients with HE admitted to three zzso hospitals between January 2005 and July zzso HE was defined as zzso and blood zzso levels zzso zzso on admission, persistence of zzso for zzso h despite zzso of blood zzso levels, and exclusion of any other cause of zzso zzso was assessed using the modified Rankin scale zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso Fifteen patients were included, with a mean age of 60 years zzso zzso Two were lost to zzso Of the remaining 13 patients, six had died zzso zzso In the seven survivors, the median zzso score was 0 zzso zzso median zzso score was 5 zzso zzso and median zzso was 100 zzso zzso zzso made in the acute phase were available for three patients and revealed no obvious relation between zzso size or pattern and clinical zzso To our knowledge, this is the first case series using validated clinical scoring systems to determine clinical long-term outcome after zzso The results suggest that mortality is high, but long-term survival with little or no disability is possible and can be observed in the majority of zzso zzso of death or poor outcome does not seem to be related to zzso features in the acute phase but rather to other presumably medical zzso
