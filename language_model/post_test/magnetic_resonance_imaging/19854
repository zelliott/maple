The onset of multiple sclerosis is zzso zzso or primary zzso An improved understanding of the causes of early progressive disability in primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso could provide zzso targets for therapeutic zzso 

Five magnetic resonance imaging zzso parameters that could potentially cause progressive disability were investigated in 43 patients with early zzso and in 37 patients with early zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso in brain, both zzso matter and white zzso intrinsic zzso in brain, both zzso matter and white matter zzso by the zzso transfer ratio zzso and zzso of the upper cervical spinal zzso Both groups were also compared with zzso 

Patients with zzso were older and more likely to be zzso Both patient groups had zzso of brain zzso matter and white matter, and intrinsic zzso in zzso of zzso zzso matter and white zzso zzso zzso was present only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls, zzso zzso p zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso analysis of all five zzso zzso age and zzso 

Grey matter and white matter of the brain are abnormal in both early zzso and zzso but zzso zzso is present only in zzso This is zzso with zzso being the usual clinical presentation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso seems to be clinically relevant in zzso treatment zzso
