zzso 

zzso To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in selecting patients for active surveillance zzso 

zzso We identified prostate zzso patients who had undergone a zzso biopsy scheme and fulfilled the criteria as zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso 10 zzso zzso disease, a zzso score zzso 6, zzso positive zzso and zzso length per core zzso zzso zzso We included 96 patients who underwent a radical zzso zzso and a prostate zzso before zzso zzso The main end point of the study was the zzso disease features at zzso with or without the use of zzso as AS inclusion zzso 

zzso Mean age and mean zzso were zzso years and zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer was staged zzso in zzso of zzso zzso The rate of zzso disease zzso and/or zzso score zzso 4 + 3) was zzso A zzso disease on zzso was noted in 28 men zzso zzso was not a significant predictor of zzso disease in zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso rate of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso positive surgical margins zzso zzso zzso or zzso upgrading zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso zzso model, no zzso zzso was an independent predictor of zzso disease in the zzso zzso zzso After a mean follow-up of 29 months, the recurrence-free survival zzso was statistically equivalent between men with zzso on zzso and those with zzso disease zzso zzso zzso 

zzso The results of the present study emphasize that, when the selection of patients for AS is based on an extended zzso biopsy zzso and uses the most stringent inclusion criteria, zzso does not improve the prediction of high-risk and/or non zzso disease in a zzso zzso
