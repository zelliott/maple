To study the three-dimensional zzso zzso patterns in different types of zzso zzso zzso by utilizing delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of cartilage zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso We used standard grading of zzso by zzso grade on standard zzso and zzso grading of cartilage in zzso for comparative zzso 

zzso was obtained from ten zzso zzso volunteers and 26 symptomatic zzso zzso zzso included the routine hip protocol and a zzso angle zzso zzso zzso echo zzso sequence utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso classified from the zzso images based on the extent of zzso zzso no zzso zzso zone measuring zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso or total zzso zzso findings were evaluated and zzso 

All zzso types revealed remarkably lower zzso mean values in comparison to zzso volunteers in all regions of zzso Distribution of the zzso zzso values was in accordance with the specific zzso damage zzso In zzso zzso there was a significant drop zzso of zzso in the anterior to superior zzso In zzso zzso there was a generalized zzso decrease zzso High zzso zzso reliability was noted for zzso assessment using zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that a pattern of zzso zzso variation does seem to exist that is unique for different zzso of zzso The zzso zzso approach to perform zzso zzso mapping has a promising role for further studies of standard zzso and zzso in the hip zzso
