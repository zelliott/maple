zzso zzso slope was evaluated in 30 normal and 30 zzso knees using magnetic resonance zzso The mean zzso zzso slope in the zzso plateau was zzso degrees zzso 5 degrees - zzso zzso in the normal knees and zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees - 19 zzso in the zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso slope in the lateral plateau was zzso degrees zzso 0 degrees - zzso zzso in the normal knees and 6 degrees zzso 1 degrees - 13 zzso in the zzso zzso Although these differences were not statistically zzso there was a large range in the zzso zzso slope in both zzso When zzso thickness of bone was zzso in the middle of the lateral plateau in total knee zzso the thickness of the bone zzso in the anterior and zzso part of the lateral plateau was zzso The presumed thickness of bone was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the anterior part and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A large range in the measured thickness of bone also was detected in the zzso zzso These results suggest that the shape of the zzso zzso varies among individuals and that the cutting angle should be determined in each case to avoid any mismatch of the patient's zzso slope of the zzso after zzso
