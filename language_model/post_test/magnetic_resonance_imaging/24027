The authors previously described a functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging task for the zzso of auditory comprehension in which focal zzso of zzso zzso and inferior frontal regions of the left zzso was reliably zzso Because this study was conducted in zzso normal volunteers, it was not possible to determine whether the activated regions were critical to the performance of language zzso that is, whether the zzso imaging zzso provided a valid measure of language zzso A direct comparison of zzso imaging language zzso with cortical stimulation must be completed before it can be used with confidence in zzso planning, and this comparison is performed in the present zzso 

The authors report on a series of 33 consecutive patients who underwent dominant zzso zzso and in whom zzso imaging mapping of auditory comprehension was performed at the Yale zzso zzso In 23 of the 33 patients zzso imaging zzso was consistent with the typical results obtained in normal participants in the earlier zzso In 16 of these 23 patients language mapping was performed using either zzso or zzso cortical zzso zzso stimulation failed to zzso language areas in two of the 16 zzso zzso stimulation that was performed in proximity to the zzso image zzso zzso with auditory zzso object naming, or speech production in 12 of the remaining 14 zzso Five of the 10 cases in which zzso of reliable zzso imaging zzso failed were attributable to technical problems and/or patient head zzso 

zzso stimulation results and zzso imaging findings were consistent in all but two zzso However, the spatial extent of the zzso produced by zzso imaging and the spatial extent of zzso language disruption that was caused by direct cortical stimulation did not always zzso zzso in defining the extent of zzso by both methods are zzso
