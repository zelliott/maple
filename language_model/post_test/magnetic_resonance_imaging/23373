To compare the diagnostic utility of pelvic ultrasound zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso on the clinical decision to proceed with zzso artery zzso zzso 

Over 2 years, 180 consecutive women zzso age zzso sought consultation for zzso 116 underwent pelvic US and zzso before possible zzso US was performed prior to zzso Imaging was zzso for zzso zzso size and location, zzso volume, and the presence of potential zzso to zzso zzso between imaging methods and cases where discrepancies could have altered management, were zzso 

For the 116 patients who completed imaging, the average zzso volume was zzso zzso using zzso versus zzso zzso using US zzso The average dominant zzso volume was zzso zzso using zzso versus zzso zzso using US zzso In 14 zzso patients US did not correctly zzso or zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Thirteen patients did not undergo zzso zzso preference zzso zzso imaging findings zzso In the four cases where zzso was not performed due to imaging findings, relevant findings were all diagnosed by zzso compared with two by US zzso The two cases not detected by ultrasound were zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Of the 103 patients who underwent zzso 14 were treated (without zzso despite the presence of a relative zzso all 14 relative zzso were identified by zzso compared with 13 by US zzso 

zzso is more accurate than US for characterizing zzso zzso In a small but statistically insignificant number of cases, zzso identified findings that were missed by zzso which changed zzso For patients that are zzso to be assessed with zzso ultrasound alone is sufficient for zzso zzso
