It is well established that attention increases the efficiency of information processing, but the neural mechanisms underlying this improvement are not fully zzso Evidence indicates that neural firing rates increase for attended zzso but another possibility is that attention could increase the selectivity of the neural population representing an attended zzso We tested this latter hypothesis by using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure population selectivity for object views under different attention conditions in the human lateral zzso complex zzso Our data not only show increased neural activity (or zzso with attention, consistent with existing models, but also increased population selectivity that cannot be accounted for by gain mechanisms zzso Our results suggest that attention increases the specificity of the neural population representing an attended zzso
