zzso zzso zzso is a rare type of primary brain tumor that zzso infiltrates more than two zzso of the brain while the normal cerebral architecture is zzso To the best of our knowledge, the association between an acquired zzso zzso and zzso has never been zzso In this article, we describe three patients with progressive zzso of the zzso zzso who subsequently showed signs and symptoms secondary to zzso zzso Early recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication allowed us to recommend prompt surgical zzso 

One patient with primary, or Type I, zzso presented with zzso zzso and two patients with secondary, or Type II, zzso presented with the signs and symptoms of progressive zzso zzso imaging studies demonstrated progressive involvement of the zzso descent of the zzso zzso through the zzso zzso and zzso spinal zzso zzso 

Once the zzso zzso was zzso all three patients underwent zzso zzso zzso a cervical zzso to the lowest level of the zzso zzso and zzso All three patients experienced immediate improvement in their zzso 

Early recognition of zzso zzso a possibly overlooked cause of death in patients with zzso allows for early surgical intervention as a potentially lifesaving procedure and significant improvement in the patient's zzso
