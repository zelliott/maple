As most patients who have suffered spinal zzso injury can now expect a normal life span, the late complications of these injuries are seen increasingly zzso Regular surveillance of both the zzso tract and the central nervous system zzso is important as the treatment of zzso potentially fatal complications can be implemented before damage has progressed too zzso Renal tract complications are particularly dangerous as they are often clinically silent but regular surveillance to detect early deterioration in zzso function, particularly from zzso causes such as zzso or obstruction can pre-empt zzso zzso protocols depend on the zzso management regime but most zzso advocate regular ultrasound with less frequent isotope function zzso With the increasing ability to diagnose and treat the neurological zzso surveillance of the state of the spinal zzso with zzso is also important and many zzso now advocate checks every few years with zzso zzso zzso sections are sufficient unless changes are noted, when zzso zzso sections can be added without significant examination time zzso Imaging is critical in acute zzso In addition to suffering from the usual normal conditions, patients with spinal zzso injury suffer others peculiar to, or particularly related to, the injury, which may be missed as their zzso is greatly altered by their zzso or zzso status and they may often present as generally zzso but with no obvious zzso This review discusses the role of zzso in routine surveillance of the zzso and the zzso tract as well as in assessing specific conditions such as deteriorating neurology or zzso function, pain, spinal instability, pressure sores, zzso zzso muscular spasm, spinal instability, airway problems and zzso operations on the zzso zzso
