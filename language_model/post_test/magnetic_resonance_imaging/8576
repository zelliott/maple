Patients with zzso pain disorders are supposed to suffer from an early acquired zzso in stress zzso In order to look for common zzso of the zzso and zzso cortical areas, we zzso recorded cerebral zzso induced by zzso pain, by cognitive stress and emotional stress using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in a group of 17 patients and an zzso control zzso In addition, the zzso volumes of both groups were zzso Patients showed increased zzso of the known zzso areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but also of some zzso zzso and zzso regions during first pain exposure and of zzso and zzso areas during cognitive stress, but reduced zzso during emotional zzso In contrast to these functional differences, zzso volume was not significantly reduced in zzso Although the superior zzso zzso was the only common area of an zzso in patients in the pain and stress condition, findings of our study support the current concept of mechanisms involved in zzso pain zzso central processing of pain and of cognitive stress is increased in patients possibly due to exaggerated memory and/or anticipation of pain exposure and to a zzso of zzso systems which has to be worked out on a cortical level in more zzso Our finding of a reduced responsiveness to emotional stress is surprising, but not zzso to these results because some sort of neglect or coping mechanisms may have developed over time as a response to early zzso
