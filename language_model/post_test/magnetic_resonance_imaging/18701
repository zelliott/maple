Our purpose was to determine the association between zzso zzso spine subcutaneous zzso fluid collections, and body weight on zzso spine MR zzso 

MR images of the zzso spine obtained at zzso T of 307 consecutive zzso zzso female, 116 zzso were reviewed on the basis of MR imaging signal characteristics for the presence, degree, size, and location of presumed subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso and fluid zzso The patients were divided into three weight groups zzso zzso or zzso 85 zzso and two age groups zzso or zzso years zzso zzso was graded on a scale of zzso according to its length relative to the zzso zzso When present, the fluid collection volumes were zzso The vertical epicenter of the signal zzso was noted by zzso body zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was seen in 121 patients zzso and discrete fluid collections were seen in 53 patients zzso Both degree of zzso and volume of fluid collection were associated with increasing weight zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso and increasing age zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso in females was significantly greater than in males zzso zzso zzso However, the sex of the patient did not correlate with frequency of fluid collections zzso zzso zzso or volume of collections zzso zzso zzso The mean epicenters of zzso in females and males were at similar levels zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso zzso 

The severity of zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso and the volume of fluid collections on MR imaging are associated with increased zzso
