zzso imaging has recently been used to investigate detailed zzso organization in human zzso Such studies frequently assume that human cortical areas are only identifiable zzso as they resemble those measured zzso in zzso This is true despite the zzso basis of the latter recordings, which are typically zzso recordings of action zzso from a restricted sample of zzso 

Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in human subjects, we found a widely distributed cortical response in both primary zzso and motor zzso upon zzso stimulation of the zzso surface of the zzso index and ring zzso Though not organized in a discrete zzso fashion, the population activity in response to thumb and index finger stimulation indicated a disproportionate response to fingertip zzso and one that was modulated by stimulation zzso Furthermore, the zzso was structured with a line of symmetry through the central zzso reflecting zzso both to primary zzso zzso and, zzso to primary motor zzso 

In considering functional zzso that is not zzso or zzso restricted as in monkey zzso studies, our methodology reveals zzso zzso that is not organized in a simple zzso manner but is nevertheless as structured as it is zzso Our findings suggest a striking functional mirroring in cortical areas conventionally ascribed either an input or an output zzso zzso
