On zzso focal cortical zzso zzso is characterized by a combination of increased cortical zzso zzso signal within the zzso zzso and blurred transition between gray and white matter zzso The visual identification of these abnormal characteristics may be difficult, and it is unclear to what degree these features occur among different zzso zzso Our purpose was to investigate the pattern of occurrence of abnormal zzso characteristics in zzso by using a set of zzso models and to generate quantitative zzso zzso 

A set of zzso operators was applied to high-resolution zzso zzso zzso in 23 patients with zzso proven zzso and 39 healthy controls, creating maps of zzso zzso maps of relative intensity highlighting areas with zzso zzso and maps of zzso magnitude modeling the zzso zzso All zzso zzso were segmented manually on the zzso zzso 

zzso volumes ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The manually segmented zzso zzso were used to estimate features in the zzso area and to determine possible local variations of each feature by means of a zzso In zzso of the patients, zzso zzso were characterized by simultaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso and blurring of the zzso zzso Moreover, in all patients, the zzso zzso had at least two of these three zzso 

The three features occurred regardless of the zzso volume, and they characterized not only large zzso zzso but also subtle ones that had been overlooked by conventional zzso inspection before zzso
