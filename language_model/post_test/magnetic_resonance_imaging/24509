A new rotary phased array zzso head zzso that can provide zzso brain images comparable to zzso zzso coils is proposed for magnetic resonance brain imaging zzso The design of the zzso head zzso is a departure from conventional zzso array design method, as zzso elements of the zzso head zzso have a zzso structure consisting of a pair of main conductors located on opposite sides, inserted zzso around and over the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso head zzso was constructed and zzso tested against a conventional zzso zzso phased array head zzso and a commercial zzso zzso zzso head zzso zzso phantom images acquired by the zzso head zzso show that signal intensity deep at the center of the phantom was improved as compared to the conventional phased array head zzso and this improvement allow the zzso head zzso to acquire zzso brain images similar to brain images acquired with the zzso head zzso In addition, partial parallel imaging was used in conjunction with the zzso head zzso to enable rapid zzso
