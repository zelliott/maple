The goal of the study was to investigate the use of automated registration techniques for interpretation of volume MR and high resolution zzso images that were obtained from patients with brain zzso 

zzso patients with brain tumors were studied on one or more occasions using zzso and high resolution zzso The data were aligned using automated zzso and zzso zzso Composite images zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso SE, and PET data were constructed to correlate zzso of regions on the PET images with regions that corresponded to normal gray matter, white matter, and zzso zzso 

The accuracy of registration between the MR and PET images was estimated to be within 1-2 zzso based upon the distance between surfaces of the outside of the zzso In 12 of the 24 zzso there were diagnoses of zzso zzso with only 5 of these exhibiting regions of higher zzso zzso than normal gray zzso For 19 of the 24 studies, the zzso context provided by the registered MR images was found to be important in distinguishing zzso tumor from necrosis based upon zzso zzso 

The automated alignment was found to be an important factor in interpreting the high resolution PET zzso This was particularly true for small zzso close to the zzso and for situations where zzso zzso had been reduced by prior treatment with radiation zzso
