MR imaging sheds new light on zzso involvement in the course of acquired chronic liver zzso however, the exact zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso and associated MR abnormalities remain zzso Our purpose was to relate MR signal intensity abnormalities of the zzso to clinical, zzso and zzso features of zzso chronic liver zzso 

zzso patients (12 male and nine female zzso were included in the study; two had zzso disease type 2, 17 had chronic liver disease of different causes, and two had idiopathic copper zzso Twelve patients had zzso proved liver zzso with a median disease duration of 175 months at the time of MR zzso None had clinical symptoms of zzso zzso MR imaging was performed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Eleven patients had abnormal MR imaging findings of the brain revealed by zzso MR zzso two of the 11 had idiopathic copper zzso The affected sites were the zzso and zzso zzso presenting symmetrical and bilateral high signal zzso or the zzso zzso which appeared zzso zzso or both zzso Eight of the 12 patients with zzso had abnormal MR signals of the zzso In these, the median zzso duration was shorter zzso zzso than in the remaining four patients with normal MR signals zzso zzso A significant correlation was found between abnormal MR signals of the brain and zzso zzso zzso zzso and factor V activity zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging confirms the presence of abnormal brain signals in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso liver disease in the absence of clinical symptoms of zzso Signal intensity abnormalities are likely caused by an as yet unidentified zzso process partially correlated with the severity of liver zzso
