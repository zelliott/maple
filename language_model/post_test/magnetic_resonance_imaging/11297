The development of zzso therapies for tumors has led to a demand for zzso surrogate markers of the zzso zzso The utility of such markers is highly dependent on their zzso zzso This paper presents a formal assessment of the zzso of zzso of relative blood volume zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso as estimated by measurement of relative zzso zzso The study was conducted in 11 patients with zzso who were scanned on two occasions zzso hours zzso The observed reliability estimates were used to calculate zzso confidence limits for detection of differences between groups and for changes in individual zzso The results show that measurement of zzso or zzso in consecutive studies is statistically capable of reliably detecting changes in excess of zzso in between group studies and zzso in individual zzso zzso of vascular zzso using is less zzso but is able to confidently identify changes in excess of zzso in group studies and zzso in zzso
