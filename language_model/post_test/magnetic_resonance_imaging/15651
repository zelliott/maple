Brain zzso as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been correlated with disability in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso Recent evidence indicates that both white matter zzso and gray matter zzso are subject to zzso in patients with zzso Although neurological deficiencies in zzso are primarily due to loss of zzso the clinical significance of zzso zzso has not been fully explored in zzso 

We have undertaken a three-year, zzso study, comparing 26 patients who elected to receive intramuscular zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy, with 28 patients who elected not to receive zzso Both groups had quantitative zzso zzso scans at study entry and after three years, and standardized clinical assessments every six zzso Brain zzso fraction zzso zzso fraction zzso and zzso fraction zzso percent changes were zzso and zzso and zzso volumes zzso zzso 

After three years, mean percent zzso change in zzso favored the zzso zzso treatment group zzso zzso zzso versus the control group zzso zzso as did the mean percent change in zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and the mean percent change in zzso zzso versus zzso zzso At the end of the study, there was a significant zzso decrease in zzso for both groups zzso for the zzso zzso treatment group, and zzso for the control group), a significant zzso decrease in zzso for the zzso zzso treatment group zzso and a significant decrease in zzso for the control group zzso when compared with zzso 

Over a three-year period, treatment with zzso zzso significantly slowed the progression of zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso when compared with the control zzso
