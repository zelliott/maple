zzso for magnetic resonance investigations in critically ill patients is zzso While these patients frequently need zzso support, not all of them require controlled ventilation and many may be treated with continuous positive airway zzso Controlled zzso with the concurrent need for zzso may be inappropriate when airway physiology is being studied and may zzso zzso No commercially available zzso designed for the magnetic resonance environment can deliver high flow continuous positive airway zzso We tested the zzso zzso flow generator and five zzso valves zzso zzso airway zzso within a 3 zzso environment for safety and possible zzso All components had minimal zzso properties and tests showed no clinically relevant change in flow delivery or oxygen concentration in the magnetic zzso In addition, the airway pressure generated by the valves was not affected by the magnetic zzso We conclude that the tested system can be safely used in a 3 zzso magnetic resonance zzso
