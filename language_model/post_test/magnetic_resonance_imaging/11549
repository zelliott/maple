To evaluate the zzso changes of cerebral involvement in children with zzso utilizing CT and zzso 

We zzso analyzed 13 zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso studies of 5 out of 93 patients with clinically proven zzso and severe zzso involvement zzso and coma and zzso of zzso referred to the department of pediatric zzso zzso zzso years, median 2 years, 2 girls, 3 zzso between zzso 

Three of 5 patients had CT and zzso studies, 2 patients had CT scans zzso One of 2 patients with isolated zzso zzso zzso and normal first zzso developed a secondary zzso zzso Another patient with an initially normal zzso developed an zzso of the right cerebral arteries with mass zzso One of 2 patients with zzso zzso involvement showed additional zzso of zzso and external and internal capsules whereas the other had only minimal involvement of adjacent white matter, but consecutive zzso zzso Four of 5 children died (3 of them with varying zzso of zzso zzso and adjacent white matter involvement, 1 with right cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso involvement was found in the majority of cases as well as in all lethal zzso The surviving patient with isolated zzso zzso involvement now suffers from zzso disorder and zzso 

zzso involvement is one of the major complications of zzso According to the literature, zzso zzso involvement in zzso is common and quite often associated with other cerebral zzso First imaging findings may not show zzso zzso to previous reports, even children with isolated zzso zzso pathology and/or less involvement of white matter and coma may either die from the underlying disease or their clinical outcome may be zzso
