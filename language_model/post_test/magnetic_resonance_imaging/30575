To use zzso and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare dimensions of the zzso pelvis and soft tissue structures in a sample of African-American and white zzso 

This study used data from 234 participants in the zzso and zzso zzso Imaging zzso a cohort study of 104 zzso women with an zzso zzso zzso zzso 94 who delivered zzso without a recognized zzso zzso tear and 36 who underwent by zzso delivery without zzso Race was zzso At zzso months zzso rapid acquisition zzso pelvic zzso were zzso zzso and soft tissue dimensions were measured and compared between white and African-American participants using analysis of zzso while controlling for delivery type and zzso 

The pelvic inlet was wider among 178 white women than 56 African-American women zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The outlet was also wider zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences between racial groups in zzso diameter, angle of the zzso arch, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, among women who delivered zzso without a zzso zzso African-American women had more pelvic floor mobility than white zzso This difference was not observed among women who had sustained an zzso zzso zzso 

White women have a wider pelvic zzso wider outlet, and zzso zzso outlet than African-American zzso In addition, after zzso delivery, white women demonstrate less pelvic floor zzso These differences may contribute to observed racial differences in zzso outcomes and to the development of pelvic floor zzso
