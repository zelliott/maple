The authors analyzed the characteristics of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso PET to compare the zzso of these zzso in making the distinction between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence of high-grade zzso 

Ten patients were evaluated with dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso PET and zzso PET to zzso zzso zzso during the zzso follow-up zzso In the zzso zzso four regions of interest zzso were identified and average values were zzso A reference zzso of the same size was defined in the zzso white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume zzso After zzso the PET images with the zzso we measured the maximum zzso values of the zzso and of the zzso cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the zzso zzso 

The zzso was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group zzso There was no difference between groups in terms of the zzso ratio as derived from the zzso and zzso zzso 

A quantitative zzso as calculated from a zzso zzso scan might be superior to the zzso ratio as derived from zzso and zzso PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade zzso from radiation zzso
