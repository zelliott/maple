An zzso zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso has been studied for tumor zzso based on its high zzso and long blood zzso The preparation procedures of the contrast agent have been modified in order to achieve higher yield and improve the synthetic zzso High zzso of zzso has been confirmed by zzso at 3 zzso 7 T and zzso T magnetic zzso The zzso zzso binding study indicated that zzso partially bound to zzso zzso In zzso cell viability in zzso cell indicated low zzso of zzso up to zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso toxicity studies demonstrated no toxicity of zzso on kidney zzso up to zzso zzso zzso While the toxicity on liver tissue was not observed at low dosage zzso zzso zzso zzso cause certain damage on zzso tissue at high dosage zzso zzso zzso The zzso has been labeled with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso has high zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso tumors, and has high zzso in zzso zzso MR zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso tumor demonstrated that zzso could enhance vascular zzso around the zzso and displays promising characteristics of an zzso contrast agent for tumor zzso
