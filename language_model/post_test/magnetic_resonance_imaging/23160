zzso evaluation of image registration zzso is a difficult and zzso issue due to the lack of a reference standard in most registration zzso In this work a method is presented zzso detailed reference standard data may be constructed in an efficient zzso zzso A zzso set of zzso landmarks is detected fully automatically in one scan of a pair to be zzso Using a zzso zzso observers define corresponding zzso locations in the second scan for a specified subset of s of these zzso The remaining zzso landmarks are matched fully automatically by a zzso based system using the s manual landmark zzso to model the relationship between the zzso The method is applied to 47 pairs of zzso zzso CT scans, three pairs of brain MR scans and five zzso CT zzso with synthetic zzso zzso differences are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the matched zzso The utility of the reference standard data as a tool in evaluating registration is shown by the comparison of six sets of registration results on the 47 pairs of zzso CT zzso
