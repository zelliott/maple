To examine how general zzso memory, zzso and social zzso and interpersonal zzso zzso relate to measures of brain function and zzso 

zzso was used to identify general and social cognitive factors from Brain Resource International Database in zzso zzso The identified factors were correlated with each zzso corresponding brain structure zzso and function zzso zzso 

Seven core cognitive factors were identified for general and three for zzso General zzso was correlated with global zzso matter, while social zzso was zzso correlated with zzso matter in zzso zzso Executive function, information processing speed and verbal memory performance were correlated with zzso zzso while most general cognitive factors zzso correlated with beta zzso zzso information processing speed was correlated with alpha zzso Executive function and information processing speed was correlated with zzso zzso zzso and slower zzso zzso at frontal sites, but at zzso sites negative correlations were zzso 

In contrast to general zzso social zzso is identified by different functional zzso activity and more localized neural zzso Only general zzso requiring more zzso controlled processing is related to brain function measures, particularly in frontal zzso 

Recording measures from multiple zzso including zzso zzso social and general zzso within the same subject provides a method of brain profiling for use in zzso and pharmacological zzso
