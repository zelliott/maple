zzso zzso infection is a zzso disease and zzso is the natural intermediate zzso zzso date no zzso have described clinical signs in zzso indicative of brain involvement by zzso In the present study we describe such clinical signs of zzso zzso zzso These signs were excessive zzso excessive blinking and zzso and zzso zzso A total of 30 zzso (18 with 2 or all 3 clinical signs and 12 without any zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso All 18 zzso with above signs had zzso on zzso along with variable involvement of other zzso that were subsequently confirmed by ex zzso zzso zzso and zzso while none of the 12 animals without any sign had zzso As development of a zzso zzso model has proved difficult, we propose that naturally infected zzso can be identified on the basis of these clinical signs and thus used as a model for further research on zzso
