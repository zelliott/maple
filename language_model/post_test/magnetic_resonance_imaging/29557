The neural zzso of the previously hypothesized link between formal musical training and mathematics performance are investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso was performed on zzso normal adults, seven with musical training since early childhood, and eight without, while they mentally added and zzso zzso Musical training was associated with increased zzso in the left zzso zzso and prefrontal cortex, and decreased zzso in visual association areas and the left inferior zzso zzso during the mathematical zzso We zzso that the correlation between musical training and math proficiency may be associated with improved working memory performance and an increased abstract representation of zzso zzso
