zzso cardiovascular risk zzso in zzso liver transplantation candidates has proven challenging due to limitations of current zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso is zzso cumbersome and expensive given the need for separate zzso zzso and abdominal zzso We evaluated the feasibility of a zzso zzso in a magnetic resonance suite, performing assessment of cardiac structure, function, and zzso along with simultaneous evaluation of zzso zzso and liver zzso 

In this pilot study, patients underwent zzso free zzso sequences and stress cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging zzso on a standard zzso zzso zzso stress was performed using zzso zzso or zzso zzso was assessed using late zzso zzso 

Over 2 years, 51 of 77 liver transplant candidates zzso age, 56 years; zzso zzso mean Model for zzso Liver Disease score, zzso range, zzso underwent zzso All referred patients completed standard dynamic zzso zzso completed stress zzso zzso completed late zzso enhancement for zzso zzso completed liver zzso and zzso completed magnetic resonance zzso The mean duration of the entire study was 72 zzso and 45 patients were able to complete the entire zzso Among all 51 patients, 4 required follow-up coronary zzso (3 for evidence of zzso on zzso zzso and 1 for zzso zzso and none had zzso coronary zzso Nine proceeded to zzso liver transplantation zzso 74 days to transplantation after zzso There were six zzso zzso in the zzso group and one death in the transplanted zzso zzso pathology confirmed zzso zzso of zzso zzso No complications during zzso examination were zzso 

In this zzso study, it appears feasible to perform a comprehensive, efficient, and safe zzso liver transplant imaging in a zzso zzso one-stop shop, even in seriously ill zzso
