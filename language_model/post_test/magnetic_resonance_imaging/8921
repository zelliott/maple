zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in children is increasingly used in clinical application and in zzso research; however, little is known how pediatric patient and typically developing populations successfully complete zzso We examined pediatric success rates with zzso attention zzso disorder zzso zzso spectrum disorders zzso and typically developing children zzso We also examined the affect of age, and, for zzso zzso medication status on success zzso We defined a successful zzso individual run when the data were zzso and included in group zzso For unsuccessful runs, zzso with excessive motion or floor task performance were zzso when zzso All clinical groups scanned less successfully than zzso medication status did not affect zzso success zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten to 18-year-old had a significantly greater scan success rate than zzso to zzso adolescents zzso to zzso demonstrated greater scan success rates than 7- to zzso Success rate for completing an entire battery of experimental runs zzso zzso zzso varied between zzso for patient populations and zzso for zzso zzso when excluding zzso to zzso Success rate for completing one run from a battery was greater than zzso for all groups, except for zzso zzso These data suggest zzso more children should be recruited in these patient groups, but only zzso for zzso for research zzso Studies with zzso to zzso may require zzso additional zzso studies with zzso to zzso may require zzso additional zzso
