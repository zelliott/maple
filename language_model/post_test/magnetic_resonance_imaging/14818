To compare the accuracy of a zzso zzso resonance frequency shift zzso zzso mapping interface and an alternative qualitative zzso zzso model in predicting tissue necrosis in an established routine setting of zzso laser zzso in the human zzso 

34 cases of zzso zzso laser zzso were zzso matched with 34 cases from an earlier patient population of 73 individuals being monitored through zzso magnitude image evaluation zzso zzso The zzso real-time zzso of zzso zzso impact (above 54 zzso zone and zzso signal loss, zzso was correlated in size with the resulting necrosis as shown by lack of enhancement on the zzso contrast exam zzso zzso groups were compared using the zzso zzso 

Online zzso guidance was available in 33 of 34 zzso Positive size correlation between calculated impact zone and contrast zzso at first day was evident in both groups zzso zzso zzso The zzso error zzso necrosis was median zzso zzso 1 zzso in the zzso group and 61 % zzso zzso in the zzso magnitude zzso zzso in zzso lethal impact were significant zzso zzso zzso whereas the real extent of zzso necrosis showed no significant difference zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso 

zzso zzso is feasible in a clinical setting of zzso zzso tumor zzso As an zzso zzso for online therapy monitoring its accuracy to predict tissue necrosis is superior to a competing model of zzso induced zzso of the zzso magnitude zzso
