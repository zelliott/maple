An unusual case with absence and zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso bodies leading to a severe zzso zzso is zzso zzso neurological deterioration occurred due to spinal zzso zzso which was treated with anterior zzso Although several mechanisms for the development of these extensive and rare abnormalities have been proposed, the cause in humans remains zzso An zzso basis is presented in the light of recent advances in molecular zzso which show that abnormal zzso signals and zzso gene expression can produce an experimental zzso very similar to the one in the patient described zzso Thus it is suggested that faults in these early zzso processes may be, at least in part, responsible for the development of such extensive zzso
