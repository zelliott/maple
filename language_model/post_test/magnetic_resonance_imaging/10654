From zzso we treated 58 patients with multiple sclerosis zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes prolonged T zzso zzso Clinical and surrogate markers of inflammation were zzso In both the zzso zzso and secondary progressive zzso stages of the illness, zzso reduced the annual zzso rate (from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso both p zzso zzso zzso zzso scans of patients with SP disease, treated with zzso 7 years zzso showed no new zzso zzso However, despite these effects on zzso disability was differently affected depending on the phase of the zzso Patients with zzso showed sustained zzso of disability due to uncontrolled progression marked by unrelenting cerebral zzso attributable to ongoing zzso zzso The rate of cerebral zzso was greatest in patients with established cerebral zzso and highest inflammatory zzso burden before treatment zzso versus zzso zzso p zzso zzso In contrast, patients with zzso disease showed an impressive reduction in disability at 6 months after zzso (by a mean of zzso zzso points) perhaps zzso to a suppression of zzso inflammation in these patients with unusually active zzso In addition, there was a further zzso albeit smaller, mean improvement in disability up to 36 months after zzso We speculate that this represents the beneficial effects of early rescue of zzso and zzso from a toxic inflammatory environment, and that prevention of zzso will prevent long-term zzso zzso These concepts are currently being tested in a controlled trial comparing zzso and zzso in the treatment of zzso patients with early, active zzso zzso
