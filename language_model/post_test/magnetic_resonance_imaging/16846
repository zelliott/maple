zzso zzso a soluble member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso is linked to cardiovascular zzso zzso associations exist between circulating zzso and cardiac zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and coronary artery disease and shows an inverse correlation with insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular disease zzso We assessed the relationship of plasma zzso and zzso and zzso function, cardiac function and zzso zzso metabolism in zzso 

We included 78 zzso men with zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso assessed by zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso zzso function was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, zzso zzso metabolism zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured in zzso 

zzso patients zzso controls showed lower zzso zzso left zzso zzso volumes, impaired zzso zzso function and zzso (all P zzso zzso In zzso men zzso controls, zzso levels were higher zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso volumes and zzso ratio zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso ratio (all P zzso zzso zzso analyses showed the associations with zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio to be independent of zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the associations with zzso volumes and zzso ratio were dependent of these zzso zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso which, in multiple zzso analysis, was dependent of zzso insulin sensitivity, zzso and zzso 

zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso volumes and zzso zzso function, while zzso was positively associated with zzso These findings indicate that in zzso men with uncomplicated zzso zzso and zzso may be markers of underlying mechanisms linking the diabetic state to cardiac zzso
