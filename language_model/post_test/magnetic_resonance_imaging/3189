The zzso zzso was zzso with MR using an internal zzso to demonstrate its zzso contrast enhancement patterns, and appearance in zzso 

A zzso zzso geometry zzso was placed in the zzso zzso Sixteen volunteers and 18 patients were zzso Imaging was performed on a zzso T zzso Asset zzso scanner in all the volunteers and nine patients and on a zzso T zzso zzso Vista in nine zzso Then zzso and zzso SE, zzso GE and STIR images zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso images parallel to the zzso in the zzso zzso plane were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was given to 2 normal subjects for dynamic studies and 10 patients for conventional zzso zzso 

The coils were easy to insert and well tolerated and provided high spatial zzso The internal zzso had a higher signal intensity than the external zzso on all sequences but particularly on STIR zzso zzso contrast enhancement of the internal zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso tracks were identified in three patients and confirmed at zzso zzso defects were seen in three patients with past zzso zzso and these were also confirmed at zzso zzso zzso was seen in three patients with idiopathic zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso with an internal zzso provides excellent zzso of normal anatomy and may be of considerable value in zzso
