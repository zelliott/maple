To determine if changes in the concentration of zzso compounds zzso from before primary systemic therapy zzso to within 24 hours after the first treatment enable prediction of clinical response in patients with locally advanced breast zzso 

Sixteen women with zzso locally advanced breast cancer scheduled to undergo zzso zzso were zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging and zzso were performed at 4 T prior to treatment, within 24 hours after the first dose, and after the fourth zzso zzso size was assessed by using zzso MR zzso zzso zzso concentration was zzso by using zzso hydrogen 1 MR zzso zzso analysis was performed by using the zzso correlation zzso and the zzso rank sum zzso 

Fourteen of 16 patients completed the zzso In one patient, the level of zzso was not measurable because of zzso zzso zzso for MR zzso zzso zzso Of the remaining 13 patients, four had inflammatory breast cancer, six had invasive zzso zzso two had invasive zzso zzso and one had mixed invasive zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso eight of 13 patients had an objective response and five had no zzso The change in concentration of zzso from baseline to within 24 hours after the first dose of zzso showed significant positive correlation with the change in zzso size (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso Change in zzso concentration within 24 hours after first dose was significantly different between patients with objective response and those with no response zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the change in zzso concentration between baseline and 24 hours after the first dose of zzso can serve as an indicator for predicting clinical response to zzso chemotherapy in locally advanced breast zzso
