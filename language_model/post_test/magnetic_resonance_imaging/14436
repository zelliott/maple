We describe an analysis of 227 patients with zzso zzso 177 were zzso and the remaining 50 were zzso The group comprised zzso of all zzso with cerebrovascular pathology and zzso of all consecutive zzso with brain zzso studied at the Department of zzso of the Hospital de la Santa zzso i Sant zzso The main risk factors identified in these patients were zzso hypertension in zzso zzso diabetes zzso in 64 zzso and heart disease in 58 zzso The most common clinical syndromes were pure motor zzso in 125 zzso pure zzso stroke in 42 zzso the zzso deficit syndrome in 34 zzso zzso zzso in seven zzso and the zzso hand syndrome in four zzso zzso syndromes were observed in 15 patients zzso zzso were demonstrated by zzso zzso in 100 patients zzso and by magnetic resonance imaging in 35 zzso of the 45 patients in which it was zzso zzso resonance imaging was significantly better zzso less than zzso than zzso zzso for imaging zzso especially those located in either the zzso zzso less than zzso or the internal capsule zzso less than zzso After the acute phase, mild or no zzso disability was detected in 178 patients zzso moderate disability persisted in 48 patients zzso and severe disability was recorded in one case zzso zzso zzso are a clearly defined entity with characteristic clinical features and an excellent short-term zzso zzso resonance imaging is the current method of choice for demonstrating these small brain zzso
