Our study aimed to correlate the dynamic zzso MR appearance of zzso zzso zzso of the breast with zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed the zzso zzso and dynamic zzso MR images of 13 of 20 women diagnosed with zzso proven zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Twelve of the 13 women presented with breast symptoms and underwent zzso Five of the women also had breast zzso MR imaging was performed for evaluation of disease extent before the patients underwent modified radical mastectomy zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Three experienced zzso reviewed the MR zzso The tumor pattern types described on imaging were correlated with a detailed analysis of the zzso 

We found three patterns of zzso zzso zzso on MR zzso The tumor pattern on imaging correlated with zzso tumor zzso We found the following patterns of zzso zzso zzso a solitary mass with irregular margins zzso zzso 4) that corresponded to the same appearance at zzso multiple zzso either connected by enhancing strands zzso zzso 6) or separated by zzso intervening tissue zzso zzso zzso that correlated with the zzso appearance of zzso tumor zzso with zzso cells streaming in zzso fashion in the breast zzso or small tumor zzso separated by normal zzso and enhancing zzso only, which were correlated with the zzso appearance of tumor cells streaming in the breast zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may be detected on MR imaging as solitary or multiple zzso that zzso to tumor zzso on zzso zzso The appearance of multiple zzso or of enhancing zzso breast elements on MR imaging is suggestive of zzso zzso zzso
