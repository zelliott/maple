The peripheral zzso zzso zzso is zzso on activated zzso and zzso and thereby is a useful zzso of zzso We developed a novel PET zzso zzso that was able to image and zzso zzso in healthy monkeys and in a rat model of zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of zzso to zzso zzso in brain of healthy human zzso Twelve subjects had PET scans of 120 to 180 zzso duration as well as serial sampling of zzso plasma to measure the concentration of unchanged parent zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were zzso To obtain stable estimates of distribution volume, which is a zzso of zzso and zzso activity, 90 zzso of brain imaging was zzso Distribution volumes in human were only approximately zzso of those in zzso This comparatively low amount of zzso binding required a zzso than a zzso model, suggesting that zzso binding was a zzso percentage compared to specific zzso The zzso zzso in two of the twelve subjects appeared as if they had no zzso zzso rapid peak of zzso and fast zzso from zzso The zzso of these unusual findings are unknown, but both subjects were also found to lack binding to zzso in peripheral zzso such as lung and zzso In conclusion, with the exception of those subjects who appeared to have no zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso to zzso zzso and zzso inflammation associated with increased zzso of zzso
