We evaluated the zzso and zzso relationships between changes in zzso MR image signal intensity, induced by unilateral zzso of the middle cerebral artery in zzso and tissue zzso deficits observed in the same animals on zzso MR images after administration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images obtained with strong zzso zzso strengths zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso factor, zzso values of zzso zzso displayed increased signal intensity in the zzso middle cerebral artery territory less than 1 zzso after zzso whereas zzso images without contrast usually failed to detect injury for 2-3 zzso after zzso After contrast administration zzso zzso by zzso zzso however, zzso images revealed zzso deficits zzso zzso within 1 zzso after middle cerebral artery zzso that corresponded closely to the zzso regions of zzso injury shown on zzso MR zzso Close correlations were also found between early increases in zzso MR image signal intensity and disrupted zzso and zzso zzso levels evaluated with surface zzso MR zzso as well as with zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso MR images more accurately reflect zzso zzso changes induced by acute cerebral zzso than do zzso zzso zzso
