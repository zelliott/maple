In this investigation, we compare two-dimensional zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso imaging of the brain to an zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso technique that uses a modulated zzso flip angle echo train and parallel imaging with zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso sequences were obtained in 16 zzso All examinations were performed on a 3 zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso artifacts within the zzso space and zzso were scored using a 4-point zzso For zzso and zzso zzso the zzso ratios and zzso ratios were zzso 

Compared to zzso zzso the zzso zzso images were less zzso by flow artifacts in the zzso space and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the qualitative imaging zzso zzso ratios and zzso ratios were higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all variables when compared with zzso zzso zzso 

The acquisition time for whole brain zzso fast spin echo zzso zzso can be dramatically reduced by using an extended echo train with flip angle zzso and parallel zzso The zzso zzso inversion pulse encompasses the entire volume and provides uniform suppression of the zzso fluid signal eliminating zzso fluid zzso zzso Other advantages include zzso in any desired plane, volume zzso displays of surface zzso and zzso
