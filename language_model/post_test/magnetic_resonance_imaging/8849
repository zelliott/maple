The neural mechanisms zzso recognition of noxious stimuli and empathy for pain appear to involve at least in part the cortical regions associated with the processing of pain zzso An important issue concerns the specificity of brain networks associated with observing and representing painful conditions, in comparison with other unpleasant zzso Recently, we found both similarities and differences between the brain patterns of activity related to the observation of noxious or disgusting stimuli delivered to one hand or zzso zzso regions included the zzso anterior zzso zzso whose activity was related to the perceived zzso We aimed here at revealing how zzso functional connectivity changes in relationship to the different experimental conditions, using a zzso interaction zzso zzso in zzso during the observation of painful stimuli was specifically and positively related to regions in the right hemisphere, including portions of the zzso zzso and insular zzso On the other hand, positive changes in zzso connectivity during the vision of disgusting stimuli were present in the right zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso activity is part of different networks involved in the recognition of painful or disgusting zzso
