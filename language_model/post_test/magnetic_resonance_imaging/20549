zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a valuable tool for the investigation of pharmacological effects of a drug on pain zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso in line with its characteristic zzso properties, may influence the zzso response at the central level, as compared to zzso Ten healthy subjects underwent a zzso zzso randomized, zzso zzso study with zzso painful stimulation of the right median zzso We measured the blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal variations induced in conditions of pain after oral administration of either zzso or zzso zzso Independent component analysis zzso was used for the analysis of the zzso data, without assuming a specific zzso response function zzso which may be altered by drug zzso Median nerve electrical painful stimulation mainly activated the primary zzso and the secondary zzso zzso the zzso the supplementary motor area, and the middle frontal zzso zzso and zzso administration induced zzso zzso in the zzso cortex, and an overall reduction in the other zzso areas, which was more prominent in the left zzso A zzso increase of zzso signal between drug and zzso was observed zzso in the primary zzso area and the middle frontal zzso without any changes in zzso pain zzso Overall, our findings show that zzso in line with the characteristic zzso properties of zzso influences the zzso response in specific zzso brain areas with respect to zzso with a zzso effect possibly due to zzso
