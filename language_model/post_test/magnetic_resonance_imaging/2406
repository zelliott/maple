The sensitivity of MR imaging for detection of pulmonary zzso was evaluated in 23 zzso The MR imaging was performed with zzso zzso zzso sequences at zzso zzso The MR images were compared with spiral zzso CT which served as the zzso zzso All MR images were interpreted by two zzso without knowledge of CT zzso The MR imaging technique initially enabled correct identification of altogether zzso of 340 zzso zzso zzso resulting in sensitivities of 36 % zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso 83 % zzso of zzso zzso zzso 92 % zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 100 % zzso of zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso with knowledge of CT findings an additional 39 zzso were zzso 15 remained zzso even zzso The results of this paper suggest that zzso still does not have a role for screening for pulmonary zzso It zzso however, that the incidental diagnosis of a pulmonary zzso on zzso zzso images is highly reliable in representing a pulmonary zzso also visible on zzso However, thus far the zzso nature especially of small zzso detected by zzso (as by zzso remains uncertain even in patients with known zzso zzso
