We investigated the relationship of zzso dysfunction type and the zzso site in patients with multiple zzso 

zzso dysfunction was evaluated in 32 patients with multiple sclerosis using the International zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites were determined by combined neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Compared with reports from Western countries the ratio of zzso symptoms was high in zzso Of urinary symptoms only filling correlated with disability status and disease zzso zzso symptoms were not related to zzso zzso zzso evaluation revealed zzso zzso in 14 of 32 patients, zzso or zzso in 12, zzso zzso with impaired zzso function in 4, a low compliance zzso in 1 and normal function in zzso Of 14 patients with zzso 13 had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in 2 patients who had zzso zzso with impaired zzso and in 1 with a low compliance zzso A significant correlation was noted for a zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for a cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso are indicative of a zzso and cervical spinal zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso site in the central nervous system may be a major zzso of the type of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The high prevalence of zzso symptoms in Japanese patients may reflect the prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
