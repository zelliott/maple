zzso is essential in the zzso of patients with intractable zzso In pediatric patients with medically zzso zzso cortical zzso account for a large percentage of the zzso zzso Unfortunately, these are also the most subtle zzso to zzso For this reason, there has been ongoing interest in utilizing new advanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques to improve the ability to zzso zzso zzso and delineate cortical zzso zzso gains such as zzso coils (32 phased array and zzso and higher field strengths zzso zzso and zzso coupled with newer imaging sequences such as zzso spin labeling zzso zzso weighted imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso are likely to increase zzso zzso zzso techniques coupled with a zzso approach including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other techniques will increase sensitivity and specificity for identifying cortical zzso
