To establish zzso data for the size, zzso and imaging characteristics of normal developing fetal sheep zzso on ultrasound zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

US and MR images of ten normal pregnant zzso at 40, 65, 90, zzso and 140 zzso days zzso zzso 145 zzso were scored for organ zzso and imaging zzso Imaging zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso growth parameters were modeled using zzso 

Imaging zzso showed excellent correlation with zzso zzso zzso stomach, zzso liver, and spine were seen well from 65 days to term by zzso More zzso were consistently visible from 90 days to term by MR than by zzso Most organ imaging characteristics tended not to change throughout zzso 

zzso fetal sheep zzso organ zzso and imaging characteristics are established for US and MR and have potential use for the in zzso assessment of sheep models of zzso zzso
