We sought to determine the prevalence of zzso pathology in a large consecutive series of patients referred for clinical cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The imaging field for many zzso sequences extends outside of the heart zzso As a result, zzso pathology may be zzso These zzso findings have clinical significance because they often lead to subsequent zzso and zzso The prevalence of zzso findings on clinical zzso studies has not been well zzso 

The reports of all zzso zzso male, age 50 zzso 15 zzso clinical zzso studies performed at an academic medical center during calendar years 2002 to 2006 were zzso All studies had been interpreted by both a staff zzso zzso III trained in zzso and a zzso zzso (with fellowship training in zzso For each study, sex, age, indication for zzso study, and reported zzso pathology were zzso zzso for each major zzso pathology was evaluated by reviewing the patient's medical center electronic medical zzso These zzso zzso were then zzso as significant if an intervention or change in the patient's management zzso 

A total of 116 zzso studies had at least one zzso zzso These findings included 55 major findings zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso in 48 distinct reports zzso of zzso and 74 minor findings zzso small zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso in 70 distinct reports zzso of zzso The majority zzso of major findings were previously known, with only 8 findings in 6 zzso of zzso reports ultimately deemed to be new and clinically zzso The age of those with zzso pathology was greater (54 zzso 16 years zzso 49 zzso 16 years, p zzso zzso 

In this large series of consecutive clinical zzso studies interpreted by both staff zzso and zzso zzso pathology is uncommonly zzso When reported, the majority of major findings are previously zzso New major findings were detected in zzso of zzso
