zzso zzso relaxation zzso offer specific information about zzso content through the zzso water fraction zzso as well as about the water environments through the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso geometric mean zzso zzso zzso While these zzso have yielded new insights into brain development and zzso they have yet to be thoroughly investigated in the spinal zzso The goals of this study were: zzso to apply a new zzso zzso zzso relaxation measurement in the cervical spine with sufficient zzso resolution to distinguish zzso and white zzso zzso to perform a pilot reliability assessment of the resulting zzso and zzso measures in a target population; and zzso to detect differences in these measures between a younger cohort zzso years of zzso and an older cohort zzso years of zzso of healthy zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso in younger healthy adults follows the known pattern of lower zzso content in zzso matter zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso as compared to white matter zzso zzso zzso The reliability zzso were zzso and zzso for the zzso in the zzso zzso and lateral column zzso white matter, zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for the global zzso zzso lower zzso were found in the older adults than in the younger adults zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as lower zzso zzso times zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the global zzso times did not show any zzso These changes in zzso and zzso zzso times, but not in global zzso times, indicate that zzso zzso relaxation measures are sensitive to changes in zzso integrity and cell zzso that may not be apparent on conventional zzso weighted zzso
