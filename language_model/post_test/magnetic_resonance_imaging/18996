zzso still exists in the literature as to the significance of the high-intensity zone zzso demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a potential pain indicator in patients with low back zzso A prospective blind study was therefore conducted to evaluate the zzso disc high-intensity zone with the pain provocation response of zzso zzso zzso patients with low back pain unresponsive to conservative treatment and being considered for spinal fusion were subjected to zzso followed by zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso was blinded to the results of the zzso zzso We used the zzso test to zzso our zzso zzso zzso were identified in 73 patients, mainly occurring at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlation was found between abnormal disc zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso abnormal discs zzso 3, 4 and zzso there was a significant correlation between the zzso and exact or similar pain reproduction zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, specificity and positive zzso value for pain reproduction were high, at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The nature of the zzso remains unknown, but it may represent an area of secondary inflammation as a result of an zzso zzso We conclude from our study that the zzso disc zzso observed on zzso in patients with low back pain is likely to represent painful internal disc zzso
