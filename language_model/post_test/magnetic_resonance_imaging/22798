zzso complex is a zzso of zzso anomalies of the zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso However, zzso rotation alone may be zzso The aim of this study was to describe our experience with zzso prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of rotation of the zzso in cases of suspected enlarged zzso magna on routine zzso imaging, and to describe the follow-up of these zzso 

Seven women, who were referred to our ultrasound unit for evaluation of an enlarged fetal zzso magna and suspected zzso of the zzso on zzso imaging, underwent further zzso studies of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso 

The mean maternal age was 27 zzso zzso years and the mean zzso age at diagnosis was zzso zzso zzso zzso The standard zzso plane image showed a zzso zzso between the zzso magna and the fourth zzso In the zzso plane, the zzso was clearly zzso with zzso zzso zzso size was within normal limits for zzso age in all zzso zzso were confirmed by prenatal magnetic resonance imaging zzso in two cases and zzso zzso and/or zzso in zzso During a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso years, all children developed zzso with no neurological zzso 

The finding of an enlarged zzso magna on zzso zzso ultrasound should be evaluated further in the zzso plane to determine whether the cause is rotation of a normal zzso This may spare patients unnecessary tests, anxiety and, in some cases, pregnancy zzso
