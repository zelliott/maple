Image interpretation consists in finding a correspondence between zzso information and symbolic labeling with respect to specific spatial zzso It is zzso a distributed process in terms of goals to be reached, zones in the image to be processed and methods to be zzso To cope the the difficulty inherent in this process, several information processing steps are required to gradually extract zzso In this paper we advocate the use of situated cooperative agents as a framework for managing such zzso Dedicated agent behaviors are zzso adapted depending on their position in the image, of their zzso relationships and of the zzso information zzso The information collected by the agents is gathered, shared via qualitative zzso or used as soon as available by zzso zzso refinement of interpretation is obtained through a coarse to fine zzso Our work is essentially focused on zzso tissue interpretation where knowledge is introduced or extracted at several levels to estimate models for zzso distribution and to cope with noise, intensity zzso and partial volume zzso Several experiments on phantom and real images were zzso A complete volume can be segmented in less than 5 zzso with about zzso accuracy of the segmented zzso zzso with other techniques demonstrates the potential interest of our approach for magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain scan zzso
