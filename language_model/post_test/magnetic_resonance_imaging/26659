zzso cortical zzso are known to respond to visual zzso zzso Many human zzso and functional imaging studies examining biological motion perception have used treadmill walking, in contrast to previous zzso zzso zzso We assessed the coding of locomotion in zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso using movies of stationary zzso varying both form and motion zzso different facing zzso or varying only the frame sequence zzso forward vs backward zzso The majority of superior zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso were selective for facing direction, whereas a minority distinguished forward from backward zzso Support zzso machines using the zzso cortical population responses as input classified facing direction well, but forward and backward walking less zzso zzso performance for the latter improved markedly when the zzso response zzso was considered, reflecting differences in momentary body poses within the locomotion zzso zzso to zzso pose presentations predicted the responses during the course of the zzso zzso of the responses to walking sequences wherein the start frame was varied across trials showed that some zzso also carried a snapshot sequence zzso Such sequence information was present in zzso that responded to zzso snapshot presentations and in zzso that required zzso Our data suggest that actions are analyzed by zzso cortical zzso using distinct zzso Most zzso predominantly signal momentary zzso In addition, zzso cortical zzso including those responding to zzso pose, are sensitive to pose zzso which can contribute to the signaling of learned action zzso
