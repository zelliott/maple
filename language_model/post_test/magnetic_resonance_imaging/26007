The authors examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administered IM each week on the evolution of monthly zzso transfer ratio zzso within new zzso zzso zzso in patients with very early zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is an effective zzso treatment for patients with zzso Among other effects, it has been shown to decrease the number of new zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a putative marker for irreversible tissue damage and evolution of zzso within a zzso may reflect recovery of tissue zzso It is not known whether zzso affects the recovery phase of zzso 

Eight zzso patients with zzso who completed up to 14 monthly brain zzso sessions elected to initiate treatment with zzso Four out of eight patients developed new zzso zzso during zzso zzso of zzso at the time of appearance and subsequent rate of change of monthly zzso were compared before and after treatment zzso zzso zzso 

The difference between zzso at appearance of 47 new zzso zzso before treatment versus 23 new zzso zzso during treatment was not zzso Twenty-two of 47 new zzso zzso before treatment and 11 of 23 new zzso zzso after treatment were monitored for up to 6 zzso After appearance of new zzso zzso the rate of increase in zzso was faster during therapy zzso zzso zzso 

zzso abnormalities within new zzso zzso evolve at a faster rate during treatment with zzso than before initiating zzso This is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso promotes resolution of new zzso zzso
