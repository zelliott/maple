We report the structural zzso and zzso investigation of a series of zzso magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents that transform from low zzso to high zzso in the presence of zzso The change in zzso results from a structural transformation of the complex that alters the coordination environment about the zzso zzso Here, we have performed a series of systematic modifications to determine the structure that provides the optimal change in zzso in response to the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso were used in conjunction with zzso regarding water access zzso number of water molecules zzso to the zzso center and zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine how the coordination environment about the zzso center is affected by the distance between the zzso domain and the zzso zzso the number of functional groups on the zzso domain, and the presence of zzso The results of this study provide valuable insight into the design principles for future zzso magnetic resonance zzso
