At the onset of West syndrome a specific impairment of visual function has been clearly demonstrated, while other aspects of zzso development, and in particular of the auditory function, have been less zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate auditory function and zzso responses at the onset of West syndrome, and to relate the results with zzso patterns, visual function and zzso zzso A prospective zzso study was performed on 25 successively enrolled infants with West zzso all the patients underwent a full clinical assessment, including zzso and zzso visual function and auditory zzso responses zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The whole assessment performed at the onset of spasms zzso was repeated after two months zzso zzso resulted significantly impaired both at zzso and zzso At the onset of spasms a highly significant relationship of auditory attention with visual function and zzso competence was shown in both zzso and symptomatic forms, but it was no longer present after two zzso Our results may suggest a possible pervasive effect of the zzso disorder on sensory processing, associated to a deficit of zzso Although we failed to show a significant correlation between auditory zzso responses and zzso patterns, some evidence seems to support at least partially an influence of the zzso disorder per zzso on the genesis of the zzso zzso A longer follow up and a larger cohort will be useful for a better clarification of these zzso
