The objective of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of ex zzso high-resolution zzso zzso to accurately zzso human coronary zzso plaques according to the American Heart Association zzso 

Thirteen human zzso heart specimens were zzso using high-resolution zzso MR technique zzso zzso zzso and zzso All MR images were matched with zzso sections according to the landmark of the zzso of the left main coronary zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso for the zzso of plaques were determined, and Cohen's zzso analysis was applied to evaluate the agreement between zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso MR zzso images obtained perpendicular to the long axis of the zzso left anterior descending artery were successfully matched with the zzso zzso For the zzso of zzso the sensitivity and specificity of zzso were as zzso type zzso (near zzso zzso and zzso type III zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type VI zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso and type VIII zzso without zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which indicates zzso composition on zzso was detected on zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso for plaque zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso high-resolution zzso zzso can accurately zzso advanced zzso plaques in human coronary zzso
