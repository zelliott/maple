The role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso planning for women diagnosed with breast cancer remains zzso The risks and benefits in women with newly diagnosed zzso zzso in zzso zzso are largely zzso 

zzso chart review comparing women treated for zzso who did and did not undergo zzso for zzso zzso End points included number of additional zzso prompted by zzso surgical zzso rates, weight of zzso mastectomy rates, and conversion to mastectomy after attempted breast zzso 

218 patients met study zzso zzso patients did not undergo zzso zzso and 154 patients zzso There was no statistically significant difference zzso zzso not zzso zzso in zzso rates between the zzso % zzso of women who did and zzso zzso zzso women who did not undergo zzso Despite use of zzso zzso zzso women zzso zzso were converted to mastectomy due to positive margins compared with zzso zzso zzso in the women who did not undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso In women undergoing zzso average weight of zzso at definitive surgery was zzso zzso while in women who did not undergo zzso average weight of zzso at definitive surgery was zzso zzso 

Our data show that zzso does not significantly decrease zzso rates or conversion to mastectomy after attempted zzso zzso Based on our findings, we do not believe zzso zzso adds benefit to the care of this patient zzso Prospective trials are necessary to further investigate the risks and benefits of zzso zzso in women with zzso
