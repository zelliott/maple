zzso zzso acquisition of data was used to decrease the acquisition time and to increase the imaging resolution of the precise and accurate inversion recovery zzso method of measuring zzso We validated the new zzso method by measuring zzso in 158 regions of interest in 12 volunteers, using both zzso and zzso We found a zzso difference between methods, which could be corrected by linear zzso After zzso the zzso method was used to test a hypothesis that there is significant regional zzso in cortical zzso We measured cortical gray matter zzso in 11 right-handed volunteers, in 48 regions of interest scattered over frontal and zzso cortex, and in 46 zzso along the central zzso zzso We found that zzso in the zzso is less than zzso elsewhere in the zzso zzso and that there is considerable zzso asymmetry in zzso in gray matter, but not in white zzso In central gray structures zzso thalamus, nucleus zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso was significantly greater than left zzso zzso zzso or zzso In cortical gray matter of the frontal lobe and anterior zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso was significantly greater than right zzso zzso zzso or zzso These findings demonstrate that there is considerable regional zzso in human cortical zzso that is unexplained by differences in tissue iron content, but may be evidence of an inherent zzso asymmetry of the zzso
