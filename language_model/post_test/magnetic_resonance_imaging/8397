The development of a quantifiable and zzso method of monitoring disease activity and response to therapy is vital for arthritis zzso 

The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of quantitative dynamic zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso modeling to evaluate disease activity in the knee and correlate the results with the clinical assessment in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso 

A group of 17 children with zzso underwent zzso clinical and laboratory assessment and zzso of the knee at enrollment, 3 months, and 12 zzso A zzso model was employed using zzso signal enhancement data to give three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to calculate zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso volumes, and clinical and laboratory assessments in most children were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso at 12 months when compared to the enrollment zzso There was excellent correlation between the zzso and zzso volume and the clinical and laboratory zzso zzso in MR and clinical zzso values in individual subjects illustrate persistent zzso when in clinical zzso 

A decrease in zzso zzso values obtained from zzso in children with zzso likely reflects diminution of disease zzso This technique may be used as an objective follow-up measure of therapeutic efficacy in patients with zzso MR imaging can detect persistent zzso in patients considered to be in clinical zzso
