zzso the pattern of zzso density across the cerebral cortex, has long been zzso in zzso sections to identify distinct anatomical areas of the zzso In humans, two-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been used to zzso zzso in select areas of the cortex, such as the stripe of zzso in the primary visual zzso and zzso zzso in the primary auditory zzso Here, we investigated the use of zzso contrast based on zzso relaxation time zzso to zzso zzso in zzso over the entire zzso of the common zzso zzso zzso a small zzso zzso that is becoming increasingly important in zzso and zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso zzso we found that zzso at zzso in a cortical region with a high zzso content was zzso shorter than zzso in a region with a low zzso zzso To maximize this zzso contrast for imaging cortical zzso patterns, we zzso a zzso rapidly acquired zzso echo zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso images made in zzso with the zzso we identified six major cortical areas with high zzso and confirmed the results with zzso sections stained for zzso We also identified several subtle features of zzso showing the sensitivity of our zzso The ability to image zzso over the entire zzso may prove useful in studies of zzso changes of the topography of the zzso associated with development and zzso zzso as well as for guiding and confirming the location of functional zzso
