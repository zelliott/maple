zzso zzso with zzso placement zzso is an optional treatment for significant carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso representing the reserve capacity of cerebral zzso usually decreases in patients with severe carotid zzso This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the baseline zzso assessed by functional MR imaging zzso and the changes in cerebral blood flow zzso after zzso 

Fourteen patients with at least zzso unilateral carotid zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso a under zzso zzso zzso was assessed by dynamic zzso zzso MR imaging before and 3-5 days after zzso The lateral index zzso was defined as zzso - zzso zzso zzso + zzso where zzso and L represent the number of activated zzso in zzso on the normal and zzso zzso zzso 

No subject had clinical evidence of zzso zzso The zzso represented baseline zzso Patients were divided into normal zzso zzso 0, zzso zzso 6) and impaired zzso zzso 0, zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso The zzso on the normal and zzso sides was calculated zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side after zzso was significantly higher in the impaired zzso group than that in the normal zzso group zzso zzso zzso There was a significantly positive correlation between zzso impairment and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could be a zzso tool in evaluating zzso After zzso early zzso changes on the zzso side are more prominent in patients with impaired zzso zzso zzso might predict early zzso increase after zzso
