To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso for patients with psychiatric disorders and to develop a new method of mapping zzso location in anterior zzso zzso that takes into account the significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso recording were used to guide placement of zzso zzso in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso zzso zzso or affective disorders zzso zzso zzso zzso improvement was evaluated with the zzso zzso zzso in 15 of the 21 obsessive-compulsive disorder patients zzso From the zzso zzso scans, we developed a coordinate system for position in the anterior zzso zzso The zzso line passes from the most anterior point of the corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso to the most zzso zzso zzso zzso We reconstructed the zzso onto a zzso map from the zzso and zzso zzso using the distance along the zzso line and the distance above the upper surface of the corpus zzso 

The location of zzso activity distinguished gray and white matter and was useful in zzso the upper and lower cortical banks of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the corpus zzso This information was used to place the zzso zzso typically were 6 to 8 zzso in diameter on zzso zzso zzso The inferior margins were along the corpus zzso from c zzso 16 to c zzso zzso Four of 15 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder had a documented decrease of more than zzso on the zzso zzso zzso but only one patient had a sustained benefit for more than 1 zzso 

zzso recording is useful for zzso zzso Our system for reporting location in anterior zzso zzso zzso for differences in zzso zzso These techniques may aid future zzso
