zzso X zzso zzso is caused by the expansion of a single zzso gene sequence zzso on the X zzso and is a leading cause of learning disability zzso zzso zzso Relatively few studies, however, have examined the zzso abnormalities associated with zzso Of those that are available many included mixed gender zzso combined zzso children and adults into one sample, and employed manual tracing techniques which measures bulk volume of particular zzso zzso there is relatively little information on differences in zzso and white matter content across whole zzso We employed magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain anatomy in 17 adult males with zzso and 18 healthy controls that did not differ significantly in zzso Data were zzso using zzso and zzso to compare zzso regional brain bulk volume, and zzso zzso matter zzso Using zzso we found that zzso males had a significant increase in bulk volume zzso of the zzso nucleus and zzso zzso and of the right zzso but a significant decrease in volume of the left frontal zzso Our complimentary zzso analysis revealed an increased volume of zzso matter in zzso regions (including zzso in the zzso zzso and increased white matter in regions extending from the zzso to the zzso zzso and from the left zzso zzso extending into the corpus zzso People with zzso have regionally specific differences in brain anatomy from healthy controls with enlargement of the zzso zzso that persists into zzso
