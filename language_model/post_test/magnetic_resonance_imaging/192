We have previously reported sustained zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso while participants prepared to perform 1 of 2 tasks as zzso But there are studies that have reported zzso reflecting task rules elsewhere in prefrontal cortex, and this is true in particular when it was left to the participants to decide which rule to zzso The aim of the present experiment was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to find whether there was zzso in common, irrespective of the way that the task rules were zzso On each trial, we presented a word after a variable zzso and participants had to decide either whether the word was abstract or concrete or whether it had 2 zzso The participants either decided before the delay which task they would perform or were instructed by written zzso Comparing the zzso with the instructed trials, there was early task set zzso during the delay in the middle frontal zzso On the other hand, a conjunction analysis revealed sustained zzso in the zzso prefrontal and polar zzso for both zzso We argue that the zzso prefrontal zzso is specialized for handling conditional rules regardless of how the task rules were zzso
