zzso imaging was used to study zzso in 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were employed to measure the rate of zzso spreading of zzso zzso zzso inside the zzso pack in the range of flow rate from zzso zzso to zzso zzso From the zzso zzso zzso concentration profiles were zzso which yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean transit zzso zzso variations in the zzso zzso were observed at flow rates above zzso zzso We hypothesized that the observed spatial zzso in the zzso zzso arise from the spatial variations of the zzso zzso To validate this mechanism we showed by simulation that similar zzso zzso variation occur in a layered zzso
