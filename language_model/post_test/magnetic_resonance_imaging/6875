zzso of eloquent zzso using zzso zzso contrast functional zzso zzso has rapidly gained acceptance as part of the evaluation of patients being considered for zzso zzso The zzso signal measures local zzso in the blood, which can change during periods of increased zzso zzso as a result of zzso in blood flow and cerebral oxygen zzso zzso anomalies could influence the zzso signal via their effects on both blood flow and zzso 

In the present study we have compared the zzso signal associated with functional zzso near zzso zzso and zzso in a group of patients referred for zzso mapping of eloquent zzso 

The magnitude of the zzso signal was not different for the zzso group and the zzso group zzso percentage signal change zzso zzso zzso For subjects with zzso there was an increase in zzso volume on the functional images compared to zzso anatomical images zzso zzso and a zzso signal was only detected outside the enlarged zzso 

The findings show that zzso effects associated with zzso most likely due to zzso deposition, can result in an apparent increase in the separation between the zzso signal and the zzso zzso This could lead to falsely high levels of surgical confidence during zzso zzso zzso patterns of blood flow associated with zzso and zzso do not appear to significantly affect the zzso signal zzso
