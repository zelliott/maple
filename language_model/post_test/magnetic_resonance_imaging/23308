zzso of the anterior zzso lobe zzso is an effective surgical treatment for intractable zzso lobe zzso but carries a risk of language and verbal memory zzso zzso zzso of functional zones in the ATL might help reduce these risks, yet zzso protocols in current widespread use produce very little zzso in this zzso Based on recent evidence suggesting a role for the ATL in semantic integration, we designed an zzso protocol comparing comprehension of brief narratives zzso zzso with a zzso shallow control task involving serial zzso zzso zzso The Story zzso zzso contrast zzso strong zzso throughout the ATL, lateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso in an initial cohort of 18 healthy zzso The task protocol was then implemented at 6 other imaging centers using identical zzso Data from a second cohort of participants scanned at these centers closely zzso the results from the initial zzso The zzso protocol provides a reliable method for zzso of surgical regions of interest in the zzso The bilateral zzso supports previous claims that conceptual processing involves both zzso zzso Used in combination with language zzso measures, reliable ATL zzso maps may be useful for predicting cognitive outcome in ATL surgery, though the zzso of this approach needs to be established in a prospective surgical zzso
