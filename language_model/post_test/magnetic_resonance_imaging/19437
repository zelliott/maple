zzso of the zzso formation, a region important for the acquisition of new zzso knowledge, has been well-documented in Alzheimer's disease zzso although the relation of such zzso to the extent of memory dysfunction in these patients has been less zzso In the present study, 18 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable zzso were studied with a zzso quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso as well as the verbal and spatial versions of the zzso controlled learning zzso The volumes of the zzso formation and, as a control for generalized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso from zzso zzso slices taken perpendicular to the long axis of the zzso To correct for individual differences in brain size, volumes of regions of interest were divided by total zzso zzso Separate zzso zzso analyses (with age, right and left zzso zzso zzso and zzso lobe volumes as the independent zzso showed that left zzso volume was the best predictor of free recall and delayed free recall of verbal information zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Recall and delayed recall of the spatial location of verbal items were best predicted by right zzso volume zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Memory scores did not correlate either with zzso zzso or zzso lobe zzso Furthermore, the relation between zzso volume and memory function observed in cases with zzso did not hold for healthy aged control zzso
