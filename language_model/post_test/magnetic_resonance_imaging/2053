To evaluate the zzso and the zzso and zzso appearance of zzso stress zzso fractures in military endurance athletes and zzso 

One hundred and zzso active duty military endurance zzso with a history of zzso hip pain were evaluated by both zzso and bone scan over a zzso zzso Patients in the study ranged in age from 17 to 45 zzso They had hip pain related to activity and had plain zzso of the hip and pelvis that were interpreted as normal or zzso The study was originally designed to evaluate the zzso and zzso appearance of zzso neck stress zzso Patients had zzso and a limited zzso examination zzso imaging only) within 48 h of the bone zzso Twelve patients demonstrated imaging findings compatible with zzso stress zzso 

Stress fractures are common in endurance athletes and in military zzso however, stress fracture of the zzso is zzso Twelve of 178 patients zzso in our study had imaging findings consistent with zzso stress zzso Two patterns were zzso Seven of the 12 zzso patients had zzso roof stress zzso In this group, two cases of bilateral zzso roof stress fractures were identified, one with a zzso zzso sided zzso neck stress zzso The remaining five of 12 zzso patients had anterior column stress fractures, rarely occurring in isolation, and almost always occurring with inferior zzso zzso stress fracture (4 of 5, or zzso One case of bilateral anterior column stress fractures was identified without additional sites of zzso 

Stress fractures are commonplace in military zzso especially endurance zzso zzso stress fractures are rare and therefore zzso but do occur and may be a cause for zzso hip pain in a small percentage of military endurance athletes and zzso
