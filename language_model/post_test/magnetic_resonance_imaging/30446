To assess the most useful dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso index in the evaluation of the therapeutic response in brain zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 25 zzso zzso were serially evaluated using zzso zzso All zzso were classified into two groups: group I zzso included patients who showed clinical, as well as imaging, zzso and group II zzso included patients with either clinical or zzso zzso The group I and group II zzso were examined for up to 12 months at 4 monthly zzso However, the zzso in five patients of group II were excised following clinical deterioration after 4 months of zzso The zzso zzso zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso relative cerebral blood flow zzso zzso zzso and leakage zzso were zzso at each time zzso The zzso zzso and total volumes of zzso together with the zzso volume, were also zzso 

All patients in group I and three in group II showed a significant decrease in all zzso zzso together with the zzso volume, after 1 zzso In these three patients in group II, increase in zzso was associated with increased cellular volume fraction whereas the zzso zzso and zzso volume decreased significantly after 4 zzso In five patients in group II who underwent zzso of the zzso after 4 months of therapy due to clinical zzso the decrease in zzso was associated with significant increase in zzso and zzso volume without any significant change in zzso zzso The zzso correlated significantly with the cellular volume, whereas zzso showed a significant correlation with the zzso and zzso volume at each time zzso 

In zzso changes in zzso and zzso volume are associated with a therapeutic response at 4 months, even when there is a paradoxical increase in the zzso zzso
