Recent studies have shown that cognitive and memory decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso is coupled with losses of zzso zzso However, few studies have investigated the characteristics of the whole brain networks in individuals with mild cognitive impairment zzso In this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, we investigated the zzso properties of the whole brain networks in 18 zzso patients, 16 zzso patients, and 18 zzso healthy zzso Among the three groups, zzso patients showed the longest characteristic path lengths and the largest zzso zzso while the zzso measures of zzso networks exhibited intermediate zzso The finding was not surprising, given that zzso is considered to be the zzso stage of zzso Compared with normal controls, zzso patients showed decreased zzso zzso mainly in the zzso zzso lobe as well as increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, we detected increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso lobe and frontal zzso and decreased zzso zzso mainly in the zzso in zzso patients compared with zzso zzso The results suggested a widespread zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These findings concerning zzso and zzso may be an integrated reflection of reorganization of the brain networks accompanied with the cognitive decline that may lead to zzso
