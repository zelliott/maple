Because many words are typically used in the context of their zzso objects and actions, distributed cortical circuits for these words may bind information about their form with zzso and motor aspects of their zzso Previous work has demonstrated such semantic grounding for zzso zzso zzso and zzso knowledge linked to words, which is manifest in zzso of the corresponding areas of the zzso Here, we explore the brain basis of zzso semantic links of words whose meaning is primarily related to zzso In a blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging design, Spanish taste words and control words matched for a range of factors (including zzso zzso zzso frequency of use, number of letters and zzso were presented to 59 right-handed participants in a passive reading zzso Whereas all the words activated the left inferior frontal zzso and the zzso middle and superior zzso zzso zzso zzso words produced a significantly stronger zzso in these same areas and also in the anterior zzso frontal zzso lateral zzso zzso and zzso among zzso As these areas comprise primary and secondary zzso zzso we conclude that the meaning of taste words is grounded in distributed cortical circuits reaching into areas that process taste zzso
