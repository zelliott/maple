To test the hypothesis that a zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol acquired at 3 zzso combined with zzso image analysis techniques enables precise volume and mass zzso of zzso lean, and bone tissue zzso that agree with zzso scale mass and scale mass changes in the context of a zzso study of zzso dogs placed on an zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Six healthy adult male dogs were scanned twice, at weeks 0 zzso and 4, of the dietary zzso zzso volumes of zzso tissue zzso zzso and zzso lean zzso and cortical bone were zzso using a zzso zzso Volumes were converted to masses using published tissue zzso 

zzso total mass zzso with scale mass with a zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and slope and intercept values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous and total zzso tissue masses increased significantly from weeks 0 to 4, while neither cortical bone nor lean tissue masses changed zzso This is evidenced by a mean percent change of zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for total zzso zzso 

zzso can precisely zzso and map body composition with respect to zzso lean, and bone tissue zzso The described approach provides a valuable tool to examine the role of distinct tissue zzso in an established animal model of human zzso zzso
