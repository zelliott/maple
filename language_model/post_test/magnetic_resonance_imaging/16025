BACKGROUND AND CASE REPORT: The use of zzso from donors with central nervous systems zzso zzso is controversial zzso We present a 1 year old boy, who was admitted for zzso A computer zzso detected a large tumor in the zzso zzso zzso The tumor was zzso but zzso a zzso brain swelling occurred, being resistant to standard zzso After brain death was established and permission was given, organ donation was zzso All zzso showed good initial functions and no zzso 

We investigated the evidence for transplantation of zzso from donors with central nervous zzso 

The Australia and New Zealand Combined zzso and zzso zzso the United Network for zzso Sharing and zzso et zzso reported three transmissions of a zzso zzso in zzso recipients, who received zzso from donors with zzso zzso In contrast the Israel Penn International zzso zzso suggests that transmission is more common: 62 zzso were zzso 14 cases showed zzso All cases of zzso showing transmission were associated with zzso zzso In zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso tumors were zzso 17 cases were identified with tumors transmission from zzso zzso 

zzso donors where brain death is established suffering from brain tumors should not be generally regarded as zzso for an organ zzso zzso from patients with risk factors zzso zzso zzso zzso should be excluded from the donor pool as transmission is more zzso The risk of donor transmitted zzso should be weight against the urgency to receive a transplant zzso
