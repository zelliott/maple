zzso zzso acid zzso zzso ventilation and zzso magnetic resonance zzso images were used to define regional functional impairment in acute airway obstruction zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso dog zzso 

The zzso study was performed in 10 zzso normal dogs in a zzso position during 20-minute spontaneous inhalation of an zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso produced by an zzso zzso in an zzso delivery system, combined with a dynamic zzso study after a zzso intravenous zzso injection of a zzso zzso dose of zzso These MR studies were also performed in the same 10 dogs approximately 30 minutes after zzso the zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso with a balloon zzso and in another six dogs after zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso zzso zzso 4) pulmonary zzso zzso with zzso Regional lung enhancement was assessed on zzso intensity zzso and zzso and zzso images produced by a zzso zzso 

The normal lungs were gradually and zzso enhanced with time after zzso zzso inhalation regardless of the respiratory zzso changes, except for three animals with the fastest breathing zzso The averaged zzso relative lung zzso increase against the baseline in the successful animals was significantly greater in the slowly and deeply breathing animals than in the fast and shallow breathing animals, regardless of the difference in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso There was an additional enhancement of zzso zzso 101 in the zzso lung and zzso zzso 160 in the zzso lung on the pulmonary zzso phase zzso image even in the slowly and deeply breathing animals who zzso zzso zzso and the enhancement effect was significantly greater compared with that with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso images clearly defined the regionally matched zzso deficits in all the zzso models, and the regionally mismatched zzso in all the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can provide efficient lung enhancement in spontaneously and adequately breathing animals, using a relatively zzso zzso delivery zzso The combined use of zzso zzso MR imaging may be acceptable for defining regionally impaired function associated with acute zzso and zzso
