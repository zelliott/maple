To describe the clinical and laboratory findings in cases of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso 

Neonatal zzso encephalitis is a devastating infection which requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and rapid initiation of zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective search for all cases of zzso encephalitis within the two Saskatchewan pediatric zzso care centers for the period of zzso Only those patients with consistent clinical presentations along with direct evidence of presence of zzso such as positive zzso fluid zzso viral cultures, positive zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso from zzso or positive zzso G against zzso from zzso blood, were zzso 

Five male and four female infant patients were zzso At a mean age of presentation of 24 zzso 20 days, zzso occurred in six zzso lethargy in six zzso temperature changes in five zzso and zzso in three zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated an initial zzso or zzso elevated zzso protein and depressed zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was abnormal in zzso of zzso zzso computerized zzso was abnormal in zzso of zzso Clinical follow-up over an average of two years demonstrated zzso delay in four patients and upper motor zzso findings in four zzso No patients suffered from zzso zzso or zzso 

Neonatal zzso encephalitis most commonly presents with seizures, zzso and zzso zzso fluid testing and zzso have zzso sensitivity in cases with laboratory confirmation of zzso zzso zzso in morbidity and mortality as compared to previous reports may relate to better recognition of this illness and zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso in our series may also relate to better recognition and zzso therapy within this series of zzso
