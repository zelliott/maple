For the successful zzso treatment of zzso angle located zzso an understanding of the relationship and variations between neural and vascular structures and a certain diagnosis are the most valuable factors for zzso zzso angle zzso have now become a visible area by advances in magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso An evaluation of this area and the decision for a zzso zzso procedure are easier than zzso Twenty zzso adult human zzso zzso that have no sign of central nervous system pathology, were obtained and dissected zzso at routine zzso The zzso zzso - zzso nerve complex and the anterior inferior zzso artery zzso were identified in all zzso Thirteen of the 40 zzso zzso zzso were situated zzso and zzso (35 zzso were located zzso to the zzso - zzso nerve zzso Thirteen zzso zzso passed between the zzso and the zzso nerve zzso Five of the 40 zzso zzso zzso had a loop near the nerve complex and then passed the nerves zzso or zzso In an zzso study 74 adult persons zzso zzso were investigated by using three-dimensional zzso transformation constructive interference in the steady state technique zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were as zzso 48 zzso zzso % of all 148 zzso were situated zzso to the zzso nerve complex, 45 zzso zzso zzso were situated zzso to the zzso nerve complex, and the zzso passed between the zzso and zzso nerves in 51 samples zzso zzso In four of the 148 zzso angles zzso zzso the zzso was not zzso There was an zzso loop coursing to the internal acoustic zzso in 15 patients zzso zzso In this study, we examined the relations between zzso and zzso nerve complex and the zzso in zzso and zzso materials for an understanding of the value and reliability of the zzso zzso This study also shows the anatomical variation between these zzso
