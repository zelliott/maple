zzso risk for zzso zzso disorder zzso has been associated with changes in brain activity related to cognitive zzso However, it is not clear whether changes in zzso are the primary deficit or whether they are related to impaired communication between regions involved in this zzso We investigated whether zzso functional connectivity between regions involved in cognitive control was affected by familial risk and zzso changes were specific to these zzso zzso seed analyses were used to investigate zzso zzso between cognitive control and motor regions in two independent samples of typically developing controls, subjects with zzso and their unaffected zzso In both samples, correlation zzso between cognitive control regions were greater for typically developing controls than for subjects with zzso with intermediate values for unaffected zzso Within the motor network, unaffected siblings showed correlations similar to typically developing zzso There were no differences in activity between the brain regions zzso These data show that functional connectivity between cognitive control regions is sensitive to familial risk for zzso zzso suggest that changes in connectivity associated with cognitive control may be suitable as an intermediate zzso for future zzso
