In the previous decades the distinction between a local zzso and distant zzso was difficult to accomplish in an early zzso As a consequence, a failure could only be zzso related to the original zzso zzso Currently, due to better imaging and position zzso techniques, the actual dose within the prostate can be estimated, taking position uncertainties into zzso Furthermore, advanced functional zzso techniques, such as MR zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso increase the chance of zzso a local recurrence within the zzso With this information the correlation between the actual previously delivered dose and a local zzso can be established, using zzso registration of the planning CT and the zzso zzso The current study describes the possibilities and problems in obtaining this zzso This serves as a framework for investigating a reliable dose effect relationship in the zzso
