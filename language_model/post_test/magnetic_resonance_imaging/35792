zzso soft tissue masses were studied with magnetic resonance imaging zzso which proved to be useful in the zzso evaluation of these zzso Other imaging zzso employed had significant zzso Plain films were of little value because of the zzso low contrast of soft zzso zzso was not necessary unless zzso suggested a vascular zzso or proximity to major blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both readily identified fatty zzso and their relationship to adjacent zzso Some soft tissue tumors could not be delineated from normal muscle with CT, but were easily seen with zzso zzso is zzso suited for the study of suspected soft tissue tumors because of its excellent soft tissue contrast and its ability to image directly in any zzso zzso evaluation required imaging in at least two planes with spin echo sequences chosen to bring out both zzso and zzso zzso
