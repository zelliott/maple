What happens in zzso cortical areas when zzso blind zzso individuals orient attention to spatial zzso Previous zzso of sighted individuals has found overlapping zzso in a network of zzso areas including frontal eye fields zzso during both overt (with eye zzso and covert (without eye zzso shifts of spatial zzso Since voluntary eye movement planning seems irrelevant in zzso their zzso zzso should be recruited for alternative functions if their zzso role in sighted individuals is only due to eye movement zzso Recent zzso of the blind has also reported zzso in zzso zzso areas, normally associated with visual processing, during a diverse set of zzso tasks, but their response to zzso shifts remains poorly zzso Here, we used zzso zzso to explore zzso and zzso zzso areas in CB individuals and sighted controls with eyes closed zzso performing a covert attention zzso task with zzso verbal cues and zzso auditory zzso We found robust zzso zzso zzso of all CB subjects, similar to and stronger than in zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso of covert spatial attention even in individuals in whom voluntary eye movements are zzso We also found robust zzso in bilateral zzso zzso zzso in CB but not in SC zzso The response decreased below baseline following zzso verbal cues but increased following auditory targets, suggesting that the zzso zzso area in CB does not directly engage during cued zzso of attention but may be recruited for processing of zzso auditory zzso
