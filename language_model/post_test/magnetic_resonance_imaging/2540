We have investigated the zzso and zzso properties of the new zzso complexes of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso The zzso as well as the zzso and conditional stability zzso of these complexes with respect to the zzso relevance were determined and discussed in comparison with the commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In case of zzso a twofold higher zzso and a complex stability similar to zzso were zzso It is zzso that lower zzso of zzso are sufficient for the same signal enhancement in the zzso MR image compared with zzso and, thus, the use of the new contrast agent zzso should diminish risks for zzso zzso zzso might be used potentially as a new contrast agent for clinical zzso zzso
