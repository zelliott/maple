zzso of the zzso zzso although typically of zzso zzso grade I) zzso can present within the spectrum of zzso zzso including zzso zzso grade zzso In certain cases, zzso features alone make the distinction between zzso and diffuse zzso zzso We reviewed 22 cases of zzso nerve zzso 19 of which were zzso zzso zzso and 3 of which were zzso zzso zzso The cases were evaluated for their clinical course, zzso appearance, zzso grade, and proliferation zzso as detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of the 19 zzso 14 showed no tumor growth by magnetic resonance imaging, and had zzso and zzso labeling zzso zzso of zzso zzso The other 5 PA exhibited aggressive behavior manifest by marked diffuse zzso tumor growth causing death in 2 patients, 1 of whom was diagnosed with zzso type 1 zzso and zzso not available), and marked local growth with an average time to growth of zzso months, a zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in three zzso Three of the five aggressive PA zzso demonstrated a finely zzso pattern, a pattern that appears as an exaggeration or expansion of the normal zzso of the zzso zzso and may simulate a diffuse zzso zzso Two demonstrated the zzso zzso pattern, with the zzso and zzso pattern typical of zzso Three diffuse zzso (2 zzso zzso and 1 zzso originated clinically and zzso from the zzso zzso and revealed a zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and an average time to growth of 8 zzso We conclude that the majority of PA of the zzso nerve are zzso stabilize zzso and have zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso of PA has a propensity for aggressive behavior, and are identified by a zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, in cases of aggressive zzso nerve tumors in which the zzso review of biopsy material cannot confidently confirm the diagnosis of zzso or diffuse zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso appears to favor the diagnosis of diffuse zzso
