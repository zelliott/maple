Here, we report a case of zzso induced by zzso tube air inflation zzso with a zzso and present evidence that multiple air bubbles entered the zzso space through a zzso oval window zzso

The patient was referred to us because of zzso zzso and right hearing loss after zzso using a zzso tube zzso On Day 2, an zzso showed right total deafness, and the zzso space could not be identified on zzso magnetic resonance zzso A high-resolution cone beam CT scan obtained on Day 3 showed multiple air bubbles in the zzso The volume rendering images clearly revealed a larger air bubble in the zzso inside the zzso of the zzso and small air bubbles in the horizontal semicircular canal, superior semicircular canal, and zzso and second turns of the zzso This finding indicates that the air bubbles entered the zzso space through an oval widow zzso caused by a sudden zzso in zzso air zzso Two months later, the air bubbles had disappeared, and the patient's high tone hearing had improved zzso 

zzso can cause a zzso if the zzso pressure rises beyond a certain critical zzso In this situation, volume rendering imaging of high-resolution cone beam CT can be used to zzso and identify the air bubbles zzso The images taken in this study suggest that air bubbles entered the zzso space through a zzso zzso
