The aim of this study was to investigate whether the tumor parameters of spinal zzso zzso are significant zzso of clinical presentation and zzso zzso 

The study involved 21 cases of zzso zzso that were operated on between 1988 and zzso The patients were 13 males zzso and 8 females zzso with an age range of zzso years zzso 38 zzso 

In most cases zzso zzso zzso zzso examination revealed a zzso deficit in at least one zzso Complete tumor removal was achieved in all zzso The patients with wider tumors had poorer zzso zzso condition and poorer zzso zzso zzso length zzso to zzso zzso was not correlated with zzso zzso status, but longer length was significantly associated with development of zzso post zzso In contrast to tumor zzso zzso ratio zzso of the tumor zzso to the largest zzso zzso at the tumor zzso was identified as a significant predictor of zzso zzso status and zzso zzso values of zzso were correlated with poorer zzso clinical status and poorer zzso zzso Neither extent of zzso zzso from length zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso nor presence of a zzso in the tumor was significant relative to zzso zzso recovery in these zzso 

This study demonstrated that the zzso of the tumor relative to the zzso is the main predictor of zzso presentation and zzso zzso The length of the tumor affects the zzso zzso zzso
