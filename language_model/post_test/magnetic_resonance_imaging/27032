In animals, zzso zzso and zzso have opposing effects on appetite and weight zzso In humans, functional brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies during zzso zzso or infusion have demonstrated suppression of zzso zzso but no studies have compared the effects of zzso and zzso We therefore sought to determine if the brain response differed to zzso zzso zzso in humans independently of the zzso zzso 

Nine healthy, normal weight subjects underwent blood zzso level dependent zzso zzso zzso during either intravenous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso administered over 2 zzso in a randomized, zzso crossover zzso Blood was sampled every 5 zzso during a baseline period and following infusion for 60 zzso in total for zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso 

No significant brain zzso signal changes were detected in response to IV zzso zzso signal in the cortical control areas increased during zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso corresponding with increased plasma zzso and insulin zzso In contrast, zzso signal decreased in the cortical control areas during zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso corresponding with increases of plasma zzso and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso infusions significantly altered zzso signal in the zzso 

In normal weight humans, cortical responses as assessed by zzso zzso to infused zzso are opposite to those of zzso zzso brain responses to these zzso and their zzso may provide insight into the zzso basis for zzso of food intake during high dietary zzso zzso
