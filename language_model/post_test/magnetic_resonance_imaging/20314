zzso zzso zzso is a method of assessing brain gray matter volume that has previously been applied to various chronic pain zzso From this previous work, it appears that chronic pain is associated with altered brain zzso The present study was undertaken to assess these potential zzso in patients with painful hip zzso zzso 

We studied 16 patients with unilateral zzso hip pain, before and 9 months after hip zzso This enabled comparison of gray matter volume in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain versus healthy controls, as well as identification of any changes in volume following zzso of pain (after zzso Assessment involved zzso questionnaires to assess pain, function, and zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the brain for zzso zzso 

zzso differences in brain gray matter volume between healthy controls and patients with painful hip arthritis were zzso Specifically, areas of the zzso in patients with chronic zzso pain exhibited decreased gray matter zzso Furthermore, when these zzso changes were compared with the brain zzso of the patients 9 months after surgery, the areas of reduced zzso gray matter volume were found to have zzso to levels seen in healthy zzso 

Our findings confirm that gray matter volume decreases within the left zzso in the presence of chronic pain and disability in patients with hip zzso The results also show that these zzso volume changes reverse after hip zzso and are associated with decreased pain and increased zzso These findings have potential implications with regard to zzso the timing of orthopedic interventions such as zzso
