To determine whether zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso a newer zzso technology, would be useful in the evaluation of the zzso of patients in zzso states resulting from traumatic brain zzso 

14 victims of severe traumatic brain injury who were in the zzso state and whose magnetic resonance images of the zzso were normal underwent bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso ratios were obtained for each zzso The zzso zzso MRS findings of patients who were in a persistent zzso state zzso zzso 8) and in patients who had regained awareness after being in the zzso state zzso zzso 6) were compared with zzso zzso MRS findings in five healthy zzso 

While conventional magnetic resonance imaging suggested that each patient had a normal thalamus, zzso MRS indicated that the zzso of each patient in the series was zzso The zzso ratio was significantly lower in the zzso of both the patients who remained in a persistent zzso state for the duration of the study and in those who regained awareness after being in the zzso state zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso ratios were lower in the group of patients who remained in a persistent zzso state than in the group of patients who regained awareness after being in the zzso state zzso zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that the zzso ratio within the zzso is significant and that zzso MRS may be helpful when attempting to determine the degree of severity of zzso and zzso injury in patients in the zzso zzso
