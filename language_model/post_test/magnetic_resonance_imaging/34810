To determine the optimum zzso of a phased array MR zzso system for human cardiac applications, the sensitivity of 10 flexible array designs operating under ideal conditions was calculated at 13 points circling the zzso of a model torso whose geometry was determined from healthy zzso The array zzso that were evaluated included continuous strips of 2, 4, 6, and 10 circular coils of diameter equal to half the torso thickness wrapped zzso around the zzso 2 pairs of coils located on the left side of the chest and back, clusters of 3 coils in 2 zzso clusters of 4 and 6 zzso and a hybrid cross of 6 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso strip zzso zzso the other designs for a given number of zzso yielding average theoretical sensitivity improvements of zzso zzso and zzso relative to a single flexible zzso positioned at the point closest to the anterior zzso compared with about zzso for zzso and zzso clusters and the zzso geometry zzso zzso zzso A flexible zzso strip array was constructed for a clinical zzso T scanner with zzso diameter circular surface coils on flexible circuit zzso The zzso ratio zzso of this zzso at the 13 cardiac locations was measured in 15 normal volunteers and compared with the zzso measured in images acquired with standard commercial MR zzso a body zzso a flexible torso zzso a general purpose flexible zzso and, in 4 subjects, a dual array zzso In the prone orientation, the average zzso zzso improvement of the zzso strip array was zzso relative to the whole body zzso compared with zzso for the other commercial coils zzso zzso zzso The twofold advantage over the commercial coils persisted in zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, flexible zzso phased zzso of strips of surface coils of diameter comparable with the depth of the heart generally zzso many other standard zzso for a given number of zzso and can yield dramatically improved zzso over coils available for general use in the zzso
