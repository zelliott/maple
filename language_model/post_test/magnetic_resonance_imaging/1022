To evaluate the usefulness of a mismatch between the severity of acute clinical manifestations and the zzso imaging zzso zzso in predicting early stroke outcome and zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with a zzso zzso stroke of zzso hours' duration were zzso The zzso Stroke zzso zzso score and the volume of zzso zzso were measured on admission and at 72 zzso 12 zzso zzso volume was measured on zzso or zzso inversion recovery images at day zzso Early zzso deterioration zzso was defined as an increase of zzso or zzso points between the two zzso zzso zzso patients received IV zzso or zzso zzso mismatch zzso was defined as zzso score of zzso or zzso and zzso volume on zzso of zzso or zzso zzso on zzso The adjusted influence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso enlargement at 72 hours, and zzso growth at day 30 was evaluated by zzso zzso analysis and generalized linear zzso 

zzso was found in 87 patients zzso Patients with zzso had a higher risk of END than patients without zzso because zzso zzso 8 zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was associated with an increase of 46 to 68 zzso in the mean volume of zzso zzso enlargement and zzso growth in comparison with zzso All the effects were even greater and significant in patients not treated with zzso zzso 

Acute stroke patients with an zzso score of zzso or zzso and zzso volume of zzso or zzso zzso have a higher probability of zzso growth and early zzso zzso The new concept of zzso may identify patients with tissue at risk of zzso for zzso or zzso zzso
