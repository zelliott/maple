To determine whether zzso imaging zzso could identify potentially clinically relevant findings in patients presenting more than 6 hours after stroke onset when compared with conventional zzso 

zzso with both conventional zzso and zzso density zzso and zzso imaging zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso was performed 6 to 48 hours after symptom onset zzso 27 zzso in 40 consecutive patients with acute zzso All acute zzso were identified first on conventional images, then on zzso by a zzso who was provided with the suspected zzso location, based on a zzso examination before zzso zzso were rated as potentially clinically relevant if they were detected only on zzso and 1) confirmed the acute symptomatic zzso to be in a different vascular territory than suspected zzso 2) revealed multiple zzso in different vascular territories suggestive of a zzso source of zzso or 3) clarified that a zzso thought to be acute on conventional imaging, was not zzso 

The initial clinical impression of zzso zzso was incorrect in 12 patients zzso zzso significant findings were detected by zzso alone in 19 patients zzso zzso demonstrated the symptomatic zzso in a different vascular territory than suspected clinically or by conventional zzso in 7 patients zzso and showed acute zzso in multiple vascular zzso in 5 patients zzso In 8 patients zzso zzso clarified that zzso thought to be acute on conventional zzso were actually zzso 

In patients zzso 6 to 48 hours after stroke zzso zzso frequently provided potentially clinically relevant findings that were not apparent on conventional zzso
