zzso retention is rare in zzso Here I describe such a case in a patient who had zzso her zzso in a motor vehicle accident at 3 years of zzso The zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso was proven zzso 

Both to present a complicated and unique case whose history pointed strongly to one diagnosis initially but turned out very differently than zzso and to give an example of the use of bedside zzso in the Emergency Department as a diagnostic tool in an unusual zzso 

A 13-year-old girl was evaluated for 3 days of urinary zzso Her history of pelvic fracture and zzso zzso in childhood suggested a zzso zzso Her zzso revealed, however, a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso Upon surgical zzso the zzso was confirmed to be zzso zzso rather than a coincidental zzso zzso 

zzso is an uncommon but zzso cause of urinary retention in zzso zzso This is a difficult diagnosis in any circumstance, and this patient's complex history complicated the zzso It was the bizarre bedside ultrasound that prompted further zzso than simple zzso zzso and zzso zzso which her zzso had suggested over the zzso This patient's case is unique in the zzso
