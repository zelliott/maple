To evaluate the role of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed in men without a zzso diagnosis of prostate cancer using follow-up biopsy as the reference zzso 

zzso patients without zzso cancer and who underwent zzso were zzso In all patients, zzso was performed at zzso using a pelvic zzso zzso and included zzso imaging, zzso imaging, and dynamic zzso zzso Thirteen had undergone no previous zzso and 29 had undergone at least 1 previous negative zzso All patients underwent prostate biopsy following zzso Two zzso zzso in consensus reviewed all cases and zzso each lobe as positive or negative for zzso These interpretations were correlated with findings on zzso zzso 

zzso biopsy was positive in 23 zzso in 15 patients zzso of study zzso On a zzso basis, zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value zzso of zzso and negative zzso value zzso of zzso On a zzso basis, zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso There was a nearly significant association between zzso score and tumor detection on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In our sample, zzso had zzso sensitivity in predicting the presence of tumor on subsequent biopsy on a zzso basis, suggesting a possible role for zzso in selecting patients with an elevated zzso specific zzso zzso to undergo prostate zzso However, zzso had weaker specificity for prediction of a subsequent positive zzso as well as weaker sensitivity for tumor on a zzso basis, indicating that in patients with a positive zzso result, tissue sampling remains necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis as well as for treatment zzso
