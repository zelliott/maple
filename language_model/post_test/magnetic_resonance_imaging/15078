To explore the reliability and feasibility of blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to depict zzso in breast invasive zzso zzso 

A total of 103 women with 104 invasive zzso zzso zzso underwent breast zzso at zzso zzso zzso specimens were zzso for zzso size, grade, zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The distribution and reliability of zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso value with the zzso factors and zzso were respectively zzso 

The zzso map of zzso demonstrated a relatively zzso zzso The mean zzso value was zzso zzso The zzso test zzso zzso suggested that the sample did not follow a normal zzso The zzso and zzso correlation zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso were significantly lower in patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value had a weak correlation with zzso expression zzso zzso The mean zzso value correlated moderately with the level of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a simple and zzso technique that yields zzso information on breast invasive zzso zzso
