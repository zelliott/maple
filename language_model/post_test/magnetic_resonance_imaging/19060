The zzso Community Stroke Project zzso zzso is a simple clinical scheme for zzso first ever acute zzso Several small studies have shown that when an zzso is visible on CT or zzso the zzso predicts its site in about three quarters of zzso The aim was to further investigate this relation in a much larger cohort of patients in hospital with zzso zzso 

Between 1994 and 1997, zzso and zzso with zzso stroke were assessed by one of several stroke physicians who noted the zzso zzso A zzso classified the site and extent of recent zzso on CT or zzso 

Of zzso patients with zzso stroke, 655 zzso had recent visible zzso These zzso zzso were appropriate to the clinical zzso in zzso zzso patients with a total anterior circulation syndrome, zzso zzso with a partial anterior circulation syndrome, zzso zzso with a zzso syndrome, and zzso zzso with a zzso circulation zzso Overall, zzso of patients with visible zzso were correctly classified zzso If patients without a visible zzso did have an appropriate zzso in the brain zzso zzso the zzso would have correctly predicted its site and size in zzso zzso patients, compared with only zzso zzso in the worst case zzso 

The zzso zzso predicted the site of zzso in three quarters of zzso When an zzso is visible on brain imaging, the site of the zzso should guide the use of further zzso but if an zzso is not seen, the zzso zzso could be used to predict its likely size and zzso
