The zzso zzso of eloquent functional areas is necessary to decrease the neurological morbidity of zzso zzso We explored the minimum spatial resolution requirements for functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data acquisition when brain mapping is used in zzso planning and zzso Using a zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso eight patients with brain tumors underwent zzso scans using spatial resolution of approximately 4 zzso 4 zzso 4 zzso to map the eloquent motor and language areas during the performance of zzso zzso The zzso results were then used zzso in an open zzso system to delineate eloquent zzso zzso zzso patterns were visually inspected by a zzso to determine zzso whether ambiguity with respect to the zzso zzso due to low spatial resolution, could be of potential significance for surgical zzso A significant degree of ambiguity in both the extent and shape of zzso was judged to be present in data from six of the eight zzso Analysis of zzso data at multiple resolutions from a normal volunteer showed that at 3 zzso zzso resolution, eloquent areas were better localized within the gray matter although there was still some potential for ambiguity caused by zzso appearing to cross a zzso The data acquired with zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced the spatial zzso of zzso to within the gray zzso Thus, zzso spatial resolution on the order of 2 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso which is much higher than the resolutions used in typical zzso zzso may be needed for the zzso identification of cortical zzso with respect to tumors and important anatomical zzso
