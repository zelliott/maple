zzso risk zzso for psychosis has been associated with widespread structural brain changes in young zzso The onset of these changes and their subsequent progression over time are not well zzso 

Rate of brain change over time was investigated in 43 adolescents at zzso for psychosis compared with 30 healthy zzso Brain volumes zzso brain, gray matter, white matter zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso and zzso zzso were measured at baseline and at follow-up (2 y after zzso and compared between zzso individuals and zzso Post hoc analyses were done for zzso individuals who became psychotic (N zzso 8) and those who did not (N zzso zzso 

zzso individuals showed a smaller increase in cerebral zzso over time than controls and more cortical thinning in the left middle zzso zzso Post zzso a more pronounced decrease over time in total brain and zzso volume was found for zzso individuals who became psychotic relative to controls and a greater decrease in total brain volume than individuals who were not zzso Furthermore, zzso individuals with subsequent psychosis displayed more thinning than controls in widespread areas in the left anterior cingulate, zzso and zzso zzso Volume loss in the individuals who developed psychosis could not be attributed to medication zzso 

The development of psychosis during adolescence is associated with progressive structural brain changes around the time of zzso These changes cannot be attributed to zzso medication use and are therefore likely to reflect a zzso process related to clinical manifestation of zzso
