The purpose of this study was to examine regional cerebral blood flow zzso in normal zzso subjects with hypertension zzso using continuous zzso zzso zzso The most common explanation for the effect of blood pressure on zzso is that zzso increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease, and it may increase the risk for zzso disease possibly through small vessel disease, zzso zzso stress, and zzso However, few studies to date have examined the zzso of cognitively normal subjects with zzso in zzso zzso and none have used continuous zzso zzso zzso This is a zzso technique that does not require either injections or zzso radiation and can measure absolute zzso rates over the entire zzso 

zzso was measured at zzso T using continuous zzso zzso zzso in 41 cognitively normal subjects who were participating in the zzso Health Study zzso zzso A zzso zzso registration method was used to zzso the zzso maps to the standard zzso brain zzso Image and zzso statistical analyses were performed between subject zzso 

zzso normal subjects with zzso zzso had decreased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the left zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, decreased zzso was observed in the right and left anterior zzso zzso with extension to the zzso region, left zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso left lateral inferior and superior zzso and inferior zzso left zzso and left superior zzso zzso 

zzso is affected in normal subjects with zzso not only in the zzso regions, but also in zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso creates a vulnerability state for the development of neurodegenerative disorders, especially zzso zzso
