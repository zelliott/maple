Turner syndrome zzso a zzso disorder characterized by the absence of one X zzso in a zzso female, is frequently associated with zzso zzso We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying deficits in spatial orientation processing in zzso Thirteen subjects with zzso and 13 zzso typically developing controls underwent zzso assessments and were scanned using functional zzso while they performed easy and difficult versions of a judgment of line orientation zzso zzso zzso and subjects with zzso activated zzso regions involved in spatial orientation during the zzso zzso However, zzso was significantly less in the zzso zzso Control subjects responded to increased task difficulty by recruiting executive frontal areas whereas subjects with zzso did not activate alternate brain regions to meet increased task zzso zzso with zzso demonstrate zzso deficits in zzso and frontal areas during the zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso deficits in these areas may be responsible for the zzso deficits observed in females with zzso
