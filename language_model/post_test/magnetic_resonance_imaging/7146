The usefulness of zzso zzso in determining the location of an accessory zzso zzso zzso was examined by the zzso map at the time of a delta wave, and by gated magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso was performed at 36 points on the anterior chest wall in eight cases with zzso zzso syndrome using a zzso zzso quantum interference zzso system with the second zzso zzso Based on these records, zzso maps during the zzso and T waves were constructed, and the depth of the accessory zzso from the zzso was calculated zzso The locations of the accessory pathways were estimated using these data and the zzso zzso The locations of the accessory pathways thus determined were compared with findings obtained by body surface zzso A zzso directed towards the left was zzso because the maximum was located more zzso than the minimum in an zzso map zzso zzso after onset of the delta wave in cases with zzso syndrome, indicating an accessory zzso to be located in the right zzso A zzso directed towards the right was zzso because the maximum was located more zzso than the minimum in an zzso map zzso zzso after onset of the delta wave of cases with zzso syndrome indicating an accessory zzso to be located in the left zzso Assuming the electric current source is a single zzso the location of a current zzso might be determined by positions of the maximum and the minimum in the zzso zzso In the present study, the locations as determined by analysis of the zzso map 40 zzso after onset of the delta wave and the gated zzso were zzso with the findings obtained by body surface zzso zzso Furthermore, some cases showed two opposing zzso on the zzso map at the peak of the T wave in lead II of the standard zzso leads; one directed to the left expressing normal zzso the other directed to the right presumably expressing zzso of the zzso which was excited by an impulse via the accessory zzso The location of the current zzso as determined by analysis of the zzso map at the peak of the T wave in lead II was nearly the same as the position of the current zzso as determined by analysis of the zzso map 40 zzso after onset of the delta zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
