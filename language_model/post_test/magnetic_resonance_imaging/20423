To evaluate the value of emergency zzso zzso zzso zzso for initial conservative management of zzso zzso zzso pregnancy after zzso image zzso 

Five consecutive cases of zzso zzso zzso pregnancy were diagnosed for precise zzso of zzso zzso site, depth of zzso invasion and zzso zzso by imaging studies including color zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and three-dimensional computerized zzso zzso Emergency zzso with zzso was initially performed to achieve immediate zzso and zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso Then, the need for either expectant management or subsequent zzso zzso was individually zzso zzso zzso zzso administration was added when delayed decline of serum zzso value was zzso 

On zzso total zzso invasion to the zzso of the anterior zzso wall was diagnosed in three cases, while the two remaining cases showed zzso invasion to the anterior zzso zzso All cases were managed by emergency zzso as an initial conservative zzso zzso spontaneous expulsion of zzso products occurred in one case of zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso administration was required to achieve complete zzso of zzso zzso pregnancy in two cases of total zzso zzso In one case of zzso zzso invasion, successful zzso zzso was performed under zzso guidance, zzso in one case of total zzso invasion, zzso removal of zzso products was incomplete due to the risk of zzso zzso and additional systemic zzso administration was required for complete zzso zzso preservation was achieved in all cases without zzso effects of zzso or secondary zzso zzso 

This small case series emphasizes that zzso is potentially useful as an initial emergency intervention for conservative management of zzso zzso zzso pregnancy to achieve immediate zzso and direct zzso effects on zzso zzso tissue with minimal systemic side effects of zzso zzso
