We evaluated the diagnostic effectiveness of magnetic resonance zzso imaging at 3 zzso to zzso zzso tumors and problems associated with its zzso 

From the records of 423 consecutive women who underwent pelvic MR imaging using a zzso system from April 2009 to June 2010, we analyzed 50 continuous cases of zzso tumors proved by zzso We evaluated zzso of these tumors for image quality and artifacts using zzso zzso For qualitative assessment, we scored overall image quality zzso poor, to 5, zzso degree of conviction regarding the diagnosis zzso zzso to 5, zzso with high zzso and 4 representative artifacts zzso chemical shift, motion, and zzso zzso zzso zzso to 5, little zzso We also zzso reviewed the diagnostic features of the zzso tumors and zzso diagnostic zzso For quantitative assessment, we determined tumor size and zzso zzso 

zzso quality score was scored zzso and conviction regarding diagnosis was zzso zzso caused little degradation in most zzso zzso zzso chemical shift, zzso motion, zzso and zzso zzso zzso diagnostic accuracy was zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso Mean tumor diameter was zzso zzso The mean zzso value was zzso in zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso in benign zzso 

The quality of zzso tumor images obtained with a zzso MR imaging system is adequate for diagnosis, with only slight degradation from penetrating or zzso zzso
