In this investigation, zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at 7 T is performed using a zzso array head zzso and a surface zzso zzso zzso geometry was zzso for each zzso separately to exploit the strengths of both zzso Acquisitions with the surface zzso focused on partial brain coverage, while zzso coverage zzso experiments were performed with the array head zzso zzso sensitivity in the zzso lobe was found to be higher with the surface zzso than with the head zzso suggesting that restriction of signal detection to the area of interest may be beneficial for localized zzso zzso Performing independent component analysis zzso decomposition of the zzso data, we consistently detected zzso signal changes and resting state zzso In the surface zzso data, a small negative zzso response could be detected in these resting state network zzso Also in the data acquired with the surface zzso two distinct components of the positive zzso signal were consistently zzso These two components were tentatively assigned to tissue and zzso signal zzso
