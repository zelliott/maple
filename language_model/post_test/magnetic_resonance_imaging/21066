Task preparation is a complex cognitive process that zzso anticipatory adjustments to facilitate future task zzso Little is known about quantitative network parameters governing this process in zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and functional connectivity zzso we show that the large-scale zzso of the brain network involved in task preparation shows a pattern of dynamic zzso that guides optimal zzso This network could be zzso into two distinct zzso structures, an zzso core acting as a major hub that zzso most of the network's communication and a predominantly sensory periphery showing more flexible network zzso During task preparation, zzso interactions were zzso zzso zzso visual areas showed a higher zzso proximity to the network core and an enhancement in their local zzso and zzso Failure to reconfigure the network zzso was zzso for zzso indicating that anticipatory network zzso are crucial for successful task zzso On the basis of a unique network decoding approach, we also develop a general framework for the identification of characteristic patterns in complex networks, which is zzso to other fields in zzso that relate dynamic network properties to zzso
