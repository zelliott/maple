zzso patients with suspected primary or zzso zzso zzso have been investigated in each case by the zzso of serum levels of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging using a zzso zzso zzso The final diagnosis was confirmed by zzso or zzso zzso levels of zzso ranged between 5 and zzso zzso zzso range less than zzso zzso images and zzso were truly positive in 11 patients, 2 of whom were subsequently found to have zzso zzso zzso showed greater detail of smaller zzso whilst zzso was more suited to the detection of distant zzso In 7 patients the zzso images were positive whilst the serum marker levels were zzso This pilot study provides a preliminary comparison of the more recent techniques currently being evaluated for the detection of zzso zzso
