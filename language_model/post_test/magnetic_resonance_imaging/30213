Reading is a complex skill that is not mastered by all zzso At the age of 5, on the cusp of zzso development, many factors combine to influence a child's future reading success, including neural and zzso factors such as zzso awareness and the auditory processing of phonetic zzso and environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status zzso We investigated the interactions between these factors in 5-year-old children by administering a battery of zzso cognitive and linguistic tests, measuring zzso with a zzso scale, and using zzso to record neural activity during a behavioral task, zzso that is zzso of reading zzso zzso tests were performed, and then corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate zzso zzso It emerged that only one relationship linking neural with zzso or environmental factors survived as significant after zzso zzso a correlation between zzso and the degree of zzso zzso in the left inferior frontal zzso zzso a region which includes zzso zzso This zzso link remained significant even after controlling for the children's scores on the zzso language and zzso zzso In order to investigate possible environmental influences on the left zzso further, zzso and white matter volumes were zzso zzso significant correlations with zzso were found, indicating that environmental effects may manifest themselves in the brain zzso as well as zzso zzso these findings suggest that the weaker language skills of zzso children are related to reduced underlying neural zzso and that these neural problems go beyond what is revealed by zzso tests zzso
