To correlate the amount of bone zzso zzso zzso calculated by magnetic resonance zzso with clinical findings, zzso and zzso findings, in patients with advanced hip zzso 

The study was approved by The Institutional Human zzso Protection zzso zzso zzso of hips was acquired in 19 patients who underwent hip zzso A spin echo zzso sequence with four echoes and separate fast spin echo zzso zzso density zzso zzso sequences of fat zzso and water zzso were acquired with water and fat suppression, zzso zzso and zzso ratio calculations were made for the outlined regions of zzso The calculated zzso values were correlated with the clinical, zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso were done on the zzso data for zzso + zzso and for zzso values zzso and focal zzso for the symptomatic and zzso zzso The values were significantly higher in the study zzso zzso significant correlations were found between pain and total zzso + zzso pain and focal zzso values, and the number of zzso and calculated zzso for the focal zzso + zzso in the zzso zzso zzso significant correlations were found between the zzso findings and zzso values for total zzso + zzso focal zzso + zzso and focal zzso and among the zzso findings, pain, and hip zzso On zzso only a small amount of zzso was seen in eight zzso zzso 

The amount of zzso in the zzso hip, as measured by zzso zzso with the severity of pain, zzso findings, and number of zzso
