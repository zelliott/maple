We report a new method for treating patients with symptomatic high-grade zzso of the zzso zzso artery associated with high-grade zzso of the zzso carotid zzso 

Our patient had high-grade zzso of the zzso right zzso artery as well as high-grade zzso of the zzso carotid artery and suffered continued zzso circulation zzso neurological deficits despite zzso 

The patient was successfully treated with a carotid zzso and zzso artery zzso in a single zzso 

This procedure has the advantage in this setting of avoiding additional cross clamping on the diseased carotid artery that would normally be required for the zzso artery zzso with carotid zzso Also, zzso at one zzso site would not endanger the other site as zzso
