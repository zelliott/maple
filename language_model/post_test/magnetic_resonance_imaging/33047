The potential of zzso therapy and virtual reality in zzso is becoming of increasing zzso However, there is limited information, using zzso on the neural networks involved in training with these zzso This study was intended to detect the brain network involved in the visual processing of movement during robotic zzso The main aim was to investigate the existence of a common cerebral network able to zzso biological zzso upper zzso and zzso zzso zzso movements, hence testing the suitability of the visual zzso feedback provided by the zzso zzso 

A visual functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso task was administered to 22 healthy zzso The task required observation and retrieval of motor gestures and of the visual feedback used in robotic zzso zzso zzso of both biological and zzso movements were examined to identify areas activated in both conditions, along with differential activity in upper limb zzso abstract object zzso Control of response was also tested by administering trials with zzso and zzso reaching zzso 

The observation of upper limb and abstract object movements zzso similar patterns of zzso according to a zzso zzso for the visual processing of movements (including specific areas of the zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso Similarly, overlapping zzso were found for the subsequent retrieval of the observed zzso Furthermore, zzso of frontal cortical areas were associated with zzso trials more than with the zzso zzso 

This study identified the neural zzso associated with visual processing of movement stimuli used in upper limb zzso training and investigated the zzso ability to zzso abstract object movements with human motor zzso In both conditions, zzso were zzso in cerebral areas involved in visual perception, sensory integration, recognition of movement, zzso on the zzso and motor cortex, storage in memory, and response zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso trials revealed greater activity for the former condition than the latter in a network including zzso cortex, right inferior and middle frontal zzso that are involved in the zzso and in decision zzso zzso on healthy subjects would suggest the appropriateness of an abstract visual feedback provided during motor zzso The task contributes to highlight the potential of zzso in improving the understanding of visual motor processes and may also be useful in detecting brain zzso during zzso
