zzso magnetic resonance adaptation has been successfully used to reveal zzso responses in the human motion complex zzso Here, we aimed at further investigating zzso as well as zzso responses of zzso by looking at how these responses are affected by zzso zzso We varied motion direction and position of 2 consecutive zzso zzso Participants had to either attend to the direction or the position of the stimuli in separate zzso We show that direction selectivity in zzso as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso adaptation was strongly influenced by task zzso zzso to the motion direction of the stimuli lead to stronger zzso zzso adaptation than attending to their zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, was largely unaffected by zzso zzso Interestingly, the change in the zzso adaptation profile across tasks could not be explained by inheritance from earlier zzso The response pattern in the early zzso zzso was stable across zzso In conclusion, our results provide further evidence for the flexible coding of direction information in zzso depending on task zzso
