To evaluate the zzso findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso fixation in zzso zzso eyes, comparing zzso with square or round edges on the anterior zzso zzso 

Comparative case series with zzso 

A total of zzso zzso zzso eyes, obtained from eye banks within the United States, implanted with different zzso 

zzso segment scanning of whole eyes with a zzso ultrasound system or high-resolution anterior segment magnetic resonance imaging followed by gross zzso zzso eyes were processed for complete zzso zzso 

zzso from imaging, zzso and zzso evaluation that could be related to zzso fixation of the zzso 

Of zzso zzso zzso eyes zzso 13 had zzso zzso acrylic zzso with anterior and zzso square zzso edges, and 14 had zzso zzso with anterior round edges (13 silicone zzso and 1 zzso acrylic zzso without zzso zzso zzso These 27 selected eyes were processed for complete zzso zzso Gross findings in both groups were composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the anterior segment and on the zzso surface, and iris zzso zzso zzso of the 14 eyes with zzso zzso with round anterior zzso edges showed mild focal disruption of the iris pigmented layer and loop zzso in the zzso zzso Additional changes observed in the 13 eyes with square anterior zzso edge zzso included iris changes, such as zzso disruption and loss of the pigmented zzso zzso iris thinning and zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso One eye also exhibited initial signs of zzso nerve disc zzso 

In this series, zzso findings were more severe in eyes implanted with zzso zzso with square anterior zzso edges, suggesting that zzso with round anterior edges are more suitable for zzso zzso 

zzso or commercial disclosure may be found after the zzso
