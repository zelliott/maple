zzso spin zzso zzso can be used to measure zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso of this technique in healthy zzso to zzso its use in zzso 

Two groups of healthy volunteers were zzso two different days to assess zzso and zzso zzso zzso data volumes were acquired on a zzso T scanner with a dedicated abdominal zzso body phased array zzso zzso was performed using a zzso FAIR zzso scheme and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso suppression and respiratory triggering were zzso zzso maps of the kidney were acquired using the same sequence with background suppression zzso 

For the group with multiple zzso zzso zzso the average cortical zzso was zzso zzso and average cortical zzso was zzso For both zzso and zzso the variation shown by the zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of variation zzso zzso and zzso zzso was small for all the analyses carried zzso zzso plots were also used to zzso the variation between the same parameters collected from the different scanning sessions in both groups, and demonstrated good zzso 

We have shown that in healthy volunteers, zzso parameters are zzso over a short and long zzso This supports the overall aim of using zzso in the clinic to assess zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso
