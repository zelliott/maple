The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of zzso zzso ethanol zzso of liver tissue on a zzso open MR zzso Needles were placed by MR guidance first into an ex zzso sheep liver and then into zzso of three zzso zzso and injection of 10 zzso of zzso alcohol was zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso and zzso spin echo zzso images were obtained after incremental volumes of zzso In one zzso simultaneous injection of saline into normal liver was also performed with subsequent pathological zzso zzso liver was zzso to liver on all zzso whereas saline caused no tissue signal changes on zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso changes on zzso zzso zzso zzso examination confirmed zzso acute liver changes as compared with the zzso MR guidance of needle placement and monitoring of ethanol effects on liver tissue is zzso This may have implications for potential zzso zzso tumor zzso
