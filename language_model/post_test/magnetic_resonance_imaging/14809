zzso brain development is evident in children born very zzso zzso weeks zzso age), including reduction in gray and white matter volumes, and thinner cortex, from infancy to adolescence compared to zzso zzso However, many questions remain regarding the zzso zzso born very zzso are exposed to repeated procedural zzso stress during a period of very rapid brain zzso In this vulnerable population, we have previously found that zzso zzso stress is associated with zzso brain development from birth to zzso zzso Our present aim was to evaluate whether zzso zzso stress zzso for clinical zzso of zzso is associated with altered cortical thickness in very zzso children at school zzso 

42 right-handed children born very zzso zzso weeks zzso zzso followed zzso from birth underwent 3-D zzso zzso zzso at mean age zzso zzso Children with severe brain injury and major zzso impairment were zzso Regional cortical thickness was calculated using custom developed software utilizing zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso zzso stress zzso as the number of zzso zzso accounting for clinical zzso zzso age, illness severity, infection, mechanical zzso zzso and zzso zzso was examined in relation to cortical thickness using constrained principal component analysis followed by generalized linear zzso 

After correcting for multiple comparisons and adjusting for zzso clinical factors, greater zzso zzso stress was associated with significantly thinner zzso in zzso cerebral regions zzso ranged from zzso to zzso predominately in the frontal and zzso zzso 

In very zzso children without major zzso motor or cognitive zzso zzso zzso stress appears to be associated with thinner zzso in multiple regions at school age, independent of other zzso risk zzso
