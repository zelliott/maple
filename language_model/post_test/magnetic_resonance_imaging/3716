zzso behavior requires choosing effectively between options involving risks and potential zzso zzso studies zzso lateral and zzso prefrontal areas, zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions in specific aspects of zzso However, limited attention is given to how brain networks zzso economic parameters in patterns of zzso zzso Here, healthy participants underwent functional zzso while evaluating zzso gambles presenting potential gains, losses and associated outcome zzso zzso zzso were constructed from analyses of zzso interactions across a comprehensive zzso of brain zzso zzso value correlated positively with activity within zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso and modulated effective connectivity across a network that extended substantially beyond these zzso zzso effective connections were found to be arranged as a zzso small world network in which zzso and zzso prefrontal areas featured as zzso characterized by dense connectivity and high zzso zzso Further analyses revealed that the observed effective connectivity effects were more pertinent to zzso zzso comparisons than to continuous value zzso Factoring expected value into its constituent zzso potential loss modulated connectivity across a subset of the zzso network, whereas potential gain and outcome probability were not significantly embodied in functional zzso Regional response zzso was excluded as an zzso basis to the observed effects, and zzso zzso were confirmed by comparison of dynamic zzso zzso Our findings extend current literature demonstrating that the representation of value is dependent on distributed processing taking across a widespread network which feeds information into a limited set of zzso prefrontal zzso This study also has more general zzso implications for zzso demonstrating the value of explicit modeling of zzso interactions for understanding the neural zzso of zzso zzso
