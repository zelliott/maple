To investigate the feasibility of highly efficient and zzso stem cell zzso for cellular zzso 

A new class of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso was zzso to label rat bone zzso zzso stem cells without secondary zzso zzso The optimal zzso conditions and zzso were zzso and the effect of zzso on cell zzso proliferation activity and zzso differentiation was zzso In 18 rats, focal zzso cerebral injury was induced and the rats randomly injected with zzso cells zzso with zzso 8- or zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso was performed to follow grafted cells in zzso zzso and results were correlated with zzso 

zzso cell zzso conditions involved a concentration of zzso zzso zzso with zzso positive charge and zzso incubation zzso zzso efficiency showed linear change with an increase in the electric zzso of zzso zzso did not affect cell zzso proliferation activity or zzso differentiation zzso The distribution and migration of zzso cells could be detected by zzso zzso confirmed that grafted cells retained the label and remained zzso 

Stem cells can be effectively and safely zzso with zzso zzso zzso in a zzso way for cellular zzso 

zzso Stem cells can be effectively zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect cell zzso proliferation or zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso could be controlled using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could migrate along the corpus zzso towards cerebral zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells retained the label and remained zzso
