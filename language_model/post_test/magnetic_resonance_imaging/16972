zzso resonance imaging zzso has been used to supplement screening zzso and clinical breast examination zzso in women who are at high risk of developing breast zzso In this study, the authors investigated the efficacy of alternating screening zzso and breast zzso every 6 months in women who had a genetically high risk of developing breast zzso 

A retrospective chart review was performed on all women who were seen in a high-risk breast cancer clinic from 1997 to zzso Patients with breast cancer gene zzso zzso who underwent alternating screening zzso and breast zzso every 6 months were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and biopsy results were zzso 

Of 73 patients who met the study criteria, 37 had zzso zzso and 36 had zzso zzso zzso patients zzso completed 1 cycle of zzso and zzso zzso 23 patients zzso completed 2 cycles, 18 patients zzso completed 3 cycles, and patients 11 zzso completed zzso 4 zzso The median follow-up was 2 years zzso zzso zzso Thirteen zzso were detected among 11 women zzso The mean tumor size was 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 patients had bilateral zzso Twelve of 13 zzso were detected on an zzso but not on the screening zzso study that was obtained 6 months zzso One cancer (a zzso focus of zzso zzso in zzso was an incidental finding in a zzso mastectomy zzso One patient had zzso zzso zzso identified on zzso but had no evidence of zzso zzso involvement after zzso chemotherapy and zzso 

In women who were at genetically high risk of developing breast cancer, zzso detected zzso that were not identified on zzso 6 months zzso Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of this screening zzso
