zzso zzso is the leading symptom in essential zzso but in some cases intention zzso and limb zzso emerge and can become highly disabling zzso Deep brain stimulation of the zzso or zzso white matter improve zzso and zzso however, the underlying network mechanisms are zzso To zzso the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation in essential zzso we pursued a zzso approach combining zzso measures of zzso movements, clinical zzso zzso measures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from diffusion zzso zzso Seven patients with essential zzso (age zzso zzso zzso years, two zzso received zzso deep brain stimulation and a clinical examination of severity of limb zzso and zzso at off zzso using therapeutic and zzso stimulation zzso A zzso task based on acoustic cues was also zzso To examine the electrical properties of target structures, we determined the zzso of neural elements zzso A control group of 13 healthy subjects (age 56 zzso zzso years, five zzso underwent zzso diffusion zzso imaging at 3 zzso zzso zzso was applied in healthy subjects from seeds in zzso and zzso to reconstruct the connectivity pattern of the zzso zzso The positions of stimulation zzso in patients were transferred into probability maps and connectivity values were correlated to clinical outcome zzso zzso stimulation improved zzso and zzso mainly during the target period of the reaching paradigm zzso reduction compared with off zzso zzso the acceleration zzso and zzso periods zzso were zzso By contrast, zzso stimulation worsened zzso during the zzso period with a zzso increase of spatial zzso while maintaining near complete suppression of zzso zzso measures were in the range of zzso zzso zzso with significantly different values for the zzso effect of therapeutic stimulation (27 zzso and the zzso effect of zzso stimulation zzso zzso The degree of connectivity to the zzso tract at the stimulating zzso correlated significantly with the reduction of zzso in the therapeutic zzso Our data suggest that stimulation induced zzso reduction and induction of zzso by zzso stimulation are zzso by different zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso tract as a likely target of zzso zzso zzso zzso may be caused by additional recruitment of adjacent zzso systems at higher zzso zzso with short pulse duration may help to increase the therapeutic window and focus on the zzso zzso
