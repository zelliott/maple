At clinical zzso field strengths zzso and 3 zzso quantitative maps of the zzso relaxation time zzso of the zzso reveal diseased tissue without requiring contrast zzso zzso zzso maps can be measured by zzso inversion recovery sequences such as zzso at zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso at a field strength of 7 T has recently become zzso but doubts have remained as to whether zzso inversion is possible in the heart due to subject heating and technical zzso This work extends the repertoire of 7 T cardiovascular zzso by implementing an zzso inversion pulse zzso for use in the heart at 7 zzso A zzso adaptation of the zzso pulse sequence has been introduced together with new zzso that accounts for the possibility of incomplete zzso zzso These methods were validated in zzso and then used in a study of six healthy volunteers to determine the degree of zzso inversion and the zzso of normal zzso at 7 T within a zzso zzso Using a scanner with 16 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso inversion efficiencies ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso perfect zzso would give zzso were zzso across the zzso The zzso zzso was 1925 zzso 48 zzso zzso zzso standard zzso
