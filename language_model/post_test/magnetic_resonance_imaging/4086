In order to evaluate the advantages of zzso MR zzso zzso MR imaging studies were performed in 4 patients with zzso zzso of the zzso and in 12 healthy zzso 

The patients and volunteers were placed inside a custom-made positioning zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences and zzso sequences were obtained during active joint motion from zzso to zzso zzso Eight zzso slices were scanned separately to cover this ankle zzso In each zzso 8 to 10 images were obtained in zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso image quality for analyzing the normal zzso of the ankle was obtained in all zzso At surgery, the zzso zzso was found to be mobile in 3 of the 4 of the zzso In none of these cases was zzso mobility observed on zzso MR zzso No motion of the fragments was observed in the fourth patient, neither at surgery nor on zzso MR zzso 

zzso MR imaging sequences made it possible to produce zzso MR imaging studies of active joint zzso The positioning device was useful for guiding joint motion in patients and for obtaining adequate image zzso
