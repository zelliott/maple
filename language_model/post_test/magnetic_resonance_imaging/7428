zzso skeletal survey or zzso zzso are currently applied to assess bone diseases in patients with zzso plasma cell zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso allows detecting the zzso of zzso cells in nearly the whole bone zzso compartment even before bone destruction has zzso Those zzso results zzso patterns of bone zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be of zzso significance in patients with symptomatic as well as zzso multiple zzso We have therefore analyzed the findings of zzso zzso in 137 consecutive individuals with zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso A focal zzso pattern was detected in zzso of zzso zzso and number of focal zzso as well as value of zzso were of independent zzso significance for progression into a symptomatic disease requiring systemic treatment zzso zzso and zzso zzso Lower homogeneous signal zzso in zzso images were related to a zzso higher bone zzso zzso in younger individuals zzso We conclude that zzso zzso identifies patients with focal zzso of presumably zzso cells in bone zzso with zzso impact concerning the risk of progression into symptomatic zzso
