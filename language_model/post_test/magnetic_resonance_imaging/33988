The zzso effects of single focal zzso on the zzso zzso lobe in rats were investigated by sequential magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso of 200 zzso as a maximum dose using 4 zzso zzso with a gamma unit created an area of necrosis consistently at the target site within 2 weeks after zzso zzso of 100 zzso caused necrosis within 10 weeks, and 75 zzso caused necrosis within one zzso zzso of less than 50 zzso did not induce necrosis consistently, although a restricted area of necrosis was created in the zzso zzso structures including the zzso portion of the zzso zzso 75 zzso may be the optimum dose for creating necrosis consistently in the zzso zzso lobe zzso However, careful dose planning considering both zzso and zzso relationships in necrosis development is necessary to avoid injury to vulnerable neural structures such as the zzso tract when applying zzso techniques to treat functional brain disorders in zzso zzso lobe structures such as zzso lobe zzso
