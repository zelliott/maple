Previous studies have shown that brain functional activity in the resting state is impaired in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso However, zzso in intrinsic brain activity patterns in mild cognitive impairment zzso patients are poorly zzso This study aimed to explore the differences in regional intrinsic activities throughout the whole brain between zzso patients and zzso 

In the present study, zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed on 18 zzso zzso zzso patients, 18 mild zzso patients and 20 healthy elderly zzso And zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso method was zzso 

Compared with healthy elderly subjects, zzso patients showed decreased zzso in the right zzso and zzso cortex, left lateral zzso cortex, and right zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and increased zzso in the left zzso junction zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients showed decreased zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso patients also had decreased zzso in the right zzso zzso cortex, right zzso and bilateral zzso zzso zzso compared with healthy elderly zzso 

zzso intrinsic activities in brain regions closely related to episodic memory were found in zzso and zzso zzso Increased zzso and zzso activity may indicate zzso mechanisms for loss of memory function in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso based on zzso analysis may provide a useful tool in the study of zzso zzso
