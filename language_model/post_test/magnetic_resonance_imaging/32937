zzso hearing loss, or zzso is a major public health problem that causes communication difficulties and is associated with diminished quality of zzso Limited satisfaction with hearing zzso particularly in noisy listening conditions, suggests that central nervous system declines occur with zzso and may limit the efficacy of interventions focused solely on improving zzso This study of 49 older adults zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years; 29 zzso was designed to examine the extent to which low and/or high frequency hearing loss was related to auditory zzso zzso Low and high frequency hearing zzso were obtained from a factor analysis of zzso from these older adults and zzso zzso from an independent sample of older zzso zzso region of interest and zzso gray matter volume associations were observed for the high frequency hearing zzso These effects occurred most robustly in a primary auditory zzso region zzso where there was also elevated zzso fluid with high frequency hearing loss, suggesting that auditory zzso zzso with high frequency hearing zzso These results indicate that zzso is particularly affected by high frequency hearing loss and may be a target for evaluating the efficacy of interventions for hearing zzso
