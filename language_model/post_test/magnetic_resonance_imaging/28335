Using zzso zzso zzso networks as templates, three-dimensional zzso cluster objects were zzso The pore space was filled with water and zzso investigated with the aid of zzso zzso A pulse sequence for zzso spin zzso zzso imaging was employed for the combined record of the three-dimensional zzso distribution and the three-dimensional zzso zzso field of water percolating through the pore zzso An evaluation procedure for the zzso image data was established that reliably renders the characteristic parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso correlation zzso
