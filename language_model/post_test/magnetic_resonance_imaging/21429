The aim of the present zzso study was to explore the zzso zzso of autobiographical memory loss in Alzheimer's patients and healthy elderly, in terms of the delay of zzso with a particular interest in the zzso zzso lobe zzso Fifteen patients in early stages of the disease and 11 matched control subjects were included in the zzso To assess autobiographical memory and the effect of the retention zzso a modified version of the zzso test was used according to five periods of zzso zzso memory deficits were correlated to local zzso via structural zzso using zzso Based zzso We used a zzso zzso to compare the relative contribution of zzso zzso zzso vs zzso left vs right) according to the different periods of zzso Our results confirm the involvement of the zzso proper in autobiographical memory retrieval for both recent and very remote zzso zzso with larger aspect for the very remote period on the left zzso zzso to the prominent zzso involvement for the young adulthood period, the implication of the right zzso prevails for the more recent periods and decreases with the zzso of the zzso which might be associated with the zzso processing of the zzso Finally, we suggest the existence of a zzso zzso depending on the retention zzso with left anterior aspects specifically related to retrieval deficits of remote memories from the young adulthood period, whereas zzso aspects would result of simultaneous zzso and/or consolidation and retrieval deficit of more recent zzso
