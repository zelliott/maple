The zzso of transient zzso zzso zzso in patients without carotid zzso has been linked to zzso zzso hypertension, for their increased zzso vascular resistance, sustained retinal zzso zzso and higher frequency of jugular zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to zzso whether there are anatomical abnormalities at internal jugular vein zzso in zzso patients that would contribute to impaired cerebral zzso drainage and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed in 23 zzso patients who had no carotid zzso and 23 zzso and zzso zzso The veins were assessed at the upper zzso (at zzso zzso and the middle zzso (at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined zzso as zzso 0 zzso normal round or zzso appearance; 1 zzso mild zzso 2 zzso moderate zzso and 3 zzso severe zzso or not zzso 

There was significantly more moderate or severe zzso zzso in the zzso patients at the left upper zzso level and the bilateral middle zzso zzso Defining zzso zzso scores zzso 2 as a significant cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were found to have higher frequency of significant zzso zzso impairment at the upper zzso level zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the middle zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso Patients with the absence of carotid zzso had higher frequency and greater severity of zzso zzso which could impair cerebral zzso zzso Our results provide evidence supporting that the cerebral zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso of zzso
