The present study demonstrates the application of zzso technology to zzso and the interaction of zzso in the rat zzso Specifically, we have observed two different types of zzso signal changes induced by acute zzso heroin administration in rat brains under conditions of spontaneous and artificial zzso Under spontaneous zzso a global decrease in zzso signal was zzso under artificial zzso a zzso increase in zzso signal was identified and the zzso sites are consistent with the distribution of zzso zzso in rat brain as previously reported by zzso Both zzso zzso signal changes were suppressed by zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso and reversed by injection of zzso following heroin zzso These results suggest that zzso has specific advantages in spatial and zzso resolution for studies of zzso and drugs of zzso
