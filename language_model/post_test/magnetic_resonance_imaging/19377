In zzso of right handed individuals the left zzso is dominant for speech and language zzso The evidence for this is accumulated primarily from clinical zzso We investigated cortical topography of language function and zzso in a sample of the right handed population using functional magnetic resonance imaging and two zzso zzso zzso cortical language networks were assessed zzso and zzso by using a zzso zzso As a group, we observed left zzso language zzso zzso the zzso index varied continuously from left zzso dominant to bilateral zzso In zzso language primarily zzso to left, and in zzso approximately half had left zzso and the other half had bilateral zzso Our data indicate that a previous view of female bilateral zzso dominance for language zzso zzso Sex differences in human brain zzso a critical zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Sex differences in the functional organization of the brain for zzso Nature zzso zzso the complexity of cortical language distribution in this zzso Analysis of the distribution of the zzso index in our study allowed us to make this difference in females zzso
