The zzso is a major zzso tract of the zzso a structure critical for normal memory zzso However, the role of structural degradation of the zzso in memory dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment zzso has remained zzso We used diffusion zzso zzso to measure zzso properties of the zzso and the zzso tract zzso as a control zzso in 206 cognitively normal subjects, 76 zzso zzso zzso and 51 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were measured using zzso zzso We found significant fractional zzso reductions in the left zzso and zzso zzso zzso increases in bilateral zzso in zzso but not in zzso compared with zzso No significant changes in the zzso were found in zzso subjects, but zzso subjects showed significantly increased zzso and zzso zzso of the right zzso compared with zzso Increased left zzso zzso measure was correlated with poor verbal memory performance in zzso zzso In addition, reduced zzso integrity of the zzso was associated with zzso zzso in zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso of the zzso is a contributor to early episodic memory dysfunction in zzso zzso
