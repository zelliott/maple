The principle of zzso zzso the zzso of an external imaging method, such as zzso in combination with an zzso into the gastrointestinal tract for zzso zzso also been applied to magnetic resonance imaging zzso We report here on our preliminary experience with a new method of zzso zzso in the upper gastrointestinal zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 32 patients with zzso zzso zzso 8) or gastric diseases zzso zzso 24), mostly tumors zzso zzso zzso Most zzso were at an advanced stage zzso A zzso zzso zzso connected to a zzso zzso zzso scanner was zzso The accuracy of zzso zzso in visualizing and staging gastrointestinal zzso was zzso 

The normal gastrointestinal wall consisted of three zzso and tumors were zzso as having a low signal intensity on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the wall layers was found to be characteristic of zzso zzso images were obtained in seven of eight zzso cases zzso but in only 14 of 24 gastric cases zzso In patients in whom adequate zzso was zzso the zzso zzso results of local and regional staging were consistent with zzso zzso CT and/or zzso results in all six zzso cancer cases and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso (N zzso of the nine patients with gastric zzso 

These preliminary results of zzso zzso are the first to be reported in the English zzso They show the potential of the method for local and regional staging, three-dimensional zzso of zzso being a potential zzso Further technical improvements are zzso
