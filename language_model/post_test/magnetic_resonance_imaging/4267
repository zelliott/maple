The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of zzso ligament reconstruction in zzso immature children with zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso Five consecutive patients zzso age, zzso years; range, 8 to 14 zzso with zzso documented zzso open growth plates and a minimum of 5 zzso of expected remaining growth, underwent zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso treatment included three zzso reconstructions using hamstring zzso and two with zzso zzso zzso All involved a centrally placed zzso or smaller zzso drill hole through an open zzso and graft placement in an over-the-top position on the zzso At an average follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso no patient had a positive anterior drawer, zzso or zzso shift zzso On zzso zzso testing, all patients had 3 zzso or less of increased zzso displacement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging showed that four zzso zzso had fused in a zzso fashion and one was still zzso zzso showed that no patient had a significant leg length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean increase in height zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Overall, using the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso evaluation form, there were four patients with grade A and one with grade zzso The one patient with a poor zzso grade had sustained a subsequent zzso dislocation with zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso reconstruction using small drill holes placed through open zzso zzso does not seem to adversely affect outcome or future zzso
