zzso studies suggest that zzso abnormalities of zzso circuits which involved with emotional and cognitive processing may contribute to the zzso of major depressive disorder zzso zzso treatment which has been reported to reverse the functional abnormalities of zzso circuits in zzso may have treating effects to related brain zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso method to investigate whole brain structural abnormalities in single episode, zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigated the effects of an 8 weeks zzso with zzso 

28 single episode, zzso zzso participants and 28 healthy controls zzso acquired the baseline high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 24 zzso participants acquired a follow-up zzso scan after 8 weeks zzso zzso Gray matter zzso zzso difference between groups was zzso 

zzso zzso had significantly decreased zzso in the right zzso prefrontal zzso and left middle frontal zzso as well as increased zzso in the left zzso and right zzso compared to HC zzso zzso Moreover, treated zzso had significantly increased zzso in the left middle frontal zzso and right zzso zzso compared to HC zzso zzso No difference on zzso was detected between zzso zzso group and treated zzso zzso 

This study of single episode, zzso zzso subjects demonstrated structural abnormalities of zzso zzso the early stage of zzso and the effects of 8 weeks successful zzso treatment, suggesting these abnormalities may play an important role in the zzso of zzso at its zzso
