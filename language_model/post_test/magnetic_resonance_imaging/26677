case report and review of the zzso 

to report on a patient presenting with zzso defects of the arch of the zzso with a rare type of zzso arch zzso This report includes a literature review of the hypothesis for the development of this zzso 

zzso zzso defects of the zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso are the most frequent anomaly, but combined anterior and zzso defects are the least zzso In particular, combined zzso defects of the arch of the zzso with other types of zzso arch zzso not including type A, have not been zzso These anomalies can cause confusion, particularly in the setting of trauma when the zzso finding may be zzso as representing a zzso 

we report here on a 22-year-old man with an zzso zzso of the zzso who complained of neck pain after a traffic zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated zzso defects with sclerotic changes and no evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed only conservative zzso 

the patient improved on conservative therapy without a surgical zzso 

we describe combined zzso defects of the arch of the zzso along with other types of zzso arch zzso Most zzso defects of the arch of the zzso are found during zzso evaluation of neck pain after zzso zzso diagnosis is needed for these patients to avoid confusing these defects with a zzso
