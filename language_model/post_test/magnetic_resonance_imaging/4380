To evaluate the role of zzso zzso and zzso MR in identification of surface landmarks of the cerebral zzso and to determine the reference values of zzso distances of each zzso in healthy infants and children on MR zzso 

Two hundred zzso cerebral zzso of 35 healthy infants and 72 healthy children were zzso evaluated from 107 routine MR brain zzso The surface landmarks of the zzso and zzso distances of each hemisphere, which were zzso divided into anterior zzso distance zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso distance zzso zzso zzso were recorded from zzso zzso and zzso MR images, zzso The mean value of anterior zzso distance of each zzso was obtained by averaging two linear zzso of the anterior zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso planes of the same zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso distance of each side of the brain was obtained from averaging of two zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The landmarks of the zzso were best identified by zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso The average values of left anterior zzso distance, right anterior zzso distance, left zzso zzso distance, and right zzso zzso distance in infants were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in children, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly wider zzso distances than zzso Left anterior zzso distance was significantly wider than right in zzso but not in zzso Male children displayed a more significant increase in anterior zzso distance than did female zzso There was no statistic difference in zzso of anterior zzso distance and zzso zzso distance between female and male zzso 

The zzso should be evaluated with MR in three zzso zzso may show conspicuous zzso fissures that should not exceed zzso zzso zzso + 2 zzso zzso on zzso and zzso planes and zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Healthy children who have fully developed zzso should have an anterior zzso distance of no more than zzso zzso and a zzso zzso distance of zzso zzso
