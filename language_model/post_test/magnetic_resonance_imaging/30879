It is controversial whether the effects of aging on various cognitive functions have the same common cause or several different zzso To investigate this issue, we scanned younger and older adults with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while performing three different tasks: working memory, visual attention and episodic zzso There were three main zzso First, in all three tasks, older adults showed weaker zzso activity and stronger prefrontal and zzso activity than younger zzso The zzso reduction is consistent with the view that sensory processing decline is a common cause in cognitive aging, and the prefrontal increase may reflect functional zzso zzso older adults showed more bilateral patterns of prefrontal activity than younger adults during working memory and visual attention zzso These findings are consistent with the zzso zzso Reduction in Older Adults zzso zzso Finally, compared to younger adults, older adults showed weaker zzso formation activity in all three tasks but stronger zzso activity in the episodic retrieval zzso The former finding suggests that age-related zzso deficits may have a global effect in zzso and the latter is consistent with an age-related increase in zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that both common and specific factors play an important role in cognitive zzso
