It is unknown whether regional measures of skeletal muscle zzso in the thigh and abdomen accurately reflect zzso zzso zzso 

We aimed to determine whether thigh and abdominal zzso measures reflect zzso zzso mass and, if so, which region is a stronger zzso 

zzso and regional measures of zzso were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of zzso white men and zzso 

The regional zzso measures, whether obtained by using a single image zzso or zzso zzso or a series of 7 consecutive images covering 31 zzso zzso or zzso were strongly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Independent of sex, the thigh zzso measures derived from a single image zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso or a series of 7 consecutive images zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso were stronger zzso of zzso zzso with smaller SEE values than were the abdominal zzso measures zzso zzso zzso However, zzso in the abdomen was also a strong marker of zzso zzso whether determined from a single image at the zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso or from a series of images across the abdomen zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso 

Although thigh measures of zzso are better zzso of zzso zzso a single image within the abdomen routinely used to estimate abdominal fat may also be a useful marker of zzso zzso
