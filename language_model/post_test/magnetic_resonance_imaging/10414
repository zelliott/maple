zzso of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of zzso auditory structures remains challenging because of the zzso zzso movement of both the zzso and the zzso fluid and involved, until now, special zzso zzso and zzso techniques, which are not convenient in clinical zzso The aim of this study is to examine the zzso in both cortical and zzso auditory structures by means of an zzso zzso which is suitable for clinical zzso 

Twenty subjects (13 volunteers and 7 zzso were examined on a 3 T imaging system with zzso musical zzso 

Both cortical and zzso auditory structures are successfully zzso in volunteers and zzso 

zzso of both the cortical and zzso auditory structures can be zzso by means of an appropriate zzso setup at 3 zzso This paradigm can easily be used in patients with tumors and/or hearing zzso
