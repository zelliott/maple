The zzso arrangement of zzso blood flow in the zzso of zzso zzso generates a zzso of oxygen tension between the zzso zzso and the zzso tip that results in a state of relative zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso implications of zzso zzso has been hampered by the absence of a zzso technique to estimate zzso zzso in different zones of the zzso In the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a method on the basis of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso which allows sequential zzso in humans in response to a variety of zzso pharmacological stimuli in health and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were obtained in healthy young human subjects zzso zzso zzso and the effects of three different zzso maneuvers that induce zzso were zzso zzso relaxation rate, zzso was measured, which is directly related to the amount of zzso in blood and in turn to tissue zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso 6 each) increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso consistent with the separate sites of action of these zzso in the zzso and with previous direct zzso of their effects in zzso rats with oxygen zzso A new finding is that water zzso improves zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in young human subjects zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be used to monitor changes in zzso zzso in humans in a zzso zzso
