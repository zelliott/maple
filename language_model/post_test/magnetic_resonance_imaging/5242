There is evidence to suggest that obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso is associated with structural abnormalities in zzso zzso yet the extent of white matter abnormalities is not well zzso In this study, we used diffusion zzso imaging zzso to examine white matter integrity in specific regions of interest zzso in patients with zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso healthy controls underwent zzso The primary objective was to explore whether patients with zzso had white matter abnormalities in the anterior limb of the internal capsule zzso the zzso zzso the zzso of the corpus zzso and the zzso The secondary objective was to evaluate the relation between fractional zzso and mean zzso in these zzso and other clinical variables (including age at onset of zzso zzso severity and levels of depressive and anxiety zzso in patients with zzso 

There were 15 patients and 17 controls enrolled in our zzso Compared with healthy controls, patients with zzso showed increased fractional zzso in bilateral regions of the zzso adjacent to the body of the zzso as well as decreased fractional zzso in the right anterior limb near the head of the zzso Patients also had decreased mean zzso in the body of the right zzso and the left anterior zzso compared with zzso zzso analyses revealed significant associations of fractional zzso and mean zzso in select circuits with zzso depression and anxiety severity zzso 

zzso of patients with zzso receiving zzso may have been a zzso In addition, the patients were zzso in terms of their obsessive-compulsive symptom zzso we did not distinguish between different obsessive-compulsive symptom zzso 

The study results provide further evidence for zzso white matter abnormalities in the zzso and zzso consistent with a zzso zzso model of zzso
