The accurate zzso zzso of the target and/or zzso at risk zzso is essential in treatment planning for zzso radiation therapy zzso Although many automatic zzso zzso approaches have been proposed, few of them can fulfill the zzso of applications in terms of accuracy and zzso Moreover, clinicians would like to analyze the characteristics of regions of interests zzso and adjust contours manually during zzso zzso tool for zzso zzso is necessary in such zzso In this work, a novel approach of curve fitting for interactive zzso zzso is zzso It allows users to quickly improve contours by a simple mouse zzso Initially, a region which contains interesting object is selected in the image, then the program can automatically select important control points from the region boundary, and the method of zzso cubic zzso is used to fit the control zzso zzso the zzso curve can be revised by moving its control points zzso Meanwhile, several curve fitting methods are presented for the zzso Finally, in order to improve the accuracy of zzso zzso the process of the curve refinement based on the maximum zzso magnitude is zzso All the points on the curve are revised automatically towards the positions with maximum zzso zzso Experimental results show that zzso cubic zzso and the curve refinement based on the maximum zzso magnitude possess superior performance on the proposed platform in terms of zzso zzso and time zzso Experimental results of real medical images demonstrate the efficiency, zzso and zzso of the proposed process in clinical zzso
