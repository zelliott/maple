To determine levels of zzso molecules in blood and zzso fluid zzso samples from patients with different zzso and activities of multiple sclerosis zzso and to assess the effect of intravenous zzso sodium zzso treatment on the levels of soluble zzso zzso 

The expressions of very late zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso function associated zzso 1 zzso vascular cell zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were determined zzso and levels of soluble zzso zzso and zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso The volumes of zzso and zzso zzso plaques and brain zzso were determined by means of the semiautomatic magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso 

A university hospital in zzso 

One hundred subjects (71 patients with zzso and 29 healthy control zzso The zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso and zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso on immune cells from blood were at least zzso to zzso higher than in controls zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso expression in blood was more zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso molecules on zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were of similar zzso but the proportions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were 3- to zzso higher than in controls zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The levels of serum soluble zzso were higher in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of patients with zzso in zzso caused a significant reduction in the serum levels of soluble zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the volumes of zzso plaques correlated with the serum level of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso molecules in blood and zzso indicate sustained potential for inflammation in the zzso throughout the clinical spectrum of zzso zzso interfering with cell zzso may be of key importance in suppressing zzso
