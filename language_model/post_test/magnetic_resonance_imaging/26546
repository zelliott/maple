Generally accepted zzso to using a zzso approach for zzso of tumors that arise in or extend into the zzso region include a zzso zzso zzso normal zzso function, and adherence of tumor to vital zzso zzso Thus, the zzso approach has traditionally been restricted to the removal of tumors involving the zzso zzso and, occasionally, to zzso extensions of such tumors if the zzso is zzso However, conventional zzso approaches to the zzso region require significant brain zzso and offer limited zzso of zzso tumor extension and the interface between the tumor and adjacent structures, such as the zzso third zzso zzso apparatus, and major zzso In this paper the authors describe successful removal of zzso tumors by using a modified zzso approach that zzso some of the traditional zzso to zzso surgery, while avoiding some of the disadvantages of zzso zzso Four patients zzso tumors zzso zzso and two zzso that arose in the zzso region and were located either entirely (three zzso or primarily (one zzso within the zzso zzso All patients had a zzso zzso zzso zzso three of the four patients had significant zzso deficits signifying involvement of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two patients exhibited zzso visual field zzso For tumor zzso a recently described modification of the traditional zzso approach was zzso Using this zzso one removes the zzso portion of the zzso zzso allowing access to the zzso zzso Total zzso of tumor was achieved (including absence of residual tumor on follow-up zzso in three of the four zzso In the remaining patient, total removal was not possible because of adherence of tumor to the zzso and zzso One zzso zzso fluid leak zzso zzso zzso function was worse than zzso function in one zzso No other new zzso zzso or neurological deficits were zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a modified zzso approach for zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso
