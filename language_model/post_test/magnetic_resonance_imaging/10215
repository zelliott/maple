The zzso and Hawkins zzso signs are commonly used to diagnose zzso pathology, but the anatomy of these maneuvers has not been well zzso in zzso This zzso open magnetic resonance imaging study characterized shoulder anatomy and rotator cuff zzso in 8 normal volunteers placed in the zzso and Hawkins zzso zzso and zzso contact of the rotator cuff was zzso and minimum distances were zzso between the zzso zzso sites and the zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso and Hawkins maneuvers significantly decreased the distance from the zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso and from the zzso zzso to the anterior zzso However, the Hawkins position resulted in significantly greater zzso space narrowing and zzso rotator cuff contact than the zzso zzso In the Hawkins position, zzso contact of the zzso and zzso was observed in 7 of 8 and 5 of 8 subjects, zzso In contrast, rotator cuff contact with the zzso did not occur in any subject in the zzso zzso zzso contact of the zzso with the zzso zzso was observed in all subjects in both zzso zzso contact with the anterior zzso was also seen in 7 of 8 subjects in the zzso position and in all subjects in the Hawkins zzso This extensive zzso contact suggests that internal zzso may play a role in the zzso and Hawkins zzso
