zzso zzso Index zzso has been used in the detection of overt liver zzso zzso In the present prospective study we evaluated the use of zzso in the differential diagnosis of liver zzso 

We have included in our study 76 patients with focal zzso zzso and 39 subjects as control zzso All patients were evaluated by Color zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging and zzso The zzso performed zzso zzso was blind from the final diagnosis of the other zzso 

zzso zzso in the control group ranged from zzso to zzso zzso value zzso in 42 cases with benign zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and in 34 cases with zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso There was a statistically significant difference in zzso zzso between the control group and group zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso may differentiate zzso from benign focal zzso zzso and therefore can be used as a screening test in the routine clinical zzso
