To study the relationship of upper zzso spine degenerative disc zzso changes on MR imaging in patients with neck zzso The relation between upper zzso and cervical spine degenerative disc disease is not well zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients referred with cervical pain were zzso There were 73 women and 77 men with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years zzso 19 to 83 zzso All MR studies were performed with a large zzso zzso covering at least from the body of T4 to the zzso zzso were coded as normal, zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso disc zzso changes were observed in zzso of patients with cervical zzso zzso was the most commonly affected level of the upper zzso spine, with 15 zzso and one zzso Upper degenerative zzso disc zzso changes presented in older patients than the cervical levels zzso test, P zzso zzso zzso disc zzso changes at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly correlated ( P zzso zzso but unrelated to any other disc disease, patient's gender or zzso zzso cervical disc disease was closely related together ( P zzso zzso but not with any zzso zzso 

A statistically significant relation was found within the upper zzso discs, reflecting common zzso zzso The absence of relation to cervical segments is probably due to differences in their zzso
