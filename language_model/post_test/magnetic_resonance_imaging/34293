The middle zzso zzso area of the zzso of the monkey is involved in visual motion zzso Previous studies using zzso techniques have shown that the area around the anterior zzso zzso in man is zzso to the area zzso of the zzso In this study, we investigated the cortical components of zzso visual evoked zzso and their topography in the visual zzso of zzso 

Visual evoked zzso to the onset of a visual motion stimulus zzso were recorded from 5 normal subjects aged 25 to 34 zzso A random dot pattern was used as the stimulus for the zzso The dots moved zzso to the right and then to the left alternately for 500 milliseconds with zzso intervals of 1500 zzso The speed of motion was varied in five steps from zzso zzso Fifteen zzso were placed on the zzso around zzso at zzso zzso Color zzso maps showing the distribution of zzso over the 15 zzso at zzso ranging from zzso milliseconds with a zzso zzso were made for each zzso These were zzso with three-dimensional magnetic resonance images of the same brain to specify the topography of the main components of the zzso in relation to the zzso and zzso pattern of the visual zzso 

We consistently observed a positive wave with a peak zzso of about 100 milliseconds zzso and a negative wave with a peak zzso of about 150 milliseconds zzso for all zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was dominant in a relatively wide area zzso to zzso whereas zzso was dominant in a relatively small area zzso to the right anterior zzso zzso which included the area corresponding to the area zzso in zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso represents the activity of the area zzso in the human visual zzso related to motion zzso
