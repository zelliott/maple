A critical question for neuropsychology is how complex brain networks react to zzso Here, we address this question for the well-known executive control or zzso zzso system, a zzso network showing increased activity with many different kinds of cognitive demand, including standard tests of fluid zzso Using zzso we ask how focal frontal lobe damage affects MD activity during a standard fluid intelligence zzso Despite poor behavioral performance, frontal patients showed increased zzso activity relative to zzso The zzso difference was not accounted for by difference in zzso Moreover, rather than specific focus on zzso or zzso cortex, additional recruitment was distributed throughout the MD regions and surrounding zzso and included zzso MD regions distant from the zzso The data suggest that, following local frontal lobe damage, there is a global zzso recruitment of an zzso and integrated zzso zzso
