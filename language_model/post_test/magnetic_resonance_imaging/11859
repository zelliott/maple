In this report we evaluate an image registration technique that can improve the information content of zzso image data by zzso matching of zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of the prostate are registered with zzso T zzso zzso The method involves rigid and zzso registration using zzso finite element zzso zzso zzso T MR imaging is conducted with the patient zzso using an zzso zzso while zzso the patient is in the zzso position with a zzso zzso in zzso We have previously observed that these changes in patient position and zzso filling produce a shape change in the zzso The registration of zzso T zzso images depicting the prostate zzso zzso central zzso zzso and peripheral zone zzso to zzso T zzso MR images using this method can facilitate the zzso of the zzso of the zzso for radiation treatment zzso After creating and zzso a zzso of manually segmented zzso from images obtained in ten sequential zzso zzso cases, we conducted a set of experiments to assess our hypothesis that the proposed registration system can significantly improve the quality of matching of the total zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results showed that the method zzso improves the quality of match zzso to rigid zzso raising the zzso similarity zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, to zzso zzso and zzso A zzso measure of registration agreement was also improved by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes are not changed by the zzso indicating that the method maintains the zzso zzso of the zzso Although this strategy was tested for zzso zzso the preliminary results from these experiments suggest that it may be applied to other settings such as zzso zzso therapy, where the integration of zzso zzso may have a significant impact upon treatment planning and zzso
