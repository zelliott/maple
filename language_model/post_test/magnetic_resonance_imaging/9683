Two previous clinical trials investigating zzso as an adjunct therapy for zzso zzso have zzso Recently a pilot study has demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso zzso The aims of this study were to zzso the effects of zzso on zzso injury and to investigate the optimal zzso protocol for a future clinical zzso Pigs zzso were zzso and a normal pig temperature of zzso was established utilizing an zzso temperature modulating zzso The pigs were zzso to a combination zzso group zzso of zzso saline solution and zzso zzso zzso or to zzso controls zzso A zzso balloon was then inflated in the zzso for zzso zzso or zzso with zzso induced during the last zzso Furthermore, zzso induced by cold saline alone zzso and prolonged combination zzso during zzso zzso were also zzso zzso size and area at risk were determined ex zzso after zzso of zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All pigs in the combination zzso group were cooled to zzso within zzso Combination zzso reduced zzso by zzso compared with zzso controls despite zzso longer zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso Cold saline did not reduce zzso zzso zzso treatment after onset of zzso by an additional zzso over that used in a previous paper did not zzso any additional zzso The zzso effects of zzso treatment are due to an zzso of zzso injury during both zzso and zzso The results suggest that a zzso protocol using a cold saline infusion and zzso cooling enables zzso to be induced in a clinical setting without delaying zzso zzso
