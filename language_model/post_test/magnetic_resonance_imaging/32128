Current MR imaging criteria for multiple sclerosis zzso do not specify the magnetic field zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether different MR imaging field strengths, specifically zzso MR imaging, have an impact on the zzso of patients with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of zzso according to MR imaging and diagnostic zzso 

In a prospective zzso comparative study, we examined 40 patients with clinically isolated syndromes zzso zzso with a zzso T and zzso MR imaging system, including zzso sections of zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery, and zzso zzso before and after injection of zzso zzso zzso resolution parameters were used for both field zzso zzso white matter zzso with a size of zzso zzso were counted and zzso according to their zzso location in zzso zzso zzso zzso and other white matter zzso Assessment of the fulfilled zzso MR imaging and McDonald diagnostic criteria was made separately for both field strengths in every zzso 

Eleven patients fulfilled more MR imaging criteria at zzso Two of these patients fulfilled the criterion of dissemination in space zzso according to the first definition of McDonald criteria, which is based on imaging criteria zzso Another patient had zzso only at zzso according to the second definition of the McDonald criteria including zzso zzso 

MR field strength, specifically zzso MR imaging, has a substantial influence on the zzso of patients with zzso according to imaging and a mild influence on the zzso according diagnostic criteria for zzso leading to consequences for zzso zzso imaging guidelines, and clinical zzso
