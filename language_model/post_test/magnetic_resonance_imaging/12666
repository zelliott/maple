It has been shown in blind patients that the abolition of sensory input can lead to changes in zzso and cortical zzso zzso Here the zzso and zzso changes found with whole brain zzso zzso in 16 patients with complete chronic unilateral zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso removal several years prior are reported zzso zzso deficits in spatial memory and navigation were previously shown in patients with right zzso Images of the brains of zzso patients were flipped, standard zzso steps were performed, and the data were zzso Patients showed a zzso volume reduction in the zzso due to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso as well as in the zzso and superior zzso zzso areas involved in the zzso cortical network, and in the zzso area zzso There was no correlation with behavioral navigational zzso No zzso zzso was found in the insular cortical zzso region or the zzso both of which receive bilateral zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso showed zzso reduction on the opposite side; this was possibly due to reduced auditory zzso which is known to cross at this zzso In comparison to healthy controls, no regional increases in zzso volume were zzso No zzso changes were detected at the selected zzso
