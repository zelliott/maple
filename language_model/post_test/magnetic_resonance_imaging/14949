zzso in the zzso zzso have varying consequences among zzso zzso Such variations are indicative of evolutionary transitions in the zzso cortical contribution to visually guided zzso However, little is known about the role of the zzso zzso in visually guided behavior in chimpanzees due to ethical concerns about invasive experiments and zzso limitations such as the inability to monitor gaze zzso We had the opportunity to study the behavioral consequences of a deficit in the zzso zzso in a zzso with a naturally occurring zzso zzso in her right zzso zzso We assessed the zzso ability to detect a small light probe zzso visual degree, zzso contrast zzso zzso presented at several locations in the visual field while monitoring gaze direction using an zzso remote zzso recently introduced to studies of great zzso The results showed the zzso was unable to detect the probe in the lower left zzso of the visual field, suggesting severe loss of contrast sensitivity in a part of zzso field that is zzso corresponded to the zzso of the zzso A zzso with a naturally occurring deficit in the right zzso zzso and the availability of remote zzso technology presented a unique opportunity to compare the role of the zzso lobe in visually guided behavior among various zzso zzso
