Recent studies have claimed that language functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso can identify language zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso and that zzso findings are highly zzso with the conventional assessment procedure of speech dominance, the zzso zzso test zzso 

To establish the power of language zzso to detect language zzso during zzso assessment, we compared the findings of a semantic decision paradigm with the results of a standard zzso in 68 patients with chronic intractable right and left zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who zzso underwent a zzso evaluation zzso The patient group also included 14 zzso subjects with zzso zzso or right zzso zzso Four zzso used a visual analysis procedure to determine the zzso of zzso zzso individually for each zzso 

zzso zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was best in zzso patients with left zzso In zzso patients, language zzso identified zzso right zzso speech dominance in every case, but missed left zzso speech dominance in zzso zzso zzso had higher zzso with the zzso than did zzso in zzso or combined regions of interest zzso Because of zzso problems, recognition of bilateral speech was zzso 

These data provide evidence that language zzso as used in the present study has limited correlation with the zzso especially in patients with zzso and with mixed speech zzso Further refinements regarding the zzso and analysis procedures will be needed to improve the contribution of language zzso for zzso zzso
