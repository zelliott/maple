zzso zzso increase with advancing age and can lead to falls and loss of zzso Brain zzso also occurs in older age and may contribute to gait zzso We aimed to investigate global and regional relationships of cerebral gray and white matter volumes with gait speed, and its zzso step length and zzso in older zzso 

In a zzso study, participants aged zzso years without Parkinson's disease or brain zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging and gait zzso using a computerized zzso Linear zzso was used to study associations of total gray and white matter volumes with zzso adjusting for each other, age, sex, height and white matter zzso zzso Other zzso considered in analyses included weight and vascular disease zzso zzso zzso was used to study regional relationships of gray and white matter with zzso 

There were zzso participants, mean age zzso zzso years, zzso male, mean gait speed zzso zzso zzso Smaller total gray matter volume was independently associated with poorer gait speed zzso and step length zzso but not zzso Smaller volumes of cortical and zzso gray matter in bilateral regions important for motor control, vision, perception and memory were independently associated with slower gait speed and shorter zzso No global or regional associations were observed between white matter volume and gait independent of gray matter volume, white matter zzso volume and other zzso 

Smaller gray matter volume in zzso distributed brain networks serving motor control was associated with slower gait speed and step zzso but not zzso
