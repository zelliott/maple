Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso measured the early vascular changes after administration of zzso zzso or zzso combined with zzso in breast tumor zzso 

Groups zzso of nude mice bearing human breast zzso were injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso + zzso on day 0, zzso zzso was performed on days 0, 1, 2, and 3, and thereafter tumors were collected for terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling and zzso zzso 

zzso measured a significant K zzso change within 3 days after zzso therapy that correlated with tumor growth arrest, which was not shown with statistical significance by zzso at these early time points zzso The K zzso changes followed zzso zzso zzso 

zzso detected significantly lower K zzso levels in breast tumor zzso following zzso zzso or combined therapy with zzso
