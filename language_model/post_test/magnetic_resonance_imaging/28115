zzso zzso dynamic zzso was used to diagnose 115 zzso tumors in 55 zzso With this technique 10 zzso images were made during a single zzso achieving nearly complete liver zzso Early enhancement images were obtained 20 s after intravenous zzso injection of zzso zzso The detection rate of zzso zzso zzso was greater with zzso zzso dynamic imaging zzso than with conventional spin echo techniques zzso because the 10 early enhancement images obtained during a single zzso showed the zzso dominant phase throughout the entire zzso In cases of zzso zzso zzso 44 zzso of the 51 zzso showed rapid enhancement on zzso dominant phase images, and 44 zzso were demonstrated as zzso or low intensity areas on delayed zzso In cases of zzso zzso peripheral enhancement was demonstrated in 25 zzso of the 28 zzso on zzso dominant phase images, and partial or complete zzso zzso was identified in all zzso on delayed zzso In patients treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso dynamic imaging technique allowed evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness by revealing the zzso of each zzso without the influence of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso dynamic zzso should be used on patients with suspected zzso tumors and in follow-up studies after zzso
