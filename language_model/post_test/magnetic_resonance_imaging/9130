Most people born deaf and exposed to oral language show scant evidence of sensitivity to the zzso of speech when processing written zzso In this respect they differ from hearing zzso However, occasionally, a zzso deaf person can achieve good processing of written language in terms of zzso sensitivity and zzso and in this respect appears zzso We report the pattern of zzso zzso zzso in such a deaf reader while performing a zzso on written words with similar spelling endings that do not provide rhyme zzso The left inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso and the left inferior zzso lobe showed greater zzso for this task than for a zzso identity matching zzso This participant was special in this regard, showing significantly greater zzso in these regions than a group of hearing participants with a similar level of zzso and reading zzso In addition, zzso showed zzso in the left zzso zzso a region which did not show zzso zzso in the other zzso The pattern of zzso in this exceptional deaf reader was also unique compared with three deaf readers who showed limited zzso zzso We discuss the possibility that this pattern of zzso may be critical in relation to zzso decoding of the written word in good deaf readers whose zzso reading skills are indistinguishable from those of hearing zzso
