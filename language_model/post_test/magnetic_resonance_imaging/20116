To determine whether a zzso zzso acquisition method improves the definition of zzso tissue zzso and zzso automated AT zzso compared to an zzso zzso 

The study included 10 zzso Two zzso volumes were acquired from each subject using two different flip zzso zzso zzso maps were calculated from each pair of zzso zzso AT was automatically segmented from the zzso maps and from the original image zzso The results were evaluated using manually segmented slices as zzso 

The zzso method segmented more of the reference AT than the zzso method, with mean values zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Compared to the zzso method, the zzso method gives better zzso separation of AT in zzso zzso The suggested method also provides an output with smaller zzso AT intensity zzso 

The zzso method improves the definition of zzso zzso analysis is superior to analysis based on the original images, and allows fully automated and accurate zzso AT zzso
