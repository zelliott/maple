zzso of visual recognition place different emphasis on the role of zzso zzso Previously, we showed that arbitrary semantic associations influenced visual recognition of novel zzso Here, the neural zzso of this effect was zzso During a visual task, novel objects associated with arbitrary semantic features produced more zzso in frontal and zzso zzso than objects associated with zzso Because the task required no semantic zzso access to zzso appears to be zzso The brain regions involved have been implicated in semantic processing, thus recently acquired zzso activate a similar network to zzso learned over a zzso
