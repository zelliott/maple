Although up to zzso of patients with whiplash injury develop chronic headache, the basis and mechanisms of this zzso headache are not well zzso 

zzso patients with zzso headache following whiplash injury were investigated within 14 days after the accident and again after 3 months using magnetic zzso zzso zzso Twelve patients developed chronic headache lasting longer than 3 months and were studied a third time after 1 zzso 

Patients who developed chronic headache revealed decreases in gray matter in the anterior zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso after 3 zzso These changes resolved after 1 year, in parallel to the zzso of zzso The same patients who developed chronic headache showed an increase of gray matter in zzso zzso centers, thalamus, and zzso 1 year after the zzso 

We demonstrate zzso gray matter changes of pain processing structures in patients with chronic zzso headache in regard to zzso zzso thus providing a biologically plausible basis for this common, disabling zzso
