To study the impact of zzso treatment planning on zzso parameters in zzso dose rate zzso zzso zzso for cervical zzso Additionally, we investigated the potential benefit of an zzso zzso modification of the classical tandem zzso zzso 

For 24 patients we compared Standard zzso zzso plans, zzso Standard plans and zzso zzso zzso The total zzso prescribed dose to Manchester point A or to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso was 80 zzso in 17 patients zzso I) and 84 zzso in 7 patients zzso zzso The constraints to 2 zzso of the zzso were 90 zzso for zzso and 75 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso Most cases were treated with a traditional zzso tandem zzso zzso In 6 patients we used a newly designed combined zzso modification for the second zzso fraction and investigated the benefit of the zzso zzso 

The average gain of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the two zzso The dose to 2 zzso of the zzso met the zzso In the group that was treated with the combined zzso approach, we could increase the zzso zzso for the second zzso fraction with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso treatment planning and zzso improves the zzso parameters compared to conventional planning zzso Additional improvement can be achieved by using a combined zzso zzso
