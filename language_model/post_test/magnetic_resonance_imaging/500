To examine the integrity of the default mode network in patients with Parkinson disease zzso Previous functional zzso experiments have studied executive deficits in patients with zzso with regard to zzso brain zzso However, recent studies suggest that executive performance also relies on the integrity of the default mode network zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso cortex, zzso and lateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso characterized by a zzso of these cortical areas during the performance of executive zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate cortical zzso during a zzso task zzso and manipulation of short-term memory zzso compared with a simple zzso matching zzso In addition, a functional connectivity analysis was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Seven patients with mild to moderate zzso (not taking zzso and 7 healthy zzso 

zzso zzso 

Both groups showed comparable zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso but different zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso Compared with controls, patients with zzso not only showed less zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso they even demonstrated a reversed pattern of zzso and zzso zzso analysis yielded that in contrast to healthy individuals, zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso nucleus were functionally disconnected in zzso 

We describe specific malfunctioning of the default mode network during an executive task in zzso This finding is zzso linked to zzso depletion and may critically contribute to the understanding of executive deficits in zzso
