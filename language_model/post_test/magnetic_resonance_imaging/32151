In relation to the adult brain, the immature brain might be more vulnerable to damage during and following traumatic brain injury, particularly in zzso zzso Given well-established evidence of corpus zzso zzso we hypothesized that anterior zzso volume zzso quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso in this structure would be decreased in children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury relative to typically developing zzso Second, given the zzso role of the anterior zzso in zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso lobe white matter, zzso zzso volume, and injury severity zzso zzso zzso zzso would be zzso of decreased anterior zzso zzso volume in patients with traumatic brain zzso Finally, we wished to establish the relationship between the anterior zzso and the zzso zzso a major zzso tract into the zzso zzso using diffusion zzso imaging zzso maps for each zzso We also hypothesized that children with traumatic brain injury would exhibit decreased fractional zzso in relation to typically developing children in a fiber system including the anterior zzso and the zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso volume was observed in patients with traumatic brain injury, and, as predicted, anterior zzso and zzso zzso volumes were positively related to each other and to higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume was not independently zzso of anterior zzso volume in the overall zzso zzso zzso imaging fractional zzso values differed between the groups for the zzso zzso zzso system, with the traumatic brain injury group exhibiting decreased fractional zzso The anterior zzso like the corpus zzso appears to be highly vulnerable to zzso degenerative changes resulting from mechanisms such as the direct impact of zzso progressive zzso injury as tissue in other brain regions zzso or zzso zzso This is the first systematic examination of anterior zzso zzso following traumatic brain injury using in zzso quantitative zzso and diffusion zzso imaging fiber tracking in pediatric zzso
