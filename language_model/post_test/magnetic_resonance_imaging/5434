Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging zzso have increased occupational exposure to magnetic zzso In this study, we examined the assessment of occupational exposure to zzso magnetic fields and zzso magnetic fields generated by motion in zzso zzso magnetic fields of zzso zzso These magnetic field components can be measured simultaneously with an induction zzso setup that detects the time rate of change of magnetic flux density zzso The setup developed was used to measure the field components around two zzso units (1 T open and 3 T zzso The measured values can be compared with zzso reference levels derived from magnetic flux density reference levels given by the International Commission on zzso zzso Protection zzso The measured zzso zzso values were above the zzso reference levels for both zzso zzso The measured values for the zzso fields zzso zzso imaging zzso and fast field echo zzso zzso also exceeded the zzso reference levels in positions where the medical staff may have access during zzso zzso The highest zzso zzso values were zzso T zzso for the 1 T scanner and 3 T zzso for the 3 T scanner when only the zzso field was zzso Even higher values zzso T zzso were measured for simultaneous exposure to zzso and zzso fields in the vicinity of the 3 T zzso
