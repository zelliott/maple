To investigate the correlation between the magnetic resonance imaging findings and subsequent surgical findings for a series of dogs presenting with suspected zzso stick injuries to the Animal Health Trust, zzso between 1995 and zzso 

zzso resonance imaging findings were reviewed for patients undergoing a scan of the zzso or cervical area for suspected foreign bodies during the years 1995 to zzso 

Case zzso history and clinical signs were similar to those reported in previous zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated foreign material in six of seven cases where this was zzso There was good correlation between diagnosis of a foreign body at magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent surgical zzso 

Compared with other imaging zzso magnetic resonance imaging is very helpful for this type of injury, especially in chronic cases where zzso evidence of a foreign body is zzso It is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of zzso penetration injury and in surgical zzso
