zzso magnetic resonance imaging was performed to determine the changes in water diffusion and to investigate the zzso of diffusion zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso maps of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso were created of 19 patients with cerebral zzso five with zzso zzso four with zzso four with zzso four with zzso and five with zzso zzso zzso was increased in chronic cerebral zzso and zzso and decreased in acute cerebral zzso zzso and the marginal area of zzso compared with the zzso of the normal gray zzso There was a significant difference in zzso between the marginal and internal areas of zzso Increased zzso may be due to increased zzso zzso in zzso and a lack of significant restriction of diffusion within zzso zzso zzso can be attributed to restricted diffusion caused by zzso zzso in zzso and the underlying zzso pattern of densely packed tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso of the internal capsule was less zzso in pathological than normal zzso zzso zzso was less zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were thought to have influenced the zzso of the brain structures and cells, resulting in decreased zzso The measurement of zzso by zzso magnetic resonance imaging has the potential for greater understanding of the zzso changes in various zzso disorders, including correct diagnosis of cerebral zzso and zzso diagnosis of brain zzso
