zzso studies indicate that between 5 and 9 percent of US children exhibit significant deficits in mathematical reasoning, yet little is understood about the brain zzso features related to mathematical zzso In this work, zzso zzso zzso analyses have been performed on magnetic resonance images of the brains of 79 third graders to investigate whether there is a correlation between brain zzso features and mathematical zzso Group comparison was also performed between zzso zzso zzso math zzso and zzso zzso zzso where each zzso consists of 20 age and gender matched zzso zzso analysis is based on the analysis of the deformation fields generated by zzso registration zzso which zzso the individual volumes to a common zzso To evaluate the effect of registration zzso on zzso results, five zzso registration zzso have been zzso zzso the zzso Bases Algorithm zzso zzso the Image Registration zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Image Registration zzso zzso the Automatic Registration zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso available in zzso The deformation field magnitude zzso was used to measure the displacement at each zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso local zzso zzso zzso show there are no statistically significant zzso differences between the NC and the MD groups using zzso However, zzso analysis using zzso found statistically significant anatomical variations between the two groups around the left zzso cortex, left zzso cortex, and right insular zzso zzso of agreement between at least two zzso based on zzso analysis were used to define zzso of Interest zzso to perform an zzso correlation analysis on all 79 zzso zzso between average zzso values and standard mathematical scores over these regions were found to be zzso We also found that the choice of registration zzso has an impact on zzso results, so we recommend using more than one zzso when conducting zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses zzso to investigate brain anatomical features related to mathematical performance in a relatively large population of zzso
