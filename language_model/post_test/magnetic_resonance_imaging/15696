To develop and validate a new multiple zzso technique for the separation of flip angle effect in pulmonary apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso zzso and human zzso The zzso sequence is modified from a standard zzso echo zzso sequence with a zzso progression in the bipolar zzso zzso with each zzso In the zzso phantom experiment, four images were acquired with base zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in the pig and human experiment, six images were acquired with base zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso measured in the phantom experiment was zzso zzso zzso zzso The measured uncertainty curve was consistent with the theoretically predicted zzso The measured in zzso zzso values (three zzso slices in the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for pig and human experiments, zzso 

With the introduction of a zzso progression in the zzso zzso the multiple zzso technique is capable of separating the flip angle effect in zzso zzso In addition, this technique can perform a rigorous measurement uncertainty analysis and provide the optimal scan parameters that yield best noise zzso
