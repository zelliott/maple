Bone zzso cells zzso labeled with iron particles can be injected into the heart and detected with zzso Improvement in zzso of zzso cells would be zzso This study examined if double contrast with iron oxide and zzso enhances cell zzso after zzso transplantation in zzso zzso Ten pigs with zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso delivery of zzso alone zzso I, zzso zzso 3) or mixed with zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before and 1 zzso after systemic zzso administration produced regions of interest with zzso that were compared to zzso regions for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All hearts were harvested for gross and microscopic zzso Areas of focal zzso corresponding to the zzso were detected in the zzso in Group zzso Early after administration of zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no zzso in Group zzso zzso examination confirmed presence of zzso cells and zzso in corresponding segments of the zzso The distribution of zzso was similar between the zzso Double contrast with cellular iron and zzso in surrounding zzso resulted in improved cell zzso by zzso
