The zzso gene has been associated with episodic memory in several recent zzso carriers of the zzso show enhanced episodic memory performance relative to zzso Gene expression studies in human and zzso species show high levels of zzso in the zzso particularly in the zzso The goal of the present study was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso is also associated with volume differences in the human zzso and whether specific zzso are zzso affected by zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to manually segment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso as well as adjacent zzso zzso lobe zzso in healthy carriers and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Overall, we found that zzso had a larger zzso volume relative to zzso The structural differences observed were specific to the CA fields and zzso regions of the zzso suggesting a potential neural mechanism for the effects of zzso on episodic memory performance reported zzso
