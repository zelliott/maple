zzso zzso zzso design is a type of zzso constrained zzso A practical problem in zzso zzso zzso design using the zzso zzso descent zzso method is that wire elements move at different rates along zzso directions zzso zzso zzso and tend to zzso breaking the zzso A zzso zzso zzso descent zzso method is presented to overcome this zzso This method takes advantage of the efficiency of the zzso method combined with momentum zzso which is also an intrinsic property of the zzso algorithm, to adjust step sizes along the three zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso inner diameter, three axis zzso zzso zzso for rat imaging was developed based on this method, with an efficiency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso along X, Y, and zzso zzso Experimental data demonstrate that this method can improve efficiency by zzso and field uniformity by zzso This method has also been applied to the design of a zzso zzso for the human brain, employing remote current return zzso The benefits of this design include improved zzso field uniformity and efficiency, with a shorter length than zzso zzso designs using zzso return zzso
