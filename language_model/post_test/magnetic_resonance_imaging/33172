To determine the association between silent zzso zzso zzso on baseline brain zzso and zzso stroke in young adults with zzso zzso zzso 

This was a zzso retrospective study of adult patients aged zzso years with zzso zzso stroke investigated by brain zzso between 2002 and zzso Silent brain zzso zzso were defined as focal zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso without corresponding focal symptoms, and zzso was defined as zzso zzso or zzso zzso on zzso zzso The primary outcome was zzso zzso A forward zzso Cox zzso model was used to determine whether zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso 

A total of zzso eligible patients were identified in the zzso 89 did not undergo zzso imaging and 12 patients had inadequate zzso leaving a study population of 170 zzso zzso demonstrated zzso in 48 of 170 zzso zzso No patients had isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migraine with aura zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso Mean follow-up duration was 25 zzso 7 zzso Among patients with zzso 11 of 48 zzso had a zzso stroke vs 8 of 122 zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso Cox regression, zzso remained independently associated with zzso stroke zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as did the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In adults zzso 50 years old with zzso zzso stroke, zzso are common and independently predict zzso zzso
