Advances in resting state zzso and diffusion weighted imaging zzso have led to much interest in studies that evaluate hypotheses focused on how brain connectivity networks show variations across clinically disparate zzso However, various sources of error zzso zzso zzso magnetic field zzso and motion zzso leak into the data, and make downstream statistical analysis zzso In small sample size studies, such noise have an unfortunate effect that the differential signal may not be identifiable and so the zzso hypothesis cannot be zzso Traditionally, smoothing is often used to filter out zzso But the construction of zzso with a zzso kernel is not well understood on arbitrarily connected zzso Furthermore, there are no direct zzso of zzso theory for zzso which allow to view the signal at multiple zzso We provide rigorous zzso for performing zzso analysis on brain connectivity zzso These are based on the recent theory of zzso zzso We provide strong evidence, on brain connectivity data from a network analysis study zzso connectivity differences in adult zzso bipolar zzso that the proposed zzso allows identifying statistically significant network variations, which are clinically zzso where classical statistical tests, if applied directly, zzso
