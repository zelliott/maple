zzso of nervous system involvement by zzso a zzso infection, is not well zzso We investigated patterns of nervous system involvement and determined if zzso abnormalities correlated with clinical manifestations of zzso 

We reviewed 23 MR imaging studies (17 of brain, six of zzso and seven CT scans of brain in 23 patients zzso male and nine female zzso age range zzso zzso with positive zzso zzso in their serum and zzso 

Twelve patients had central nervous system zzso involvement, four had peripheral nervous system zzso involvement, two had combined zzso and zzso involvement, and five had isolated hearing zzso Imaging findings were zzso five of seven brain CT studies were normal, and 10 of 23 MR studies were normal zzso brain, one zzso one zzso One brain CT study showed zzso zzso mild zzso enhancement, left zzso zzso and diffuse white matter zzso One other brain CT study showed enhancement of the zzso in addition to white matter zzso zzso MR findings were zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso nerve root enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region zzso zzso 1), diffuse white matter changes zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients improved after treatment with three zzso drugs for zzso zzso Seven patients had follow-up zzso the enhancement disappeared but the white matter and zzso changes persisted despite almost complete clinical zzso 

zzso correlation in zzso varies from a normal imaging study despite positive clinical findings, to a variety of imaging abnormalities that reflect either an inflammatory process, an zzso process, or a vascular zzso
