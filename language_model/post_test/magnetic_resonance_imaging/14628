The performance of zzso zzso magnetic field modeling is compared to dedicated wire patterns for the generation of zzso harmonic zzso shapes as these are the workhorse for spatial zzso and magnetic field homogenization in MR imaging and zzso To this end, an example 48 channel zzso setup is analyzed and shown to be capable of generating all first through fourth order zzso shapes over small and large zzso relevant for MR zzso The zzso efficiency for the generation of linear zzso fields shares the same order of magnitude with classic and state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso zzso field modeling becomes progressively more efficient with the synthesis of more complex field shapes that require the combination of multiple zzso zzso The possibility of a zzso zzso of both magnetic field shapes and generation performance with the zzso approach are discussed with emphasis on the possible zzso between the field accuracy and generation zzso zzso zzso has been shown previously to outperform current zzso zzso Along with the efficiency gains of zzso zzso shown here, the zzso concept has the potential to zzso replace conventional zzso systems that are based on sets of dedicated zzso coils and zzso allow optimal zzso zzso solutions similar to zzso zzso zzso
