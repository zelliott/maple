We assessed zzso in six zzso zzso patients zzso group), in comparison with that observed in 20 patients with vascular zzso zzso zzso and 24 zzso patients without organic central nervous system zzso disease zzso zzso Using zzso MR images, five zzso of the zzso were zzso the zzso of the rostrum zzso body zzso and zzso zzso the anterior to zzso length zzso and the maximum height zzso Next, the corpus zzso index zzso was calculated as zzso + zzso + zzso 

All zzso patients had white matter zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso on the initial zzso zzso Compared with that observed in the zzso and zzso zzso groups, the zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso group (with zzso group, zzso with zzso group, zzso 

This study showed significant zzso of the zzso in all zzso patients on the initial zzso scans obtained zzso months after zzso We propose that the early appearance of zzso frequently accompanied by high-intensity in the zzso and/or zzso on zzso images is an important diagnostic clue to zzso
