To explore the zzso of zzso stress disorder zzso by studying default mode network during the resting state in patients with zzso after zzso traumatic zzso 

zzso zzso patients and 20 matched normal controls received the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Left and right zzso zzso zzso was regarded as seed region respectively, and the functional connectivity about whole brain was assessed by using zzso functional connectivity zzso 

Compared with control group, the patients with zzso showed that the brain area with decreased functional connectivity included left superior frontal zzso and right zzso zzso while the brain area with increased functional connectivity included right zzso right superior zzso zzso and right middle zzso zzso 

The brain default mode network of zzso patients is abnormal in resting zzso These abnormalities might be the zzso mechanisms of zzso
