The combination of zzso and zzso also known as Hartsfield syndrome, represents a unique genetic zzso An zzso zzso mode of transmission has been suggested for this condition based on the observation that male patients have zzso been zzso Thus far, no candidate genes have been suggested on the X zzso We report a male patient with a full-blown Hartsfield syndrome zzso who had zzso at zzso involving four zzso He presented with bilateral zzso of the hands (both hands had four fingers with a deep gap between the 2nd and 3rd zzso zzso lip and zzso and a depressed zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging of the brain revealed zzso zzso His zzso zzso was zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Whole Human Genome zzso array revealed a zzso at zzso of 210 zzso zzso testing revealed that the deletion was derived from the zzso zzso Of the genes on the duplicated zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso appeared to be the most likely to explain the patient's zzso From a clinical standpoint, it is important to point out that the zzso who performs relatively well with zzso and has a zzso zzso around 70, has survived multiple life-threatening episodes of zzso Awareness of the risk of zzso is of great importance for the anticipatory management of patients with zzso and an oral zzso even in the absence of overt zzso
