To zzso compare zzso patients zzso and adult patients (AP) affected by Crohn's disease zzso in terms of the location and activity of zzso zzso 

zzso children zzso age zzso and 43 adults zzso age zzso with proven CD underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso to zzso zzso and detect their activity in 9 segments of the small and large zzso The results were zzso on a per patient and per segment zzso zzso was performed in all zzso P values less than zzso were considered statistically zzso 

zzso of terminal zzso was significantly different in the two groups: observed in zzso of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the colon was diseased in zzso of zzso versus zzso of zzso In particular, left zzso segments were significantly more involved in zzso zzso colon zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso colon zzso versus zzso not zzso whereas zzso involvement was equal in both zzso In children the zzso disease activity was found in left zzso zzso whereas in adults it was in the terminal zzso 

zzso detected significant differences between the two zzso showing a more extensive and severe involvement of the left colon in children but the zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso is useful for assessing Crohn's disease in adult and zzso zzso zzso Adult and zzso patients show different zzso involvement on zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso involved in adults zzso the left colon in zzso zzso The causes of the severe left zzso disease in children are zzso zzso The extensive zzso involvement in children has zzso zzso
