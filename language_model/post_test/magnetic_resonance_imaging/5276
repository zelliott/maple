To identify which rest phase zzso or zzso is optimum for assessing or measuring cardiac structures in the setting of three-dimensional zzso zzso imaging in zzso heart disease zzso 

The study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was zzso Fifty children zzso male and 24 female zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structures were analyzed for zzso ratio zzso and image zzso zzso zzso were taken of the zzso arch, right zzso zzso zzso tract zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso distributed variables were compared by using paired zzso tests, and zzso data were compared by using zzso zzso zzso 

Mean zzso and image quality were significantly (all P zzso zzso greater in zzso for the right atrium zzso zzso vs zzso image quality, zzso vs zzso left atrium zzso zzso vs zzso image quality, zzso vs 29), RV zzso zzso vs zzso image quality, 131 vs 23), zzso zzso zzso vs zzso image quality, 125 vs zzso and pulmonary veins zzso zzso vs zzso image quality, zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and zzso image quality was higher for the left pulmonary artery (238 vs zzso P zzso zzso right pulmonary artery zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and for imaging of an area after an zzso zzso zzso vs 7; P zzso zzso All zzso arch and zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso greater in zzso zzso point of arch, 70 vs 53 zzso descending zzso 71 vs 58 zzso zzso arch, zzso vs 275 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 268 zzso zzso zzso 337 vs 280 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 259 zzso 

Certain structures in zzso are better zzso in zzso and others in zzso and therefore, the zzso approach allows a higher overall success zzso This approach also allows depiction of diameter changes between zzso and zzso and is therefore preferable to standard zzso sequences for the planning of zzso zzso
