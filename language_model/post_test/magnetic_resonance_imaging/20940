Left zzso zzso right zzso zzso and left zzso zzso volumes and functions contain important zzso information in zzso heart zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso has high spatial resolution, this method may be optimal to obtain this zzso 

We evaluated automated assessment for zzso by comparing it with cardiac magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso patients with previous zzso zzso were scanned with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso volume, zzso volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction zzso were assessed for the left and right zzso with automatic zzso software and manual zzso zzso zzso zzso mass and zzso changes in LA volume were zzso 

The mean age of patients was 61 zzso 10 years, 40 zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was possible in all but 2 zzso The average duration of image processing was 21 zzso 4 minutes by zzso and 11 zzso 4 minutes by zzso zzso plots showed good agreement between zzso and zzso with only small zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso mean difference of zzso zzso of agreement, zzso to zzso and P zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso mean difference of zzso zzso of agreement, zzso to zzso and zzso zzso LA fractional change by zzso was zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso mean difference of zzso zzso of agreement, zzso to zzso and P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and LA volumes and functions may be evaluated fast and reliably with the use of automated assessment and cardiac zzso with good agreement to zzso zzso assessment of cardiac chambers with zzso appears possible in clinical zzso
