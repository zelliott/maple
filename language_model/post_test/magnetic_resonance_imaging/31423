To zzso assess right zzso zzso function after the Ross procedure by using magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The local ethics committee approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment in the zzso zzso patients (15 male, two zzso mean age zzso standard zzso 19 years zzso zzso imaging performed zzso years after surgery zzso zzso and 17 matched controls (15 male, two zzso mean age zzso standard zzso 20 years zzso zzso were studied by using MR zzso Standard zzso and zzso zzso imaging sequences were used to assess zzso valve function, zzso and zzso RV function, and RV zzso The zzso zzso U test and the zzso rank correlation zzso were used for statistical zzso 

Minor degrees of zzso zzso zzso flow zzso between zzso and zzso zzso across the zzso zzso were found in 12 of 17 patients but not in controls zzso zzso zzso A larger RV mass was present in Ross patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, impaired zzso RV function was found, as shown by a decreased mean zzso valve early filling zzso contraction phase zzso peak flow zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Peak flow zzso across the zzso valve correlated with RV mass zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso valve zzso peak flow zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso RV zzso function was normal in Ross patients zzso RV ejection zzso zzso zzso 8 vs 51% zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

RV zzso and RV zzso dysfunction are frequently observed in patients after the Ross zzso even in the absence of overt zzso zzso RV zzso function is still zzso
