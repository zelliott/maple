The zzso magnetic field of zzso scanners can be affected by environmental zzso zzso resonance zzso and functional imaging with zzso zzso imaging zzso are particularly vulnerable to the movement of zzso vehicles, trains and other large metallic masses in the zzso This work investigates the sensitivity of two different imaging techniques to assess disturbances of the zzso magnetic field: zzso phase changes in zzso images of a uniform test object; and zzso image displacement along the phase zzso direction in zzso zzso zzso For the latter a zzso sample was used, and the separation between zzso and zzso signals was taken as a zzso Both techniques were evaluated in a site known to be free of any significant environmental disturbances and validated by inducing a magnetic field zzso Both techniques provide valuable information in acceptance tests, allowing zzso users to evaluate and manage the environmental conditions surrounding a zzso The zzso zzso technique was found to be highly sensitive, being expected to detect magnetic field fluctuations down to zzso parts per million zzso The phase images method was found to be less sensitive zzso zzso but is more easily zzso The zzso zzso technique was used in acceptance tests and environmental disturbances to the magnetic field of the order of zzso zzso were measured at the zzso on two separate zzso
