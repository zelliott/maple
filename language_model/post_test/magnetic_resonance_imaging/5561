zzso zzso zzso is the ability to zzso the relationship between items zzso zzso after having learned a set of premise pairs zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies in humans have identified a distributed neural network, including cortex, zzso and thalamus, during zzso zzso We studied two aspects of zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects who had acquired the zzso sequence zzso of visual zzso First, the identification of novel pairs not containing end items zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with greater left zzso zzso compared with the identification of novel pairs containing end items A and zzso This demonstrates that the identification of stimulus pairs requiring the flexible representation of a sequence is associated with zzso zzso Second, for the three novel pairs devoid of end items we found greater right zzso zzso for pairs zzso and zzso compared with pair zzso This indicates that zzso decisions on pairs derived from more adjacent items in the sequence are associated with greater zzso zzso zzso zzso thus scales with the degree of zzso processing necessary for zzso zzso Both findings confirm a role of the zzso in zzso zzso in zzso
