Current methods of monitoring chronic zzso in a single joint rely on clinical examination derived zzso such as the detection of zzso zzso This study aimed to develop a zzso method for zzso the volume of zzso lining in chronic zzso using contrast enhanced magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The knees of 18 patients with chronic zzso were examined zzso zzso A zzso zzso weighted zzso sequence was used to evaluate the zzso enhancement of zzso structures after intravenous zzso zzso lining volume was calculated from zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso images with zzso and zzso zzso Eleven patients were examined before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 weeks) and MR data compared with changes in clinical examination derived zzso of disease zzso 

zzso lining volume varied from zzso zzso The zzso of variation in volume calculation was zzso for a single observer and was zzso for two zzso zzso lining volume was zzso in all patients where zzso lining zzso could not be detected zzso A decrease in zzso lining volume of zzso zzso was associated with an improvement in zzso lining zzso detected zzso zzso in zzso lining volume were zzso by MR in two of three patients where changes in clinical examination derived zzso were zzso 

A zzso method of zzso the volume of zzso lining in patients with chronic zzso has been zzso MR measurement of zzso lining volume may zzso changes in chronic zzso that remain unidentified by clinical zzso
