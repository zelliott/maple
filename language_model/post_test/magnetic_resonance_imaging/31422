To zzso zzso with magnetic resonance zzso imaging, long-term outcome of the brain after zzso versus zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso One hundred zzso zzso men, 91 zzso mean age zzso standard zzso 51 years zzso zzso patients were randomly assigned to surgical versus zzso treatment of the zzso aneurysm with 138 zzso zzso 71 zzso MR examinations 1 year after zzso The presence, zzso volumes, and cause of zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso zzso and Student zzso zzso Furthermore, correlation between zzso brain zzso zzso intensity zzso zzso on zzso and zzso MR images and zzso outcome was evaluated by using zzso correlation zzso 

Only 44 zzso of 138 patients had no zzso associated with zzso According to intention to treat, zzso were more frequent after surgical rather than zzso treatment, zzso in the frontal zzso zzso zzso 50, zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso vs zzso zzso 15 zzso P zzso zzso zzso Only zzso patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso in the parental artery territory were more frequent in surgical zzso zzso 33 zzso than in zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso P zzso zzso patients, with corresponding mean zzso volumes of zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in remote vascular territories were equal in frequency and zzso zzso injuries were common in the surgical zzso zzso 40, zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso volumes correlated with zzso test zzso 

zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso MR images are more frequent after early surgical rather than zzso treatment of the zzso aneurysm, and zzso volumes correlate with the zzso test zzso
