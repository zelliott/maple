zzso zzso schizophrenic zzso patients exhibit altered neuroendocrine activity that has been linked to their life-threatening water zzso as well as to impaired function and reduced volume of the anterior zzso zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit similar, albeit less zzso changes in neuroendocrine activity and anterior zzso function, but not reduced anterior zzso zzso Indeed, reduced anterior zzso volume is seen in patients with normal water balance zzso zzso zzso zzso whose neuroendocrine activity and anterior zzso function differ markedly from those with zzso In an effort to reconcile these findings we measured zzso zzso and 3rd zzso shapes in 26 schizophrenic patients (10 zzso 7 zzso 9 zzso and 12 healthy controls matched for age and zzso zzso inward zzso were localized to the anterior lateral zzso surface zzso of a zzso which zzso neuroendocrine responses to psychological zzso in zzso and to a lesser extent in zzso while zzso in zzso were restricted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the right zzso amygdala, a key segment of this zzso were seen in both zzso groups, and correlated with the volume of the 3rd zzso which lies adjacent to the neuroendocrine zzso Finally, these structural findings were most marked in those with impaired zzso stress zzso These results reconcile previously conflicting data, and support the view that anterior lateral zzso pathology zzso neuroendocrine function in zzso patients with and without zzso The relationship of these findings to the underlying mental illness remains to be zzso
