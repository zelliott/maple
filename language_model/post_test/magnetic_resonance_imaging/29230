We studied 33 patients with zzso of different grades zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso MR zzso zzso We found that in zzso of the zzso the presence of signals in the area of zzso zzso assigned to zzso in zzso zzso correlated with signal enhancement after zzso zzso We suggest that visibility of zzso signals could be due to zzso barrier damage, which is characterized by contrast agent zzso
