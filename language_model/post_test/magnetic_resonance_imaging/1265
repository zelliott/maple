A test phantom for evaluating magnetic resonance image contrast was constructed using separate chambers filled with zzso zzso zzso solutions of different zzso The zzso were chosen so that the relaxation times produced were distributed over the range appropriate for human zzso in brain zzso zzso solutions had relaxation properties similar to those of white matter, gray matter, and brain zzso The region surrounding the chambers was filled with a sodium zzso solution with zzso similar to that of brain tissue so that zzso signal zzso would be zzso When magnetic resonance relaxation response zzso were obtained with the zzso relaxation contrast and latitude could be compared for different imaging pulse zzso zzso responses for zzso echo sequences differed considerably when the flip angle was zzso
