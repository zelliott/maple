zzso lung imaging has the potential to offer many new insights into mechanisms of pulmonary zzso While the physiologist has access to a number of techniques to evaluate lung function, such as multiple zzso gas elimination technique or the injection of zzso these techniques have significant zzso including lack of spatial information or low spatial resolution and, in the case of zzso an inability to make zzso in zzso The functional imaging techniques based on magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso hold substantial zzso In this article, specific issues related to the MR evaluation of pulmonary blood flow, including zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the technique, are discussed to highlight some of the important zzso issues that affect functional zzso Additional zzso considerations include the zzso zzso of blood flow, and the effects of posture, breath zzso and zzso The relationships between these many factors and the collection of regional pulmonary zzso data are zzso
