zzso planning, or zzso navigation of hip surgery, including zzso procedures such as zzso or zzso procedures such as total zzso needs to be performed with a high degree of accuracy to ensure a successful zzso The ability to precisely zzso the hip joint rotation zzso may prove to be very useful in this zzso The human hip joint has been shown to be a zzso shape, and therefore the accurate location of the hip joint zzso zzso cannot be zzso simply as the zzso of a zzso This study describes a method for determining the zzso by applying a zzso shape to the zzso cartilage surface of magnetic resonance images, in order to increase the accuracy of the zzso location which had previously been calculated by a functional method using reconstructed three-dimensional surface zzso zzso By zzso a zzso shape to the zzso it was possible to compensate for zzso calculation zzso
