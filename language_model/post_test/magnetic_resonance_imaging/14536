The capacity of sex to modify behavior in health and illness may stem from biological differences between males and zzso One such zzso to the biological definition of zzso inequality of X zzso zzso Studies of Turner zzso zzso suggest that zzso profoundly alters zzso brain zzso However, use of zzso as a model for X zzso zzso is complicated by zzso zzso background genetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso to better isolate X zzso effects on brain development and identify how these overlap with zzso sex differences, we used zzso structural imaging to study zzso mice zzso of zzso and zzso zzso alongside their zzso normal male and female zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso of zzso vs zzso differences in a set of sexually zzso structures including classical zzso of zzso action, such as the bed nucleus of the zzso terminal and zzso amygdala, zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities that zzso those reported zzso and zzso abnormal development of brain systems relevant for zzso of altered zzso and emotion in both zzso and human zzso Our findings suggest an unexpected role for zzso genes in shaping sexually zzso brain development, and an zzso zzso influence of zzso genes on both cortical and zzso development in zzso Furthermore, our zzso findings highlight the bed nucleus of the zzso zzso and zzso gray matter as novel zzso candidates for closer study in zzso zzso of these data with existing zzso knowledge generates a set of novel, testable hypotheses regarding candidate mechanisms for each observed pattern of anatomical variation across zzso zzso and zzso zzso
