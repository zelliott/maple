zzso auditory sensitivities and familiarity with the sounds of language give rise to clear influences of zzso categories on adult perception of zzso With few exceptions, current models endorse highly zzso mechanisms responsible for the influence of zzso category on speech perception, based primarily on results from functional imaging and zzso zzso Here we directly test the hypothesis that the right zzso does not engage in zzso zzso By using zzso to identify cortical sites sensitive to zzso in both word and zzso zzso zzso we find evidence that zzso zzso sensitivity is limited to a zzso zzso We extend the interpretation of these zzso results through the study of an individual with a zzso zzso who is zzso zzso for initial acoustic and phonetic analysis of zzso This zzso performance revealed that the right zzso alone was insufficient to allow for typical zzso category effects but did support the processing of zzso phonetic information in zzso zzso Taken together, these findings confirm previous claims that the right zzso zzso does not play a primary role in zzso processing, but they also indicate that zzso context may zzso the involvement of a right zzso largely tuned for less abstract dimensions of the speech zzso
