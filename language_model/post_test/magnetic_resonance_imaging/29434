The frequency of zzso findings in septic zzso was as zzso zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso joint zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso fluid enhancement zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed bare area changes zzso abnormal zzso signal zzso abnormal zzso enhancement zzso and abnormal zzso signal zzso Associated zzso more often showed zzso signal abnormalities and was zzso 

zzso enhancement, zzso zzso and joint zzso had the highest correlation with the clinical diagnosis of a septic zzso However, almost a third of patients with septic arthritis lacked an zzso zzso zzso zzso if it was diffuse and seen on zzso zzso the highest association with zzso zzso
