To study different methods of CT and MR images fusion in patient treated by zzso for localized prostate zzso To compare the results of the zzso study realized on CT slices and images zzso 

Fourteen cases of patients treated by zzso were zzso zzso The CT examinations were realized with zzso section of zzso zzso and MR images were obtained with a surface zzso with zzso section of 3 zzso zzso For the images fusion process, only the zzso weighted MR sequence was zzso Two processes of images fusion were realized for each patient, using as reference marks the bones of the pelvis and the implanted zzso A quantitative and qualitative appreciation was made by the operators, for each patient and both methods of images zzso The zzso study obtained by a dedicated software was realized on CT images and all types of images zzso The usual zzso indexes zzso zzso and zzso were compared for each type of zzso 

The quantitative results given by the software of images fusion showed a superior accuracy to the one obtained by the pelvic zzso reference zzso zzso qualitative and quantitative results obtained by the operators showed a better accuracy of the images fusion based on zzso zzso For two patients out of three presenting a zzso inferior to 145 zzso on CT examination, the zzso was superior to this norm when the zzso was based on images fusion, whatever the method zzso 

The images fusion method based on implanted seed matching seems to be more precise than the one using zzso reference zzso The zzso study realized on images fusion could allow to rectify possible zzso mainly due to difficulties in surrounding prostate zzso zzso on CT zzso
