zzso in body fluid estimates between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods may be due to the use of a uniform value of tissue zzso to zzso zzso fluid volume zzso and zzso fluid volume zzso zzso may also arise from the exclusion of fluid volumes of hands, feet, neck, and head from zzso due to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to define the specific zzso of various body segments and to use those values for zzso of zzso and zzso along with a correction for zzso fluid zzso zzso maintenance zzso patients (16 zzso underwent body composition analysis including whole body zzso whole body zzso zzso content, zzso and sodium zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso all performed on the same day before a zzso zzso zzso was determined from zzso zzso mass zzso by zzso zzso status of zzso (by zzso and sodium zzso tissue resistance (by zzso and segment zzso zzso zzso was higher and zzso zzso of zzso was lower in men compared with zzso zzso zzso values for arm, zzso and leg all differed from the uniform zzso used in traditional zzso zzso Estimates for whole body zzso zzso and total body water from zzso using zzso instead of uniform zzso values and after adjustment for zzso fluid volumes of the body did not differ significantly from zzso zzso The uniform tissue zzso values used in traditional zzso zzso result in zzso of zzso zzso and total body zzso Use of zzso zzso values combined with adjustment for body volumes that are neglected by traditional zzso technique significantly improves zzso of body fluid volume in zzso zzso
