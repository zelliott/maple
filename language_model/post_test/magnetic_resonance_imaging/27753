Many factors can jeopardize the accuracy of deep brain stimulation zzso lead zzso Confirmation of lead placement while the patient is still in the operating room would be zzso zzso zzso or CT can identify placement zzso but these zzso can be zzso or time zzso zzso zzso may give information on the accuracy of the Y zzso but the accuracy of the X coordinate usually cannot be zzso When an object of known dimensions is present in the brain, such as a unilateral zzso lead, its dimensions can be used to calculate unknown zzso The objective of this study was to determine if zzso zzso skull zzso accurately predicts the distance between zzso zzso using zzso zzso as the gold zzso 

The distance between 32 pairs of zzso leads was measured by 2 independent zzso under blinded conditions on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accounted for using the formula: actual distance between 2 leads zzso zzso distance between zzso zzso measured length of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The mean zzso zzso distance on zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed no difference based on method zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso showed excellent zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso accurately predicts the distance between zzso zzso The technique is especially useful when the location of the first zzso lead relative to the zzso is known, such as during staged bilateral procedures or lead replacement zzso
