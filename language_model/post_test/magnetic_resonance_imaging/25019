zzso the relationship between the structural and functional organization of the human brain is one of the most important goals of zzso Individual zzso in brain structure means that it is essential to obtain this information from the same zzso To date, this has been almost zzso Even though zzso functional imaging techniques such as functional zzso zzso are now zzso there is no complementary zzso structural zzso We present an in zzso method of examining the detailed zzso of any individual, which can then be correlated with that zzso own functional zzso This method zzso high-resolution structural zzso to identify distinct cortical regions based on cortical zzso zzso We demonstrate that the observed MR zzso patterns relate to zzso through a correlation of zzso with zzso In zzso high-resolution zzso studies identify zzso cortex, as well as visual area zzso in four individuals, as defined by using zzso The anatomical identification of a cortical area zzso outside of zzso zzso is a significant advance, proving it possible to identify zzso cortical areas and demonstrating that in zzso structural mapping of the human cerebral zzso is zzso
