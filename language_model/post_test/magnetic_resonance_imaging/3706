The abilities to empathize and to zzso two fundamental dimensions of cognitive style, are characterized by apparent individual zzso These abilities are typically measured using an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to reveal any correlations between zzso and zzso scores and regional gray matter volumes in healthy children by applying zzso zzso to magnetic resonance zzso We collected zzso of brain structure and administered children's versions of the zzso and zzso questionnaires zzso and zzso zzso to 261 healthy children aged zzso zzso zzso zzso data were zzso zzso and smoothed using an zzso zzso zzso zzso Next, we analyzed the correlation between regional gray matter volume and zzso and zzso scores adjusting for age, sex, and zzso zzso The zzso scores showed significant positive correlations with the regional gray matter volumes of the left zzso and superior zzso zzso including the zzso zzso the inferior frontal zzso the superior zzso zzso and the zzso which are functionally related to zzso zzso Additionally, zzso scores showed a significant negative correlation with the regional gray matter volume of the left zzso zzso cortex, which is functionally involved in selective attention zzso Our findings suggest that individual differences in cognitive style pertaining to zzso or zzso abilities could be explained by differences in the volume of brain structures that are functionally relevant to zzso and zzso
