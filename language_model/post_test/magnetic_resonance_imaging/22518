The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic ability of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso in the detection and zzso of prostate cancer, zzso compared with zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso were performed on 39 patients with zzso zzso zzso levels greater than 4 zzso and suspicious findings at zzso ultrasound zzso All patients underwent a zzso zzso biopsy within 30 days according to a subdivision of the prostate into zzso All studies were interpreted by a dedicated zzso who reported the areas of interest as normal, zzso or suspicious on zzso At zzso cancer was defined as possible if the ratio of zzso plus zzso to zzso exceeded mean normal peripheral zone values by two standard zzso zzso or as zzso if that ratio exceeded the normal value by three zzso zzso and zzso findings were zzso correlated with findings obtained from individual biopsy zzso 

zzso and zzso alone had sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of prostate cancer equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso when zzso and zzso were zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso findings and biopsy results yielded no significant zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso provides a significantly higher specificity in the detection of zzso as compared with zzso alone and can be recommended as a problem-solving zzso before biopsy in patients with high zzso levels and suspicious zzso
