The introduction of zzso zzso zzso systems zzso simultaneous recording from the entire brain surface has established zzso as a clinically feasible method for the evaluation of patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso In zzso zzso two types of zzso spike zzso could be zzso an anterior vertical and an anterior horizontal zzso zzso zzso can be used to attribute spike activity to zzso lobe zzso Whereas the anterior vertical zzso is compatible with zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso the anterior horizontal zzso can be explained by zzso activity of the zzso tip zzso In zzso zzso zzso and lateral vertical zzso were found which could distinguish between zzso and lateral zzso seizure onset zones as evidenced from invasive zzso In zzso zzso zzso could clarify the spatial relationship of the structural zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of patients with persistent zzso after zzso surgery may represent another clinical important application of zzso because magnetic fields are less influenced than electric fields by the prior zzso zzso zzso and invasive zzso recordings indicate that zzso activity restricted to zzso zzso structures cannot reliably be detected on zzso and that an extended cortical area of at least 6 to 8 zzso involving also the zzso zzso lobe is necessary to produce a zzso zzso zzso In lateral zzso zzso zzso seems to be more sensitive than zzso which further zzso the potential role of zzso for the study of zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore can be regarded as a valuable and clinically relevant zzso method for the evaluation of patients with zzso
