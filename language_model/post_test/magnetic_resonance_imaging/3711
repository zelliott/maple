zzso zzso the process by which small blocks of semantic information are combined into a coherent zzso has been studied with various types of zzso However, whether the brain zzso reported in these studies are attributed to semantic unification per zzso or to other zzso zzso processes still remains zzso The neural basis for semantic unification in sentence comprehension was examined using zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso The semantic unification load was manipulated by varying the goodness of fit between a critical word and its preceding context (in high zzso low zzso and violation zzso The sentences were presented in a serial visual presentation zzso The participants were asked to perform one of three tasks: semantic zzso judgment zzso silent reading for comprehension zzso or font size judgment zzso in separate zzso The zzso results showed a similar zzso zzso zzso by the semantic unification load across all of the three zzso The brain zzso associated with the semantic unification load were found in the anterior left inferior frontal zzso zzso in the zzso task and in a widespread set of regions in the other two zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso reflects a semantic zzso which is different from other brain zzso that may reflect zzso strategic zzso
