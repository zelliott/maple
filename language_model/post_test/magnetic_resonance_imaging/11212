The anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso in selective attention, working memory zzso zzso and behavioral zzso zzso with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in these mechanisms during selective attention and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso have not been specifically investigated during behavioral zzso whose deficits may relate to salient schizophrenic features such as foresight abnormalities and impaired social functioning and zzso We thus studied zzso function in relation to two aspects of zzso remembering information and anticipating responses, in control and schizophrenic zzso We measured brain zzso in eight subjects with schizophrenia and eight healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance zzso All subjects performed zzso delay tasks with color dots or facial expression zzso as cues and either 50% or zzso response zzso which emphasized demands on remembering the cues or anticipating the response for correct performance, zzso We found a double zzso of zzso zzso between subject groups and task zzso In controls, the zzso became intensely activated during response anticipation (more extensively and zzso when the cues were colors than when they were facial zzso but remained at resting activity levels during zzso In schizophrenic patients, significant zzso zzso was seen only when remembering a zzso (more extensively and zzso when it was a facial zzso than when it was a zzso but not when anticipating a zzso These results reveal an zzso dysfunction during choice anticipation in schizophrenia and suggest that it might zzso the foresight deficits seen in schizophrenic zzso
