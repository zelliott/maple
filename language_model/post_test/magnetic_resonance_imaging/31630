zzso temperature is a fundamental zzso zzso that can provide insight into pathological zzso The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a novel zzso chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso agent suitable for in zzso temperature mapping at zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso at zzso as a function of temperature, zzso and agent zzso The transfer of zzso zzso zzso from the bound water to bulk water pools was approximately zzso greater for zzso compared to zzso at zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso and pH zzso pH zzso when using power level sufficiently low for in zzso zzso Unlike zzso whose zzso effect decreased with increasing temperature in the zzso range, the zzso effect of zzso was optimal at body zzso A strong linear dependence of the chemical shift of the bound water pool on temperature was observed zzso zzso degrees zzso which was insensitive to pH and agent zzso zzso maps with zzso zzso 1 degrees C were acquired at zzso in zzso zzso 1) phantom A, an zzso solution of 10 zzso zzso 2) phantom B, zzso bovine serum zzso zzso with 15 zzso zzso and 3) phantom C, mouse brain tissue with 4 zzso zzso The temperature sensitivity combined with the high zzso effect observed at low concentration using low zzso power zzso suggests this compound may be a good choice for in zzso temperature mapping at zzso
