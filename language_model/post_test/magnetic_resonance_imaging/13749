The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso changes that occur in the upper airway of children during awakening from zzso zzso 

Children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging of the head underwent additional scans of the upper airway during deep sedation with zzso this was repeated on zzso zzso views were obtained at the most zzso sites of the zzso at the levels of the soft zzso and zzso zzso were then obtained of the zzso zzso diameter, zzso diameter, and zzso areas at these zzso 

Data were obtained on 16 children, aged 10 months to 7 zzso In both zzso and awakening states, most children had the smallest zzso area of the zzso at the level of the soft zzso During the zzso state, at the soft zzso level, the zzso diameter was most narrow in 11 children, the zzso diameter was most narrow in 1 child, and they were equal in 2 zzso During the zzso state, at the level of the zzso the zzso diameter was most narrow in 9 children, the zzso diameter was most narrow in 5 children, and they were equal in 2 zzso During zzso at the soft zzso level, the zzso diameter was most narrow in none of the children, the zzso diameter was most narrow in 13 children, and they were equal in 1 zzso At the level of the zzso the zzso diameter was most narrow in 4 children, and the zzso diameter was most narrow in 12 zzso During zzso the zzso diameter of the zzso at the level of the soft zzso decreased in 12 children, increased in 1 child, and remained the same in 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso diameter increased in 11 children, decreased in 1 child, and remained the same in 2 children zzso zzso zzso The zzso area at the level of the soft zzso increased in 4 children, decreased in 8 children, and stayed the same in 2 children zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso diameter of the zzso at the level of the tongue decreased in 11 children, increased in 4 children, and remained the same in 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso diameter increased in 11 children and decreased in 5 children zzso zzso zzso The zzso area at the level of the tongue increased in 7 children, decreased in 7 children, and stayed the same in 2 children zzso zzso zzso 

The dimensions of the upper airways of children change shape significantly on awakening from zzso zzso When sedated, the upper airway is oblong zzso with the zzso diameter larger than the zzso zzso On zzso the shape of the upper airway in most children changed such that the zzso diameter was zzso zzso areas between zzso and awakening states were zzso These changes may reflect the differential effects of zzso on upper airway zzso during zzso
