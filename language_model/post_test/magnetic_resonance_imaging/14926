Water content is the dominant chemical compound in the brain and it is the primary zzso of tissue contrast in magnetic resonance zzso zzso Water content varies greatly between individuals, and it changes dramatically over time from birth through zzso of the human life zzso We zzso that the effects that zzso and age-related variations in water content have on contrast of the brain in MR images also have important, systematic effects on in zzso zzso measures of regional brain zzso We also zzso that changes in water content and tissue contrast across time may account for age-related changes in regional volumes, and that differences in water content or tissue contrast across differing zzso diagnoses may account for differences in regional volumes across diagnostic zzso We demonstrate in several complementary ways that subtle variations in water content across age and tissue compartments alter tissue contrast, and that changing tissue contrast in turn alters measures of the thickness and volume of the cortical zzso zzso We derive zzso relations describing how age-related changes in tissue relaxation times produce age-related changes in tissue zzso intensity values and tissue zzso zzso We vary tissue contrast in computer-generated images to assess its effects on tissue zzso and volumes of gray matter and white zzso and zzso We use real-world imaging data from adults with either zzso or zzso Disorder and zzso and zzso healthy adults to assess the ways in which variations in tissue contrast across diagnoses affects group differences in tissue zzso and associated zzso We conclude that in zzso zzso zzso measures of the brain, including regional volumes and measures of cortical zzso are a product of, or at least are zzso by, differences in tissue contrast across individuals, ages, and diagnostic groups, and that differences in tissue contrast in turn likely derive from corresponding differences in water content of the brain across individuals, ages, and diagnostic zzso
