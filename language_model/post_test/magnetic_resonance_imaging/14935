This study aims to investigate zzso zzso zzso for in zzso labeling of human zzso zzso cells zzso to allow for in zzso tracking and zzso zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso following zzso zzso Human zzso DC were labeled zzso with fluorescent zzso zzso and injected via zzso and intravenous routes in 4-5 zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso Control mice zzso were similarly injected with zzso zzso In zzso 7 T zzso was performed 24 h later and all zzso were removed in order to measure zzso and zzso contents and identify zzso zzso efficiently labeled zzso zzso to zzso zzso per zzso without altering viability and zzso zzso The magnetic resonance zzso signal was exclusively due to zzso The zzso MR zzso intensity for TM was significantly higher than for CM zzso zzso zzso and highly correlated with the zzso zzso content zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed for in zzso tracking and zzso zzso by means of zzso following zzso injection, with very high sensitivity zzso cells per zzso The safety of these new zzso types must be confirmed via extensive zzso tests including in zzso stability and zzso zzso
