zzso memory processes can be investigated using different functional zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to examine correlations between zzso memory test scores and zzso signal changes during zzso scanning using three different memory zzso 

zzso right-handed healthy subjects underwent three zzso zzso a word pair, zzso a zzso and zzso a zzso association zzso These zzso were compared for their value in memory zzso and zzso by calculating correlations between the zzso signals in the zzso zzso lobe and behavioral data derived from a zzso test zzso 

As expected, group analysis showed zzso zzso for the zzso a tendency to zzso zzso for the zzso and bilateral zzso for the zzso zzso No linear correlations were observed between zzso data and zzso in the zzso zzso However, we found significant zzso correlations between behavioral memory performance and zzso in both the verbal and the zzso zzso that is, zzso signal changes were greater not only among participants who performed best on the zzso tests, but also among the poorest zzso The zzso learning task did not correlate with the zzso in the zzso paradigm at zzso 

We interpreted the zzso correlations to be due to zzso zzso zzso associated with low performance when people try unsuccessfully to remember presented zzso Because zzso levels did not zzso increase with memory performance, the latter cannot be zzso by zzso alone, but only be used in conjunction with zzso zzso
