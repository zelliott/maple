We evaluated whether PET with zzso zzso was clinically useful in distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

We examined eight patients with zzso zzso zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso between 5 and 68 days after the bleeding episode using PET with zzso zzso 

zzso accumulated in the area surrounding the zzso in both groups, except in one patient with an acute zzso zzso Between 22 and 45 days after the zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso zzso largely in accordance with the zzso areas on CT or MR zzso whereas between 14 and 68 days after zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso zzso that extended beyond the zzso areas on CT or MR zzso The intensity of zzso zzso in tumor tissue was greater than that in zzso zzso 

zzso results suggest that zzso can distinguish zzso from zzso zzso on the basis of differences in zzso extent compared with CT or MR zzso
