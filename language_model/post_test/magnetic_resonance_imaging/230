To describe the zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging features of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated vascular anomalies in zzso 

A retrospective study was performed reviewing zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging archives of eight institutions for dogs with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso criteria included a zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging study and supportive diagnostic and follow-up zzso zzso vessels were reviewed for size, shape, location and course (including tributaries and zzso and classified as normal, abnormal or shunt zzso 

Ten dogs with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso In all dogs, zzso zzso blood was zzso to either a right or a left zzso zzso with seven different zzso zzso zzso dogs were predominantly female zzso per zzso and young zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso and zzso shunt vessels were identified in two cases zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso depicted details of abdominal vessels including zzso formation in one zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a vascular zzso anomaly in the dog that can be associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso are excellent tools to demonstrate the complex vascular anatomy and to guide treatment planning for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
