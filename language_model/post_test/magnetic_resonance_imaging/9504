zzso ultrasound zzso imaging zzso allows zzso of zzso flowing through the cerebral zzso We hypothesized that analysis of zzso tissue zzso would enable for characterization of zzso deficits in acute middle cerebral artery zzso territory zzso zzso patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, 9 weeks) were zzso zzso images of bubble zzso were acquired by zzso zzso at low mechanical index immediately after zzso zzso Different parameters were calculated from regions of interest zzso real-time time to peak zzso rise rate zzso and plateau zzso of acoustic intensity, and A zzso zzso was used as an index of blood zzso zzso were compared with zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso had lower values in zzso of zzso as compared with normal tissue zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time to peak was delayed in zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From the analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves, zzso and A zzso zzso had the largest areas under the curve with optimal zzso values of zzso and A zzso zzso We conclude that zzso with analysis of zzso zzso correctly identifies zzso brain tissue in acute zzso zzso
