To determine if contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging is useful for assessment of zzso viability in patients with zzso zzso results from single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examination with zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty patients underwent zzso zzso examinations with zzso zzso were considered zzso for assessment of zzso zzso on the basis of fixed zzso defects that either had normal wall motion or exceeded any wall motion zzso Patients then underwent zzso zzso MR imaging for assessment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging for assessment of wall zzso For image zzso the left zzso was divided into 14 zzso Wall motion and extent of zzso were assessed independently and zzso 

zzso segments were zzso for zzso at zzso and most (21 of 41 zzso involved the zzso or inferior zzso zzso was confirmed with MR imaging in 10 of 41 zzso zzso segments in eight patients zzso An additional 29 segments in eight patients had zzso at MR imaging that was not suspected at zzso including segments in three patients with no clinical history of zzso zzso prior to zzso All cases of zzso except one that were zzso or zzso with zzso at zzso were zzso at MR imaging, and most of the zzso zzso zzso (15 of 28 zzso had no associated wall motion zzso 

Patients with zzso examination findings that are zzso for zzso may benefit from zzso MR imaging, particularly in the setting of zzso zzso
