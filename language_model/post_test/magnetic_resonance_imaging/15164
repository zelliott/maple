zzso disorders are zzso characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the zzso It is likely that future treatment trials will target the underlying protein zzso and it is therefore increasingly important to be able to distinguish between different zzso during zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether rates of brain zzso differ in neurodegenerative zzso that vary by pathological diagnoses and characteristic protein zzso zzso zzso subjects were identified with a clinical diagnosis of zzso and two serial head zzso zzso were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into Alzheimer's disease, zzso with zzso bodies zzso mixed Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso changes zzso zzso zzso zzso and progressive zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five controls were matched by age, gender and scan zzso to the study zzso The zzso integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain zzso and zzso volume zzso All zzso results were annualized by adjusting for scan zzso The rates of whole brain zzso and zzso expansion were significantly increased compared to controls in the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso rates in the zzso group were not significantly different from control rates of zzso The largest rates of zzso were observed in the zzso group which had a zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso group had significantly greater rates of zzso and zzso than the zzso mixed Alzheimer's zzso Alzheimer's disease and zzso groups, with a similar trend observed when compared to the zzso zzso The zzso group showed the next largest rates with a zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso which were both significantly greater than the zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the rates of zzso between the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's zzso and zzso groups, which all showed similar rates of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Rates of zzso therefore differ according to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein zzso While rates are unlikely to be useful in zzso Alzheimer's disease from cases with mixed Alzheimer's zzso pathology, they demonstrate important zzso differences between zzso and those with mixed Alzheimer's zzso and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and between those with zzso and zzso zzso
