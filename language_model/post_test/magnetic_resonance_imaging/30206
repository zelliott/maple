The literature suggests that that semantic and zzso zzso tasks selectively activate left zzso area zzso 45 and 44, respectively, in zzso speech zzso We used functional zzso to test this zzso zzso performed a semantic and a zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso task zzso zzso nouns with masculine zzso was zzso zzso blocks were included as a low-level control zzso The exact zzso of the effects was tested with zzso probability maps of BA 44 and BA zzso Participants generated fewer words in the zzso than in both the semantic and the zzso condition, which did not differ from each zzso Compared to rest, all language tasks activated the well-known language network in the left zzso including both left BA 44 and BA zzso In the direct contrasts between the different verbal zzso tasks, zzso zzso activated BA 44 more strongly than semantic or zzso zzso However, semantic zzso did not elicit higher zzso than the zzso zzso tasks in any part of zzso zzso No differences were observed between zzso and semantic zzso Thus, the zzso in BA 45 observed during verbal zzso tasks seems to be not restricted to semantic processing as suggested by the zzso In contrast, zzso verbal zzso additionally involved the left BA zzso In conclusion, different parts of zzso region support zzso and more general processes in verbal zzso
