The cerebral zzso in zzso sclerosis are of three zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso and cluster of zzso cells in the white zzso zzso of these zzso is still incomplete even with modern imaging zzso zzso resonance zzso images of ten patients with zzso sclerosis were reviewed and compared to zzso zzso zzso scans and to the clinical severity of the zzso zzso weighted spin echo zzso zzso 1800, TE zzso zzso images and inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 40) images were obtained at the same zzso zzso zzso zzso were better seen, because of their zzso with CT than with MR zzso They were demonstrated as zzso to low intensity depending on the amount of zzso on zzso weighted images, and as a similar intensity to the white matter on zzso zzso Small peripheral zzso in the zzso which were only occasionally seen as small low density areas on CT scans, were well demonstrated on MR zzso These zzso were zzso on zzso weighted images, and zzso on zzso zzso zzso location of these was not in the cortex, but in the zzso white zzso The findings indicate that these zzso represent the zzso well known zzso zzso which are commonly present under the cortical zzso but may be independent of zzso zzso zzso were not confidently identified, which suggested that they might have similar intensity to the cortical gray zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
