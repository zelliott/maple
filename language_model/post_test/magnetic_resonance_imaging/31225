zzso of the cerebral zzso against the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso mass zzso the so-called zzso notch phenomenon, can be an important cause of false zzso motor zzso Here, we demonstrate a case in which clinical, zzso and zzso findings were used together to define this zzso 

A 21-year-old man sustained a left zzso depressed zzso fracture from a motor vehicle zzso zzso zzso zzso examinations demonstrated no evolution of zzso or zzso and he was managed zzso with zzso for zzso pressure zzso Throughout his course in the zzso intensive care unit, he displayed persistent left zzso 

Further zzso and zzso studies were undertaken in an attempt to explain his left zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated zzso zzso in the central portion of the right cerebral zzso extending to the right internal zzso zzso studies using zzso electrical motor evoked zzso revealed both a marked increase in zzso zzso as well as a reduction in the complexity of the motor evoked potential zzso on the zzso left zzso This contrasted to significantly lower zzso threshold as well as a highly complex motor evoked potential zzso recorded on the relatively intact zzso zzso 

This is the first time that clinical, zzso and zzso findings have been correlated in a case of zzso notch zzso zzso of the zzso cerebral zzso against the zzso zzso can lead to damage and zzso zzso The zzso extent of the zzso can be defined by magnetic resonance imaging and the zzso extent by zzso zzso
