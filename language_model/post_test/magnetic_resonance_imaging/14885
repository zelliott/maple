To compare the accuracy of different MR sequences to measure tumor zzso 

Eighty-six women zzso age: 53 years zzso who underwent zzso zzso for breast cancer were zzso zzso diameters of the index tumor zzso and of the whole extent of the tumor zzso were measured on zzso zzso zzso on dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences and on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with pathological size were evaluated using zzso correlation zzso zzso 

Median pathological size of IT was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Median pathological size of the zzso was 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of IT showed a good zzso with pathological size, with best results using zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso frame zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso frame zzso zzso zzso IT was visible on zzso in zzso and accurately measured within zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was superior using zzso zzso frame zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso frame zzso zzso zzso zzso frame zzso zzso zzso zzso frame zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, even using zzso frame, zzso was accurately measured within zzso only zzso 

If visible, IT size is best measured on zzso with a good accuracy zzso whereas zzso is best estimated on zzso zzso zzso However, when adjacent additional sites exist around zzso suspected surrounding disease components need to be proved by pathological zzso
