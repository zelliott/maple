zzso zzso and working memory zzso load are known to affect object processing in the zzso zzso However, the combined effect, which could be either synergistic or zzso remains zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a zzso design, we investigated the effects of zzso load and emotional zzso on object processing in the zzso visual zzso zzso female subjects were shown blocks of zzso and more or less zzso visual stimuli that varied in emotional zzso zzso or zzso and phase zzso rendering them more or less zzso zzso on these pictures, subjects saw colored squares on which they had to perform a demanding zzso task zzso zzso This zzso task absorbs zzso resources normally available for the zzso analysis of visual objects and can therefore be interpreted as a manipulation of zzso We hypothesized that attenuated processing resources in the lateral zzso complex zzso for these zzso pictures under high zzso load zzso et zzso zzso could be regained when they were of negative emotional zzso Our results indicate that both emotional zzso and zzso load critically depend on a minimum level of phase zzso of the stimuli to affect zzso zzso Furthermore, the influences of emotional zzso and zzso load do not interact with each other in zzso Rather, emotional zzso exerts a general zzso gain effect while preserving the difference in zzso between low and high zzso zzso A connectivity analysis suggests that the emotional zzso might originate in the zzso zzso
