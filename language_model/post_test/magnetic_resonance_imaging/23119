Evidence suggests that physical activity zzso is associated with the maintenance of cognitive function across the zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease zzso is associated with impaired cognitive zzso The objective of this study was to examine the interactive effects of PA and zzso on brain zzso during memory processing in older zzso zzso cognitively intact zzso A zzso design was used with four groups zzso zzso zzso Low zzso PA; zzso Low zzso PA; zzso High zzso PA; and zzso High zzso zzso PA level was based on zzso frequency and zzso zzso risk was based on presence or absence of an zzso zzso Brain zzso was measured using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while participants performed a famous name discrimination zzso Brain zzso zzso semantic memory processing occurred in 15 functional regions of zzso High PA and High zzso were associated with significantly greater semantic memory zzso zzso in 6 and 3 of the 15 regions, zzso zzso interactions of PA and zzso were evident in 9 of 15 brain regions, with the High zzso zzso group demonstrating greater semantic memory zzso than the remaining three zzso These findings suggest that PA selectively increases zzso brain zzso in cognitively intact but genetically zzso zzso zzso studies are required to determine whether increased semantic memory processing in physically active zzso individuals is protective against future cognitive zzso
