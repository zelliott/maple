The purpose of our study was to describe the zzso findings in the zzso cruciate ligament zzso analogous to zzso zzso in the anterior cruciate ligament zzso to correlate zzso findings in the zzso with zzso zzso to differentiate the zzso zzso appearance from the appearance of zzso zzso and to emphasize the coexistence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cruciate zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso appearance commonly coexists with zzso zzso zzso zzso and, less zzso zzso zzso Both zzso tears and zzso findings suggestive of zzso zzso zzso show ligament zzso and increased zzso signal zzso zzso zzso are usually zzso and typically have no zzso zzso
