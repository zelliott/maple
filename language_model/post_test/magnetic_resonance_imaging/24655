zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities of brain activity during performance of attention tasks have been described in zzso multiple sclerosis zzso No data are available in clinically isolated syndrome zzso suggestive of zzso 

The objective of this research is to evaluate in zzso patients the zzso pattern of brain zzso during an attention task and to explore the effect of increasing task load demand on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso patients and 32 zzso and zzso healthy controls zzso underwent zzso while performing the zzso zzso Control zzso task, a cognitive paradigm requiring increasing levels of zzso control zzso zzso models were used for statistical analyses of zzso zzso 

zzso patients had reduced accuracy and greater reaction time at the zzso task compared with zzso zzso On blood zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had greater activity in the right zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso Furthermore, zzso patients had greater activity at the lower zzso and reduced activity at the greater zzso level of zzso control demand in the left zzso compared with zzso 

This study demonstrates the failure of zzso control processing in zzso The zzso zzso dysfunction of the zzso supports the role of zzso zzso in the failure of attention observed at the earliest stage of zzso
