A novel method for zzso reconstruction of images from zzso zzso data acquired by multiple receiver zzso systems is zzso Based on zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso the method for zzso zzso data reconstruction zzso can be readily modified to include various linear and zzso reconstruction zzso Such constraints may be beneficial for reconstructing highly and zzso zzso data sets to improve image zzso zzso is zzso simple and zzso efficient and can reconstruct images from data sampled on arbitrary zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for image reconstruction with zzso constraining was demonstrated using a wide range of simulated and real zzso zzso
