For molecular magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of iron oxide zzso create potent zzso contrast effects that extend a distance far exceeding their physical zzso The potency of the contrast effects derive from their high iron content and are significantly greater than that of zzso particles of iron oxide zzso commonly used for zzso Due to their size and zzso nature, zzso are less susceptible to zzso vascular zzso or zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso may be useful contrast agents for detection of zzso molecular targets by zzso This Chapter describes the methodology of a novel, functional zzso probe targeting vascular cell zzso zzso zzso for detection of acute brain inflammation in zzso at a time when pathology is zzso by conventional zzso zzso are included for zzso of zzso to mouse zzso zzso against zzso zzso the validation of zzso binding specificity to activated zzso cells in zzso and the application of zzso for in zzso targeted zzso of acute brain inflammation in zzso This functional molecular imaging tool may potentially accelerate accurate diagnosis of early cerebral vascular inflammation by zzso and guide specific zzso
