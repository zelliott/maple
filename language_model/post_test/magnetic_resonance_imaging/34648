Our objective was to determine the familial zzso of large zzso aqueduct syndrome zzso detected by CT and MR imaging and to propose the genetic inheritance of zzso 

We zzso reviewed cases of zzso revealed by zzso CT and MR imaging at the University of Utah Health Sciences zzso We interviewed 25 patients with zzso regarding family history of hearing zzso Any family members with onset of hearing loss before 30 years old also underwent CT and MR zzso The zzso aqueduct (on CT zzso or the zzso duct (on MR zzso was measured at the zzso of the zzso zzso A measurement greater than zzso zzso in diameter was considered zzso zzso Diagnosis of zzso was made if the patient had hearing loss and positive imaging zzso 

Of the 25 patients, five were found to have familial involvement, resulting in subsequent study of eight additional symptomatic zzso A total of 33 patients had positive CT or MR imaging zzso zzso underwent both studies, two underwent CT only, and two underwent MR imaging zzso Among the 33 patients with zzso zzso familial occurrence was observed (13 zzso In four of the five different families, the involvement occurred among siblings in one zzso In one of the five families, the involvement occurred in two generations, affecting an uncle and a cousin of the zzso 

In patients with zzso a significant zzso had familial zzso Based on the zzso of the familial cases, the pattern was most consistent with zzso zzso zzso although a smaller component of zzso dominant or zzso inheritance may zzso
