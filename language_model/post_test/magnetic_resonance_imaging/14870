The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso for the interpretation of zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with breast zzso 

25 patients with breast cancer preoperatively underwent both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic contrast enhanced zzso The maximum signal increase zzso and curve shape zzso zzso of contrast enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso and correlated to the maximum standard zzso value zzso of zzso zzso 29 healthy women with zzso served as control zzso Enhancement zzso of all zzso zzso were compared to zzso findings of the healthy control zzso 

zzso 33 contrast enhanced zzso on zzso zzso had a corresponding zzso zzso on zzso 30 of the PET positive zzso were classified as surely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso of these zzso was not significantly different to the control group zzso vs zzso but zzso zzso had a significantly higher rate of type III zzso with rapid zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso 

The maximum signal increase is not capable of zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso However, since zzso zzso showed a higher frequency of rapid zzso zzso zzso III zzso on corresponding zzso future studies should concentrate on the analysis of this zzso In clinical routine the curve shape still should be taken with care as there is a high overlap with benign zzso
