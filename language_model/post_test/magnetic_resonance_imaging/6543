We previously reported that an increase of cartilage thickness is the earliest measurable change by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in early stages of experimental zzso zzso Our present objective was to study the microscopic translation of this finding in order to know whether the cartilage thickness zzso represents the earliest structural damage or whether it alternatively constitutes a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was induced by partial zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso animals were used as zzso Gross and microscopic cartilage changes were zzso assessed after surgery at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 52 weeks, and compared to zzso zzso 

The swelling of cartilage detected by zzso correlated with depletion in zzso zzso and cellular loss, which were closely related to the progression of zzso at the earliest zzso zzso of the cartilage structure appeared only in advanced zzso 

zzso swelling detected by zzso is due to zzso depletion and represents the earliest zzso in zzso Because it is accompanied by cellular loss, it cannot be merely attributed to surgical trauma and represents true tissue zzso The biological meaning of volume variations detected by zzso should be assessed carefully taking into account the disease stage as an increase in cartilage height also reflects cartilage damage and not a zzso zzso
