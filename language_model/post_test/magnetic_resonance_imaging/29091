Two different types of zzso images of the same slice of tissue will generally have different spatial zzso The judicious zzso combination of their data can be accomplished to yield a single image exhibiting properties of zzso Here, zzso zzso PET and zzso MR images of the human brain are used as the low- and high-resolution members of the zzso A color scale is necessary in order to provide for separate intensity parameters from the two image zzso However, not all color scales can accommodate this zzso The zzso color model allows one to choose a color scale in which the intensity of the zzso image type is coded as zzso while that of the high-resolution type is coded as value, a reasonably independent zzso Furthermore, the high-resolution image must have high contrast and be quantitative in the same sense as the zzso image almost always zzso Here, zzso MR images zzso segmented quantitative zzso zzso zzso are zzso Their essentially complete contrast serves to effect an apparent editing function when zzso as the value of the color zzso Thus, the combination of zzso PET images with zzso zzso zzso zzso images produces visually zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic zzso zzso These exhibit the high sensitivity to zzso amounts characteristic of PET along with the high spatial resolution of zzso zzso At the same time, however, they retain the complete quantitative measures of each of their basis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Published 1999 zzso zzso
