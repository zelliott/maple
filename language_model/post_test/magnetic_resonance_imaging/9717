To analyze the topography of human eyes with zzso zzso by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso with volume rendering of the acquired zzso 

zzso case zzso 

Eighty-six eyes of 44 patients with high zzso zzso error zzso zzso zzso or zzso length zzso zzso were zzso Forty zzso eyes were examined as zzso 

The participants were examined with an zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso GE zzso zzso zzso and zzso cubes were zzso Volume renderings of the images from high-resolution zzso zzso data were done by computer zzso The margins of globes were then identified zzso by the signal intensity, and the zzso outside the globes were zzso 

The zzso zzso characteristic of the globes and the distribution of the 4 distinct shapes of globes according to the symmetry and the radius of zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso the barrel, zzso zzso zzso and temporally distorted zzso 

In zzso of the patients with bilateral high zzso both eyes had the same zzso zzso The most zzso part of the globe existed along the central zzso axis in zzso of eyes and was slightly inferior to the central axis in the remaining zzso In 38 of 68 eyes zzso with bilateral zzso zzso multiple zzso were zzso The eyes with 2 zzso were subdivided into those with zzso zzso and those with zzso zzso The eyes with 3 zzso were subdivided into zzso zzso superior, and zzso inferior zzso The eyes with visual field defects that could not be explained by zzso zzso zzso significantly more frequently had a temporally distorted zzso zzso with zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso significantly more frequently than eyes with zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a complete zzso image of human eyes by high-resolution zzso with zzso zzso The results showed that there are different zzso shapes in eyes with zzso zzso and that the difference in the zzso shape is correlated with the development of zzso conditions in eyes with zzso zzso
