zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify brain areas involved in spatial attention and determine whether these operate zzso or zzso for vision and zzso On a zzso basis, a symbolic auditory cue indicated the most likely side for the subsequent target, thus directing covert attention to one zzso A subsequent target appeared in vision or touch on the cued or zzso zzso zzso cued trials (as compared with valid zzso activated the zzso junction and regions of inferior frontal cortex, regardless of target zzso These brain areas have been associated with zzso spatial coding in zzso studies of the monkey brain and were linked to a change in the location that must be attended to in the present zzso The zzso zzso and superior frontal zzso were also activated in our task, again, regardless of target zzso but did not show any specificity for zzso cued zzso These results identify a zzso network for spatial attention and reveal differential activity for inferior circuits involving the zzso junction and inferior frontal zzso zzso to invalid zzso versus more superior zzso circuits zzso to valid and invalid zzso
