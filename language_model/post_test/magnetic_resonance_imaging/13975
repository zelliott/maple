zzso signal loss zzso zzso on zzso echo magnetic resonance imaging zzso may reflect zzso zzso However, zzso are also known to be associated with zzso zzso is commonly associated with zzso vascular zzso 

To determine whether zzso on zzso is significantly associated with the type of zzso zzso zzso stroke more often than an zzso stroke zzso of the extent of zzso 

We studied 91 patients who had an acute stroke and were admitted to the Department of zzso Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, from March 1, 1997, to July 31, zzso These patients underwent both conventional zzso and zzso The zzso was used to count zzso We also counted zzso and classified zzso zzso or mild and zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis was used to test for zzso interaction association with the type of stroke zzso over zzso and to evaluate the relative contribution of an zzso for age, sex, and zzso discriminating the type of zzso 

The association between zzso and zzso statistically significantly differed by zzso zzso zzso for zzso interaction zzso The zzso count on zzso was significantly associated with the type of stroke zzso over zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso when zzso was classified as none or zzso When zzso was classified as advanced, there was a decrease in the odds ratio of zzso to zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso on zzso is a predictor of zzso vs zzso in patients with no or mild zzso but not in patients with advanced zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso for a zzso zzso the extent of zzso should be zzso
