zzso in gray matter zzso zzso and cortical thickness zzso have been demonstrated in small and zzso samples of subjects with differing chronic pain zzso including irritable zzso syndrome zzso zzso across 7 structural zzso studies conducted at University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, between August 2006 and April 2011, we examined group differences in regional zzso volume in 201 predominantly zzso female subjects (82 zzso mean age: zzso zzso 119 healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso graph theoretical methods and controlling for total brain volume, global and regional properties of large-scale structural brain networks were compared between the group with zzso and the HC zzso Relative to zzso the zzso group had lower volumes in the bilateral superior frontal zzso bilateral zzso bilateral amygdala, bilateral zzso bilateral middle zzso frontal zzso left cingulate, left zzso zzso zzso and left zzso Higher volume was found in the left zzso zzso Group differences were no longer significant for most regions when controlling for the Early zzso zzso global score, with the exception of the right zzso and the left zzso zzso No group differences were found for measures of global and local network zzso Compared to zzso in patients with zzso the right zzso zzso and right zzso were identified as being significantly more critical for information zzso zzso involved in zzso pain zzso and central sensory amplification were identified as network hubs in zzso Overall, evidence for central zzso in patients with zzso was found in the form of regional zzso volume differences and altered global and regional properties of brain zzso zzso
