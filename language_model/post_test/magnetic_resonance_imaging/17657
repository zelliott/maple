To assess the value of breast zzso in size assessment of breast zzso in high risk patients, including those with a zzso 1 or 2 zzso zzso recommend invariably breast zzso screening for these patients and therapy is thus based on these zzso However, the accuracy of breast zzso for staging purposes is only tested in sporadic zzso 

We assessed zzso of zzso staging using zzso with zzso in 49 tumors in 46 high risk patients zzso zzso 12 zzso and 11 zzso zzso The size of the total tumor area zzso was compared to zzso In invasive zzso zzso the size of the largest focus zzso was also zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso with pathology was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso was underestimated in zzso overestimated in zzso and correctly measured in zzso zzso zzso was underestimated in zzso overestimated in zzso and correctly measured in zzso zzso Impact of zzso 1 or 2 zzso on the quality of size zzso was not zzso 

zzso size zzso using breast zzso in high risk patients is comparable to its performance in sporadic zzso zzso breast zzso can safely be used for treatment zzso
