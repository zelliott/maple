zzso exposure to mild zzso zzso zzso core symptom of major depressive zzso up to zzso of the zzso rats, whereas the remaining show resilience to zzso This chronic mild stress zzso model is well documented as an animal model of major depressive zzso We examined the zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of the zzso in zzso and stress resilient rats that may mark the differential behavioral zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso resilient zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso 8) rats were subjected to in zzso diffusion zzso imaging, high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso zzso parameters were decreased in both zzso zzso A significant inward displacement in the zzso part of the right zzso was apparent in the resilient subjects and an increase of the zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging zzso subtle zzso changes in the zzso of zzso animals irrespective of their zzso or resilient zzso In contrast, zzso magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance zzso shape change analysis of the zzso allowed discrimination of these two zzso of stress zzso Although the precise mechanism discriminating their behavior is yet to be zzso the present study zzso the role of the zzso in the zzso of depression and the induction of zzso Our results reflect the potency of zzso magnetic resonance methods in zzso settings with key zzso benefit to and from the zzso
