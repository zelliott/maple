A technique for zzso zzso magnetic resonance images into arbitrary zzso planes has been developed and implemented on a Toshiba zzso (formerly zzso zzso imaging system (South San Francisco, zzso This method is designed to allow the user to easily define a new plane by marking with a zzso features of interest on two or three different image zzso These features are combined in the resulting zzso zzso The zzso image can have arbitrary zzso and is created with a zzso dimension equivalent to the original data zzso Resolution ranges from the original zzso resolution to the slice zzso depending on zzso An improvement in zzso ratio results from the effective averaging performed by zzso This method is zzso used to correct for small variations in zzso such as the positioning of the zzso zzso It can also be used to generate zzso images at many different angles from a single zzso data zzso This method has been applied to the particular problem of improving the presentation of coronary arteries on a conventional set of zzso zzso cardiac images by increasing the visible length of individual coronary zzso
