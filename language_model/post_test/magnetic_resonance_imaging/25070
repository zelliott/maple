The signal obtained with zzso zzso imaging applied to a confined liquid is directly related to the pore shape in the limit where all molecules have sampled the whole zzso We investigate the diffusion of water across a approximately 50 zzso thick film formed between planes of zzso The diffusion time zzso is changed almost three orders of zzso For short zzso the zzso displacement increases with a rate which is slightly less than for freely zzso zzso At zzso longer than zzso zzso the displacement is constant at 24 zzso which implies that the water is confined in the measuring direction defined by the applied zzso zzso zzso smooth and aligned planes give rise to sharp zzso features on the echo zzso curve, zzso zzso signal zzso the zzso space zzso zzso The experimental data with rather smooth local zzso and zzso can be explained in terms of either surface zzso or a zzso of the zzso We discuss the averaging effect of diffusion along a zzso zzso film and propose two zzso methods to determine the pore shape from the echo zzso curve obtained in the zzso zzso
