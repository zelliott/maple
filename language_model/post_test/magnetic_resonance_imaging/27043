This article explores the feasibility of using coupled electromagnetic and zzso simulations to improve planning and control of zzso treatments for zzso The study investigates the usefulness of zzso to improve heat zzso in zzso targets in treatments monitored with zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

zzso capabilities of a zzso zzso zzso zzso phased array zzso zzso were investigated with electromagnetic and zzso simulations of zzso in homogeneous phantom models and two human leg zzso High frequency structure simulator zzso zzso was used for electromagnetic simulations and zzso patterns were coupled into zzso zzso for zzso zzso with zzso variable zzso zzso were accelerated by zzso zzso anatomy into a zzso whole body tissue zzso To validate this treatment planning approach, simulations were compared with MR zzso images in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso simulations demonstrated excellent agreement with temperature rise zzso obtained with MR zzso imaging in homogeneous zzso and clinical treatments of large zzso zzso The results demonstrate feasibility of zzso appropriate relative zzso of antennas for zzso heat in zzso 

Advances in the accuracy of computer simulation and zzso zzso via MR zzso imaging have provided powerful new tools for zzso of clinical zzso zzso zzso agree well with MR zzso images in both homogeneous tissue models and patients with lower leg zzso This work demonstrates that better quality zzso treatments should be possible when simplified hybrid model simulations are performed routinely as part of the clinical zzso zzso
