zzso and safety of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso strongly depend on the possibility of three-dimensional zzso zzso of zzso as well as the zzso of pulmonary zzso Current zzso systems allow zzso zzso of anatomical heart structures using zzso zzso 

To evaluate clinical usefulness of zzso zzso zzso after contrast agent administration into the right atrium for the purpose of evaluating left zzso anatomy in patients undergoing zzso zzso of zzso 

We also compared images obtained using zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso In 18 consecutive patients undergoing zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso was performed zzso followed by zzso reconstruction of the left atrium and the zzso zzso using the zzso 3 system was successful in 17 zzso Total zzso time was zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso time 31 zzso 8 zzso and radiation dose was 413 zzso 170 zzso Mean zzso time for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean radiation dose was 159 zzso 57 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the left atrium was possible in 17 patients, including 16 patients in whom all 4 pulmonary zzso zzso were zzso In 1 patient, all zzso pulmonary veins were located outside the scan zzso In 1 case, zzso did not allow zzso of the right inferior pulmonary zzso and in another case the zzso veins had a common zzso as shown in zzso but not zzso in zzso 

Pulmonary vein diameter assessed by zzso was slightly higher than by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso although this was mainly related to a single zzso right inferior pulmonary zzso Good agreement zzso 2 zzso between the two methods for the assessment of pulmonary zzso zzso was higher for the zzso than the zzso veins zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso after contrast agent administration into the right atrium seems to be a safe and effective method to zzso pulmonary zzso zzso and left zzso zzso It remains to be established whether it enables evaluation of anatomical zzso
