zzso volume changes reported in bipolar disorders could represent artifacts of medication or zzso conditions, or illness related changes, either biological zzso or consequences of illness zzso We conducted zzso high-risk study to investigate whether zzso volume changes represent primary biological risk factor for bipolar zzso 

zzso zzso participants (age range zzso zzso were recruited from families multiply affected with bipolar zzso They included 20 affected and 26 unaffected offspring of parents with primary mood disorders, matched by age and sex with 31 controls without a personal or family history of psychiatric zzso zzso volumes were measured on zzso zzso anatomical zzso images using standard zzso 

There was a significant difference between groups zzso unaffected zzso and control subjects) in zzso volumes zzso zzso 74 and zzso in absence of zzso volume zzso The zzso volumes were largest in unaffected zzso subjects without differences between affected and control or affected and unaffected zzso zzso The maximum changes were found in the head of the zzso Controlling for zzso of observations in multiple subjects per family yielded zzso zzso 

Despite the biological zzso partial agreement with previous studies and nominal statistical significance, controlling for zzso of observations within families changed the increased zzso volumes among unaffected subjects to zzso We thus present these findings as negative, pending further zzso zzso volume abnormalities did not meet criteria for zzso in this zzso
