To assess characteristics of zzso zzso and normal appearing white matter zzso with various imaging zzso zzso metabolism was investigated with zzso zzso concentration with zzso zzso zzso and zzso detection with routine brain zzso 

Thirteen patients were studied in a stable phase of their disease, and two during an acute zzso Nine healthy volunteers served as zzso 

Three patients had a normal brain zzso 12 had typical zzso MR images were registered to the PET zzso zzso and zzso control areas were zzso zzso zzso showed relative zzso and 2 zzso zzso concentration was significantly decreased in both zzso and zzso 

In stable zzso most large zzso have a relatively increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly decreased zzso concentration compared to healthy subjects, but no difference in zzso zzso Active zzso in acute zzso are also zzso This finding opens a new window on the zzso of white matter zzso based on zzso zzso
