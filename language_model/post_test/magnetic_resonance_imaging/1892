Changes in regional cerebral blood flow zzso have previously been demonstrated in a number of cortical and zzso regions, including the zzso zzso thalamus, zzso nucleus, and the zzso zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso zzso in response to experimental noxious zzso Increased anterior zzso responses in patients with chronic regional pain and depression to noxious stimulation distant from the site of clinical pain have been zzso We suggested that this may represent a generalized zzso response to noxious stimuli and may apply to other types of chronic regional zzso Here these techniques are extended to a group of patients with zzso chronic low back zzso zzso subjects, 16 chronic low back pain patients and 16 controls, were studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the experience of hot, mild, and moderate pain, were delivered to the back of the zzso right hand using a zzso zzso Each subject had 12 zzso of zzso 4 for each zzso zzso of zzso with zzso pain experience revealed similar responses across groups in the zzso zzso (including the zzso thalamus, zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso zzso zzso These regions represented the majority of zzso for this study and those recorded by other imaging studies of zzso Although some small differences were observed between the groups these were not considered sufficient to suggest abnormal zzso processing in patients with zzso low back zzso
