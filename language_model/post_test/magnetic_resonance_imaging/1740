Since the risks for zzso are more dependent on plaque composition than on the degree of zzso zzso the zzso assessment of zzso should extend beyond mere depiction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the vessel wall can provide important information about the individual makeup of zzso zzso potentially enabling early detection and characterization of zzso before narrowing of the vessel zzso zzso The zzso assessment of the vessel wall with sufficient spatial resolution and image contrast, however, remains zzso zzso include high zzso ratio, high zzso ratio, good signal penetration depth and homogeneous signal throughout the vessel under investigation, as well as imaging protocols encompassing various contrast zzso Numerous dedicated zzso zzso coils have been developed to achieve these goals employing either external surface zzso zzso or zzso utilizing zzso coils to image the vessel wall from inside the vessel and thus being zzso For the zzso approach of imaging with surface zzso the carotid and the right coronary arteries have been zzso since they are of critical importance and since they are relatively superficial structures, accessible from the zzso To detect the early development of plaque and zzso it globally rather than locally, zzso contrast agents on the basis of zzso particles of iron oxide can be used as a marker of zzso activity within the zzso In the long run, it appears likely that the combination of zzso MR zzso with the administration of zzso contrast agents and subsequent high-resolution MR of detected zzso zzso with dedicated zzso coils could evolve as the diagnostic concept of choice for the assessment of zzso zzso
