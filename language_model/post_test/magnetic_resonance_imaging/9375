zzso zzso zzso in the zzso yield a high risk of zzso Although zzso zzso zzso is accepted, because of high surgical morbidity and zzso outcomes are still zzso 

We previously reported the early results of zzso for zzso zzso Here, we obtained data from a longer follow-up for a larger number of patients and present precise outcomes based on the latest follow-up zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso were treated by zzso Outcomes such as the rates of zzso zzso after treatment, and adverse effects were zzso zzso 

The annual zzso rate before zzso was zzso The mean follow-up period after zzso was 71 months zzso zzso zzso The zzso obliteration rate confirmed by zzso was zzso at 5 zzso zzso associated with higher obliteration rate were previous zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher margin dose zzso zzso zzso For patients treated with a margin dose of zzso 18 zzso the obliteration rate was zzso at 5 zzso zzso worsening of neurological symptoms was observed in zzso The annual zzso rate after zzso was zzso Four patients died of zzso and zzso survival rate was zzso at 10 years after zzso 

zzso obliteration must be achieved for zzso zzso because they possibly cause lethal zzso even after zzso Treatment with a high margin dose is desirable to obtain favorable outcomes for these zzso Additional treatment should be considered for an incompletely obliterated zzso
