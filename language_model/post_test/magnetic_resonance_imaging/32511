zzso in three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso brain images can be classified using protocols for manually zzso and labeling zzso For large zzso time and expertise requirements make this approach zzso To achieve automation, an individual zzso can be zzso to another individual using an anatomical correspondence estimate relating the zzso image to the target zzso The accuracy of the resulting target labeling has been limited but can potentially be improved by combining multiple zzso using decision zzso We studied zzso propagation and decision fusion on 30 normal brain MR images, which had been manually segmented into 67 zzso zzso estimates were established by zzso registration using zzso zzso Both direct label propagation and an indirect approach were zzso Individual zzso showed an average similarity index zzso of zzso against manual zzso zzso fusion using 29 input zzso increased zzso to zzso For indirect propagation of a single source via 27 intermediate images, zzso was zzso We also studied the effect of the decision fusion procedure using a zzso simulation with synthetic input zzso The results helped to formulate a model that predicts the quality improvement of fused brain zzso based on the number of individual zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate a zzso procedure that exceeds the accuracy of previous automatic methods and can compete with manual zzso
