zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies present an opportunity to advance research by pooling zzso However, brain zzso derived from zzso are susceptible to differences in zzso zzso It is therefore necessary to determine whether there is an interaction between the sequence parameters and the effect of interest, and to zzso any such interaction by careful choice of acquisition zzso As an zzso of the issues involved in zzso studies, we present data from a study in which we aimed to zzso a set of zzso zzso to define a protocol giving data that are consistent and zzso across two centers and over zzso 

zzso was achieved based on data quality and quantitative measures, in our case using zzso and zzso Based zzso zzso Our approach consisted of a series of five zzso zzso a zzso zzso was collected, using a range of candidate zzso and parameters chosen on the basis of previous zzso Based on initial results, a number of minor changes were implemented to zzso the zzso and a second zzso zzso was zzso zzso data quality measures were compared between zzso in order to determine the best performing zzso which were taken forward to the next stage of zzso We subsequently acquired short-term and long-term zzso zzso data, and quantitative measures were again assessed to determine the protocol with the highest zzso across zzso zzso of a scanner software and hardware upgrade on the zzso of the protocols at one of the centers were also zzso 

Assessing the quality measures from the first two zzso allowed us to define zzso zzso all with high image quality as assessed by zzso Comparing the quantitative test and zzso measures, we found high zzso zzso for all zzso but lower zzso zzso for some protocols than zzso The upgrade showed no important zzso 

We were able to determine (for the scanners used in this zzso an zzso zzso which gave the highest zzso and zzso zzso of those zzso and give details of this protocol zzso More generally, we discuss some of the issues raised by zzso studies and describe a methodical approach to take towards zzso and zzso and recommend performing this kind of procedure to other zzso
