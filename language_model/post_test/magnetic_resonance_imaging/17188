The aim of this study was to evaluate three-dimensional zzso transformation constructive interference in zzso zzso imaging as a zzso investigation of anatomical structures around the zzso zzso for surgical zzso of the spinal zzso and zzso of the zzso 

The zzso imaging was used to zzso neural structures around the zzso zzso in 13 cases and was compared with conventional magnetic resonance zzso In all cases, zzso images demonstrated the fine structure of the spinal zzso and nerve roots, with good contrast between zzso spaces and zzso The zzso findings were closely correlated with microscopic observation and zzso investigation during zzso In three of eight patients whose zzso images demonstrated abundant nerve roots embedded in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was not zzso zzso These three cases had obliteration of the zzso space by the zzso at the bilateral sides of the zzso In two cases with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction of zzso images along the spinal zzso clearly demonstrated a zzso around the complicated zzso 

Using zzso imaging is useful for establishing precise zzso information around zzso zzso and for predicting the level of surgical zzso
