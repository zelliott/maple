We have previously reported a model of cerebral zzso in the form of an equivalent electrical zzso The aim of this work was to demonstrate that the model could predict zzso flow patterns seen in the superior zzso zzso zzso straight zzso zzso and jugular vein zzso in normal zzso 

An electrical zzso model of zzso and cerebral blood flow was fitted to measured zzso and zzso data from 16 healthy zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso derived from the model were compared with measured zzso flows in the zzso zzso and zzso 

The model accurately predicted the measured jugular zzso The measured zzso from zzso and zzso showed a less pronounced and delayed zzso peak compared with the predicted zzso The fitted bulk model parameters provided relative values that zzso approximately to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cerebral aqueduct ( approximately zzso zzso zzso ( approximately zzso and arteries zzso and for the elastic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso ( approximately zzso and veins zzso The elastic zzso of the major cerebral arteries was large and could not be accurately zzso 

We have confirmed the ability of the model to predict the zzso zzso in healthy zzso The absence of any statistically significant component of the zzso zzso not described by the model implies that zzso of zzso flow could be used to zzso further the zzso zzso
