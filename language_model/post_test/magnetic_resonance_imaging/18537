zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of 28 patients with known breast tumors was compared with clinical findings and zzso and for 12 of the patients also with zzso The dynamic zzso performed in 18 patients showed that signal intensity in zzso echo zzso images increased rapidly in zzso tumors after contrast injection and reached a plateau level at 1-3 zzso zzso zzso showed slower contrast enhancement continuing throughout the whole examination period of 10 zzso The most enhancing parts of the tumors were selected for intensity zzso The differentiation between zzso and benign tumors in dynamic zzso zzso was in accordance with the zzso findings in all zzso The tumor diameter as measured by zzso showed very good agreement with the size of the tumor zzso zzso of tumor size zzso in zzso and zzso showed that zzso had the most accurate correlation to the measured size of the tumor zzso
