zzso motor coordination is essential for piano zzso The functional zzso zzso for high-level zzso performance achieved by professional pianists is zzso We compared professional pianists to musically zzso controls while carrying out zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequential finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso This task zzso to zzso playing scales practiced daily by pianists from the beginning of piano zzso Musicians and controls showed significantly different functional zzso zzso When comparing performance of parallel movements to rest, musically zzso controls showed stronger zzso than did pianists within a network including anterior zzso cortex, right zzso zzso cortex, both zzso zzso and right zzso zzso The direct comparison of zzso parallel to mirror movements between both groups revealed stronger signal increases in controls within zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and zzso bilateral prefrontal cortex, left zzso zzso cortex, right anterior zzso and right zzso zzso These findings suggest increased efficiency of cortical and zzso systems for zzso movement control in zzso This may be fundamental to achieve high-level motor skills allowing the musician to focus on artistic aspects of musical zzso
