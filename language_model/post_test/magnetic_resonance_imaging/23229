To investigate the performance of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in identification and characterization of lethal zzso zzso in a zzso manner on human zzso 

Before forensic autopsy, 20 human forensic corpses were examined on a zzso system for the presence of zzso zzso Short zzso zzso and zzso long axis images zzso zzso zzso were acquired in zzso In subsequent autopsy, the section technique was adapted to short axis zzso zzso investigations were conducted to confirm autopsy and/or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were detected and age staged with zzso of which 13 were zzso confirmed zzso zzso and zzso Six zzso interpreted as zzso by zzso showed no zzso or zzso zzso Five of the six zzso zzso correlated well to coronary pathology, and one case displayed a severe zzso zzso 

zzso reliably demonstrates zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso in zzso In zzso cases zzso may display zzso zzso zzso at autopsy and routine zzso zzso has the potential to substantiate autopsy and to counteract the loss of reliable information on causes of death due to the recent disappearance of the clinical zzso
