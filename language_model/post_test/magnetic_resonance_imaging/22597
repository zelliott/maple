The aim of this study is to report a novel description of a displaced tear of the lateral zzso as a zzso low signal intensity band parallel and zzso to the anterior cruciate ligament zzso on zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images, resulting in the appearance of a zzso zzso The appearance of a double zzso may potentially be a specific indicator for a lateral zzso displaced zzso Increased awareness of this characteristic MR finding may increase accuracy in the diagnosis of displaced tears of the lateral zzso
