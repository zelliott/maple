Recent evidence indicates zzso zzso folding patterns and white matter zzso uniquely shape electric fields generated by zzso Current methods for predicting the brain regions influenced by zzso involve projecting the zzso zzso position or center of gravity onto realistic head models derived from structural and functional imaging zzso Similarly, zzso models have been used to estimate electric field zzso generated by zzso zzso delivered from a particular zzso location and zzso In the present paper we inspect differences between electric field zzso estimated using the finite element method zzso and zzso approaches described zzso We then more specifically examined an approach for zzso cortical zzso volumes based on individualistic zzso simulations of electric zzso We evaluated this approach by performing zzso recordings during zzso zzso zzso We recorded motor evoked zzso zzso in response to single pulse zzso using two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso at 25 different locations zzso grid, zzso zzso centered on the hotspot of the right first zzso zzso zzso muscle in left motor zzso We observed that motor zzso maps varied within and between subjects as a function of zzso zzso position and zzso For each zzso position and orientation tested, simulations of the zzso electric field were zzso using individualistic zzso models and compared to zzso zzso obtained during our zzso zzso We found zzso simulations of electric field strength, which take into account zzso zzso geometry and tissue zzso zzso significantly correlated with zzso observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations validate the zzso of individualistic zzso models to account for variations in zzso folding patterns and tissue zzso zzso which should help improve the targeting accuracy of zzso in the mapping or zzso of human brain zzso
