To present a method of automated zzso zzso of dynamic MR enhancement zzso of zzso transplants and evaluate the zzso properties of the resulting MR zzso zzso zzso 

This study included 27 patients with zzso zzso transplants and eight patients with diseased zzso zzso The examination was repeated in 10 patients and the zzso of the enhancement parameters was estimated by analysis of zzso zzso The zzso properties of the transplant volumes and enhancement parameters were tested with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The enhancement parameters were zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso rate zzso and cortical zzso blood volume zzso were lower in diseased zzso zzso The combination of these parameters was a strong predictor of zzso transplant disease zzso under zzso curve zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of cortical and zzso enhancement is feasible and allows the accurate detection of zzso disease in zzso transplants by zzso
