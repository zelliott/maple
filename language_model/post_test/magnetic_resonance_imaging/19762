We studied a patient zzso with bilateral damage to those regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso We demonstrated, for the first time in a zzso patient, that zzso was unable to adapt to the visual zzso induced by the optical prisms with either hand within four times the number of trials required by healthy adult zzso We offer a novel account for the role of the zzso in zzso zzso that the reach direction to the zzso target location specified in zzso zzso coordinates must be zzso from the gaze direction to the perceived target location specified by intrinsic zzso coordinates in order to produce zzso accurate zzso This spatial zzso between gaze direction and reach direction may provide the necessary training signal required by the zzso to update the current internal model used to maintain spatial zzso between visual and zzso maps of zzso zzso The hypothesis is discussed in relation to recent zzso accounts of zzso zzso
