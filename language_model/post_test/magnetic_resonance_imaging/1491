The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso in the detection of zzso tumor after zzso zzso zzso of experimental liver zzso 

zzso was performed at different energy levels in zzso zzso rabbits zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were placed at 0, 24, 96 hours, and 14 zzso Signal zzso were calculated of the transition between zzso damaged and undamaged tissue zzso zone zzso zzso and of the surrounding tissue zzso zone zzso zzso 

zzso recurrence was seen in 47 zzso At 24 hours sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 92, 100, and zzso in zzso and 23, 100, and 50% in zzso At 14 days sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 100, 11, and zzso in zzso and 100, 89, and zzso in zzso 

zzso is best excluded in zzso at 24 hour and in zzso at 14 day with an accuracy up to zzso
