To establish whether zzso transfer ratio zzso zzso are sensitive to change in normal appearing zzso matter zzso in early zzso multiple sclerosis zzso in the absence of significant zzso and to assess whether zzso or white matter zzso measures are associated with clinical measures of impairment in early zzso zzso 38 patients were studied zzso disease duration zzso years zzso zzso to zzso median expanded disability status scale zzso zzso zzso to zzso along with 35 healthy zzso zzso was determined from zzso density weighted images with and without zzso zzso zzso was used to generate normal appearing white matter zzso and zzso segments of the zzso map, and partial zzso were zzso with a 10 zzso threshold and zzso zzso Mean zzso was calculated from the tissue zzso zzso measures were determined using a zzso fast zzso zzso recall sequence from 37 patients and 17 zzso 

Mean zzso and zzso zzso were both reduced in early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients v zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso p zzso zzso Brain zzso fraction zzso correlated with zzso zzso but when zzso was included as a zzso zzso zzso was still lower in the patients zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

In early zzso zzso matter zzso zzso is zzso The correlation with mild clinical impairment (in this essentially zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso could be a clinically relevant surrogate marker in therapeutic zzso
