zzso resonance zzso zzso is capable of zzso depicting the mechanical properties of zzso in zzso In contrast to mechanical zzso at the surface of the zzso the method proposed in this study describes zzso waves produced by an inserted zzso The results demonstrate that zzso performed with the needle driver provides zzso zzso estimates that correlate well with those obtained using mechanical zzso Comparisons between zzso acquisitions obtained with surface and needle drivers yielded similar results in zzso However, the zzso wave propagation pattern provided by the needle driver in a target region can reduce section zzso error in wavelength zzso that occurs with surface drivers in zzso zzso zzso zzso testing of the device was performed on zzso This study demonstrates that the needle driver is an effective option that offers advantages over surface drivers for obtaining accurate zzso estimates in targeted regions that are accessible by the zzso
