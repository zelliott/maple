Cell lines represent a key tool in cancer research allowing the generation of zzso which resemble initial zzso in zzso animal zzso The zzso of early zzso development is of major interest in order to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso based zzso zzso allows zzso and zzso of zzso development in early stages prior to manual zzso zzso agents for zzso such as zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso represent powerful tools for the zzso zzso of early stage zzso In this experimental study, we zzso prostate cancer cells with zzso or zzso in zzso and used zzso zzso for tracing zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso for tracking in an zzso animal zzso 

zzso of prostate cancer cells zzso was established zzso with zzso and zzso zzso detection of zzso cells in an zzso phantom was carried out through zzso zzso while zzso detection was performed using zzso zzso after subcutaneous zzso injection of zzso cells into zzso mice zzso The animals were scanned in regular intervals until zzso The respective zzso volumes were zzso and corresponding zzso masses were subjected to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resulted in no significant zzso effects on proliferation and cell zzso zzso zzso accounted 105 cells for zzso as well as for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans allowed detection of 103 and 104 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso from days zzso while zzso zzso allowed detection until zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were highly zzso in zzso mice and the zzso volume development was zzso in a time dependent zzso The amount of injected cells correlated with zzso size development and disease zzso zzso analysis of the induced zzso masses demonstrated characteristic zzso of prostate zzso 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting direct zzso zzso zzso and zzso based zzso zzso tracing of cancer cells in a model of prostate zzso zzso zzso was found to be suitable for zzso tracing allowing long detection zzso The zzso cells kept their highly zzso potential zzso zzso volume development was zzso prior to manual zzso allowing zzso zzso in early stages of the zzso
