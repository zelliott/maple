The human cognitive system is severely limited in the amount of information it can process zzso When two tasks are presented within a short zzso zzso reaction time of each task, especially task 2, is dramatically zzso Previous studies have shown that such delay is accompanied by increased zzso in the right inferior frontal zzso zzso In this study, we address the role of right zzso in resolving zzso interference at two different zzso allocation of zzso attention and response zzso We scan 12 subjects using functional zzso while they conduct two zzso discrimination in task 1 and color discrimination in task zzso vary the zzso between tasks as 100 or 1500 zzso The targets are located at the center or at the zzso When both are at the center, they compete primarily for response zzso When both are at the zzso they additionally compete for the allocation of zzso zzso zzso show that the right zzso and frontal zzso regions are significantly more active in the short zzso than the long zzso condition, but only when subjects attend to the periphery in both zzso We conclude that the right lateral frontal regions are important for resolving zzso interference at the zzso attention zzso
