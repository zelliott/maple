To assess whether brain tissue loss occurs after profound and sustained suppression of magnetic resonance imaging zzso enhancement, we measured brain volume changes from 10 patients with rapidly evolving secondary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso treated with zzso zzso stem cell transplantation and followed up for 24 zzso An average yearly decrease of brain volume of about zzso was observed despite only five enhancing zzso seen on triple dose follow up scans of two zzso This indicates that, in zzso progressive loss of tissue can occur independently of zzso zzso zzso
