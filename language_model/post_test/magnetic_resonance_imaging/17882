Recently, we reported a previously zzso symptom constellation zzso zzso zzso zzso deafness, and zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the clinical features of the syndrome to aid patient management with respect to diagnosis, zzso zzso and identification of best treatment zzso

All children presented with zzso zzso in zzso Later, zzso zzso zzso and hearing loss were zzso zzso zzso mostly responded well to treatment, zzso proved to be the most debilitating feature, with three patients zzso All available magnetic resonance imaging zzso revealed subtle symmetrical signal changes in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, four patients had a small corpus zzso and zzso zzso and three had a small spinal zzso Regional quantitative zzso analysis of the images confirmed the corpus zzso and zzso zzso and showed further patterns of variation from the zzso
