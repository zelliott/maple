zzso processing is associated with brain electrical activity that is reflected in zzso zzso zzso zzso during a target detection task, and regional cerebral zzso metabolism zzso measured zzso may be influenced by the same zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso factors could be directly correlated with zzso to derive functional brain maps of brain activity at zzso zzso zzso zzso and 400 zzso following stimulus presentation in a target detection zzso We controlled for the potential zzso effects of age, sex, and task zzso and correlate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreases in zzso at each time point were identified with statistical zzso mapping zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso maps were the same for target and zzso processing, while maps for 280 and 400 zzso clearly distinguished between targets and zzso zzso zzso cognitive processes that depend mainly on stimulus characteristics show less variation based on stimulus meaning zzso letter vs zzso target vs zzso than later zzso cognitive zzso These early effects are zzso to the left hemisphere, for negative zzso factors, and positive zzso correlations are more likely than negative zzso zzso Thus, brain areas related to task processing impact both zzso and zzso measures, suggesting a shared zzso mechanism for negative zzso factors and increased zzso zzso statistical analysis of these two measures using statistical zzso mapping provides high spatial and zzso resolution in zzso experiments, while requiring only a single zzso PET scan per zzso
