zzso size in fluid zzso inversion recovery zzso images is an important clinical zzso for patient assessment and zzso Although manual zzso of zzso areas considered as ground truth, it is zzso highly zzso and difficult to perform in areas of zzso zzso In this study, an automatic methodology for zzso zzso zzso is proposed, and its application in patients with brain tumors undergoing zzso and in patients following stroke is zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was performed in 57 magnetic resonance imaging zzso data sets obtained from 44 zzso 28 patients with primary brain zzso 5 patients with zzso zzso zzso who were scanned zzso during zzso therapy (18 zzso zzso and 11 patients following zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was obtained in all zzso When compared to manual zzso a high visual similarity was observed, with an absolute relative volume difference of zzso and zzso and a zzso overlap error of zzso and zzso obtained for two zzso accepted values for automatic zzso zzso zzso of the segmented zzso volumes were in line with qualitative zzso assessment in four patients who received zzso zzso In stroke patients the proposed methodology enabled identification of the zzso zzso and differentiation from other zzso zzso areas, such as pre-existing zzso 

This study proposed a zzso methodology for zzso zzso detection and zzso and for discrimination between zzso of interest and pre-existing zzso zzso from this study show the wide clinical applications of this methodology in research and clinical zzso
