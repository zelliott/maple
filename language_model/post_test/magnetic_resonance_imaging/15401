zzso zzso is an increasingly reported transient zzso with yet unknown zzso In this study 2 cases of zzso zzso are described in whom we used a combined approach of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso showed ST abnormalities and cardiac serum markers were mildly zzso but zzso demonstrated smooth coronary zzso zzso revealed severe zzso zzso and significantly decreased ejection zzso zzso we detected reduced zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratios during the first week of acute zzso After 1 week we observed an improvement of zzso ratios by zzso and zzso which was associated with an increase in left zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso MRS might be a valuable tool in the evaluation of zzso zzso but larger zzso are needed to improve the understanding of zzso changes during transient zzso zzso
