To evaluate a zzso fast zzso zzso zzso Dixon zzso technique for zzso spine imaging with and without fat suppression compared to conventional zzso fast recovery zzso zzso and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso 

zzso patients were referred for spine magnetic resonance imaging zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso STIR zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two observers compared STIR and zzso water images and zzso zzso and zzso zzso images for overall image quality, fat suppression, zzso zzso motion, zzso fluid zzso flow artifact, zzso and disease zzso 

On zzso images water and fat separation was perfect in 58 zzso zzso Compared to zzso the zzso water images demonstrated less motion in 57 zzso of 61 patients zzso zzso zzso better zzso sharpness in 51 zzso and patients zzso zzso zzso and less zzso flow artifact in 7 zzso P zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in fat suppression or chemical shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images showed equivalent motion, zzso flow, and chemical shift zzso zzso depiction was equivalent on zzso water and STIR images and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso efficiently provides both zzso and zzso zzso spine images with excellent image quality, equal disease zzso and zzso reduction in scan time compared to conventional STIR and zzso zzso
