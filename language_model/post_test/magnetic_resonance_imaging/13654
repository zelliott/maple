To determine whether zzso adaptation to a vertical zzso disparity is altered in patients with zzso zzso 

With a zzso zzso zzso responses of zzso eye position to a zzso or 30-minute period was measured in subjects wearing a zzso zzso vertical zzso over one zzso Thirteen patients with well-documented zzso diseases who did not have manifest zzso zzso or limited zzso eye movement and zzso healthy subjects zzso 

The mean zzso zzso percentage of vertical zzso adaptation was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and 30-minute zzso zzso These levels were significantly smaller than the respective ones in the zzso control group zzso zzso zzso repeated measures zzso Seven zzso of 13 patients, including two with genetically confirmed pure zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso showed markedly reduced responses to both the zzso and 30-minute zzso In all three patients with acute zzso zzso the zzso response was improved at the same time as zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso adaptation to vertical zzso disparity is frequently impaired in patients with zzso zzso These results bolster the hypothesis that zzso adaptation is a zzso zzso
