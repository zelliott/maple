zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides a zzso tool for observing zzso of neural activity in the brain while a subject listens to zzso However, intense acoustic noise is generated in the process of capturing MR zzso This noise stimulates the auditory nervous system, limiting the dynamic range available for displaying zzso zzso The noise is potentially damaging to hearing and is distracting for the zzso In an active noise control zzso system, a reference sample of a noise is processed to form a sound which adds zzso with the noise at the zzso zzso We describe an zzso of zzso in the zzso hostile and physically compact zzso scanning zzso First, a zzso system was evaluated zzso in the laboratory, using the electrical drive to a zzso loudspeaker as the zzso This system produced zzso zzso of zzso zzso between 250 zzso and 1 zzso and smaller amounts at higher zzso The system was modified to operate in a real MR scanner where the reference was obtained by recording the acoustic scanner zzso zzso reduction by zzso zzso of the most intense component in scanner noises was realized between 500 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso reduction of 12 zzso and 5 zzso in tests at zzso of 600 zzso and at zzso zzso zzso Although the benefit of zzso is limited by transmission paths to the zzso other than zzso routes from the auditory zzso zzso achieves worthwhile zzso even in the frequency range of maximum bone zzso zzso zzso zzso should, therefore, be generally useful during auditory zzso
