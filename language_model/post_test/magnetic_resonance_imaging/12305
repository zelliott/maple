The aim of this study was to assess a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso as an MR contrast agent to target zzso as well as to evaluate the targeting ability of zzso for in zzso zzso In the present work, 17 zzso sized iron oxide zzso zzso with zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso were used for targeting the zzso zzso zzso which is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested as negative zzso The size distribution of zzso and zzso zzso was determined by transmission electron zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso After intravenous administration of both zzso contrast enhancement in the liver was observed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso retention was monitored zzso by zzso and validated with zzso blue zzso and zzso for up to eight days post zzso zzso Although the zzso signal intensity did not show significant differences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso blue zzso and zzso analysis confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso mainly in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso were mainly taken up by zzso and zzso zzso Target specificity was further confirmed by high-resolution MR imaging of zzso containing isolated zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso signal was observed for zzso isolated from animals which received zzso zzso but not from animals which received zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso can be used as a zzso targeting MR contrast agent to potentially aid in the diagnosis of zzso diseases if the zzso zzso by zzso is taken into zzso
