zzso changes in the zzso zzso of patients with Parkinson's disease were previously investigated in different zzso zzso The aim of our study was the in zzso measurement of these zzso using three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

21 patients with Parkinson's disease and 24 controls were examined using magnetic resonance zzso imaging at 3 zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions were analyzed using zzso For spectral fitting, an adjusted basis data set with zzso zzso and zzso was used to better reproduce the in zzso zzso To assess differences between both groups more accurately, especially in zzso at lower zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in addition to the analysis of individual zzso 

We found significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to controls, whereas zzso zzso acid, and zzso acid were slightly zzso According to anatomical features, clear differences in the zzso profiles were found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso result from progressive zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels can be interpreted as impaired energy metabolism due to zzso zzso Lower zzso zzso might be a cause or consequence of zzso zzso Furthermore, slightly increased zzso and zzso acid levels are expected based on post zzso data in Parkinson's zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first zzso confirmation of these zzso zzso
