Increased use of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance zzso in zzso planning highlight some technical problems in zzso zzso of markers during imaging are vital in zzso zzso In magnetic resonance zzso zzso specially designed plates are used that contain zzso copper zzso solutions as a zzso Replacement of copper zzso solution is usually required after some time due to zzso and zzso The zzso procedure is quite cumbersome and can cause technical problems in zzso In this study, we describe copper zzso solution mixed with a zzso gel as a simple but useful alternative to zzso copper zzso resolution to ease the zzso procedure and to overcome the air zzso
