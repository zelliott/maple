zzso electrical brain activity in the alpha zzso zzso band is a prominent feature of human zzso zzso during alert zzso and is commonly thought to arise primarily from the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso While the zzso is considered to play a supportive role in the generation and zzso of cortical alpha zzso its precise function remains controversial and incompletely zzso To address this, we evaluated the correlation between the blood zzso level dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signals in the zzso and the spontaneous zzso of zzso alpha rhythms based on zzso data acquired zzso during an zzso zzso zzso We observed both negative and positive correlations in the zzso The negative correlations were mostly seen within the visual thalamus, with a preference for the zzso over lateral zzso zzso The positive correlations were found at the anterior and zzso zzso zzso Through functional connectivity analysis of the zzso data, the zzso was found to be functionally associated with the same widespread cortical visual areas where the zzso signals were zzso correlated with the zzso alpha zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso were part of a distinct functional network that included brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso These observations are consistent with previous animal zzso studies and the notion that the visual thalamus, and the zzso in particular, is intimately involved in the generation and spontaneous zzso of zzso alpha zzso facilitated by its zzso and widespread interaction with the cortical visual zzso We further zzso that the anterior and zzso zzso zzso being part of the ascending zzso system, may indirectly zzso cortical alpha rhythms by affecting vigilance and zzso zzso
