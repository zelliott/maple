zzso based on real-time zzso is an emerging technique that can be used to train voluntary control of brain zzso Such brain training has been shown to lead to behavioral effects that are specific to the functional role of the targeted brain zzso However, real-time zzso zzso so far was limited to mainly training localized brain activity within a region of zzso Here, we overcome this limitation by presenting near real-time dynamic zzso modeling in order to provide feedback information based on connectivity between brain areas rather than activity within a single brain zzso Using a zzso attention zzso we show that participants can voluntarily control a feedback signal that is based on the zzso model comparison between two zzso model alternatives, zzso the connectivity between left visual zzso and left zzso zzso zzso the connectivity between right visual zzso and right zzso zzso Our new approach thus allows for training voluntary control over specific functional brain zzso Because most mental functions and most neurological disorders are associated with network activity rather than with activity in a single brain region, this novel approach is an important zzso innovation in order to more directly target functionally relevant brain zzso
