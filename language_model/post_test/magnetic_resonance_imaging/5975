MR and CT techniques zzso for small zzso imaging are playing an increasing role in the evaluation of small zzso zzso Several studies have shown the advantage of these techniques over tradition zzso zzso examinations secondary to improvements in spatial and zzso resolution combined with improved zzso zzso zzso The preference of MR zzso CT has been geographical and based on expertise and public zzso With the increasing awareness of radiation exposure, there has been a more global interest in implementing techniques that either reduce or eliminate radiation exposure zzso zzso Hall zzso zzso zzso increasing source of radiation zzso N zzso J zzso zzso This is especially important in patients with chronic diseases such as inflammatory zzso disease who may require multiple studies over a lifetime or in studies that require sequential imaging time points such as in assessment of gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso MA, von zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Small zzso zzso assessment with magnetic resonance zzso J zzso zzso Imaging zzso A recent study showed that certain zzso of patients with Crohn's disease may be exposed to higher doses of zzso those diagnosed at an early age, those with upper tract zzso penetrating disease, requirement of intravenous steroids, zzso or multiple surgeries zzso zzso zzso K, zzso C, et zzso Crohn's disease: factors associated with exposure to high levels of diagnostic zzso zzso zzso Therefore it has been suggested that techniques that can reduce or eliminate radiation exposure should be considered for imaging zzso zzso Hall zzso zzso zzso increasing source of radiation zzso N zzso J zzso zzso zzso to the excellent zzso contrast, direct zzso imaging capabilities, new zzso zzso pulse zzso lack of zzso radiation and availability of a variety of oral contrast agents, MR is well suited to play a critical role in the imaging of small zzso zzso In this article we will review the technical issues related to the performance of MR zzso and zzso and discuss the role and controversies of using MR in the assessment of inflammatory zzso zzso
