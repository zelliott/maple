Little is known about the effects of zzso zzso on the cerebral processing of zzso We investigated the effects of zzso IV zzso doses on the perception of experimental painful heat zzso Healthy volunteers were evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while receiving the painful stimuli in conjunction with zzso and increasing doses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Vital variables were monitored and all subjects rated pain intensity and zzso on a zzso rating zzso zzso in consciousness were measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso declined as zzso dosage was increased zzso decrease, zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intensity ratings also decreased with increasing zzso dosage but to a lesser extent zzso zzso During zzso administration, a typical pain zzso network zzso zzso cingulate, and prefrontal zzso was found, whereas decreased pain perception with zzso was associated with a zzso reduction of zzso cerebral zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso effects on pain processing showed a decreasing zzso of the secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso This part of the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked with the affective pain component that zzso the potency of zzso in modulating affective pain zzso
