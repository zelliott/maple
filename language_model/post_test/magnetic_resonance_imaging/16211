The zzso zzso are a family of zzso storage disorders caused by impaired zzso zzso zzso brain imaging abnormalities are seen in zzso zzso This study aims to determine the effects of zzso stem cell transplantation zzso and/or intravenous zzso replacement therapy zzso on these zzso 

A retrospective chart and brain imaging study review was conducted of zzso types I and II patients with brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso performed at, and following, initiation of zzso White matter zzso zzso zzso spaces, corpus zzso zzso and zzso were scored by three independent zzso blinded to cognitive status, date of treatment zzso and zzso of zzso 

Five patients were zzso three patients with zzso I and two with zzso zzso zzso of follow-up ranged from 13 to 51 zzso One patient had severe zzso I zzso zzso and received zzso followed by zzso The remaining patients had zzso zzso The other two zzso I patients were cognitively normal siblings zzso zzso with an intermediate zzso One zzso II patient had moderate cognitive impairment without zzso zzso zzso the other zzso zzso had normal zzso There was very little zzso variation in zzso zzso The greatest abnormalities for each patient were found at initial zzso All patients, including the zzso patients, demonstrated improved or unchanged zzso scores following zzso zzso of white matter abnormalities or zzso zzso spaces did not correlate with cognitive zzso as such, extensive zzso zzso abnormalities were noted in the older, cognitively normal zzso I zzso In comparison, his younger sibling had only mild zzso abnormalities at the same age, after receiving 4 years of zzso 

This study represents one of the first to document the zzso effects of zzso in zzso patients utilizing serial brain MR imaging studies, and raises several important zzso Brain zzso abnormalities typically become more pronounced with zzso initiation of zzso or zzso reversed or stabilized this trend in the zzso patients zzso In addition, earlier initiation of treatment resulted in decreased severity of imaging zzso zzso mechanisms for these observations include improved zzso fluid zzso reduced central nervous system zzso storage via zzso through the zzso barrier zzso repair of damaged zzso reduction in zzso zzso or zzso zzso through the zzso
