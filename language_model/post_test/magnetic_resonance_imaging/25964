The sensitivity of several zzso imaging techniques to local field zzso zzso generated by zzso in bulk magnetic zzso zzso were compared in mouse brain at zzso zzso At high field, differences in zzso can cause substantial signal zzso and image zzso Because zzso effects scale with zzso mouse brain zzso imaging at high field is particularly susceptible to the effects of zzso The zzso techniques zzso and zzso were found to have a decreased sensitivity to zzso compared to zzso imaging zzso Images obtained using zzso and zzso exhibit severe signal zzso in regions of high zzso such as near zzso zzso and at the brain zzso In applications such as functional zzso and diffusion zzso zzso and zzso are likely to provide more comprehensive whole brain coverage in mouse brain at high field than zzso techniques, which are likely to image regions of the brain with strong zzso with low signal to noise, reducing the probability of detecting significant zzso based zzso
