The influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso and elimination of iron oxide zzso is studied in this zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso were obtained via zzso decomposition of an iron coordination complex as a zzso zzso were coated with zzso acid zzso and zzso to zzso molecules by zzso zzso zzso Using a rat model, we explored the zzso zzso pattern in blood and in different zzso zzso zzso and zzso after intravenous administration of the zzso The time of residence in blood was measured from the evolution of water zzso zzso with time and zzso analysis in blood zzso The results showed that the residence time was doubled for zzso coated zzso and consequently particle zzso in liver and zzso was zzso zzso zzso analyses showed no zzso in the liver and confirm zzso distribution of zzso in the organ, in agreement with magnetic zzso and iron zzso Finally, by successive magnetic resonance images we studied the evolution of contrast in the liver and measured the zzso time of residence and zzso of zzso in the liver during a one month zzso On the basis of these results we propose different zzso routes that determine the fate of magnetic zzso
