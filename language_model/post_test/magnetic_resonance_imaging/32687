Type 2 diabetes leads to cognitive impairment and zzso which may reflect zzso and zzso complications as well as neurodegenerative zzso There are few studies on the anatomical basis for loss of cognitive function in type 2 zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the association between type 2 diabetes and markers of brain aging on magnetic resonance images, including zzso zzso and white matter zzso as markers of vascular damage and general and zzso zzso as markers of zzso in zzso men born between zzso and 1919 and followed since 1965 in the zzso Aging zzso 

zzso and incident zzso was zzso zzso between magnetic resonance imaging markers and diabetic status were estimated with zzso regression, controlling for zzso and other vascular zzso 

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the cohort is zzso zzso with type 2 diabetes had a moderately elevated risk for zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk for both zzso zzso and zzso was twice as high in subjects with compared with those without type 2 zzso Among the group with type 2 diabetes, those with the longest duration of diabetes, those taking insulin, and those with complications had relatively more zzso brain zzso 

There is evidence that older individuals with type 2 diabetes have an elevated risk for vascular brain damage and neurodegenerative zzso These pathological changes may be the anatomical basis for an increased risk of cognitive impairment or zzso in type 2 zzso
