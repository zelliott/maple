We used zzso field zzso to zzso cortical zzso types described by zzso in 16 patients with multiple sclerosis zzso compared with 8 zzso zzso to characterize the contrast properties of cortical zzso including zzso zzso zzso and phase zzso and to investigate the relationship between cortical zzso types and clinical zzso 

We collected, on a zzso zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and a zzso zzso rapid zzso zzso 

Overall, 199 cortical zzso were detected in patients on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed for characterization of cortical plaques into type I zzso type II zzso and type zzso zzso extending partly or completely through the cortical zzso zzso as described zzso zzso III and IV were the most frequent type of cortical plaques zzso followed by type I zzso and type II zzso zzso Each zzso type was more frequent in secondary progressive than in zzso zzso This difference, however, was significant only for type zzso zzso zzso images showed the zzso while phase images showed the zzso zzso ratio for all cortical zzso zzso In patients, the number of type zzso zzso was associated with greater disability zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and older age zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detected different zzso cortical zzso types in our small multiple sclerosis zzso sample, zzso if validated in a larger population, that it may prove a valuable tool to assess the contribution of cortical zzso pathology to clinical zzso
