zzso zzso zzso is a novel technique that uses blood signal zzso to detect blood volume zzso through changes in tissue zzso zzso has relatively low signal to noise ratio zzso because only zzso of tissue signal remain at the time of blood zzso Here, it is shown that by adding a zzso transfer zzso zzso it is possible to increase zzso either by attenuating the initial tissue zzso when the zzso pulse is placed before zzso or, accelerating the recovery process when the pulse is applied after the zzso To test whether the zzso pulse would affect the blood zzso time in zzso zzso effects in blood were measured both ex zzso in a bovine blood phantom and in zzso in human zzso Such effects were found to be sufficiently small zzso under a zzso power zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and frequency offset zzso zzso to allow use of the same zzso zzso zzso functional zzso experiments using zzso were performed in human visual zzso at 3 zzso The relative signal changes in zzso were of the same magnitude as in zzso while the contrast to noise ratio zzso was enhanced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso should provide a means for increasing inherently low zzso in zzso experiments while preserving the zzso zzso
