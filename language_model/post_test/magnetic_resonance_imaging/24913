To evaluate the accuracy of water enema zzso zzso zzso for predicting the location of zzso in patients with zzso to magnetic resonance imaging zzso focusing on zzso zzso and having zzso and zzso data as the reference zzso 

zzso women zzso age zzso zzso suspected of having deep pelvic zzso underwent zzso CT and video zzso within 4 zzso Two zzso blinded to the clinical data evaluated the CT images obtained after zzso retrograde zzso using water as the contrast zzso and a comparison with zzso and zzso findings was zzso CT sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso negative zzso value zzso and diagnostic accuracy were zzso The radiation dose to patients was zzso Cohen's weighted zzso zzso test was used to evaluate the zzso zzso 

In 23 out of 33 patients zzso zzso implants were found at surgery and pathological zzso CT confirmed the diagnosis of zzso zzso in 20 out of 23 zzso Three zzso located on the zzso zzso colon zzso zzso zzso and one zzso the zzso zzso with a diameter of less than zzso were not zzso CT sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and accuracy values were 87, 100, 100, 77, and zzso zzso The mean effective dose estimate was zzso Almost perfect agreement between the two readers was found zzso 

Water enema CT can play a role in the diagnosis of zzso zzso and represents another accurate potential tool for video zzso approaches, especially in patients for whom zzso is zzso
