The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease zzso does not exactly match the pathological findings at autopsy in every zzso zzso zzso imaging measures, such as zzso zzso Imaging zzso that reflect underlying pathology, would be clinically useful independent supplementary measures of disease zzso We have developed an zzso that extracts zzso information from individual patient's zzso zzso scans and assigns a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the scan based on the degree of zzso in comparison to patterns extracted from a large library of clinically well characterized zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be adjusted for demographics to give zzso zzso which are zzso for subjects with brains identified as abnormal by the zzso Since zzso findings are considered to represent the zzso zzso our objective was to assess the sensitivity of zzso to pathological zzso zzso This was done by comparing zzso zzso based zzso with zzso grading of disease severity in 101 subjects who had both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tangle zzso zzso We found a rank correlation of zzso zzso between zzso zzso stage and zzso The results show that zzso extracted information from zzso scans such as zzso accurately capture the severity of zzso pathology and can be used as an independent approximate surrogate marker for zzso pathological staging as well as for early identification of zzso in individual zzso
