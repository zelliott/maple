zzso zzso is considered to play a major role in the development of clinical disability in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso Acid zzso is a zzso marker constantly identified in zzso studies of the normal and zzso zzso To our knowledge there are no studies available that evaluated zzso in zzso fluid zzso as a possible marker for disease zzso 

To evaluate zzso zzso of zzso in zzso in relation to disease zzso clinical measures of disability and zzso markers of disease zzso 

zzso zzso were determined in zzso of 46 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 secondary progressive zzso and 8 primary progressive zzso Prior to zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso and clinical examination, including the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Composite zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of zzso were determined in 12 patients with other neurological diseases zzso 

Median zzso zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso in zzso , zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients had a significantly lower zzso concentration than zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso brain volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and black hole zzso load zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No differences were observed between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso concentration in zzso patients is related to clinical performance and zzso measures of disease burden and may therefore be an important zzso specific marker of disease severity and possibly zzso
