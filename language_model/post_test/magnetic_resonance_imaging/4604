A retrospective analysis of 158 zzso and zzso zzso scans of normal brains at zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Signal zzso in the frontal cortex, zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso zzso were divided by those of frontal white zzso and these zzso ratios were correlated with iron zzso estimated from the anatomical region and age of the zzso zzso plots were also made of zzso ratio versus age for the zzso zzso zzso The changes in both zzso and zzso ratios were consistent with the hypothesis that zzso and zzso vary zzso with iron zzso and the corresponding zzso determined separately from the zzso and zzso zzso were generally in zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso ratios at zzso zzso was consistent with expected iron zzso except for the cortex, in which partial volume errors due to zzso and white matter caused increased zzso The zzso results agreed well with in zzso data on zzso and zzso in tissue specimens and with other zzso zzso When compared with zzso and zzso in zzso solution, a significant zzso relaxation zzso was found, attributable to slower diffusion and zzso of zzso in zzso
