We compared the assessment of left zzso function and mass by zzso zzso zzso with fast zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso in patients who received zzso heart zzso We also sought to establish the zzso of zzso zzso in this patient zzso 

We zzso acquired 51 sets of echo and zzso data in 21 patients who had undergone zzso heart zzso We examined the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in this group and compared it with published zzso We compared the left zzso ejection fraction zzso and mass determined by echo with the zzso zzso 

The average time between zzso and echo was 0 zzso 7 days zzso zzso zzso the time between each set of zzso data acquisition was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance showed good zzso in this population, with zzso percentage zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for mass, and zzso percentage zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso limits of agreement between echo and zzso were wide for both zzso zzso zzso to zzso and mass, irrespective of the formula used zzso to 198 g for the Bennett and Evans formula, zzso to zzso g for the American Society of zzso zzso formula, zzso to 181 g for the zzso formula, and zzso to zzso g for the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is zzso in recipients of transplanted zzso We found poor agreement with the results of zzso The choice of technique will depend on local resources as well as the clinical importance of the zzso Echo remains readily available and gives rapid assessment of volumes, zzso and zzso However, the good zzso of zzso may make it a more suitable technique for long-term follow-up of an individual or of a study zzso
