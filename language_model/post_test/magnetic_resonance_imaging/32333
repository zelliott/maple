zzso of the zzso gene lead to combined zzso hormone zzso zzso which is characterized by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and, less zzso zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular zzso in a cohort of patients with zzso 

A zzso study involving 46 cases of zzso (17 familial cases belonging to seven zzso and 29 sporadic zzso selected on the basis of clinical and hormonal evidence of zzso zzso central zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of an identified cause of zzso zzso of zzso were investigated by DNA zzso zzso hormonal and zzso data were collected at each zzso 

zzso zzso were identified in all familial zzso five zzso presented a zzso zzso zzso one zzso presented a zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso and one presented a previously zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 29 sporadic cases, only two zzso presented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was observed among patients with the same zzso particularly the presence and age of onset of zzso the levels of zzso and the results of zzso zzso One patient presented a zzso mass that persisted into zzso 

This is the first report of a zzso in the initiation zzso of the zzso gene and this further expands the spectrum of known zzso responsible for zzso The low zzso frequency observed in sporadic cases may be due to the involvement of other unidentified acquired or genetic zzso
