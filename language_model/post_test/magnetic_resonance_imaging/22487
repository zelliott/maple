To investigate the potential utility of magnetic resonance zzso zzso for passive zzso of therapeutic zzso devices such as zzso and zzso 

Using a zzso coating process, zzso zzso were applied to commercially available zzso zzso and zzso These coated devices were zzso in zzso made of zzso zzso zzso and whole blood and also in live canine zzso on a zzso cardiovascular MR scanner using zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional spin zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso echo zzso 

zzso available zzso shelf zzso zzso 5, and 6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were clearly zzso in all zzso and canine zzso and the zzso proved to be durable and zzso without degradation in signal intensity up to 24 zzso zzso zzso address some of the shortcomings that have previously limited the role of MR as a guidance zzso 

Both in zzso and in zzso zzso of therapeutic zzso devices coated with zzso zzso are found to be clinically zzso
