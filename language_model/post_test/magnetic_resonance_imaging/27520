zzso relaxation in the rotating frame, or zzso relaxation, is normally described by a zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso and microscopic molecular exchange may lead to zzso or zzso zzso relaxation behavior in certain zzso under the application of spin lock pulse field zzso 

To investigate the presence of zzso zzso relaxations in zzso rat head zzso of brain and zzso 

Five zzso rats underwent zzso imaging at zzso A zzso rotary echo spin lock pulse was used for zzso preparation with a spin lock frequency of zzso Twenty-five zzso images with spin lock times ranging from 1 to 60 zzso were acquired using a zzso zzso zzso echo zzso Image zzso over different spin lock times were fitted using zzso as well as zzso models both on zzso basis and zzso zzso zzso with a significance level P value of zzso was used to evaluate whether zzso model gave a better fitting than zzso zzso 

In rat zzso only zzso but no apparent zzso zzso relaxation zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso zzso relaxation was observed in muscles of all five rats zzso zzso zzso A longer and a shorter zzso relaxation component were extracted to be zzso zzso zzso (a fraction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the normal single zzso relaxation of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso relaxation components were detected in rat zzso The long and the short zzso relaxation component are thought to zzso to the restricted zzso water population and the hydrogen exchange between zzso and zzso groups, zzso
