zzso of zzso and microscopic distribution of general zzso can facilitate identification of zzso zzso and molecular zzso of zzso zzso Previous attempts to measure brain zzso zzso with zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso imaging were conducted at magnetic field strengths lower than 2 zzso All have produced only zzso of brain zzso zzso intrinsic to zzso imaging of zzso include higher zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the lower limits to zzso delay times that can be used in conventional zzso imaging zzso So far, such methods have been unable to capture rapidly zzso brain zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging and zzso were conducted at zzso zzso using a specially developed zzso probe and new imaging zzso With the new techniques, it was possible to observe directly the zzso distribution, and elimination in brain of zzso a fluorinated general zzso with special advantages for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images, acquired at different times after zzso administration, clearly showed the distribution of a fluorinated general zzso within the zzso Based on continuous zzso relaxation time zzso zzso signals could be separated into two zzso attributable respectively to zzso in a mobile or immobile zzso During zzso there was a delayed zzso of zzso in the mobile zzso During zzso there was a rapid elimination from the immobile zzso 

At zzso zzso zzso distributes zzso in the zzso zzso in the brain tissue contributes mostly to the immobile component of the zzso zzso whereas that in the surrounding zzso and muscle zzso contributes mostly to the mobile zzso Imaging and zzso results suggest that the immobile component of zzso is associated with the general zzso effects of the zzso
