We aimed to assess the value of a second MR scan in the zzso diagnosis of zzso 

One hundred zzso subjects with clinical follow-up of at least zzso with two scans were selected from a cognitive disorders zzso zzso were reviewed as a single first scan zzso zzso two zzso scans presented side-by-side zzso zzso and a registered pair zzso zzso zzso were presented to two zzso and a zzso together with approximate scan zzso (if zzso and zzso zzso decided on a main and zzso zzso 

There was no evidence that differences between methods zzso as relative odds of a correct zzso differed between zzso zzso for degenerative condition or not, zzso for main diagnosis, zzso for zzso zzso results were pooled over zzso For distinguishing zzso from degenerative conditions, the proportions correctly diagnosed were higher with methods B and C than with A zzso both zzso The difference between method B and C was not statistically significant zzso For main diagnosis, the proportion of correct diagnoses were highest with method C for all three zzso however, this was not statistically significant comparing with method A zzso or with method B zzso For zzso diagnosis, there was some evidence that method C was better than method A zzso and B zzso 

zzso zzso and registration may improve visual diagnosis in zzso
