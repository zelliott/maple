zzso of zzso and zzso evaluation using various sequences and field strengths in the zzso zzso and measurement of cartilage defects in an animal zzso 

After open creation of zzso cartilage defects of various zzso depths and locations in 8 zzso sheep knee zzso the knees were examined using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso and zzso and zzso zzso echo zzso sequences on zzso T and zzso T MR zzso The images were analyzed by two independent zzso in a blinded manner, by dividing the zzso into 15 virtual zzso The results were correlated with the zzso findings with regards to location, zzso and depth of the zzso 

The highest sensitivity zzso zzso diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso positive zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso values in detecting defects were obtained using the zzso T zzso zzso The highest specificity zzso zzso yielded the zzso T zzso zzso with the other sequences inferior by no more than zzso zzso In general, zzso sequences were superior to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and especially to zzso sequences zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In determining the zzso zzso the zzso T zzso sequence was superior to all other sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso with only slight superiority to the zzso T zzso sequence zzso zzso p zzso zzso but clear superiority to the other sequences zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso p zzso zzso zzso other zzso p zzso zzso To determine the zzso zzso the zzso T zzso sequence was most reliable zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by the zzso T zzso sequence zzso zzso significance of difference: p zzso zzso 

In detecting cartilage zzso the field strength of zzso zzso was only superior to zzso T zzso using zzso zzso or zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso In determination of depth and length of the zzso the higher field strength was not zzso
