To determine zzso the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the impact of zzso zzso on response to zzso 

zzso zzso rats were zzso implanted with zzso and/or allocated to: control groups zzso or treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso The next day, zzso zzso limited to the zzso was initiated in all treated zzso The zzso cycle included 36 zzso given in 9 sessions for 3 consecutive zzso zzso development was assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso associated with zzso caused a zzso complete zzso rate zzso as opposed to the zzso rate zzso when zzso alone or zzso in control zzso Drug delivery for 3 weeks produced better survival results zzso compared to one-week sustained release zzso MR images showed zzso increasing tumor volumes during the first half of the zzso cycle, followed by a decrease, and the disappearance of the tumor if survival exceeded 120 zzso 

zzso controlled delivery is a promising strategy for zzso zzso Drug delivery system zzso is zzso implicated in both the response to treatment and the limitation of toxic side zzso
