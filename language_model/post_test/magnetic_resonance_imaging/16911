We wanted to investigate the usefulness of zzso zzso functional zzso zzso for the assessment of cortical visual impairment in infants with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso data were collected from 24 infants who suffered from zzso and from 12 zzso normal zzso Slow zzso zzso was performed using a zzso MR scanner while visual stimuli were being zzso Data analysis was performed using zzso zzso zzso software zzso the zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the region of interest data, and the time to peak zzso of zzso response functions zzso was estimated for the surviving zzso The number of activated zzso and the zzso values of zzso were zzso zzso correlation analysis was performed to compare visual impairment evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso with the number of activated zzso in the zzso zzso in all zzso 

In all 12 control zzso the blood zzso zzso zzso signal was negative and the maximum response was located in the anterior and superior part of the zzso zzso and this might zzso to the anterior region of the primary visual zzso zzso In contrast, for the 24 cases of zzso there were no activated zzso in the zzso in four subjects, small and weak zzso in six subjects, deviated zzso in seven subjects and both small and deviated zzso in three zzso The number of active zzso in the zzso lobe was significantly correlated with the zzso visual impairment zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso of the zzso was significantly delayed in the cases of zzso as compared with that of the normal zzso 

zzso the characteristics of both the zzso response and the zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in the cortical visual assessment of infants with zzso
