One the main reasons for the limited use of zzso in the evaluation of zzso dissection in emergency conditions is its long execution zzso The authors report their experience regarding a new zzso sequence that reduces execution time and avoids the use of contrast zzso 

zzso zzso stable patients with suspected (16 cases, 3 with confirmed diagnosis of zzso or known zzso dissection (2 zzso underwent in emergency conditions zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso Imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso Flip zzso 45, bandwidth zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, acquisition time per slice 7 zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso 38; zzso zzso sequence requiring cardiac zzso The results obtained were compared in terms of diagnostic accuracy and execution time with those of classical zzso examination zzso blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

The diagnostic accuracy of zzso both with zzso sequence and the zzso technique, and zzso CT in the diagnosis of dissection or aneurysm is equal zzso whereas execution time is 6, 25 and 6 minutes, zzso zzso CT proved to be more accurate than zzso zzso in evaluating the zzso zzso and the extension of the dissection to the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence provides a diagnosis of zzso dissection or zzso zzso in a short time and may represent a valuable alternative to CT in emergency settings, especially in patients with reported zzso to zzso contrast zzso
