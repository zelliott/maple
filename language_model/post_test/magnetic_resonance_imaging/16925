Previous zzso studies have primarily focused on the neural activities involving the acute effects of zzso Considering that acupuncture can induce long-lasting effects, several researchers have begun to pay attention to the sustained effects of acupuncture on the resting zzso Most of these researchers adopted functional connectivity analysis based on one or a few zzso brain regions and demonstrated various zzso brain networks underlying the specific effect of zzso Few have investigated how these brain networks zzso at the zzso zzso In this study, we sought to investigate the functional correlations throughout the entire brain following acupuncture at zzso zzso zzso in comparison with acupuncture at nearby zzso zzso We divided the whole brain into 90 regions and constructed functional brain network for each zzso Then we examined the network hubs and identified statistically significant differences in functional correlations between the two zzso Following zzso but not zzso the zzso regions such as the amygdala, zzso and anterior zzso zzso emerged as network zzso For direct zzso increased correlations for zzso compared to zzso were primarily related with the zzso and zzso regions such as the zzso amygdala, anterior zzso zzso and thalamus, whereas decreased correlations were mainly related with the sensory and frontal zzso The zzso zzso patterns between the two conditions may relate to the functional specific zzso effects of zzso The preliminary findings may help us to better understand the long-lasting effects of acupuncture on the entire resting brain, as well as the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso
