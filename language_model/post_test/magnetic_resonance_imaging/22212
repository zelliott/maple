Studies of zzso zzso zzso in monkeys suggest that excessive zzso zzso from the internal segment of the zzso zzso zzso suppresses the motor thalamus, which reduces zzso of the cerebral zzso motor system, resulting in the zzso and poverty of movement of Parkinson's disease zzso This hypothesis is supported by reports of high rates of spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso of the supplementary motor area zzso and zzso prefrontal regions in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso or chronic zzso electrical zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso is associated with marked improvements in zzso and zzso and the impaired zzso of zzso is reversed when the zzso is treated with zzso zzso To test whether improvement in motor function with zzso surgery can be attributed to increased activity in zzso cortical regions, we assessed the changes in regional cerebral blood flow zzso and zzso symptoms during disruption of zzso activity with zzso stimulation delivered through implanted brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed an increase in zzso in zzso zzso cortical areas during zzso zzso which improved rigidity and zzso These results suggest that zzso the excessive zzso output of the zzso zzso reverses zzso via a zzso relay, by zzso of brain areas involved in the initiation of zzso
