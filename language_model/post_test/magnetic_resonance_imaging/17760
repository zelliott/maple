Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that zzso T cell responses to zzso zzso derived from zzso T cells undergoing zzso may contribute to multiple sclerosis zzso zzso 

The percentage of zzso zzso T zzso cells specific for various zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in the peripheral blood and zzso fluid zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso of class I molecules zzso with relevant zzso zzso Moreover, the capacity of zzso zzso T cells to produce zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in response to the relevant zzso zzso was evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso T cells by zzso cells was also evaluated ex zzso 

We found that zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells specific for zzso zzso were represented in zzso patients with zzso significantly higher than in healthy zzso These zzso zzso T cells with a strong potential to produce zzso or zzso in response to the relevant zzso zzso were significantly accumulated in the zzso from the same zzso In addition, the zzso of these zzso zzso T cells correlated with the disease zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso cellular proteins are required to activate zzso zzso zzso T cells ex zzso 

Taken together, these data indicate that zzso zzso zzso T cells with strong inflammatory potential are recruited at the level of the inflammatory site, where they may be involved in zzso zzso through the production of high levels of inflammatory zzso
