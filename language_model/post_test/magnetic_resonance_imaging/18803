Studies of patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis have demonstrated that they typically remain zzso and zzso for 1-2 zzso It has been zzso that prolonged zzso psychosis may have serious zzso poor response to zzso medications, poor clinical zzso and direct zzso This study investigated the relationships between duration of zzso initial psychosis and zzso functioning and high-resolution imaging brain zzso 

A total of 156 subjects with zzso zzso zzso disorder, or zzso disorder were evaluated during their first episode of zzso zzso included nine zzso of zzso zzso zzso measures of total brain zzso gray and white matter, and zzso and measures of brain surface zzso 

The mean duration of zzso initial psychosis was zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and surface anatomy zzso with duration of zzso initial psychosis were zzso none reached statistical zzso When the group was divided on the basis of median duration of zzso initial zzso there were again no significant differences between the groups with long and short duration of zzso initial psychosis except on two measures zzso memory and cortical zzso zzso 

The absence of strong correlations suggests that zzso initial psychosis has no direct toxic neural zzso These results suggest that large-scale initiatives designed to prevent neural injury through early intervention in the zzso or early psychosis phase may be based on incorrect assumptions that zzso or cognitive deterioration may be zzso Nevertheless, early treatment is justified because it reduces zzso
