To correlate the zzso and magnetic resonance imaging results of the zzso nerve in eyes primarily zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with zzso who underwent primary zzso 

The zzso results of 67 eyes from 67 patients with zzso who underwent primary zzso between March 1997 and January 2008 were studied for evidence of zzso nerve zzso Two zzso independently reviewed available zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies with special emphasis on zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging for evidence of zzso nerve zzso A weighted zzso statistic was used to assess agreement between zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso zzso 

Of the 67 eyes zzso 60 had zzso magnetic resonance images, 58 of which were deemed appropriate for review by both zzso Review of the zzso results showed zzso nerve involvement in 62 zzso of 67 zzso 28 zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso On review of the magnetic resonance scans, the first zzso identified zzso nerve involvement in 57 zzso of 60 zzso 26 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso The second zzso identified zzso nerve involvement in 46 zzso of 60 zzso 33 zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso agreement existed between zzso zzso zzso Poor and fair agreement existed between each of the 2 zzso and zzso results, respectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumors showed the greatest disparity zzso zzso and zzso between magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso 

Limited correlation was found between magnetic resonance imaging and zzso results in assessing zzso nerve invasion in eyes with zzso zzso resonance imaging using routine imaging technologies, although useful in the evaluation of zzso has limited usefulness in assessing the exact extent of zzso nerve invasion; high-risk features of zzso such as zzso invasion remain best defined by zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the interpretation of zzso nerve involvement by a zzso should not be the determining factor to defer zzso in favor of zzso zzso
