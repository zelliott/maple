This study sought to report on the utility and safety of the zzso CO2 laser in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective chart review identified 16 patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso All tumor pathology types were zzso zzso were assessed based on hormone status, tumor size, pathology, zzso and zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso zzso zzso zzso 12; zzso zzso cyst, 2; zzso zzso and zzso 1 each) with an average size of zzso zzso were identified by zzso and zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso CO2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso 8 were zzso and 4 were zzso (3 zzso and 1 zzso zzso Gross total zzso was achieved in 7 of 16 patients zzso with hormone zzso in all patients zzso after a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso complications occurred in 3 patients zzso 2 patients developed transient diabetes zzso zzso and 1 developed a zzso leak requiring surgical zzso Five patients zzso underwent zzso radiation to the residual zzso 

We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso surgery for zzso tumors is a minimally invasive approach using a tool that is quick and effective at cutting and zzso The surgery has a low rate of complication, and no zzso complications were zzso The laser fiber allows the surgeon to safely cut and zzso without the zzso problems encountered with conventional CO2 zzso Further studies are recommended to further define its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso
