To determine whether zzso disc zzso change in size over zzso 

Based on previous work by the authors of the present study, the zzso of zzso zzso disc zzso is approximately zzso The natural history of zzso disc zzso is zzso The natural history of zzso and cervical disc zzso in symptomatic individuals who become zzso has been shown in multiple studies frequently to result in a decrease in size of the zzso 

Twenty patients with 48 zzso zzso zzso previously diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging using zzso zzso spine echo and zzso zzso zzso refocused images at each zzso disc level from zzso to zzso for a mean follow-up period of 26 zzso zzso canal diameter was recorded, and disc zzso square area was measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso according to percentage of canal zzso The change in size of the disc zzso over time was zzso 

All patients remained zzso during the follow-up zzso A total of 48 disc zzso were identified from the original magnetic resonance zzso There were 21 small zzso canal zzso disc zzso 20 medium zzso zzso disc zzso and seven large zzso zzso disc zzso Of the 21 small disc zzso 18 showed no significant change in size, whereas three showed a measurable increase in zzso Of the 20 zzso disc zzso 16 showed either a small or no change in size, one showed a significant increase in size, and three showed a significant decrease in zzso Of the seven large disc zzso three demonstrated no change in size, and four demonstrated a significant decrease in zzso In addition, five new disc zzso were detected in four zzso one was small, and four were moderate in zzso 

Based on the results of this study, the authors believe that zzso disc zzso may well exist in a state of relative zzso yet exhibit little change in size and remain zzso There was a trend, however, for small disc zzso either to remain unchanged or increase in size and for large disc zzso often to decrease in zzso
