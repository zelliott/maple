We aimed to zzso zzso the effects of chronic exercise training on both peripheral and central zzso artery function and structure with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Physical activity has well-known beneficial effects on vascular function in subjects with zzso zzso Exercise also leads to beneficial effects on zzso function in elderly athletes, possibly contributing toward the reduced risk from coronary artery disease in this age zzso However, conflicting data exist on the training effects in the younger zzso 

A total of 49 young (age 20 to 35 zzso zzso subjects, zzso elite zzso and zzso and zzso sedentary control subjects, underwent zzso zzso The zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso descending zzso and the common carotid artery and the zzso artery were assessed for zzso and zzso area and zzso zzso and zzso zzso artery zzso were also assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso showed vascular zzso with enlarged zzso (by zzso p zzso zzso and reduced central zzso artery zzso areas (by up to zzso zzso zzso descending zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar for elite zzso when compared with sedentary control subjects at all levels of the zzso and the carotid and zzso artery zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was similar for zzso and control subjects zzso zzso zzso However, zzso showed reduced absolute (by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Young elite zzso demonstrate normal zzso but reduced zzso zzso zzso whole body, combined zzso and zzso does not lead to changes in zzso zzso but to vascular zzso
