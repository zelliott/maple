To determine whether the hypothesis that the phenomenon of persistent zzso zzso in the zzso stage of zzso stroke is in fact associated with the zzso zzso This is done by assessing the evolution of both the apparent diffusion zzso zzso and the zzso marker zzso zzso in a group of patients, and by comparing the results with the total cellular density by means of the zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-two patients with stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery were each examined once only at a time ranging from eight hours to six days following the onset of zzso zzso values of zzso were obtained based on zzso zzso zzso Short TE zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso of cerebral zzso in zzso zzso Their levels were also compared with those in zzso zzso zzso 

In the stroke zzso there was a significant correlation between zzso and the zzso level, albeit less pronounced than that for zzso During different zzso stages between 12 hours and three days, the zzso ratio increased by a factor of two and returned to apparently normal zzso 

Our study provides the first demonstration of a relationship between persistent zzso zzso and the zzso population in the context of cell swelling due to zzso imbalance in stroke zzso
