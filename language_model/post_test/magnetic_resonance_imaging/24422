We zzso analyzed 15 years experience of awake surgeries for zzso tumors in zzso zzso zzso surgeries mostly for language mapping were performed for 42 of zzso newly diagnosed cases zzso and 59 of zzso surgeries including for recurrence zzso When the same zzso and locations as cases zzso under awake condition are selected from the parent population treated by radical zzso awake surgeries were most frequently performed for 14 of 55 newly diagnosed cases zzso and 14 of 62 surgeries zzso with grade II zzso In the results, 8 of 59 surgeries zzso could not achieve complete language monitoring until the final stage of tumor zzso considered as failed awake zzso Gross total zzso was accomplished in 20 of 42 newly diagnosed cases zzso and 32 of 59 surgeries zzso zzso rate was zzso Late severe deficits were observed in 2 of 42 newly diagnosed cases zzso and 3 of 59 surgeries zzso zzso language mapping cases did not suffer severe deficits in both early and late zzso In contrast, high zzso of severe deficits, 3 as early and 2 as late of 8 cases, were identified with failed awake zzso The overall survival of patients treated by awake surgery compared favorably with those treated without stimulation mapping and with stimulation mapping under general zzso zzso surgery may contribute to improve the outcome of zzso near eloquent areas by maximizing the tumor zzso and minimizing the surgical zzso
