Dynamic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso muscles is based on performing a number of short zzso while the patient zzso consecutive points placed in different positions of zzso 

To check the relation between zzso findings and the results of clinical examination in patients with various types of zzso 

We have selected three patients with lateral zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and inferior zzso restriction from the group, in which we have performed zzso We have taken measures of the affected muscles shape, zzso area and zzso The results were related with the clinical zzso 

The zzso obtained with use of zzso reflect the actual state of the affected muscle as seen on the Hess zzso The limitation of the muscles action is represented by a lack of increase in the zzso area and volume in respective gaze zzso The restriction of the muscle affects its shape by pulling it towards the place of zzso 

Data acquired by means of zzso zzso to the clinical findings and allow a quantitative analysis of the degree of muscle zzso Defining the extent of the zzso changes in zzso muscles, related with long-lasting paralysis, let us make an informed decision regarding further zzso
