zzso zzso are rare zzso tumors that usually have a long clinical zzso However, they may cause sudden zzso There are only 31 cases of zzso zzso reported in the literature, and only one has been studied with magnetic resonance zzso We present three new cases of zzso zzso cell tumor studied with zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso and MR (2 zzso and discuss the clinical zzso diagnostic imaging and treatment of these zzso 

Age at presentation ranged from 19 to 59 years zzso Two patients were female and 1 zzso zzso of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from 1 year to nearly 14 zzso zzso complaints included zzso zzso zzso nerve deficits, headache, and gait zzso Imaging studies revealed zzso zzso involving the zzso the zzso was zzso in one case and zzso in zzso They were zzso or zzso on CT zzso zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and frequently showed contrast zzso All tumors were operated through a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso techniques only partial zzso could be zzso as there was no sharp zzso from the surrounding tissue in any zzso Two of our patients had increased neurological deficits after zzso zzso was not zzso zzso of zzso remnants has not shown clear tumor growth after 1, zzso and 10 zzso 

Imaging characteristics of zzso zzso do not seem to differ from those in other locations and are not zzso zzso surgery is rarely if ever possible, nor is it zzso because of the risk of functional zzso However, because of their benign zzso partial zzso seems to carry a similar prognosis as tumors in other locations that are amenable to complete zzso
