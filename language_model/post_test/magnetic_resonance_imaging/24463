zzso ultrasound zzso has been shown to be an efficient imaging zzso in guiding zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to assess the usefulness of zzso US in guiding zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso that was not clearly visible on zzso US or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

During a zzso period, zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 14 patients with 19 zzso zzso that were poorly defined on zzso US and zzso zzso zzso US was repeated after 30 minutes, and complete zzso was defined as absence of any zzso enhancement within the zzso zzso Patients were followed periodically with clinical zzso liver function tests, zzso zzso and zzso CT or magnetic resonance zzso imaging for a minimum of 1 year after zzso to look for local recurrence or disease zzso Survival probability was estimated with the zzso zzso 

Complete tumor zzso was achieved in all 19 zzso with no evidence of residual or zzso tumor in the zzso areas after a mean follow-up of 16 zzso No major complications were observed in any zzso However, new zzso developed in other parts of the liver on follow-up scans in three patients, and were accordingly treated with zzso zzso Two patients died of disease progression or liver failure within the zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso not well zzso on zzso US or CT, zzso US provides an additional tool to guide zzso zzso
