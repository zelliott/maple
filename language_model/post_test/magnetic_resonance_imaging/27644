The study's purpose was to analyze the effects of zzso on the volume of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the last two considered zzso zzso 

The volume of OT and zzso were determined using magnetic resonance imaging in nine zzso healthy women, before and after 36 zzso of a standardized zzso training program zzso zzso 

The volume of the dominant OT was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso with training, whereas the zzso OT volume remained unchanged zzso P zzso zzso The total volume of zzso increased by zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso because of a similar increase of dominant and zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso Before zzso the volume of the OT was zzso greater in the zzso compared with the dominant side zzso zzso zzso This asymmetry was compensated by zzso training zzso P zzso zzso No zzso zzso in zzso muscle volumes were observed either before zzso P zzso zzso or after zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

The present study reveals the existence of zzso in the muscles of the abdominal wall in zzso healthy zzso zzso practice twice a week for 9 months elicits zzso of the abdominal wall muscles, particularly of the zzso and eliminates zzso zzso of the zzso Modern zzso can be recommended as an effective method to reinforce the muscles of the abdominal wall and to compensate zzso zzso zzso
