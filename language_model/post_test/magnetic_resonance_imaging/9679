One aspect of the debate over the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is whether it should be carried out with the zzso or zzso zzso 

The zzso technique results in fewer graft failures than the zzso technique in anterior cruciate ligament zzso 

zzso controlled zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

A total of 153 patients were zzso zzso into 2 groups of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring zzso using zzso interference screw zzso zzso technique zzso group, zzso zzso zzso and zzso technique zzso group, zzso zzso zzso The evaluation methods were clinical examination, zzso zzso zzso the International zzso Documentation Committee zzso and the zzso knee scores, and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso All of the operations were performed by 1 experienced zzso surgeon, and all clinical assessments were made by 2 blinded and independent zzso A musculoskeletal zzso blinded to the clinical data made the zzso zzso 

There were no differences between the study groups zzso zzso percent of patients zzso zzso zzso were available at a minimum zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso Eight patients (7 in the zzso group and 1 in the DB zzso had graft failure during the follow-up and had anterior cruciate ligament revision surgery zzso zzso zzso In addition, 7 patients (5 in the zzso group and 2 in the DB zzso had an invisible graft on the zzso assessment at the zzso zzso Also, the zzso bundle was partially invisible in 2 patients and the zzso bundle in 9 zzso Together, the total number of failures and invisible zzso were significantly higher in the zzso group (12 patients, zzso than the DB group (3 patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant group differences were found in the knee scores or stability evaluations at the zzso 

This zzso zzso trial showed that the revision rate of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was significantly lower with the zzso technique than that with the zzso zzso However, additional years of follow-up are needed to reveal the long-term zzso
