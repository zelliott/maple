Volume reduction in insular zzso may constitute an important zzso in zzso We provide the first zzso of studies that conducted zzso analyses of the magnitude of effect and pattern of zzso volume reduction in schizophrenia compared with healthy control zzso 

Included studies examined zzso volume in schizophrenia relative to healthy control zzso Studies were located via electronic database searches and hand zzso Study selection, data zzso and quality assessment were completed by two independent zzso zzso g effect sizes were calculated using Comprehensive zzso zzso to zzso zzso differences between people with and without zzso accounting for zzso influences of age, sex, illness zzso medication, whole brain volume, and potential differences in zzso and anatomical zzso 

zzso analysis showed reductions of bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso with moderate zzso apparent zzso zzso zzso This effect was consistent across left and right zzso and not influenced by illness stage or zzso Additional analyses revealed larger reductions of anterior zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses did not identify any significant zzso of reduced zzso zzso 

This zzso indicates zzso reduction of zzso volume in zzso of greatest magnitude in the anterior zzso Cellular distinctions across anterior and zzso zzso may contribute to understanding the zzso and functional significance of the observed zzso zzso
