To investigate differences between focal and diffuse cervical zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso at zzso T in comparison to quantitative MR imaging of the upper cervical zzso area and zzso zzso at baseline and zzso 

Including 22 zzso patients with persistent spinal zzso symptoms by either diffuse or focal zzso and 17 controls, we acquired zzso the mean zzso area and the water zzso relaxation time and disability at baseline and zzso zzso analyses included zzso comparisons and correlation zzso zzso studies covered assessment of zzso and progression of the baseline zzso 

Compared with focal zzso diffuse zzso were attended by more zzso zzso longer zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline was associated significantly with zzso zzso and with clinical progression during zzso zzso MRS results were not significantly correlated to the clinical disability zzso The zzso of MRS was zzso zzso changes of the MRS results were not statistically zzso 

MRS indicated differences in zzso and zzso between diffuse and focal cervical zzso in zzso Although zzso spectral and clinical changes were zzso zzso turned out to be the most sensitive spectral zzso
