The purpose of this article is to evaluate the relationship between apparent diffusion zzso zzso values, tumor volume, and total zzso grade in patients with prostate cancer before radical zzso 

A total of 110 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone zzso prostate zzso at zzso T before radical zzso were zzso zzso values were derived by drawing a region of interest on the zzso confirmed zzso zzso volume was obtained by manual zzso on zzso images zzso and zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso value or tumor volume and the zzso grade was assessed by using zzso mixed linear and effect zzso zzso analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy of zzso and tumor volume in determining the aggressiveness of prostate zzso 

A total of 197 tumors were zzso 128 zzso tumors were found in the peripheral zone and 69 zzso were found in the central zzso The zzso value was found to be zzso correlated with the zzso grade zzso zzso zzso for peripheral zone zzso Higher zzso values were found to be associated with lower zzso grades in the peripheral zone prostate zzso No association was found in the central zone prostate zzso Both zzso values and tumor volumes were found to significantly predict tumor zzso specifically in the peripheral zone zzso under the curve, zzso 

zzso values were found to be zzso correlated with the zzso zzso grade in patients with prostate zzso Our results show that zzso values might help to predict prostate cancer, especially for tumors in the peripheral zzso Given the substantial overlap in the zzso values, the addition of other MR zzso such as zzso and technical improvements in zzso imaging might improve accuracy in the zzso of zzso
