zzso volume reduction and increased prevalence of zzso white matter zzso have been reported in late-life zzso We aimed to examine whether total number of zzso white matter zzso were associated with reduced zzso volume in aged female subjects with zzso depression zzso 45 zzso and healthy comparison zzso 

The study included 28 middle-aged and elderly subjects with major depression and 41 zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were determined using manual tracing zzso White matter zzso were rated from zzso zzso scans using a zzso zzso zzso 

After controlling for total brain volume and age, patients had reduced zzso volume due to right zzso volume decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes did not differ significantly between zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis indicated that reduced zzso volume did not significantly correlate with total number of zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Right zzso volume was reduced in aged female zzso subjects with zzso Total number of zzso white matter zzso was not associated with the decrease in right zzso zzso Our data suggest zzso involvement, independent of zzso white matter zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
