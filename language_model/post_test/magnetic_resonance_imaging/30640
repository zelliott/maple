We investigated the sensitivity of the zzso zzso brain potential zzso recorded during a zzso task to memory function in subjects with zzso of the Alzheimer's type zzso those with mild cognitive impairment zzso and normal elderly zzso We also explored the ability of zzso zzso verbal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso search zzso zzso memory measures to distinguish between the three subject groups using zzso function zzso Fourteen patients with zzso 16 with zzso and 15 zzso and zzso controls were zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso subjects at all levels of memory zzso however, it did not differ between zzso and control zzso Delayed verbal memory performance best zzso zzso from zzso and control subjects, while delayed verbal memory and zzso volume best zzso zzso subjects from zzso These results support the utility of zzso and zzso measures in diagnosing zzso and do not support the notion that zzso zzso is sensitive to mild memory dysfunction when measured using the current zzso
