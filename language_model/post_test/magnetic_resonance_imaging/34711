To identify changes in the zzso of the zzso responsible for its adult zzso 

Ten human fetal specimens ranging from 13 to 24 zzso zzso age were examined with MR zzso zzso and zzso sections of 10 different specimens of similar ages were compared with MR imaging zzso 

At 13 to 14 zzso zzso the unfolded zzso on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso surrounds a widely open zzso zzso zzso zzso At 15 to 16 weeks, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso have started to zzso The zzso zzso remains zzso The zzso zzso is larger and more zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso fields of the zzso zzso are arranged zzso The zzso zzso has a narrow U zzso By 18 to 20 weeks, the zzso begins to resemble the adult zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso have folded into the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso approximate each other across a narrow zzso zzso The zzso fields form an arc and the zzso field has increased in size within the widened arch of the zzso zzso 

MR imaging of fetuses provides a zzso basis for understanding zzso zzso
