zzso and bipolar disorder share overlapping symptoms and genetic zzso zzso brain zzso is seen in both zzso 

We compared 70 schizophrenia and 64 psychotic bipolar zzso their respective unaffected first-degree relatives zzso zzso 70, and zzso zzso zzso and 118 healthy subjects, all group zzso zzso and zzso We used functional network connectivity analysis to measure differential connectivity among 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state zzso First, we examined connectivity differences between zzso and control zzso Next, we zzso these dysfunctional connections in relatives for potential zzso Network connectivity was then correlated with Positive and zzso zzso zzso zzso scores to reveal clinical zzso 

Three different network pairs were zzso connected in zzso zzso rate corrected zzso zzso zzso involving five individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior default zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One abnormal pair was unique to zzso zzso one unique to zzso zzso and one zzso was zzso Two of these three combinations zzso zzso were also abnormal in bipolar relatives but none was normal in schizophrenia relatives zzso trend for zzso The zzso circuit zzso which uniquely distinguished bipolar zzso contained multiple zzso zzso Network relationship zzso correlated significantly with zzso negative scores in bipolar zzso and zzso with zzso positive and general scores in zzso 

zzso and psychotic bipolar zzso share several abnormal resting state network connections, but there are also unique neural network zzso between zzso We identified specific connections that might also be candidate psychosis zzso
