zzso zzso has been advocated as the principal imaging zzso for zzso zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso To assess its usefulness we reviewed the course of 18 consecutive patients with zzso zzso zzso Imaging included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso was detected initially in zzso patients, and in zzso during zzso No zzso tumor was detected by zzso zzso when zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso CT and/or zzso confirmed tumors in 10, but demonstrated zzso zzso in association with 6 false positive zzso zzso zzso zzso sampling for zzso zzso one zzso detected by zzso and CT zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso Of these, 8 were false negative, as CT and/or zzso detected zzso 10 agreed with negative CT and zzso and 5 correctly zzso false positive CT and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso led to tumor zzso in 2 zzso We conclude that zzso zzso does not offer greater sensitivity than zzso and that false positive scans are zzso Although zzso zzso may be helpful in selected cases, it is not a significant advance over conventional imaging for zzso zzso zzso
