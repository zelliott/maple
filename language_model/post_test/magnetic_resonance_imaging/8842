This study compared region of interest zzso and zzso analysis zzso methods to determine the optimal method of zzso water fraction zzso zzso Twenty healthy controls were scanned twice using a zzso zzso relaxation sequence and zzso were drawn in white and zzso zzso zzso was defined as the fractional signal from 15 to 40 zzso in the zzso zzso For zzso analysis, the mean intensity of zzso within an zzso was fit using zzso least zzso For zzso zzso was obtained for each zzso and the mean and median values within an zzso were zzso There was a slightly higher correlation between zzso 1 and 2 for the zzso method zzso relative to the zzso method zzso and the zzso mean square difference between scans was zzso lower, indicating zzso was the most consistent between zzso For the zzso method, mean zzso was found to be more zzso than median zzso As the zzso method is more zzso and gives more options for zzso and analysis of zzso it is recommended over the zzso method of zzso zzso
