zzso three zzso image volumes with techniques such as zzso zzso zzso zzso relies on reconstructing the tissue layers based on reflection of light from tissue zzso One zzso scan in an image is acquired by scanning and zzso several zzso scans, and several zzso slices are acquired to assemble a full zzso image zzso In this work, we demonstrate how zzso zzso zzso can be used to accurately reconstruct zzso zzso images with minimal quality degradation from a subset of the original zzso The full zzso image is reconstructed from sparsely sampled data by exploiting the zzso of the image in a carefully chosen transform zzso We use several zzso schemes, recover the full zzso image using zzso and show that there is negligible effect on clinically relevant zzso zzso of the zzso nerve head in the recovered zzso The potential outcome of this work is a significant reduction in zzso image acquisition time, with possible extensions to speeding up acquisition in other imaging zzso such as ultrasound and zzso
