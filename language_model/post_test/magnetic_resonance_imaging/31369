To evaluate a novel quantitative magnetic resonance zzso methodology zzso Echo Medical zzso for measurement of zzso fat and lean mass in zzso 

We have studied zzso the in zzso accuracy and precision by measuring 18 zzso zzso oil with and without 9 zzso water zzso the accuracy and precision of measures of simulated fat mass changes in human subjects zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso fat and lean mass zzso compared to those obtained using the established zzso zzso model method zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso represented 18 zzso of oil at 40 degrees C as zzso zzso fat and 1 zzso lean while at 30 degrees C zzso zzso fat and zzso zzso lean were zzso The zzso of repeated estimates was zzso zzso for fat and zzso zzso for lean zzso Adding 9 zzso of water reduced the fat estimates, increased zzso of fat as lean, and zzso the zzso zzso the simulated change in the fat mass of human volunteers was accurately represented, independently of added zzso zzso compared to the zzso model, zzso underestimated fat and zzso lean zzso The extent of difference increased with body zzso The zzso of repeated zzso increased with zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed shortcomings in absolute accuracy and specificity of fat mass measures, but detected simulated body composition change accurately and with precision roughly three times better than current best zzso This methodology should reduce the study duration and cohort number needed to evaluate zzso zzso
