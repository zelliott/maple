Identification of eloquent brain areas in patients with zzso zzso is important to minimize the risk of neurological zzso We performed a zzso study comparing conventional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for identification of the central zzso to topographical zzso and zzso functional zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patients with brain zzso were zzso at zzso or 3 zzso The central zzso was identified by an experienced zzso on zzso zzso by zzso analysis of zzso zzso in zzso and by zzso analysis in zzso or zzso 

The central zzso in the affected zzso was readily identified in a significantly higher percentage of patients by zzso zzso and topographical analysis zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The topographical analysis identified a significantly larger portion of the total central zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were found between institutions, zzso versus zzso diagnoses, zzso sequence zzso age, or zzso 

Identification of the central zzso is best performed using topographical zzso however, zzso analysis may suffice for daily routine zzso
