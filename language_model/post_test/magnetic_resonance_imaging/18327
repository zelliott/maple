The size of the zzso arch and zzso zzso was measured in 50 healthy volunteers studied by zzso In each case the following parameters were measured and statistically zzso diameter (in zzso of ascending zzso (between onset and arch zzso of zzso arch zzso zzso of zzso of descending zzso (between zzso and zzso of zzso zzso a mean diameter was also zzso and for every diameter mean and standard zzso were zzso Moreover, the length (in zzso of superior and inferior contours of the zzso arch, as the ratio of these two values were zzso At last, total length of considered zzso zzso area of zzso surface and zzso volume were zzso For each zzso a zzso was then zzso with age in zzso and values of above mentioned parameters in zzso zzso evaluation allows to affirm that the size of the zzso grows with zzso On the contrary, the ratio between superior and inferior zzso of the zzso arch tends to remain zzso this fact seems to disagree with the current opinion that the superior wall of the arch grows with age more than the inferior zzso
