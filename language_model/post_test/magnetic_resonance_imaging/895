Evidence from recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggests that zzso cortical changes zzso could participate in the maintenance of function in multiple sclerosis zzso Here, we addressed the impact of brain zzso on the pattern of cerebral zzso in an zzso patient with a zzso zzso This patient showed mildly disabling zzso of the left side zzso zzso and corresponding brain zzso zzso volume zzso of the right zzso The clinical syndrome was considered to result from a zzso in the zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso potential recordings confirmed substantial zzso damage to the zzso tract arising from that zzso zzso of these zzso normal brain zzso was found for hand and foot movements for both brain zzso This demonstrates that brain zzso itself does not necessarily induce cortical zzso changes, even if mild disability is zzso On the other hand, significantly disabling distinct clinical syndromes zzso arising from spinal zzso zzso may evoke cortical changes irrespective of brain zzso This issue has to be studied in zzso zzso
