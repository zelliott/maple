zzso of the lower zzso pole provides good results in the treatment of zzso zzso Therefore we hypothesized that the length of the lower zzso pole is increased in patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso study, level of evidence zzso Between 2000 and 2005, 25 patients with chronic zzso zzso underwent conservative and surgical treatment in our zzso All of them had zzso zzso were three independent examiners measured the zzso Index, the length and the ratio of the zzso and zzso zzso surface, zzso length and thickness and the thickness and length of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso were compared with 50 zzso of a control group with no clinical zzso disorders or zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso a longer zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significant higher ratio between the zzso and the zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso knee zzso No significant changes were seen in the length of the zzso surface or the zzso zzso The development of chronic zzso zzso in athletes might be associated with a longer lower zzso pole as patients with zzso knee showed a longer zzso zzso surface compared with the control zzso
