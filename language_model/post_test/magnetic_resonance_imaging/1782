Sleep is an essential human zzso Although the function of sleep has generally been regarded to be zzso recent data indicate that it also plays an important role in zzso The zzso of human sleep is most effectively zzso with functional imaging, and PET studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of both rapid eye movement zzso and zzso eye movement zzso zzso In this study, PET was used to determine patterns of regional zzso metabolism in zzso sleep compared with zzso We hypothesized that brain structures related to waking cognitive function would show a persistence of function into the zzso sleep zzso Fourteen healthy subjects (age range zzso years; 10 women, 4 zzso underwent concurrent zzso sleep studies and zzso PET scans during waking and zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism declined significantly from waking to zzso zzso Relative decreases in regional metabolism from waking to zzso sleep occurred in wide areas of zzso zzso zzso and zzso association cortex, primary visual cortex, and in zzso zzso After controlling for the zzso declines in absolute zzso relative increases in regional metabolism from waking to zzso were found zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and extensive regions of the zzso zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso and in the right zzso zzso association zzso and primary zzso and motor zzso The reductions in relative metabolism in zzso sleep compared with waking are consistent with prior findings from blood flow zzso The relative increases in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, zzso and zzso zzso formation are new observations that are in accordance with the view that zzso sleep is important to brain plasticity in zzso regulation and zzso zzso
