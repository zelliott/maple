Evidence suggests that structural brain changes occur over time in bipolar disorder but few studies have examined this zzso Additional work implicates zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso The present study examined zzso trends in prefrontal zzso index zzso in bipolar disorder and the effect of zzso zzso 

zzso patients with bipolar I disorder and 18 control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging at study entry and after 4 zzso zzso zzso was zzso as the ratio of folded inner zzso to exposed outer zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso decreased significantly with time in both zzso the rate did not differ for bipolar zzso Within the bipolar zzso individuals with one or more zzso met zzso showed greater losses in zzso an effect that correlated with gray matter loss in the left zzso 

zzso index may be sensitive to zzso as well as being a zzso zzso While the loss of prefrontal zzso over time is not accelerated in bipolar disorder, a greater rate of loss is associated with the possession of one or more zzso met zzso
