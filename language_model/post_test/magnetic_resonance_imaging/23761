To relate the vertical zzso zzso in the deeper layers of zzso cartilage by zzso zzso Imaging zzso to zzso zzso 

Two knee zzso recovered at zzso from males in their zzso with no history or visual evidence of joint disease were zzso MR images were obtained in a zzso T 400 zzso zzso after which the knees were zzso zzso and examined zzso 

High resolution MR showed vertical zzso signal zzso with a two to zzso variation in signal intensity and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso most prominent in weight bearing zzso zzso sections revealed alternating light and dark zzso areas with a zzso of zzso zzso in the lower zones of the cartilage, some, but not all of which clearly represented zzso Given that MR will only zzso vertical structures in cartilage aligned at 90 degrees, whereas zzso will cut them at varying angles, it is likely that the vertical structures seen by each zzso zzso and that they represent structural zzso in zzso perhaps the presence of plates of high collagen and zzso zzso 

The vertical zzso seen routinely in the deep zones of zzso zzso cartilage on zzso sections are not zzso they are likely to represent structural zzso due to the presence of areas of high collagen and high zzso content that exist in zzso zzso This structural zzso may be of great importance to the integrity and function of the zzso
