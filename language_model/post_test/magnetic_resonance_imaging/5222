Recently, zzso zzso focused radiation therapy such as that administered by zzso zzso zzso has been used increasingly for the treatment of zzso brain zzso zzso therapy to the brain can cause delayed zzso which carries its own significant morbidity and zzso While zzso zzso is known to be clinically different from that following zzso radiation, pathological differences are not well zzso In this study, we aimed to integrate novel zzso and zzso observations to gain a conceptual understanding of zzso zzso 

We examined zzso zzso of 10 patients treated at Yale New Haven Hospital between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, for brain zzso that had been previously treated with zzso zzso zzso who subsequently required surgical management of a symptomatic zzso zzso None of the patients showed pathological evidence of tumor zzso Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data for each of the 10 patients were then studied zzso 

We provide evidence to show that zzso zzso may present as an advancing process that extends beyond the original high-dose radiation zzso zzso examination of the zzso tissue revealed traditionally known zzso changes including zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso small and zzso vessels revealed zzso zzso zzso indicative of active zzso 

We propose that the presence of a zzso component in association with zzso zzso may facilitate the progressive nature of the zzso It may also explain the resemblance of delayed zzso with recurring tumor on virtually all imaging zzso used for zzso zzso
