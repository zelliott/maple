The characteristics of an zzso technique that could be used for direct detection of zzso activity are zzso It was shown that magnitude imaging using echo zzso imaging can detect transient local zzso The sensitivity of this method was thoroughly zzso A partial zzso zzso acquisition with zzso reconstruction was found to increase the signal zzso A unique sensitivity to the position of the current pulse within the imaging sequence was demonstrated with the greatest signal change occurring when the current pulse zzso with the acquisition of the center lines of zzso The signal change was shown to be highly sensitive to the spatial position of the current conductor relative to the zzso Furthermore, with the use of zzso of spatial and zzso placement of the current pulse, the level of signal change obtained at this lower limit of current zzso was considerably zzso It was possible to detect a current of zzso zzso applied for 20 zzso with an imaging time of zzso zzso The level of sensitivity observed in our study brings us closer to that theoretically required for the detection of action currents in zzso
