To describe changes in chronic and acute magnetic resonance imaging zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso zzso in early zzso zzso and to associate these findings with zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical findings during a zzso zzso 

Thirty-four patients, 20 males and 14 zzso median age 27 years, with inflammatory low back pain zzso 23 zzso were zzso zzso CT, and zzso as well as clinical and laboratory tests were zzso After a follow-up period of 1 year zzso 377 zzso the examinations were zzso and the findings were zzso 

zzso and CT changes resulting from zzso destruction increased significantly during zzso and the two zzso were significantly zzso For the zzso findings of inflammatory activity, only bone zzso zzso decreased zzso An increase in the zzso test was the only clinical examination that changed zzso 

In early zzso zzso can detect significant inflammatory and destructive changes of the zzso over a zzso follow-up period, in spite of minimal changes in the clinical zzso The zzso changes in inflammatory activity are not zzso by CT and X-ray zzso Thus, zzso may be a sensitive method, without known risks, for early diagnosis and for following disease progression in zzso
