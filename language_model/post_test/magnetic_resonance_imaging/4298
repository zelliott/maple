zzso zzso spatial zzso and their effects on zzso zzso statistics were examined in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso normal, young subjects were scanned using zzso zzso while not performing any zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso in these zzso was described well by a zzso zzso zzso statistical analysis of these noise zzso which assumed independence zzso ignored zzso zzso rejected the zzso hypothesis at a higher rate than specified by the nominal zzso zzso smoothing in conjunction with the use of a modified general linear model zzso and zzso 1995, zzso zzso zzso brought the zzso rate closer to the nominal zzso It was also found that the noise zzso zzso contain zzso coherent time zzso This observed spatial zzso could not be fully explained by a continuously zzso spatial zzso function and was much greater for lower zzso zzso Its presence made zzso test statistics in a given noise zzso dependent, and thus shifted their zzso to the right or left of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the general linear model reduced this dependence and consequently stabilized zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
