It is unknown whether focal changes of zzso obstruction within the lungs of patients with asthma vary or are fixed in location with time or repeated zzso With zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, the zzso are depicted and focal areas of zzso obstruction are shown as zzso zzso 

To investigate the regional changes of zzso obstruction with time and repeated zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed before zzso and immediately after zzso zzso challenge in 10 young patients with asthma on 2 days that were zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image comparisons were performed to determine the change in location of ventilation defects within the lung and their change in zzso 

When comparing zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso images of the 2 days, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso respectively, were in the same location, and of those, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, did not change zzso Comparing zzso versus zzso images, zzso zzso zzso of defects were in the same location on day 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on day zzso On both days, the percent increase in zzso number from zzso to zzso was much greater than the percent decrease in zzso values zzso zzso zzso 

Many of the ventilation defects persisted or recurred in the same location with time or repeated zzso suggesting that the regional changes of zzso obstruction are relatively fixed within the zzso 

The findings give new insight into the regional zzso zzso within the lungs of patients with zzso
