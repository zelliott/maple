We studied whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be used to detect zzso inflammation before the detection of irreversible tissue zzso Next, we tested whether this early detection would enable the administration of treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a realistic clinical time after zzso 

zzso rats were injected zzso with zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso was performed at different time after the injection, and zzso were collected for zzso zzso inflammation was assessed by determination of the levels of inflammatory zzso 

zzso inflammation was detected by zzso as early as 3 hours after maternal administration of zzso zzso to zzso zzso This was observed before any tissue damage, which appeared only at 24 hours after the administration of zzso Delayed zzso administration (after zzso zzso protected the zzso as seen by the preserved tissue integrity and limited zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

These findings established a zzso diagnostic method for early in zzso detection of zzso inflammation that would allow the administration of zzso intervention within a clinically relevant delay after zzso
