In most instances, traditional zzso methodology provides insufficient spatial detail to identify relationships between brain electrical events and structures and functions zzso by magnetic resonance imaging or zzso zzso zzso This article describes a method called zzso for increasing the spatial detail of the zzso and for fusing zzso and zzso zzso zzso estimates zzso near the outer zzso of the zzso using a realistic finite element model of the structure of a zzso head determined from their magnetic resonance zzso zzso is not a source zzso technique and thus makes no assumptions about the number or type of generator zzso The zzso of zzso has been initially tested by comparing zzso data with zzso measured with zzso grid zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso registered with a zzso magnetic resonance imaging and rendered in three dimensions, provide better spatial detail than has zzso been obtained with scalp zzso zzso zzso results are presented from research studies of zzso zzso movement, language, attention and working zzso zzso zzso zzso data are also zzso indicating that this technique may have future clinical application as an aid to seizure zzso and surgical zzso
