How we measure time and integrate zzso cues from different sensory zzso are fundamental questions in zzso zzso to a zzso (such as that routinely perceived in zzso differs substantially between auditory and visual zzso Here we examined beat sensitivity in each zzso and examined zzso zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to characterize brain activity during perception of auditory and visual zzso In separate zzso sessions, participants listened to auditory sequences or watched visual zzso The order of auditory and visual sequence presentation was zzso so that zzso order effects could be zzso Participants judged whether sequences were speeding up or slowing down, and the pattern of tempo judgments was used to derive a measure of sensitivity to an implied zzso As expected, participants were less sensitive to an implied beat in visual sequences than in auditory zzso However, visual sequences produced a stronger sense of beat when preceded by auditory sequences with identical zzso zzso Moreover, increases in brain activity were observed in the bilateral zzso for visual sequences preceded by auditory sequences when compared to visual sequences without prior auditory zzso No such zzso differences zzso or zzso were found for the auditory zzso The results provide further evidence for the role of the zzso zzso in internal generation of the beat and suggest that an internal auditory rhythm representation may be activated during visual rhythm zzso
