zzso of facial emotion perception occurs in zzso disorders where the expression of emotion is zzso or zzso for example zzso disorder and zzso It has been suggested that, in the clinical context of emotional zzso there is a shift in the relative contribution of brain regions zzso cognitive and emotional zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces such emotional zzso in healthy zzso zzso we zzso that in healthy subjects zzso would elicit neural responses to emotional stimuli which zzso those reported in zzso disorder and zzso Thus, we predicted that zzso would produce reduced activity in zzso and visual brain regions involved in emotion processing, and increased activity in zzso regions of the prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso both associated with cognitive processing and, zzso with emotion zzso zzso zzso signal change in zzso we examined the neural zzso of zzso emotional zzso in eight young right-handed healthy men receiving an infusion of zzso or saline zzso while viewing alternating 30 s blocks of faces displaying fear versus neutral zzso The normal pattern of neural response occurred in zzso and visual zzso to fearful faces during the zzso zzso zzso abolished this: significant zzso signal change was demonstrated only in left visual zzso However, with zzso neural responses were demonstrated to neutral expressions in visual cortex, zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be associated with reduced zzso responses to emotional stimuli and a relative increase in the visual cortical response to neutral zzso
