To determine which imaging zzso best determines the microscopic extent of primary zzso zzso in zzso limbs in zzso 

Case zzso 

10 dogs with zzso zzso 

10 dogs with zzso zzso that did not receive zzso chemotherapy were treated by use of limb zzso zzso limbs were zzso by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso and examined microscopically to determine zzso extent of zzso cell involvement and length of associated zzso zzso Changes detected by use of the various imaging studies were compared with the actual tumor length determined zzso Data were analyzed to determine which imaging technique most closely predicted tumor zzso 

zzso obtained by use of zzso zzso views were most accurate at predicting tumor length but underestimated tumor length substantially in 1 limb and slightly in another zzso zzso made by use of CT were most accurate at predicting tumor length when zzso zzso was taken into account but underestimated tumor length in 1 zzso zzso made by use of zzso were least accurate but did not underestimate tumor length in any of the zzso 

Although zzso is used in diagnosis of zzso in dogs, additional imaging studies to confirm the extent of zzso prior to zzso zzso may be zzso zzso of tumor length would be associated with higher zzso of incomplete zzso and local tumor zzso
