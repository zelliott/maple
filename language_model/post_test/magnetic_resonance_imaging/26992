Our objective was to determine the zzso of immediate adverse events for zzso contrast zzso 

All zzso contrast agent adverse events reported to zzso quality assurance committees were graded according to American College of zzso criteria and divided by the total number of injections to determine zzso during the past 10 zzso For each event, an zzso and zzso control patient was identified to compare sex, weight, zzso zzso count, allergic history and zzso contrast agent dose zzso The zzso Food and Drug Administration zzso zzso Event Reporting System zzso database was analyzed to compare local experience to national zzso 

zzso zzso had the highest rates of adverse events, zzso compared with brain zzso p zzso zzso or spine zzso p zzso zzso zzso events were more likely in women, with a female to male ratio of zzso and in patients with history of prior allergic reactions zzso zzso zzso Immediate adverse events rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso per 1,000 injections for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had more severe patient zzso including three patients who arrested zzso as the patient becoming unresponsive and the code team being zzso one of whom zzso From 2004 to 2009, the zzso received reports on 40 zzso contrast agent zzso deaths unrelated to zzso systemic fibrosis, with an zzso per million doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This limited retrospective analysis shows that zzso contrast agents are very safe, with only rare reports of death, and raises the possibility that zzso linear zzso contrast agents and zzso zzso may have fewer severe immediate adverse events compared with zzso zzso
