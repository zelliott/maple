To evaluate the diagnostic value of retrospective image fusion from pelvic magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in detecting zzso recurrence of zzso zzso 

Thirty patients with a suspicion of recurrence of zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pelvic zzso zzso for zzso zzso performance about the local zzso pelvic zzso zzso and bone zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso and retrospective image fusion from PET and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by two experienced zzso Final diagnoses were obtained by zzso zzso zzso imaging and clinical follow-up for at least 6 zzso zzso test was employed for statistical zzso 

zzso positive locally zzso disease, pelvic zzso zzso and bone zzso and zzso dissemination were present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensitivity for detecting local zzso pelvic zzso zzso and bone zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso 100 and zzso respectively, for fused zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso The sensitivity of diagnosing local recurrence by fused zzso was significantly better than that of zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the detection of zzso zzso were zzso 100 and zzso for fused zzso zzso 100 and zzso for zzso zzso zzso 100 and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso combines the individual advantages of zzso and zzso and is a valuable technique for assessment of zzso recurrence of zzso zzso
