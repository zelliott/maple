The goal of this study was to identify reliably the zzso segment of the zzso nerve by using the three-dimensional zzso transform constructive interference in zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging sequence to define landmarks that assist in the identification of the zzso nerve on MR imaging and to describe the zzso relationship to the anterior inferior zzso artery zzso 

A total of 26 volunteers underwent 3-D zzso MR imaging, and 10 of these volunteers also underwent MR zzso in which a zzso sequence was used to identify the facial zzso the zzso nerve and its apparent origin, zzso canal, and the zzso The authors identified the zzso nerve with certainty in zzso of 3-D zzso sequences obtained in the zzso and zzso planes and in zzso obtained in the zzso zzso The nerve emerged from the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso The facial zzso could always be identified, and zzso canal was identified in zzso of zzso In zzso of cases, the zzso nerve was seen to contact the zzso which passed inferior to the nerve in zzso of cases and superior to it in zzso 

The anatomical course of the zzso nerve and its relationship to the zzso and other blood vessels can be reliably identified using a 3-D zzso MR sequence with the facial zzso and zzso canal serving as zzso
