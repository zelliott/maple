Recent research strongly indicates that zzso tasks activate a zzso of the inferior frontal zzso The purpose of the present zzso study was to investigate the extent to which zzso of this region during zzso processing is due to speech processes per zzso such as zzso zzso or to other cognitive task demands such as working zzso Thus, we compared zzso patterns during zzso of speech and tone sequences to a tone discrimination zzso In particular, participants performed zzso judgments on pairs of words, zzso and tone sequences that required zzso of a continuous acoustic signal as well as tone pairs that did not require zzso zzso and reaction time data showed that speech and tone sequence zzso conditions patterned more similarly to each other than to tone discrimination zzso zzso of group data revealed strong zzso of the region at the border of the left inferior and middle frontal zzso for all three zzso conditions compared to tone discrimination, but no consistent differences were observed when word and zzso zzso were directly zzso zzso of individual subjects indicated that a large number of participants activated a small area of the middle frontal zzso during the speech conditions compared to the zzso These results suggest that a significant portion of active frontal areas is recruited for zzso acoustic information and maintaining it in memory for zzso However, some regions at the border of the zzso frontal zzso may be unique to speech zzso
