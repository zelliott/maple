Among younger adults, the ability to willfully regulate negative zzso enabling effective responses to stressful experiences, engages regions of prefrontal zzso zzso and the zzso Because regions of zzso and the zzso are known to influence the zzso zzso here we test whether zzso and zzso responses during emotion regulation predict the zzso pattern of zzso cortisol zzso We also test whether zzso and zzso regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older zzso to zzso rather than younger zzso We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging as participants regulated zzso or zzso their affective responses or attended to negative picture zzso We also collected saliva samples for 1 week at home for cortisol zzso zzso with previous work in younger samples, increasing negative affect resulted in zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to previous work, decreasing negative affect did not produce the predicted robust pattern of higher zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the predicted effect zzso zzso attend in the zzso however, exhibited higher signal in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso for the same zzso Furthermore, participants displaying higher zzso and lower zzso signal when decreasing compared with the attention control condition evidenced zzso more zzso declines in cortisol over the course of the zzso Individual differences yielded the predicted link between brain function while reducing negative affect in the laboratory and zzso regulation of zzso activity in the home zzso
