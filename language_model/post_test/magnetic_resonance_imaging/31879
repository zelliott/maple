zzso zzso data on the development of the brains of human and nonhuman primates is on remarkably zzso and most of our understanding of zzso brain development is zzso from findings in zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is a promising tool for the zzso zzso study of the developing zzso zzso We devised a protocol to scan pregnant zzso serially at 3 T for up to 3 h per zzso Seven zzso were scanned zzso times, beginning as early as 56 days zzso age, and as late as 185 days zzso approximately 185 zzso zzso scanning of the fetal zzso required careful animal preparation and zzso in addition to zzso of the scanning zzso We successfully acquired maps of relaxation times zzso and zzso and high-resolution anatomical images of the brains of fetal zzso at multiple time points during the course of zzso These images demonstrated the convergence of gray and white matter contrast near term, and zzso demonstrated that the loss of contrast at that age is a consequence of the continuous change in relaxation times during fetal brain zzso These data zzso demonstrate that maps of relaxation times have clear advantages over the relaxation time weighted images for the tracking of the changes in brain structure during fetal zzso This protocol for in zzso zzso of fetal zzso brains will help to advance the use of nonhuman zzso models to study fetal brain development zzso
