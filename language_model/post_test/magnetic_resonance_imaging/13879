The functional organization of working memory zzso in the human prefrontal zzso remains zzso Storage and processing functions might be zzso in zzso and zzso areas of the prefrontal cortex, zzso If so, storage functions might be zzso irrespective of informational domain, following damage or dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal function in general might be zzso according to informational zzso zzso spatial versus zzso zzso In the present study we used repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to directly test these competing zzso We applied zzso to zzso and selectively disrupt the function of the zzso zzso or zzso prefrontal zzso in normal human volunteers performing either a spatial or a zzso zzso zzso Performance in the spatial task was impaired by zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso Performance in the zzso zzso task was impaired by zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso disruption of the zzso prefrontal zzso affected performance in both zzso These findings provide evidence of zzso segregation of zzso functions in widely separated areas of prefrontal zzso
