In humans, presence of an A1 zzso of the zzso zzso is associated with reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso receptors in the zzso Recently, it was observed that carriers of the A1 zzso zzso subjects) showed impaired learning from negative feedback in a reinforcement learning zzso Here, using functional zzso zzso we investigated carriers and zzso of the A1 zzso while they performed a zzso reversal learning zzso zzso subjects showed subtle deficits in reversal zzso In particular, these deficits consisted of an impairment in sustaining the newly rewarded response after a reversal and in a generally decreased tendency to stick with a rewarded zzso Both genetic groups showed increased zzso signal in response to negative feedback in the zzso zzso zone zzso and anterior zzso zzso feedback that incurred a change in behavior additionally engaged the zzso zzso and a region of the zzso consistent with the location of zzso cell zzso The response of the zzso to negative feedback increased as a function of preceding negative zzso However, this graded response was not observed in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso group also showed diminished recruitment of the right zzso zzso and the right lateral zzso zzso zzso during zzso Together, these results suggest that a genetically driven reduction in zzso zzso receptors leads to deficient feedback integration in zzso This, in turn, was accompanied by impaired recruitment of the zzso zzso and the right zzso during zzso which might explain the behavioral differences between the genetic zzso
