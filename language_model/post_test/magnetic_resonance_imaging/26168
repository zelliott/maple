zzso zzso MR imaging has allowed quantitative assessment of cerebral blood volume zzso in brain zzso The purpose of our study was to compare zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in the evaluation of the response of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso 

zzso MR imaging was performed in 18 consecutive patients with zzso zzso zzso receiving both zzso and zzso for 12-month zzso Six patients undergoing zzso therapy alone were chosen as control zzso Conventional zzso zzso images were compared with relative zzso zzso maps calculated on a zzso basis from dynamic zzso imaging zzso zzso progression was evaluated clinically using established criteria for zzso zzso Studies were performed at zzso to zzso zzso and imaging and clinical findings were zzso 

zzso response to treatment, based on clinical findings, did not correlate well with conventional imaging zzso The zzso values decreased significantly in all patients between the start of therapy and the first follow-up in the study group, but not in the control zzso The difference in zzso values between the clinically stable and the progressive group at 12-month follow-up was statistically zzso with the progressive group having higher zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging is a valuable adjunct to conventional imaging in assessing tumor activity during zzso therapy, and zzso better than conventional studies with clinical status and response to zzso
