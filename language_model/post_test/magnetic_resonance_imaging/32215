The purposes of this study were to analyze the progress of internal zzso zzso of the zzso joint zzso and to find critical yardsticks that can be used during lateral zzso analysis to identify subjects with potential zzso 

The sample consisted of zzso women whose primary complaints were zzso They were divided into 5 groups based on the results of magnetic resonance imaging of bilateral zzso bilateral normal disc position, unilateral disc displacement with reduction zzso and zzso normal disc position, bilateral zzso unilateral zzso and zzso disc displacement without reduction zzso and bilateral zzso zzso zzso variables from their lateral zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso and zzso analysis to determine the key factors in identifying subjects with zzso zzso 

zzso positioning of the zzso zzso rotation of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and increase in zzso intensified gradually with the progression of zzso zzso and the subjects with bilateral zzso showed the greatest changes in zzso zzso zzso variable selection in zzso analysis identified the following 2 zzso zzso zzso to zzso horizontal plane angle and zzso zzso analysis resulted in the correct zzso of zzso of the subjects and showed that those with smaller zzso zzso to zzso horizontal plane angles and larger zzso had high possibilities of zzso zzso 

This study suggests that some zzso variables can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic tool to help identify patients with potential zzso zzso
