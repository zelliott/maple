This study used high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso to define and evaluate zzso imaging criteria for cavernous zzso invasion zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images obtained from 103 patients with PA submitted to surgery zzso with zzso were zzso zzso The following MR signs were studied and compared with zzso findings: zzso presence of normal zzso zzso between the zzso and cavernous zzso zzso zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso lateral wall bulging, zzso displacement of the zzso internal carotid artery zzso by zzso zzso grade of zzso extension zzso zzso and zzso percentage of zzso zzso encased by the zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso testing, and sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso were obtained for each MR zzso The odds ratio of the most significant criteria was also zzso and the multiple zzso zzso test was used to compare the criteria zzso 

The following signs have been found to represent accurate criteria for zzso of the zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso intact zzso zzso compartment zzso zzso and zzso percentage of zzso of the zzso zzso lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion was certain if the percentage of zzso of the zzso zzso was higher than zzso and 3 or more zzso zzso compartments were not zzso The most valuable criterion of zzso by zzso zzso analysis was the percentage of zzso of zzso zzso of zzso or more, with an odds ratio of zzso 

The zzso diagnosis of zzso by PA is extremely important because zzso zzso is rarely obtained after zzso alone in patients with invasive zzso The aforementioned MR imaging criteria may be useful in patient's management and in advising most of the patients preoperatively on the potential need for complimentary therapy after zzso
