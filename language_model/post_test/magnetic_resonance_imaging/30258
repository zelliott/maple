zzso enhancing zzso zzso is a common zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso clinical zzso To minimize sample size or zzso exposure, a crossover design without a concurrent control group is zzso Natural zzso may confound this zzso We assessed the degree of zzso in monthly new zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A post hoc analysis was performed on 65 zzso zzso patients in the Prevention of zzso and disability by zzso zzso zzso in Multiple zzso zzso zzso Patients were originally selected for relapses but not zzso for zzso zzso Eleven zzso scans were taken at zzso zzso and months 1 through zzso Monthly new zzso rates were examined using a random effects zzso zzso Patients were analyzed as a single group and by screening zzso count level zzso no, low, and high zzso 1 to 3, zzso zzso 

A total of 32, 19, and 14 patients had no, low, and high zzso counts at zzso The monthly new zzso rates zzso zzso of all patients at zzso months 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9 were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso the rate decreased by zzso zzso and zzso The monthly rate of the no zzso remained zzso The rates for both the low and high zzso decreased by zzso zzso and zzso at months 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9 compared to zzso 

zzso zzso multiple sclerosis patients experience a decline of new zzso activity over 9 zzso A crossover design without a concurrent comparison group may overestimate the treatment zzso
