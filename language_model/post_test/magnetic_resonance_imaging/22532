The present study investigated the relation of brain activity patterns measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and slow zzso zzso zzso associated with a complex cognitive zzso A second goal was to examine the neural zzso of spatial imagery of zzso of zzso zzso Using a mental image scanning task, spatial imagery requirements were systematically manipulated by zzso varying the distance between zzso acquired zzso zzso showed a close relation between slow zzso and the blood zzso level dependent zzso signal in human zzso zzso zzso times of mental scanning correlated with the distances between landmarks on the learned zzso In zzso duration and zzso of slow zzso and duration of the zzso response systematically varied as a function of mental scanning zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso imagery effect likely originated from the same cortical zzso as the corresponding zzso zzso This zzso of the zzso signal with slow zzso is in line with recent findings in animals demonstrating a tight link between local field zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso location of the imagery effect is consistent with the idea that zzso triggered zzso and mentally driven zzso spatial processes are both zzso by the same zzso brain zzso
