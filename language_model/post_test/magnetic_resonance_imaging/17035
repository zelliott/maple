Typical zzso findings of multiple system zzso zzso have been observed in motor related zzso in addition to the common areas of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell columns of the spinal cord, and the zzso The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that functional impairment associated with the zzso findings exists in the motor zzso of zzso patients using zzso zzso Twenty clinically probable zzso patients (9 with zzso and 11 with zzso zzso and 11 healthy controls zzso were zzso The regional zzso zzso approach was used to analyze low frequency spontaneous fluctuation of blood oxygen level dependent zzso Compared with the zzso the zzso patients showed significantly decreased zzso in the left primary zzso cortex, zzso zzso cortex, left lateral prefrontal zzso zzso and right inferior zzso zzso zzso together with increased zzso in the right primary zzso cortex, bilateral zzso zzso bilateral supplementary motor areas, zzso zzso and left zzso The results support the hypothesis that motor zzso areas can be functionally involved and likely play a role in motor circuit dysfunction in zzso zzso
