To determine how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in radiation response of a zzso mouse zzso zzso relate to zzso of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso parameters and how those mouse zzso results compare with published clinical zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso grown in female zzso mice were treated when at 200 zzso in zzso Groups of mice were given graded radiation doses, either alone or followed 30 zzso later by an zzso injection of zzso administered at doses of zzso zzso The radiation dose producing local tumor control in 50% of treated animals at 90 days zzso was calculated for each zzso zzso zzso was performed before and 3 h after zzso administration, and parameters describing zzso and zzso volume were zzso 

zzso showed a zzso decrease reaching significance at 25 zzso At greater doses of 50 and 100 zzso the zzso increased slightly and was not significantly different from that of zzso zzso significantly decreased again at 250 zzso The drug zzso zzso for all zzso vascular zzso parameters showed a shape similar to that of the zzso zzso A similar dose dependency was seen with previously published clinical zzso 

Our zzso zzso data could predict the zzso enhancement of the tumor radiation response and suggest the clinical zzso doses necessary to improve the radiation response in zzso
