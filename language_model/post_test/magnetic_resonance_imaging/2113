The volume of cortical zzso as detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the visual zzso has previously been shown to be reduced following zzso zzso zzso In order to understand the cause of this change, we studied the cortical zzso both the size of the activated area and the signal change following zzso and compared the results with results of zzso zzso We studied nine patients with previous acute ON and 10 healthy persons served as controls using zzso with visual zzso In addition to a reduced activated volume, patients showed a reduced blood zzso level dependent zzso signal increase and a greater asymmetry in the visual cortex, compared with zzso The volume of visual cortical zzso was significantly correlated to the result of the contrast sensitivity zzso The zzso signal increase correlated significantly to both the results of the contrast sensitivity test and to the zzso visual zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a useful method for the study of zzso even in cases where the visual acuity is severely zzso The reduction in activated volume could be explained as a reduced zzso zzso however, the greater asymmetry might point to a cortical reorganization as a consequence of zzso zzso Future zzso studies in ON will add to the understanding of the neural zzso zzso following zzso
