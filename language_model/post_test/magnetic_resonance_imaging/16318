zzso and zzso zzso currently play only an zzso role in the diagnosis of inflammatory zzso disease zzso Their sensitivity and specificity are not high enough to be relied upon alone to secure a zzso however, their most promising role seems to be in identifying Crohn's disease patients at a higher risk of progression to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso well with other measures of zzso activity but not as well with clinical zzso zzso can help predict zzso zzso and in patients with severely active zzso colitis may indicate which patients are most likely to progress to zzso Similarly, zzso zzso and zzso are reasonably accurate and zzso measures of disease activity, can predict zzso and identify a high-risk group among acute severe colitis zzso zzso zzso is a highly sensitive tool that can be used in patients with suspected Crohn's disease with a negative traditional zzso but lower specificity and the risk of capsule retention zzso zzso zzso CT zzso can delineate the extent and severity of zzso inflammation and detect zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso is a radiation-free zzso imaging alternative that is comparable to CT zzso in diagnostic zzso
