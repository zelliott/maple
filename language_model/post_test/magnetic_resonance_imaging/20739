zzso in human behavior related to sex is supported by zzso studies showing differences in brain zzso patterns during cognitive task zzso An emerging field is examining the human zzso including networks of brain regions that are not only zzso during different task conditions, but also networks that show highly correlated spontaneous activity during a zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso network activity has been associated with individual task performance and behavior under certain zzso zzso our aim was to determine whether sex differences exist during a zzso resting state for two networks associated with cognitive task performance zzso control network zzso zzso network zzso and the default mode network zzso zzso healthy subjects zzso zzso 23 zzso underwent a zzso zzso zzso scan in a zzso zzso An independent components analysis zzso was performed to identify the zzso zzso for each network based on specific spatial zzso defined in previous zzso To determine the consistency of these networks across subjects we performed zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences between sexes in the functional connectivity of the brain areas within the zzso zzso or the zzso These important findings highlight the zzso of intrinsic connectivity of these resting state networks and their similarity between zzso Furthermore, our findings suggest that resting state zzso studies do not need to be controlled for zzso
