zzso abstract knowledge acquired through language experience can alter cortical processing of complex auditory zzso To isolate zzso processing of linguistic tones zzso pitch variations that convey part of word zzso a novel design was used in which hybrid stimuli were created by zzso Thai tones onto Chinese syllables zzso zzso and Chinese tones onto the same syllables zzso zzso Native speakers of tone languages zzso zzso underwent zzso scans as they judged tones from both stimulus zzso In a comparison of native zzso non-native tones, overlapping activity was identified in the left zzso zzso zzso In this area a double zzso between language experience and neural representation of pitch occurred such that stronger activity was zzso in response to native as compared to non-native zzso This finding suggests that cortical processing of pitch information can be shaped by language experience and, moreover, that zzso zzso zzso can be driven by zzso cognitive zzso
