The aim of this study is to investigate and correct for zzso and zzso zzso in magnetic resonance images for use in zzso treatment zzso Patients with brain zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the zzso position with the head fixed by a plastic cast in a zzso zzso zzso The imaging experiments were performed on a zzso T whole body zzso scanner with 3 zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso Image zzso caused by zzso magnetic field zzso were studied by varying the direction of the zzso zzso For purposes of accuracy assessment, external and internal landmarks were zzso zzso attached to the cast and in the zzso frame served as external zzso In the zzso plane the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso bone and the zzso of the cervical vertebra served as internal zzso zzso zzso as observed in the reversed zzso zzso experiments were zzso with respect to the contributions of zzso zzso magnetic field zzso and zzso and chemical shift zzso The zzso zzso magnetic field zzso in the zzso plane was determined from zzso on a grid zzso zzso due to chemical shift effects were estimated for bone zzso containing structures such as the zzso bone and the zzso of the cervical vertebra using the values obtained from the zzso zzso magnetic field zzso are caused by the patient and the zzso zzso zzso field zzso were calculated for a typical patient zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
