This study addresses the spatial relation between local zzso and zzso imbalances in the zzso core in a rat model of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain maps were obtained by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and zzso by zzso flame zzso of the zzso brain zzso Stroke location was verified by diffusion zzso by changes in tissue surface zzso and by zzso with zzso protein 2 zzso zzso and zzso distribution within the zzso core was zzso with the maximum zzso increase and zzso decrease typically observed in peripheral regions of the zzso zzso The pattern of the zzso decrease matched the maximum rate of zzso increase zzso Some residual mismatch between the sites of maximum zzso and zzso imbalances was attributed to the different channels and pathways involved in transport of the two zzso A linear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the samples of zzso brain indicates that for each zzso equivalent leaving zzso zzso zzso zzso on average, of zzso enter the zzso Better understanding of the zzso link between the zzso influx and zzso zzso would validate the zzso zzso slope as a candidate zzso and a complementary tool for assessing zzso damage and treatment zzso
