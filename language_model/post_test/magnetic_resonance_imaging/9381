zzso zzso with zzso mapping and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso are established techniques for maximizing tumor zzso and preserving function, but there has been little experience combining these zzso 

To report our experience of combining awake zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso in close proximity to eloquent zzso 

Twelve patients (9 male and 3 female zzso age, zzso years; mean, 41 zzso undergoing awake zzso and zzso for zzso zzso were identified from a prospective zzso zzso were made of how these 2 zzso were integrated and what impact this strategy had on safety, surgical decision making, zzso operative time, extent of tumor zzso and zzso 

Twelve zzso were safely performed in an operating room equipped with a zzso zzso zzso The extent of zzso was limited because of proximity to eloquent areas in 5 zzso language areas in 3 patients and motor areas in 2 zzso Additional tumor was identified and zzso after zzso in 6 zzso Average operating room time was zzso hours zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso neurological function, immediate zzso function was zzso in 7 and worse in zzso after 30 days, it was zzso in 11 and worse in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso device can be performed safely to maximize zzso of tumors near eloquent language zzso
