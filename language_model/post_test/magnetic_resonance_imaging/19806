zzso changes in the zzso zzso are detected in zzso of scans for zzso zzso This study zzso the relationship between symptoms of zzso and zzso evidence of zzso pathology in patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans for unrelated zzso 

Prospective zzso study, evaluating symptoms of zzso in patients undergoing zzso scanning of the internal acoustic zzso A visual analogue scale zzso of zzso symptoms was completed immediately before zzso specifying symptoms present at the time of completing the zzso zzso scores were recorded by one of the investigators, blinded to the zzso zzso Two investigators independently rated zzso zzso zzso for each zzso both of whom were blinded to the symptom zzso zzso and zzso scoring systems were used for both symptom and zzso scores, which were then zzso 

zzso and zzso Departments in a large teaching zzso 

Fifty consecutive patients were recruited over a zzso zzso 

Visual analogue scale symptom scores were compared with zzso scores for zzso zzso zzso 

No statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between zzso symptoms and zzso features suggestive of zzso in patients undergoing zzso scanning for zzso zzso 

The relationship between zzso symptoms and zzso findings of zzso pathology is not zzso Management decisions should be made on the basis of zzso history and zzso rather than zzso zzso This is the first study assessing this relationship by documenting symptoms on the day of zzso using a validated scoring zzso
