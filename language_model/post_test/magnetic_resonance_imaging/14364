zzso of regional zzso has widespread application for both zzso research and clinical zzso Here we review the use of MR contrast agents to measure tissue zzso Two primary mechanisms of image contrast are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects result from zzso enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso Because tissue zzso rates are zzso smaller, the dominant effect is zzso of zzso relaxation zzso The second mechanism of image contrast is the variation in tissue magnetic field produced by zzso distribution of high magnetic zzso zzso zzso of tissue zzso requires a detailed understanding of the relation between contrast agent concentration and associated MR signal zzso Studies to date show a linear relationship between contrast agent concentration and rate change in most zzso The exact nature of this relationship in the dynamic setting of rapid contrast agent passage through the zzso bed is less well zzso If this relationship is known, zzso kinetic modeling can be used to calculate regional blood flow and blood zzso Data are presented which indicate that this approach is zzso and suggest the potential of zzso zzso for high resolution in zzso mapping of both physiology and zzso
