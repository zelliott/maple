zzso of a peak at zzso zzso in a long echo time zzso recognized as zzso zzso in the WHO grade II zzso and central zzso by means of zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of 19 patients with zzso confirmed WHO grade II zzso and 2 patients with central zzso was zzso zzso MRS zzso zzso 135 zzso and TE zzso 144 zzso was performed with zzso T and zzso T zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratios were compared between the zzso zzso Additional analysis of a brain of 61 healthy volunteers was zzso 

zzso was distinguished in 12 out of 19 zzso WHO grade II zzso Among those 12 WHO grade II zzso only in zzso of a zzso zzso was zzso In both central zzso zzso was distinguished and in zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso The ratio of zzso in central zzso was higher than in WHO grade II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but the ratio of zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no difference between zzso groups in terms of zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Only in zzso of the zzso of normal brain zzso was zzso 

zzso is found in WHO II grade zzso as well as in central zzso but only in a part of a tumor zzso It is necessary to perform zzso MRS of the whole tumor volume to zzso the presence of zzso zzso in a normal brain can not be identified by means of conventional zzso MRS performed by means of zzso T or zzso T zzso
