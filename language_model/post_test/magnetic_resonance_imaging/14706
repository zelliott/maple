We used functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and visual evoked zzso zzso to determine the nature of blood flow responses to functional brain activity and carbon dioxide zzso inhalation in patients with cerebral zzso zzso zzso and their association with markers of zzso zzso 

In a zzso prospective cohort study, zzso zzso zzso ultrasound CO2 zzso and zzso data were compared between 18 patients with probable zzso (by Boston zzso and 18 healthy controls, matched by sex and zzso zzso zzso consisted of a visual task zzso an alternating zzso zzso and a motor task zzso the fingers of the dominant zzso 

Patients with zzso had lower zzso of the zzso response in visual zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso but not in motor zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso lower visual zzso zzso zzso correlated with higher white matter zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and more zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, did not differ between zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso There were trends toward reduced CO2 zzso in the middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso and zzso cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blood flow responses in zzso are more evident using a task to activate the zzso lobe than the frontal zzso consistent with the zzso of increasing vascular zzso severity from frontal to zzso lobe seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso are caused, at least partly, by impaired vascular zzso and are strongly correlated with other zzso markers of zzso zzso
