Using brain magnetic resonance imaging, we measured in 16 young zzso dyslexic adults and 14 zzso controls cortical zzso of zzso zzso areas, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso cortical zzso and of the inferior frontal region related in the left zzso to speech zzso In addition, we assessed the zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso in both groups according to a qualitative zzso The dyslexic subjects also performed specific tasks exploring different aspects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that: zzso contrary to most results reported in the literature, there is a lack of any zzso difference relative to zzso zzso asymmetry between the two zzso zzso there are significant differences between dyslexic and control subjects relative to frontal zzso zzso concerning the zzso region, there is a more zzso pattern towards the left side in dyslexic subjects than in zzso and zzso relations in dyslexic subjects between zzso asymmetry zzso and the level of performance in a zzso task have a particular reliance on verbal short-term memory, frontal asymmetry and performance in a zzso reading zzso Considering these results it is suggested that zzso zzso skills may relate to frontal lobe zzso while zzso zzso impairment in people with zzso may rather relate to zzso lobe zzso
