zzso tumors associated with familial zzso zzso show variable zzso about zzso grow relentlessly, resulting in severe morbidity or zzso zzso that could identify the minority of zzso tumors that behave aggressively would allow these tumors to be treated early and spare the majority of patients who have more benign disease from unnecessary zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate whether imaging the tumor zzso zzso by modern methods predicts zzso 

This is a prospective case series zzso 

The study was conducted at a zzso center specializing in familial zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Nine patients with familial zzso zzso (4 male, mean age 39 zzso with zzso tumor underwent zzso and dynamic zzso zzso Standard zzso was repeated a year later to assess tumor zzso 

The primary outcome measured was the correlation between zzso and dynamic zzso zzso parameters and subsequent zzso zzso 

zzso intravenous access precluded dynamic zzso zzso in 1 female zzso Thirteen zzso tumors (4 zzso 2 zzso 7 abdominal wall; mean area, 68 zzso were analyzed in the remaining 8 zzso Two patients died before follow-up zzso Five tumors decreased in size, 3 increased in size, and 3 remained stable after a zzso zzso correlation zzso rank zzso significance at zzso existed between maximum standardized zzso value and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with other vascular parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso integrated area under the zzso curve at 60 seconds zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the maximum standardized zzso value or dynamic zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso integrated area under the zzso curve at 60 zzso between the tumors that grew or decreased in size or between the tumor zzso However, vascular zzso ratio zzso standardized zzso zzso was significantly different for tumor site zzso zzso zzso and size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This investigation is limited because of its exploratory nature and small patient zzso 

Although not zzso for tumor behavior, some correlations existed between dynamic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio may provide further information on tumor zzso however, this needs to be evaluated with further larger zzso
