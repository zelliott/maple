The brain mechanisms underlying successful recovery of hand zzso after stroke are still not fully zzso although functional zzso zzso studies underline the importance of zzso zzso 

We explored potential changes in brain activity in 7 patients with zzso to chronic stroke zzso zzso 8 zzso with zzso to high-grade zzso zzso of the upper limb zzso zzso zzso after standardized robotic zzso rehabilitation training, in addition to conventional rehabilitation therapy for 3 zzso zzso and zzso assessments were carried out before and after training to characterize changes in brain activity and zzso 

The zzso Index zzso zzso post: zzso P zzso zzso and grip force zzso zzso post: zzso P zzso zzso of the zzso hand increased significantly after zzso On zzso active movement of the affected (left) hand resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the primary zzso zzso prior to zzso After rehabilitation, zzso appeared zzso including the zzso primary zzso zzso and supplementary motor area zzso No changes and no abnormalities of zzso maps were seen during movement of the unaffected zzso zzso zzso analyses showed no significant zzso zzso increases after zzso 

Despite behavioral improvements, we failed to identify consistent patterns of functional reorganization in our zzso This warrants caution in the use of zzso as a tool to explore neural plasticity in zzso samples lacking sufficient statistical zzso
