The majority of zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso fractures occurs at the zzso junction zzso When responsible for neurological zzso these rare zzso require a zzso zzso We present the results of a new option to treat these zzso an open balloon zzso associated with a zzso zzso internal zzso 

Twelve patients, aged a mean zzso years, were included in this prospective series; all of them presented zzso burst fractures located between zzso and zzso associated with neurological zzso The surgical procedure first consisted of a zzso for zzso followed by an open balloon zzso A zzso zzso internal fixation was subsequently put into place when the local zzso was considered zzso A zzso scan study evaluated local zzso body's height restoration using two zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

All of the patients in the series were followed up for a mean 14 zzso Local zzso improved a mean zzso zzso zzso body height was also substantially zzso with a mean gain of zzso according to the anterior zzso height ratio and zzso according to the zzso Index zzso Two cases of cement leakage were recorded, with no adverse clinical side zzso Complete neurological recovery was observed in 10 zzso two retained a minimal neurological deficit but kept a walking zzso 

The results presented in this study confirm the data reported in the literature in terms of local zzso correction and zzso body height zzso The combination of this technique with zzso plus zzso allowed us to effectively treat burst fractures of the zzso junction and led to stable results 1 year after zzso This can be advantageous in a population often carrying multiple zzso With a single operation, we can achieve neurological zzso and spinal column stability in a minimally invasive way; this avoids more substantial surgery in these fragile zzso
