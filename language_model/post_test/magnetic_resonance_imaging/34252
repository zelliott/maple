Survival and integration into the host brain of grafted tissue are crucial factors in zzso zzso The present study explored the feasibility of using a clinical MR scanner to study zzso graft development in a rat model of zzso zzso zzso fetal lateral zzso zzso grown as free-floating zzso cultures were grafted into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso sequences were acquired at 2, 7, 21, and 99 days zzso MR images were then compared with images of corresponding zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso caused a progressive zzso enlargement, which was significantly different from controls at 21 days zzso Seven days zzso zzso images revealed a defined zzso signal surrounded by a zzso rim at the site of graft placement, which was found zzso for the first 21 days zzso whereas a zzso graft signal was detected at 99 days zzso At 2 days zzso zzso images showed the graft region as a zzso area surrounded by a rim of low signal intensity but at later zzso graft location could not be further zzso zzso for graft size and zzso size obtained from MR images highly correlated with measures obtained from zzso processed sections (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study shows that fetal rat lateral zzso zzso grown as free-floating zzso cultures can be successfully grafted in a rat Huntington model and that a clinical MR scanner offers a useful zzso tool for studying zzso graft zzso
