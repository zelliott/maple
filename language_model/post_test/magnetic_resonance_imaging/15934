The progressive development of deficits in executive functions, including action planning, is a well-known complication of Parkinson's zzso A dysfunction of the prefrontal zzso which is known to be involved in the control of zzso zzso could explain the difficulties in initiating behavior or zzso ongoing actions in patients with zzso The strong zzso zzso of the prefrontal zzso raises questions about the putative effects of zzso therapy on this cognitive zzso In the present study, we used zzso to examine the functional influence of zzso therapy on neural activity during a zzso task in nine patients with and without zzso treatment and in matched zzso Whereas the patient and control subjects exhibited the same performance during the zzso task, different patterns of brain zzso were observed depending on the zzso zzso The zzso state was characterized by more widely distributed brain activity, mainly in the bilateral zzso zzso did not fully restore normal brain zzso and induced changes in the pattern of zzso zzso activity, which was more pronounced in the zzso part in the zzso state and in the zzso part after zzso zzso These results support the idea of a critical role for zzso in the control of executive functions in patients with zzso
