We describe a method for mapping stimulation data, obtained at the time of neurosurgery for intractable zzso onto a zzso zzso zzso model of the individual zzso The mapping is done by comparing an zzso photograph of the exposed cortical surface with a computer-based MR zzso of the surface, zzso indicating corresponding stimulation sites, and recording 3-D MR machine coordinates of the indicated zzso zzso studies were performed to validate the accuracy of the mapping zzso Six zzso zzso a zzso and four computer scientists, independently mapped 218 stimulation sites from 12 zzso The mean distance of the six locations from the mean location of each site was zzso zzso with a standard zzso of zzso zzso or within zzso zzso with zzso zzso Since the surgical sites are accurate within approximately 1 zzso these results show that the zzso approach is accurate within the limits of the stimulation zzso When incorporated within the kind of information system envisioned by the Human Brain Project, this zzso method will not only provide a key link between zzso and invasive approaches to understanding language organization, but will also provide the basis for studying the relationship between language function and anatomical zzso
