We address the connection between conceptual knowledge and cognitive control using a neural network zzso This model extends a widely held theory of cognitive control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso On the control of automatic zzso A parallel distributed processing model of the zzso zzso Psychological Review, 97, zzso zzso so that it can explain new empirical zzso zzso other zzso modeling work, we zzso that representations used for task control are recruited from zzso representations for categories, such as the concept of color relevant to the zzso task we model zzso This hypothesis allows the model to account for otherwise puzzling zzso results, such as increased activity in brain regions processing zzso zzso In addition, biologically motivated changes in the zzso pattern of connectivity show how global competition can arise when zzso is strictly local, as it seems to be in the zzso We also discuss the potential for this theory to unify models of task control with other forms of zzso
