When presented with two objects patients with zzso show a marked impairment at naming both zzso This has led many authors to conclude that the second item is not being processed zzso Robinson, zzso However, this deficit may instead reflect a deficit with zzso or conscious zzso We investigated this issue using a semantic zzso paradigm that allowed us to assess implicit processing of the second zzso zzso We presented a patient, with bilateral zzso damage, with pairs of pictures that were either from the same or a different semantic zzso The patient was asked to either zzso one of the pictures or to name both zzso When the items were from different categories the patient's zzso performance was significantly poorer than when they were from the same category, even though he could rarely explicitly report both zzso These findings are consistent with the notion that the meaning of the zzso item influenced the reporting of the zzso zzso zzso the deficit seen in this patient does not seem to reflect an inability to process more than one item simultaneously but rather a deficit in explicitly identifying multiple zzso
