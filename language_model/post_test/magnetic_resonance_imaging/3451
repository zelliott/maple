Recall of a studied item and retrieval of its zzso context zzso zzso both depend on recollection of qualitative information about the study zzso This study investigated whether recall and source memory engage overlapping neural zzso Participants zzso zzso zzso studied a series of words, which were presented either to the left or right of zzso zzso data were collected during a subsequent test phase in which zzso zzso were zzso two thirds of which could be completed by a study zzso zzso were to use each stem as a cue to recall a studied word and, when recall was successful, to indicate the zzso study zzso When recall failed, the stem was to be completed with the first word to come to zzso Relative to stems for which recall failed, zzso zzso successful recall were associated with enhanced activity in a variety of cortical regions, including bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in these regions was enhanced when recall was accompanied by successful rather than unsuccessful source zzso It is proposed that the regions form part of a zzso zzso in which activity is graded according to the amount of information retrieved about a study zzso
