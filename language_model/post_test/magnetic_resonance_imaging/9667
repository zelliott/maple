Visual assessment rating scales for zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso have been used by zzso in clinical practice to aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease zzso Recently zzso zzso methods for magnetic resonance imaging zzso data have been suggested as alternative zzso If computerized methods are to be implemented in clinical practice they need to be as good as, or better than experienced zzso and carefully zzso The aims of this study were: zzso To compare the ability of zzso zzso visual assessment rating zzso a zzso zzso zzso method and manually measured zzso volumes to distinguish between subjects with zzso and healthy elderly controls zzso zzso To assess how well the three techniques perform when predicting future conversion from mild cognitive impairment zzso to zzso 

High resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired from 75 zzso patients, 101 subjects with zzso and 81 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso An automated analysis method was used to generate regional volume and regional cortical thickness measures, providing 57 variables for zzso analysis zzso partial least squares to zzso structures using zzso zzso Manual zzso zzso were also determined for each zzso Visual rating assessment of zzso zzso was performed by an experienced zzso according to the approach of zzso et zzso 

We found prediction zzso for distinguishing between zzso and zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso for the visual rating assessments and zzso for manual zzso of total zzso zzso The three different techniques showed similar accuracy in predicting conversion from zzso to zzso at one year zzso 

Visual rating assessment of the zzso gave similar prediction accuracy to zzso zzso and manual zzso zzso This suggests a potential future role for computerized methods as a complement to clinical assessment of zzso
