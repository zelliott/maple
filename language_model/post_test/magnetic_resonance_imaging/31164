The zzso that mediate recovery of motor function after stroke are incompletely zzso Several zzso and human studies proposed the involvement of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we studied four chronic stroke patients with focal zzso zzso affecting the zzso zzso originating in the primary motor zzso zzso and good motor zzso We tested the hypothesis that, in these patients, disruption of activity in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso magnetic stimulation zzso would result in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was applied to the primary motor cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the affected zzso zzso zzso and intact zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients and healthy controls in the setting of a simple reaction time zzso paradigm performed with the hand zzso to the zzso zzso zzso applied to zzso led to substantial zzso zzso delays in both zzso zzso applied to zzso of patients zzso clear delays in zzso zzso in the zzso hand, whereas zzso applied to zzso of patients or healthy volunteers did zzso Motor evoked zzso after stimulation of zzso were, on average, larger and had, on average, shorter zzso than after stimulation of zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso as a zzso zzso functional recovery of executive motor function in patients with focal zzso of zzso zzso originating in zzso and good motor zzso Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso of the affected zzso can reorganize to control basic parameters of movement usually assigned to zzso zzso
