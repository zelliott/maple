zzso zzso zzso occurs as an overuse injury in sport and is also characteristic of zzso zzso zzso It particularly affects the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso although the reason for this is zzso We investigated whether there are regional differences in the zzso architecture of the zzso or in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that could suggest unequal force transmission from bone to zzso zzso architecture was zzso from zzso taken with a zzso zzso system of the zzso of zzso room zzso and in magnetic resonance images of the knees of living zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed on the zzso digital images using zzso zzso Regional differences at the zzso in the thickness of the zzso zzso and the zzso plate were evaluated zzso in zzso zzso The zzso studies showed that the quantity of bone and the apparent zzso thickness in the zzso were greatest zzso and that in the lateral part of the zzso there were fewer zzso which were zzso either zzso or zzso zzso The zzso study showed that the zzso zzso was most prominent zzso and that the zzso plate was thinner zzso Overall, the results indicate that mechanical stress at the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso distributed and greater on the zzso than on the lateral zzso Thus, we suggest that the functional anatomy of the knee is closely related to regional variations in force transmission, which in turn relates to the zzso site of pathology in zzso zzso zzso
