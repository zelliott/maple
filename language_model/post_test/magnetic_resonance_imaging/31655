zzso evokes zzso symptoms, and its primary action is to impair zzso zzso zzso zzso but it also zzso secondary increases in zzso zzso 

To identify the sites of action of zzso in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased zzso release using the zzso release inhibitor zzso 

Two experiments with different participants were performed using a zzso zzso randomized, zzso zzso zzso In the first experiment, the effect of intravenous zzso zzso on regional blood zzso zzso zzso signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline zzso In the second experiment, zzso with zzso was compared with zzso to identify which effects of zzso are zzso by increased zzso zzso 

zzso Trust Clinical Research zzso Manchester, zzso 

zzso healthy, right-handed men were recruited by zzso 

In experiment 1, participants were given intravenous zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by a maintenance infusion of zzso zzso for the remainder of the zzso or zzso zzso saline zzso In experiment 2, participants were zzso with 300 zzso of zzso or zzso and then were given the same doses of zzso as in experiment zzso 

Regional zzso signal changes during zzso or zzso infusion and zzso Psychiatric zzso zzso and zzso zzso States zzso zzso 

zzso induced a zzso zzso and unexpected decrease in zzso frontal cortex, including zzso zzso and zzso cingulate, which strongly predicted its zzso effects and increased activity in zzso cingulate, thalamus, and zzso cortical regions zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso Psychiatric zzso zzso psychosis zzso zzso zzso prevented many of the zzso signal changes and the zzso 

These 2 changes may zzso 2 fundamental processes of zzso abnormal zzso experiences and impaired zzso evaluation of their zzso The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and zzso effects of zzso involve increased zzso zzso
