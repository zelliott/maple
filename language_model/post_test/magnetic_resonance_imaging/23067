This work aims at demonstrating the value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso as a routine tool for zzso brain zzso zzso were done using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Louisville, Colorado, zzso under general zzso Images were acquired after patient positioning and after zzso of an zzso biopsy zzso A zzso guide zzso zzso was used to align and direct the zzso zzso was done as necessary, to improve placement within the target and to avoid critical structures, using the system's integrated infrared navigation zzso zzso placement was tracked using serial zzso zzso biopsy was done in 39 patients, of whom 28 had zzso and 11 had zzso zzso Additional OR time related to the use of zzso (including positioning of the patient and zzso and imaging zzso averaged zzso In zzso of the surgeries the biopsy zzso was zzso based on zzso zzso A zzso diagnosis was obtained in all but one patient, with zzso confirming proper zzso placement in all zzso There were no significant zzso on clinical or imaging grounds nor any other zzso zzso can be routinely used for zzso biopsy in a regular zzso operating zzso While general zzso is used and there is some additional time incurred from this technology the improved diagnostic yield and ability to avoid complications make zzso an ideal technical adjunct for brain zzso
