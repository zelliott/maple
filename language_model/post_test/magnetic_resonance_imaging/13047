The left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso is the most commonly used target for zzso magnetic stimulation zzso in the treatment of zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso method used for zzso targeting of the zzso in most clinical zzso This rule may be zzso as it does not account for differences in skull size or variations in prefrontal anatomy relative to motor zzso zzso This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a large repetitive zzso zzso trial in which we examined the zzso of zzso placement and how it affects zzso zzso 

zzso depressed subjects enrolled in a randomized, zzso trial received either active zzso or sham for 3 zzso Prior to treatment zzso investigators placed vitamin E capsules at the point of stimulation and used a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso scan to image these zzso relative to zzso We employed a zzso zzso zzso to zzso the cortical region zzso 

Active zzso significantly reduced Hamilton Depression zzso zzso zzso zzso A linear model for this improvement involving the coordinates of the zzso zzso location, age, and treatment condition was highly zzso Specifically, individuals with more anterior and lateral stimulation sites were more likely to zzso 

These results suggest that within the general anatomical area targeted by the zzso rule, placing the zzso zzso more zzso and zzso is associated with improved response rates in zzso depression zzso Controlled studies testing this anatomical hypothesis are zzso
