zzso and long-term effects of zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso on cerebral blood flow zzso in patients with zzso are still zzso The purpose of this zzso study was to explore zzso zzso patterns in zzso patients after zzso Thirteen zzso patients (7 male, 6 female, mean age zzso zzso underwent zzso labeling zzso zzso zzso days zzso 1 zzso before zzso zzso MR examinations were performed about 1 week zzso 6 zzso 3 months zzso zzso months zzso and zzso months zzso after zzso zzso zzso level, zzso score, number connection test type A zzso and zzso symbol test zzso scores were converted into relative values by dividing by zzso zzso values, and then, compared via one-way analysis of zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso changes of relative zzso zzso and the changes of relative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso scores were calculated by crossing zzso Compared with the zzso level, the global zzso slightly increased by zzso % about 1 week later, then rapidly decreased by zzso % 3 months later, and zzso decreased by zzso % in zzso months and zzso % in zzso months following zzso The changes of zzso zzso score were slightly correlated with zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference was found between the zzso and zzso zzso levels, zzso and zzso scores zzso zzso zzso measured at different time points after zzso zzso showed different patterns, indicating varying zzso effects of zzso on zzso A sharp decline of zzso was found in the 1 week to 3 months period after zzso indicating that high event rate of zzso zzso might relate with the zzso zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso
