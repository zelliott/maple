The aim of this study was to evaluate the qualitative change in zzso cartilage after zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten knees of 10 patients were zzso The signal zzso of zzso and normal cartilage were evaluated by zzso three-dimensional zzso recalled zzso zzso MR zzso The signal intensity zzso index zzso intensity of zzso cartilage divided by that of normal zzso was defined and the change in zzso index was zzso zzso and zzso evaluation was done at the second look zzso The zzso index was at its lowest level immediately after zzso and increased with time to 9 months zzso After 9-12 months, the zzso index settled to almost level and was maintained at that value for at least 2-3 years zzso The average of the zzso indexes after 12 months to the last examination was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which means signal intensity of zzso cartilage was maintained at a value lower than that of normal zzso The total zzso score was zzso zzso zzso points zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal cartilage and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The quality of zzso cartilage as zzso cartilage was inferior to that of normal zzso In the present study, the time course change in the zzso index indicates that the major maturation process of implanted zzso neared completion in 9-12 zzso Minor changes, such as zzso zzso with reorganization of the collagen fibers in zzso cartilage, may continue, but an almost identical condition seemed to be maintained during the first 2-3 years of zzso zzso index does not always reflect all properties of zzso cartilage but may be a useful zzso for zzso zzso
