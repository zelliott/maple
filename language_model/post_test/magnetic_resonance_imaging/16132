Survival and tumor recurrence for patients with zzso zzso is heterogeneous, with reported survival and recurrence times varying by several months to zzso The zzso implications of a zzso zzso zzso remain less well zzso 

We zzso reviewed all adult patients who underwent a zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso grade zzso from 1996 to 2006 at a single zzso zzso zzso hazards zzso analysis was used to identify independent associations with survival, recurrence and zzso zzso Furthermore, a review of the literature for all works on zzso zzso and contrast enhancement was zzso 

One hundred zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 89 zzso and 13 mixed zzso were available for analysis, with 64 zzso and 125 zzso zzso and zzso tumors, zzso There were no significant differences in clinical and zzso variables between patients with and without contrast zzso After zzso analysis, contrast enhancement was independently associated with decreased survival zzso and increased recurrence zzso and zzso toward significance with zzso zzso zzso zzso overall survival, zzso survival and zzso survival rates for patients with enhancement versus patients without enhancement were 70 versus zzso zzso 32 versus zzso zzso and 74 versus zzso zzso zzso The review of the literature identified 14 works that fit our zzso The majority of these published works had zzso limitations including small population size as well as the inclusion of zzso grade II zzso pediatric patients and patient undergoing zzso 

This study may provide insights into risk zzso patients with zzso zzso and most specifically those that contrast zzso
