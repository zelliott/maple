zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can provide maps of brain zzso with zzso spatial resolution but is limited in its zzso resolution to the order of zzso Here, we describe a technique that combines structural and functional zzso with zzso zzso to obtain zzso maps of human brain activity with zzso zzso zzso This new technique was used to obtain dynamic statistical zzso maps of cortical activity during semantic processing of visually presented zzso An initial wave of activity was found to spread rapidly from zzso visual zzso to zzso zzso and frontal areas within 185 zzso with a high degree of zzso overlap between different zzso zzso effects were observed in many of the same areas following this initial wave of zzso providing evidence for the involvement of feedback mechanisms in repetition zzso
