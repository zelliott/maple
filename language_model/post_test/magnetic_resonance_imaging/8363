zzso models of recognition memory suggest that two processes contribute to zzso recollection and zzso Recent work suggests that the two processes are zzso at the level of the zzso Here we review 12 studies that used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and 21 studies of patients with damage to various brain regions, which examined recollection and familiarity using the zzso zzso process zzso procedure zzso or receiver operator characteristic zzso memory zzso for insights into the neural basis of each zzso zzso show that recollection and familiarity are characterized by different patterns of brain activity in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that recollection and familiarity cannot be zzso based on confidence levels alone, and that the two processes are not zzso Based on these results, we propose a model in which recollection and familiarity can be zzso in two ways: recruitment of additional brain regions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during recollection, and in variations in zzso of brain networks activated during zzso or zzso zzso
