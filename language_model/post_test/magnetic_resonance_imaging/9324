To zzso determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso imaging combined with MR zzso zzso in zzso benign from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involving the main pancreatic duct zzso with zzso analysis as the reference zzso 

The informed consent requirement was zzso for this institutional review zzso zzso A total of 51 patients with zzso proved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29; mixed type zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent MR imaging, MR zzso and surgery, with a mean zzso of zzso months between MR examination and zzso zzso image analysis included assessment of the site of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso body and/or tail of the zzso or zzso presence or absence of duct wall zzso and contrast enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso image analysis included measurement of the maximum diameter of the zzso A comparison of zzso and borderline zzso with zzso zzso was performed with the Student zzso test or the zzso U test for continuous zzso 

At zzso analysis, 27 zzso were classified as zzso 13, as borderline zzso and 11, as zzso zzso wall zzso were observed in 16 zzso involving the zzso and one zzso or borderline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wall enhancement was observed in 20 zzso or mixed type zzso and five zzso or borderline zzso zzso zzso zzso The median zzso diameter of the zzso was 18 zzso in zzso zzso or mixed type zzso and 11 zzso in benign borderline zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in the overall zzso survival rate of patients with zzso zzso and those with mixed type zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso 

zzso wall zzso and enhancement of the zzso walls are signs of zzso zzso or mixed type zzso
