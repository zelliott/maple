The positions of the head of the zzso of the zzso disc and the outline of the zzso surface are digitized from zzso zzso of the zzso joint of a 32-year-old subject in 5 different positions of zzso The stress distribution in the joint is calculated on the basis of these zzso For each position of the zzso the momentary center of rotation in the head of the zzso and the zzso attached to the zzso surface are zzso The line connecting these two points indicates the direction of the resulting zzso zzso Furthermore, the extension of the area available to the force transmission is zzso By means of these parameters the stress distribution is calculated independently from the zzso The analyses show that the zzso joint is slightly eccentrically loaded in all zzso The increase of the stresses is in all cases oriented zzso The results are verified in an anatomical zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso structures as well as the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are functionally adapted to the analyzed stress zzso
