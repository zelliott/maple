To appreciate the impact that key developments will have on the future of cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso imaging, it is zzso to consider its present zzso zzso has passed the threshold of being used primarily by zzso and is now in the early zzso zzso To reach this threshold has taken many years, but its adoption by early majority users is expected to accelerate the growth of zzso A number of factors govern its natural growth potential, including physician education and zzso scanner zzso technology, and reimbursement zzso The intrinsic zzso accuracy of zzso coupled with its high level of zzso make it ideal for inclusion in trials, potentially with dramatic reductions in trial duration and the number of subjects zzso zzso there are a number of applications for which zzso is widely regarded as being the diagnostic test of zzso Software and hardware developments that speed up the basic zzso procedure are being incorporated into zzso extending the functionality of routine applications such as flow imaging and tag zzso zzso areas that are close to routine application include coronary artery imaging, and evaluation of zzso zzso and viability zzso
