zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have emerged as potential zzso coronary imaging zzso The objective of the present study was to clarify the current accuracy of both zzso in the detection of significant coronary artery zzso zzso to conventional zzso as the gold zzso by means of a comprehensive zzso of the presently available zzso 

A total of 51 studies on the detection of significant coronary artery zzso zzso or zzso 50% diameter zzso and comparing results with conventional zzso were identified by means of a zzso zzso zzso sensitivities, zzso and zzso values, all with zzso zzso as well as summary odds ratios, were calculated for both zzso In addition, the relationship between diagnostic specificity and disease prevalence was determined using zzso zzso 

A comparison of sensitivities and zzso revealed significantly higher values for zzso (weighted average zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso (weighted average zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A significantly higher odds ratio zzso for the presence of significant zzso was observed for zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis revealed a better specificity for zzso versus zzso in lower disease prevalence populations zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the available studies with zzso and zzso for zzso coronary zzso indicates that zzso has currently a significantly higher accuracy to detect or exclude significant coronary artery zzso
