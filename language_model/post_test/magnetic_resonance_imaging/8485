A combination of good clinical selection with reliable zzso of diverse parameters that characterize the dynamics of zzso fluid zzso flow from zzso magnetic resonance imaging may identify patients with idiopathic normal pressure zzso zzso 

We have carried out a quantitative analysis of 38 subjects (19 healthy subjects and 19 patients with suspected idiopathic zzso The images were acquired using a zzso T MR unit with a zzso sequence in an zzso plane perpendicular to the zzso aqueduct codified to 20 zzso and with 27 observations per cardiac cycle by means of retrospective zzso The area was defined to half the height of the peak zzso to maximize zzso zzso zzso were mean flow, maximum zzso and zzso flow, maximum zzso and zzso zzso mean zzso zzso production and stroke zzso 

All the parameters measured showed a significant difference zzso zzso between controls and patient except for the maximum zzso zzso zzso It was observed in the zzso analysis that the two groups zzso and zzso were classified correctly in zzso with the use of the maximum zzso flow and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the dynamics of zzso by means of zzso zzso patients with zzso state from the control subjects, with significant differences that can be used to zzso idiopathic zzso
