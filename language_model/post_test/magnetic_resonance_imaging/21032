zzso can adapt to reversal of the visual field after long-term wear of reversing zzso zzso Among various aspects of adaptation to reversed vision, adjustment of zzso behavior has been consistently zzso On the other hand, there is relatively little quantitative evidence for zzso zzso for example, restoration of zzso harmony between the visual and tactile zzso To zzso zzso adaptation to reversed vision, we conducted long-term experiments with continuous wear of reversing zzso Four human adult participants wore zzso reversing spectacles for 37 or zzso zzso adaptation was examined by spatial zzso judgment tasks for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso zzso tasks, correct responses disappeared completely at the beginning of zzso zzso but gradually zzso first in the zzso task, and subsequently in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso tasks revealed zzso zzso zzso upon removal of the reversing prisms after the long adaptation zzso In the zzso zzso task, responses were mostly correct irrespective of the reversed vision, but incorrect responses zzso appeared approximately when the zzso change was first observed in the zzso zzso Moreover, starting from the period when these changes in the zzso and AM tasks emerged, an zzso sign of zzso interaction was revealed by functional zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso adaptation to reversed vision does occur, and that it proceeds to zzso zzso which seems to zzso accompany global zzso zzso
