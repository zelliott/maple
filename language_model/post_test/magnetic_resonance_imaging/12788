The aim of this study was to investigate functional reorganization of motor systems by probing connectivity between motor related areas in chronic stroke patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in conjunction with a novel zzso zzso robotic device zzso We evaluated data sets obtained from healthy volunteers and zzso patients with zzso zzso stroke zzso or zzso months prior and mild to moderate zzso affecting the right zzso We acquired zzso echo zzso and fluid zzso inversion recovery MR images and zzso zzso data using parallel imaging by means of the zzso zzso zzso Parallel Acquisitions zzso zzso on a 3 T MR zzso Participants underwent zzso while performing a motor task with the zzso in the MR zzso Changes in effective connectivity among a network of primary motor zzso zzso supplementary motor area zzso and zzso zzso were assessed using dynamic zzso zzso Relative to healthy controls, stroke patients exhibited decreased intrinsic neural zzso between zzso and zzso which was consistent with a dysfunctional zzso to zzso zzso Stroke patients also showed increased zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that changes in zzso and zzso connectivity may occur to compensate for a dysfunctional zzso The results demonstrate for the first time that connectivity zzso between motor areas may help counterbalance a functionally abnormal zzso in chronic stroke zzso Assessing changes in connectivity by means of zzso and zzso might be used in the future to further zzso the neural network plasticity that zzso functional recovery in chronic stroke zzso
