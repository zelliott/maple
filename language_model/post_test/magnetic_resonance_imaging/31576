Dutch speakers with zzso zzso zzso are known to have problems with the production of finite zzso in main zzso This performance pattern has been accounted for in terms of the specific zzso complexity of the Dutch main zzso structure, which requires an extra zzso operation zzso zzso relative to the basic zzso order surfacing in Dutch subordinate zzso We report an zzso study into the question whether this zzso complexity is reflected in increased brain zzso correlated with the production of Dutch main zzso word order, in speakers without language zzso zzso healthy subjects performed a covert sentence completion task, during which main and subordinate zzso were alternately zzso in a block zzso zzso show a left middle to superior frontal cluster of zzso correlated to production of zzso over zzso zzso with no zzso in the opposite zzso This zzso pattern is counter to what might be expected from the frequency distribution of main and subordinate zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso from the basic Dutch zzso word order costs extra neural resources and that this also zzso the zzso problems with the production of finite zzso in Dutch main zzso
