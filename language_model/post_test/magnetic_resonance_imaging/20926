It has been zzso that zzso zzso breast cancer is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and a poor zzso The purpose of our study was to compare the magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of the 3 major different breast cancer zzso zzso zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso and to suggest the criteria that might predict zzso zzso 

From October 2007 to April 2011, we studied 77 patients with zzso confirmed zzso breast cancer who underwent breast zzso We randomly included 148 patients with zzso breast cancer (110 zzso and 38 zzso as a control zzso We evaluated the zzso data, the zzso zzso and kinetic features, the signal intensity on zzso images, and the apparent diffusion zzso zzso 

Our results confirmed that zzso tumors are more aggressive, are usually diagnosed at a younger age compared with the other study groups, and show benign zzso features with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified some parameters as independent zzso of zzso zzso age, size, shape, presence of zzso and zzso zzso The receiver operating characteristic zzso curve, built with 4 of 5 these factors as criteria to predict zzso status, showed a zzso area under the curve zzso value zzso zzso specificity zzso The inclusion of the fifth criterion showed a zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified the zzso parameters that are independent zzso of zzso breast zzso which might be helpful for earlier prediction of the zzso status of a breast zzso
