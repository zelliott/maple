zzso response of brain zzso to zzso zzso zzso over time has not been well zzso Being able to predict zzso changes in tumor size over time may allow improved counseling of patients and potentially earlier recognition of poor response to zzso 

To zzso the rate of change in size of zzso brain tumors after treatment with a linear accelerator zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with single zzso brain tumors treated with zzso zzso at the University of Florida between 1992 and 2009 who had at least one zzso after zzso A total of 218 patients with zzso follow-up zzso scans were included in the zzso zzso area was calculated by measuring the largest tumor area on zzso imaging and using the equation for area of an zzso zzso outcome was percent change in tumor zzso The contribution of several factors including zzso primary tumor zzso zzso or zzso zzso prior treatment, primary tumor control, and zzso dose were examined using zzso zzso 

Mean patient age was zzso years zzso zzso and zzso of patients were zzso zzso percent of patients had primary tumor control and zzso had zzso presentation of their brain zzso zzso peripheral dose range was zzso zzso with a median of zzso zzso The mean percent size change was zzso with a mean rate of change of zzso per zzso The median percent change was zzso with a median rate of change of zzso per zzso The median follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso Female gender and melanoma zzso were found to be significant zzso of an increase in tumor zzso Lack of previous surgical zzso was a significant predictor of a decrease in tumor size after zzso Other factors tested with zzso analysis, including age, zzso of zzso dose, dose volume, zzso performance score, and primary tumor control, were not significant in predicting tumor size change after zzso 

In this study, brain zzso decreased in size by a median of 50% for a median follow-up of zzso months after zzso The overall rate of decrease was zzso per month after treatment with zzso zzso zzso was a predictor of poor tumor zzso
