zzso and dealing with conflicting information is essential for successful decision making in a complex zzso In the present zzso study, stimulus conflict and response conflict are contrasted in the context of a zzso decision-making zzso discrimination zzso zzso conflict was manipulated by varying zzso zzso along zzso and zzso zzso Response conflict was manipulated by varying whether or not competing stimulus dimensions provided evidence for the same or different zzso The right inferior frontal zzso was involved specifically in the resolution of stimulus conflict, whereas the zzso anterior zzso zzso was shown to be sensitive to response zzso Additionally, two regions that have been linked to zzso decision making with zzso stimuli in monkey physiology studies were zzso engaged by stimulus conflict and response zzso The middle zzso area, previously linked to processing of motion, was strongly affected by the presence of stimulus zzso On the other hand, the superior zzso zzso previously associated with zzso of evidence for a response, was affected by the presence of response zzso These results shed light on the neural mechanisms that support decision making in the presence of conflict, a cognitive operation fundamental to both basic survival and high-level zzso
