To determine whether frontal lobe regions, including zzso area, zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and supplementary motor area zzso are zzso activated during zzso and semantic language tasks, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in eight healthy right-handed subjects silently performing two semantic tasks zzso and verb zzso and a zzso retrieval task zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso area, zzso and zzso for all zzso zzso area zzso was approximately doubled during the semantic tasks compared with the zzso task zzso vs zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso adjectives vs nouns zzso vs zzso zzso zzso however, there were no significant differences in the zzso or zzso across zzso We conclude that zzso area is more active during tasks that have a semantic content, whereas areas involved in zzso processing zzso and memory retrieval zzso are engaged equally during both types of zzso
