Since the role of zzso in cancer development has been zzso the study of zzso or zzso therapeutic agents has become increasingly important for cancer zzso Selective zzso is one approach towards this zzso Since many types of zzso accumulate large numbers of zzso mast cells which will release zzso zzso injected zzso may bind to zzso neutralize its zzso effect and induce zzso In this work we studied the formation of zzso by using dynamic contrast enhanced zzso The enhancement zzso of the contrast medium measured before and after zzso treatment were compared to assess the zzso zzso The underlying concept was that if the vessels became zzso the subsequently injected contrast medium could not be delivered into the tissue to cause zzso In addition to the zzso changes, zzso may also induce systemic effect in the zzso The zzso changes measured in tumors were compared to changes in normal zzso liver, zzso and especially the muscle adjacent to zzso The results showed that zzso induced pronounced changes in the zzso However, the degree of change measured by zzso was not associated with the results of zzso assessment of zzso assessed by zzso perhaps due to the zzso nature of the tumor and the difficulty in sampling sufficient regions zzso The zzso zzso effects were also zzso We demonstrated that zzso could induce selective zzso in tumors, and that the effect could last for several zzso Dynamic zzso zzso can serve as a suitable means to investigate the mechanism of this novel approach to induce selective zzso for zzso cancer zzso
