zzso artery calcium zzso carotid zzso zzso and left zzso zzso mass and geometry offer the potential to characterize incident cardiovascular disease zzso risk in clinically zzso zzso The objective of the study was to compare these cardiovascular imaging measures for their overall and zzso ability to predict zzso 

The study sample consisted of zzso Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso participants zzso zzso mean age, zzso zzso They were free of zzso at baseline and were followed for a median of zzso zzso There were 297 zzso events, including zzso coronary heart disease zzso events, 65 strokes, and 91 heart failure zzso zzso zzso was most strongly associated with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and all zzso events zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Most strongly associated with stroke were zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso mass showed the strongest association with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso There were no significant interactions for imaging measures with sex and ethnicity for any zzso zzso Compared with traditional risk factors alone, overall risk prediction zzso zzso for future zzso zzso and all zzso was significantly improved by adding zzso zzso mass, and zzso respectively (all zzso 

There was no evidence that imaging measures differed in association with incident zzso by zzso zzso was most strongly associated with zzso and zzso zzso mass and zzso concentric zzso best predicted zzso and zzso mass best predicted zzso
