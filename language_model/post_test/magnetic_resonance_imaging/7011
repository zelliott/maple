This study zzso fast zzso zzso with zzso words to examine the role of left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso in semantic processing of zzso As a special linguistic phenomenon in Chinese, a zzso word is a zzso word zzso that, when read from right to left zzso opposite to the normal left to right reading direction, is also a real zzso The two words, AB and BA, can have very different zzso Fourteen native Chinese saw a zzso word zzso and were asked to read it backward silently to obtain the meaning of zzso defined as the target zzso They then saw two test words and decided which of the two was zzso related to the target zzso zzso in a zzso of zzso was found to be modulated by the extent to which irrelevant semantic zzso of the zzso word BA zzso with semantic retrieval of the target word zzso This finding demonstrated the involvement of the left inferior zzso in the control processes of semantic retrieval in zzso In addition, comparing conditions using zzso with that using zzso words, we found evidence suggesting a zzso functional subdivision in left inferior zzso consistent with that in zzso
