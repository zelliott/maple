The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of blind zzso zzso zzso injections in zzso zzso syndrome and determine the correlation between accuracy of the injection location and clinical zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso syndrome were zzso for zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso and blind zzso injections zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging analysis was performed immediately after the zzso Changes in shoulder range of motion, pain, and shoulder function were zzso All patients were assessed before the injection and 6 zzso after the zzso 

zzso injections were performed in 15 zzso group 1 patients and in 16 zzso group 2 zzso There was no statistically significant difference in the injection location accuracy between the two groups zzso zzso zzso At the end of the sixth week, regardless of whether the injected mixture was found in the zzso region or not, all of the patients showed improvements in all of the parameters evaluated zzso zzso zzso 

Blind injections performed in the zzso region by experienced individuals were reliably accurate and could therefore be given in daily zzso zzso injections in the zzso region were very effective in improving the pain and functional status of patients with zzso zzso syndrome during the short-term zzso
