zzso zzso motions of the zzso cervical spine during head rotation were investigated in healthy volunteers using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

To document zzso coupled motions of the zzso cervical spine during zzso 

In zzso three-dimensional zzso of the zzso cervical spine in rotation have not previously been well zzso since they are too complicated to follow using conventional zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers underwent three-dimensional zzso of the cervical spine in 11 positions with 15 degrees increments during head rotation using a zzso zzso Relative motions of the zzso cervical spine were calculated by automatically zzso a segmented three-dimensional zzso of the vertebra in the neutral position over images of each position using volume zzso zzso motions of adjacent zzso were represented with 6 zzso (6 degrees of zzso by zzso angles and translations on the coordinate system defined by zzso then zzso in zzso using surface bone zzso 

Mean zzso rotation of the zzso cervical spine in maximum head rotation zzso degrees ) was zzso degrees at zzso zzso degrees at zzso zzso degrees at zzso zzso degrees at zzso zzso degrees at zzso and zzso degrees at zzso zzso lateral zzso with zzso rotation was observed in the same direction as zzso rotation at all levels zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso extension with zzso rotation occurred in the middle cervical region zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees ), while in the lower cervical region, zzso was coupled with zzso rotation zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees ; zzso zzso degrees zzso 

We investigated zzso motions of the zzso cervical spine during head rotation using a three-dimensional imaging system, and obtained the first accurate depictions of in zzso coupled zzso These findings will be helpful as the basis for understanding abnormal zzso
