The notion that already existing memories can be modified after their zzso has received an increasing amount of experimental support, with empirical data accumulating across species and memory zzso However, there is no evidence for zzso zzso intrinsic signatures of memory zzso Here, using a combination of zzso brain zzso and zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso magnetic stimulation interference with a zzso motor memory altered zzso zzso zzso zzso functional zzso reducing it compared to stimulation in which the zzso memory was zzso Furthermore, the modulated functional connectivity predicted zzso memory zzso This reduction in functional connectivity recovered after additional execution of the memorized task, and the interference did not affect control zzso functional zzso This demonstrates that intrinsic zzso zzso brain activity can be modulated by zzso interaction with existing memories and strongly zzso with behavioral zzso of changes in memory zzso
