The development of a zzso zzso is a common zzso sign in zzso zzso and zzso scans of patients with cerebral zzso Large zzso can be accompanied by a marginally extended zzso and vice zzso Several zzso zzso have been identified as zzso of vascular induction and zzso zzso such as zzso oxide zzso have been identified as specific zzso of vascular zzso and zzso blood flow in primary brain zzso in which different zzso zzso zzso I and zzso are induced as a result of the zzso hypoxic zzso zzso Other authors have considered NO as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II is expressed by zzso and zzso invading during zzso zzso At present, no data exist on NO zzso zzso in cerebral zzso 

zzso (N zzso zzso of zzso zzso were investigated zzso using a zzso grading evaluation for the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso marker zzso and zzso vessel presence by zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso extension was measured in zzso zzso scans by an image processing device zzso and calculated for the ratios of zzso volumes to total zzso zzso The data were zzso statistically zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso and correlated with the clinical zzso zzso zzso II was further investigated by in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso 

Between 1987 and 1996 zzso patients in our department suffered from a zzso disease in the brain or spinal zzso In 96 cases zzso zzso material was processed for the zzso zzso The age distribution ranged from 14 to 85 years with a median age of 58 zzso The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was estimated as 53 zzso The expression of NO zzso was frequently zzso zzso I was detected in zzso zzso 2 and 3 in zzso of zzso zzso III, the zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso II in zzso zzso 2 and 3) of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso could be detected in zzso of them, zzso in higher expression 2 and zzso The pan zzso marker zzso was observed in zzso of all zzso Fifty seven percent of the specimens exhibited strong zzso with zzso against zzso zzso were statistically significant for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I and II zzso zzso zzso A negative correlation was detected for the zzso index zzso zzso zzso and the zzso data for zzso III zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No correlation existed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The objective of the study was to investigate zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso presence of zzso vessels and zzso in cerebral zzso A further aim was to investigate a putative zzso induction by NO producing zzso zzso oxide zzso expression was statistically significantly correlated with the expression of the zzso zzso and the presence of zzso and zzso There was a negative correlation between zzso extension and the presence of zzso III and zzso The results seem to indicate a specific zzso modulating role of NO in cerebral zzso
