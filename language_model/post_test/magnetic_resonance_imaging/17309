zzso in volumes of the zzso have been reported previously in adolescents and adults with bipolar disorder zzso Several studies have reported reduced volumes in adolescents with zzso however, both decreases and increases in volumes have been reported in adults with zzso zzso of potential zzso contributions to these disturbances in zzso of the zzso has been limited by the absence of zzso data in persons with zzso Here we use a zzso zzso design to investigate whether zzso volume abnormalities persist in adolescents and young adults with BD over a time zzso of approximately 2 zzso 

Participants included 18 adolescents and young zzso 10 participants with BD I and 8 healthy comparison zzso zzso volumes were measured on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans acquired twice for each subject over intervals of approximately 2 zzso zzso volumes were the dependent measures in a zzso statistical analysis to compare zzso volumes between groups over time while zzso for total brain zzso 

zzso volumes were significantly smaller in adolescents and young adults with BD compared with healthy participants zzso zzso zzso The effect of time was not zzso 

Although the sample size is modest, this study provides preliminary evidence to support the presence of decreased zzso volumes in adolescents and young adults with BD that persist during this zzso zzso
