zzso zzso zzso zzso is a severe disease of the zzso tract zzso In pediatric population, zzso remains of unknown origin for most zzso zzso zzso zzso is also a common feature in the course of zzso zzso zzso disorders related for some patients to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso could be the presenting symptom of respiratory chain zzso zzso and thus we investigated zzso zzso in small zzso and/or colon smooth muscle of primary zzso zzso 

We studied eight children with zzso and 12 pediatric zzso We collected clinical, zzso and pathological data and measured respiratory chain zzso activity in isolated smooth muscle of the small zzso and/or the zzso We also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Neither pathological nor zzso data were in favor of a zzso zzso No respiratory chain zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso In zzso zzso respiratory zzso and zzso zzso activities were increased in small zzso and/or colon whereas no zzso was noted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso activities were higher in control small zzso than in control colon zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso gene did not reveal zzso for any of the zzso 

The normal zzso activities as the lack of zzso and genetic abnormalities indicate that, at zzso with adult patients, zzso zzso zzso is not a common cause of childhood zzso
