zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein that is expressed by zzso cells during zzso vascular zzso We speculated that zzso may be zzso in zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso 

zzso protein was detected by zzso in zzso zzso zzso after zzso artery zzso To determine whether zzso zzso would augment zzso in zzso zzso or vehicle was administered for 3 weeks by intramuscular injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We used a disc zzso system zzso to characterize the zzso response to vehicle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso minor zzso zzso zzso or basic zzso growth zzso After 14 days, the discs were extracted and zzso to zzso vascular growth by zzso zzso zzso protein expression was increased in zzso zzso Administration of zzso increased zzso vascular flow index and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso doubled zzso growth, as did basic zzso growth zzso However, zzso was not enhanced by the zzso zzso or zzso minor zzso 

zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso an effect that is dependent on the zzso motif and a second signaling sequence in the zzso zzso zzso intramuscular administration of zzso significantly enhances zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso may prove to be a novel therapeutic agent for patients with zzso
