Eleven consecutive patients with a first episode of acute zzso zzso were zzso using conventional and zzso transfer zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in order to assess the zzso evolution of zzso nerve zzso damage and to investigate the correlation of ON damage with visual outcome and zzso zzso Patients underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso assessments at baseline and after three and 12 zzso ON volumes were measured on zzso zzso images using a local zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso from the ON was derived from zzso echo zzso No significant volume difference was detected between affected and healthy zzso both at baseline and zzso At zzso mean zzso values were significantly higher in affected ON than in healthy ON zzso zzso whereas at months 3 and 12, the mean zzso values were significantly reduced in the affected ON zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mean zzso of the affected zzso corrected for healthy ON values, progressively decreased over time zzso zzso at month 3 and P zzso at month zzso On the contrary, zzso values of healthy ON remained zzso No correlations were found between zzso measures and clinical or zzso zzso This study shows the presence of subtle pathological changes, possibly due to residual zzso and subsequent additional zzso and impaired zzso in the ON of patients with a first episode of zzso zzso In the early phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso is more sensitive than zzso zzso in detecting zzso zzso
