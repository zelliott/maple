Patients with cardiac zzso are currently restricted from nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of zzso on new generation zzso Tests were performed using a phantom model with seven dual chamber and two single chamber systems in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Monitoring by zzso and zzso were used during the standard clinical scan sequences as well as a zzso inquiry after each zzso Spin zzso zzso zzso and fast field echo sequences were performed with the following stimulation modes: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On entering the zzso magnetic field, the zzso switch was activated followed by zzso zzso The subsequent scan showed no influence on the stimulation function nor on the zzso zzso Event counter function remained zzso zzso with automatic mode switching to demand pacing or programmed zzso of the zzso switch were triggered in the dual chamber mode and were inhibited in the one chamber mode during the zzso zzso of zzso program or rapid pacing were not zzso zzso scan could induce zzso as high as zzso signals, but the stimulation threshold of the heart was not zzso Thus, zzso should be programmed in the zzso mode during scan to avoid zzso and trigger zzso
