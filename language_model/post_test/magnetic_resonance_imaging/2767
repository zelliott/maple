In applications where precise image section positioning is vital, the interactive section rotation and offset capabilities of interactive zzso should be zzso However, due to the independent nature of these two adjustments, the desired structure may often not be visible in the image after a zzso zzso time is wasted during zzso An zzso is presented that automatically alters the section offset after a rotation to provide continuous viewing of a marked structure, greatly improving section orientation zzso The technique is illustrated in the determination of double zzso zzso for zzso imaging of the portal zzso This zzso is expected to prove useful in applications of interactive zzso requiring precise zzso
