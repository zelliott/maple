Growth and magnetic resonance characteristics of a human zzso cell zzso zzso were studied in zzso as zzso in zzso nude zzso zzso cells injected zzso in the flank using either zzso zzso an extract of basement membrane zzso or growth medium zzso as a vehicle were zzso Much higher tumor growth rates and cell density were observed with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso also showed that zzso implanted cells grew as zzso solid tumors compared to zzso tumors which formed zzso As a result of increased cell density with the improved method, tumors as small as zzso zzso provide high zzso magnetic resonance zzso which yield smaller standard zzso with fewer zzso
