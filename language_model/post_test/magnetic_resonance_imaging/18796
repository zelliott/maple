To investigate whether zzso improvements in zzso control, zzso and insulin sensitivity in zzso patients with generalized zzso are accompanied by reduction in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We examined the effects 8-10 months of subcutaneous zzso replacement therapy on insulin sensitivity, zzso and zzso zzso content in two patients with acquired generalized zzso and one patient with zzso generalized zzso All patients had extreme lack of body fat, low plasma zzso levels, and elevated serum zzso but only two had zzso zzso sensitivity was measured by a high-dose zzso zzso insulin tolerance test, as well as by zzso zzso clamp studies in two zzso zzso and zzso zzso content were measured by zzso magnetic resonance zzso All zzso were obtained before and during zzso months of zzso zzso 

zzso control and zzso levels markedly improved with zzso therapy in the two diabetic patients, and a slight improvement in zzso levels was seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the zzso clamp studies, and the rate of zzso disappearance during the insulin tolerance test nearly doubled with zzso zzso As compared with the baseline period, after 8-10 months of zzso therapy, the mean zzso zzso content was reduced by approximately zzso and the zzso content was reduced by approximately zzso 

Reduction in zzso and zzso zzso content may partly explain zzso improvement in insulin sensitivity in patients with generalized zzso
