The zzso zzso of long-term retention remains a relatively uncharted area in human memory research, and in particular there is little in the way of zzso data that address this zzso We describe a patient with zzso lobe zzso who complained of zzso for important events that had occurred in the previous zzso months, but who reported that her short-term and zzso memory were zzso She displayed normal performance on traditional tests of short-term and long-term zzso performing at a very similar level to that of zzso and zzso healthy control subjects on immediate and half-hour delayed recall zzso Forty days later, however, she showed a dense zzso for recall of such information, whereas control subjects could readily recall much of the original zzso She also showed evidence of memory loss for news events that had occurred over the previous few zzso zzso scanning and zzso brain mapping indicated left zzso lobe pathology, with a possible zzso focus in the left anterior zzso These data provide empirical evidence for the existence of a distinct very long-term consolidation process in human episodic memory and point to its neural zzso in the zzso zzso Transfer of information into a permanent long-term memory store may entail zzso consolidation processes rather than a zzso zzso consolidation zzso
