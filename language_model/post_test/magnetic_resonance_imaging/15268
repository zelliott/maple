Some studies showed abnormalities in brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from 12 to zzso These abnormalities are described as zzso with multiple sclerosis zzso 

To describe the abnormal brain zzso zzso in zzso with imaging studies conducted with more sensitive white matter change zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso were zzso All zzso brain studies were performed with a zzso zzso zzso system according to the zzso MR Imaging zzso for Multiple zzso from the zzso of zzso Centers Consensus zzso 

Brain zzso images were evaluated in 29 zzso cases because in one case the zzso images were not appropriate for the zzso Of these 29 brain zzso studies, 19 cases zzso had at least one or more zzso zzso and 10 were negative zzso Brain zzso findings in 19 cases were characterized in zzso zzso zzso by the presence of zzso white matter zzso in 16 zzso cases zzso most of them zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in 13 zzso cases, but zzso they were not oval, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso were observed in 4 zzso cases without zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated absence of zzso zzso zzso nerve enhancement was observed in zzso patients zzso None of the brain zzso abnormalities observed were compatible with zzso et zzso criteria of zzso 

This study, based on a Cuban patient population, with long duration of disease, good sample size and detailed characterization by zzso demonstrated the brain zzso pattern of zzso patients, which is different from zzso
