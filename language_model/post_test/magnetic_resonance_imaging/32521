zzso have been cast on the strict zzso between zzso and long-term memory zzso Specifically, several zzso studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso a region almost invariably associated with long-term memory, is involved in active short-term memory zzso Furthermore, a recent study in zzso zzso patients has shown that the zzso is critically involved in zzso objects and their locations, even when the delay period lasts only 8 zzso However, the critical feature that causes the zzso zzso zzso and in particular the zzso to participate in active maintenance is still zzso This study was designed in order to explore zzso involvement in active maintenance of spatial and zzso zzso zzso participants performed a zzso task in which they had to maintain either zzso associations, zzso association, single colors, or single zzso zzso activity was measured using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed using a random effects zzso Right zzso zzso activity was evident when participants had to maintain zzso associations, but not when they had to maintain zzso associations or single zzso The present results suggest a zzso involvement in active maintenance when feature combinations that include spatial information have to be maintained zzso
