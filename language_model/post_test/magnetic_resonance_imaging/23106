zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the maintenance of intentions during an ongoing task involving implicit zzso Participants were required to detect target words while engaging in the ongoing zzso zzso matched to the target category and cues matched to the action for targets were presented implicitly during the ongoing zzso zzso zzso target cues were found to enhance prospective memory performance, and implicit action cues accelerated responses more than irrelevant implicit cues in the prospective memory zzso We found increased zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso activity during the ongoing task with both implicit target and action cues, suggesting that alertness or zzso zzso processes were strengthened by implicit zzso zzso target cues zzso enhanced activity in the lateral anterior prefrontal zzso zzso area 10), which may be involved in dual processing of the ongoing task and the maintained zzso These results suggest that implicit cues may boost primitive attention toward an intended action and may be accessible to zzso zzso The zzso of prospective target detection and the action execution by target cues were associated with increased supplementary motor area zzso zzso In contrast, we found enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso with action cue during the prospective memory task, suggesting that the zzso may be involved in zzso and rather automatic zzso These results demonstrate the effectiveness of implicit cues for examining the maintenance of zzso Overall, we found that implicit target cues can facilitate prospective memory performance, and implicit action cues can accelerate zzso The zzso neural zzso suggest that zzso and motor control processes are involved in the enhancement of prospective zzso
