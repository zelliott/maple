The functions of the lower urinary tract are controlled by complex pathways in the brain that act like switching circuits to voluntarily or zzso shift the activity of various pelvic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pelvic floor zzso from urine storage to zzso In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to zzso the brain switching circuits controlling zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso images confirmed the hypothesis based on previous zzso and zzso studies that the brain stem switch for zzso zzso control involves both the zzso gray zzso and the zzso zzso center zzso During storage, the zzso was activated by zzso input from the urinary zzso while the zzso was zzso When zzso volume increased to the zzso zzso the switch from storage to zzso was associated with zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso A complex brain network that may regulate the brain stem zzso switch and control storage and zzso was also zzso Storage was accompanied by zzso of the motor cortex, zzso cortex, zzso cortex, zzso cortex, thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso was associated with: 1) increased activity of the motor cortex, thalamus, and zzso 2) a shift in the locus of activity in the zzso and zzso and 3) the emergence of activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso brain control of zzso zzso is important for zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso including frequency, urgency, and zzso
