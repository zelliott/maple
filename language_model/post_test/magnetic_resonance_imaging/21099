The present study compares the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso for staging and restaging in zzso zzso 

Over 8 years and 2 months, zzso zzso PET and zzso zzso examinations zzso zzso 5 zzso were performed in 132 patients with proven zzso zzso zzso or suspected zzso zzso zzso zzso disease: solid zzso zzso zzso zzso systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso and benign disease zzso zzso zzso A total of 259 suspected zzso zzso were zzso zzso during primary diagnosis and zzso zzso during zzso Image analysis was performed separately on each zzso followed by analysis of combined and registered zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were evaluated and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or imaging follow-up zzso zzso zzso after 6 zzso In the separate analysis of zzso PET and zzso sensitivity was 86 zzso % and specificity 85 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a sensitivity of 97 zzso % and specificity of 81 zzso zzso zzso results zzso PET zzso zzso 69, zzso zzso zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso zzso 85, registered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were due to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso results zzso PET zzso zzso 50, zzso zzso zzso 20, combined zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, registered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were based on low zzso or minimal zzso zzso zzso evaluation during follow-up showed a zzso of 91 zzso % for zzso zzso 93 zzso % for zzso and 96 zzso % for combined zzso zzso 

For the detection of single zzso zzso registered zzso zzso proved to be the methodology of choice for adequate zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso alone performed better than zzso PET and zzso imaging during primary zzso At zzso however, the zzso evaluation demonstrated a superiority of zzso PET zzso
