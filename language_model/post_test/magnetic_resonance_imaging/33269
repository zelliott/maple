zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a zzso technique that has come into common use to examine neural network function in normal and impaired cognitive zzso Using this promising type of analysis, researchers have identified the presence of zzso distributed regions operating as large-scale neural networks, which are observed both during the performance of zzso memory tasks and in the resting zzso The assembly of these zzso distinct regions into functional ensembles and their choreographed zzso and zzso sets the stage for complex behaviors such as the formation and retrieval of zzso zzso We review progress in the use of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso the changes in neural activity in normal older individuals, patients with mild cognitive zzso and those with Alzheimer's disease, focusing on the altered activity of the default mode network and zzso zzso zzso We place zzso zzso studies into the larger context of more zzso zzso zzso studies of human memory, which have firmly established the critical role of the zzso zzso lobe in zzso zzso Lastly, we discuss the data from our group and others that suggests zzso zzso and zzso zzso may prove useful as zzso zzso in studying the progression of memory failure over the course of Alzheimer's zzso
