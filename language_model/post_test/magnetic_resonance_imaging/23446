zzso zzso zzso have a range of treatment options that can preserve zzso zzso zzso zzso and conservative zzso 

To evaluate the natural course of hearing deterioration during a period of conservative zzso 

A retrospective case review was performed on 47 patients with a unilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso of growth was monitored by repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso and speech zzso results were evaluated for zzso of patients showing growth or no growth and by zzso location of tumor in the internal auditory zzso 

Patients had a mean follow-up of zzso zzso Over the entire population, the zzso average thresholds at zzso 1, 2, and 3 zzso and the word recognition scores both significantly deteriorated from 38 to 51 zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso Overall, zzso of subjects with good hearing, according to the 50/50 rule, maintained hearing above this zzso There were no significant differences in hearing loss by zzso in the internal auditory canal zzso zzso zzso or by growth status zzso growing, zzso Only 6 patients showed a large hearing zzso This happened early during zzso with relatively stable hearing after zzso 

Hearing will deteriorate in some zzso zzso zzso regardless of tumor zzso Hearing zzso if on a large scale, most likely occurs early in zzso The present results using conservative management in these tumors appear similar to those reported for zzso zzso or zzso
