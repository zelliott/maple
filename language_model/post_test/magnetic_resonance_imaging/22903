To zzso and zzso analyze the zzso zzso in three dimensions and to determine its association with zzso syndrome and rotator cuff zzso 

Institutional review board approval was received with exemption of informed consent for this retrospective zzso zzso zzso resonance images were evaluated in 84 patients zzso zzso 21 zzso mean age, zzso years; age range, zzso zzso On the basis of surgical results, patients were separated into three groups: those without shoulder zzso or rotator cuff tears zzso zzso those with shoulder zzso zzso zzso and those with rotator cuff tears zzso zzso To zzso the zzso zzso the structure was manually zzso and a zzso model was created by using zzso The zzso was divided into a 20 zzso 20 zzso For each patient, a shape index zzso data set and local zzso zzso zzso data set were zzso zzso analyses were used to identify differences between groups, and prediction models were constructed on the basis of correspondent zzso 

Analysis of both data sets yielded no apparent progression between groups and demonstrated a lack of similarity between the zzso and rotator cuff tear zzso Discrimination between groups could be demonstrated by dividing the lateral portion of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso The highest overall diagnostic accuracy of our prediction models was zzso zzso of 84) by using 10 blocks of the zzso data set and zzso (62 of 84) by using five blocks of the zzso data zzso 

zzso modeling yields objective data about the zzso zzso On the basis of this method, zzso zzso by the zzso is not a primary cause of shoulder zzso syndrome or rotator cuff zzso
