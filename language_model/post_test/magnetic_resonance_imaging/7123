In order to assess the value of zzso in the depiction of zzso nerves, we zzso reviewed 60 patients investigated over a zzso zzso The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine the score of zzso in detecting zzso nerves III to zzso and 2) to establish accurate landmarks for easy detection of these zzso zzso nerves III, zzso zzso and VIII are well seen zzso to zzso very often on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nerves IX to zzso are correctly studied only on zzso planes zzso and zzso but it is difficult to distinguish between the zzso nerve and the zzso and spinal zzso Due to their zzso direction and small size, nerves IV and VI are seldom zzso The most important landmarks are the zzso the zzso zzso zzso the internal auditory canal, the jugular zzso the zzso canal and the zzso zzso We suggest the following scanning zzso short zzso sequences zzso 600 zzso TE 20 zzso 3 to 5 zzso thick zzso zzso 16 to 20 zzso field of view with 4 or 2 zzso respectively, 256 zzso 256 zzso and at least one acquisition plane zzso zzso but preferably two or three zzso zzso is a sensitive examination in the recognition of zzso zzso It should be the zzso exploratory procedure in patients with zzso nerve zzso
