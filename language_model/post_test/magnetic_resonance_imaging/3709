zzso research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is characterized by complex patterns of zzso activity in widely distributed functional zzso As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso dependent zzso zzso the resting brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating zzso signals zzso More recently, zzso functional imaging studies involving simultaneous acquisition of zzso and zzso zzso data have suggested that the relatively slow zzso fluctuations of some resting state networks zzso zzso in the zzso data are related to much faster zzso zzso transient brain states reflected in zzso signals, that are referred to as zzso To further zzso the relationship between zzso and zzso we developed a fully zzso approach that combines information from simultaneously recorded, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using independent component analysis zzso of the combined zzso and zzso data, we identified thirteen zzso and ten zzso that are organized independently in their zzso and spatial zzso zzso We hypothesized that the intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the zzso data and the zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations associated with each zzso were correlated with the zzso signal associated with each zzso We found that each zzso was characterized further by a specific zzso signature involving from one to a combination of several zzso Moreover, by comparing the time course of zzso zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso on a zzso group level, we unraveled for the first time a set of zzso networks that zzso to a range of previously described zzso including zzso zzso zzso attention, zzso zzso and default mode zzso These results extend our understanding of the zzso signature of zzso zzso and demonstrate the intrinsic connection between the fast zzso activity and slow zzso zzso
