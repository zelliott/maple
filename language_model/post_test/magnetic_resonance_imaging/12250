Although healthy aging is associated with general cognitive decline, there is considerable zzso in the extent to which cognitive functions decline or are zzso zzso cognitive function in the context of age-related zzso and functional changes, has been attributed to zzso zzso However, the existing sparse evidence is largely focused on functions associated with the frontal cortex, leaving open the question of how wider age-related brain changes relate to zzso We evaluated relationships between age-related neural and functional changes in the context of preserved cognitive function by combining measures of structure, function, and cognitive performance during spoken language comprehension using a paradigm that does not involve an explicit zzso We used a graph theoretical approach to derive cognitive zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso network properties with age, zzso variations, and behavioral data, we found that decreased gray matter integrity was associated with decreased connectivity within key language regions but increased overall functional zzso However, this network reorganization was less efficient, suggesting that engagement of a more distributed network in aging might be triggered by reduced connectivity within specialized zzso
