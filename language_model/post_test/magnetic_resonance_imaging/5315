Most patients with zzso disease zzso will have evidence of an zzso on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, a significant minority of patients with CD and zzso zzso have no visible zzso on zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of zzso zzso assessment and accuracy of zzso findings on surgical zzso 

zzso data set zzso zzso AND zzso The clinical, zzso zzso and surgical outcomes of 24 consecutive CD patients with negative zzso findings were compared with those of 95 consecutive zzso and zzso CD patients with zzso zzso on zzso 

The total zzso rate was zzso Among all patients, 87 had zzso positive zzso tests and underwent zzso while bilateral inferior zzso zzso sampling zzso was performed in 12 and 50 other patients with negative and positive zzso zzso A zzso zzso confirmed by pathological examination, was found in zzso and zzso of patients with negative and positive zzso zzso The zzso rate was not different between patients with negative and positive zzso zzso % and zzso zzso P zzso zzso or between patients who did not undergo zzso with negative zzso and patients with positive zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate of patients who underwent zzso with negative zzso was not different from those not undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso The recurrence rate was higher, although not statistically different, in patients with negative zzso compared to positive zzso 

Based on the findings zzso zzso CD may be a surgically zzso syndrome, with a zzso basis that primarily involves a zzso cause of the zzso
