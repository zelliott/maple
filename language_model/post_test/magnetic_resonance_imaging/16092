To better understand the contributions of effort on cortical zzso associated with motor tasks, healthy participants with varying capacities for zzso the control of individual finger movements performed tasks consisting of a single concurrent abduction of all digits zzso and paired finger abduction with digits 2 and 3 abducted together zzso with digits 4 and 5 zzso Brain activity was zzso from measurement using functional magnetic resonance zzso Effort was measured zzso using zzso responses zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso On average, the zzso score for the Hard task was significantly higher zzso than for the Easy task zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the average zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was significantly higher zzso for the Hard task than for the Easy task zzso zzso zzso zzso The Hard task produced increases in zzso network zzso including supplementary motor area, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso When the imaging data were subdivided based on zzso score, there was an increase in zzso and involvement of additional areas, including zzso and prefrontal zzso zzso the data based on zzso zzso produced greater effects including zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso These results show that the effort required for task performance influences the interpretation of zzso zzso This work establishes understanding and methodology for advancing future studies of the link between effort and motor control, and may be clinically relevant to zzso recovery from zzso zzso
