To investigate the zzso changes in a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso changes in 18 zzso rats were studied with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso The changes induced by zzso zzso developed into liver zzso zzso due to zzso zzso during the progression of zzso The MR zzso data zzso enhancement integral zzso were compared between the zzso zzso corresponding well with MR images and pathology and their surrounding zzso zzso 

A total of 46 zzso were located by MR imaging and autopsy, including 22 zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso 10 early zzso and 5 overt zzso Among the 22 zzso 6 were zzso zzso zzso and 16 were high-grade zzso zzso The average zzso of RN, zzso early and overt zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and their liver zzso nearby was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the blood zzso index between each zzso and its surrounding zzso zzso showed no statistically significant difference zzso zzso zzso There were significant differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso During the late zzso zzso phase, the zzso curve in zzso zzso zzso had an zzso intensity at the early zzso zzso phase and a low signal intensity at the portal zzso zzso Of the 10 early zzso 4 demonstrated less blood zzso and 6 displayed minimally increased blood flow compared to the surrounding zzso Five zzso showed significantly increased blood supply compared to the surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso can detect changes in blood supply of zzso zzso
