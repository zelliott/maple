zzso zzso rarely develop as a consequence of inadequate zzso ventilation that arises due to zzso allergy, zzso tumors, surgery, and zzso The development of frontal zzso is delayed until older than 6 zzso zzso the development of the zzso in the frontal zzso after zzso advancement surgery in young children with zzso may provide essential information for the development of the frontal zzso 

We report a rare case of a 22-year-old man presenting with a frontal zzso zzso by dull headache, zzso and zzso and which developed 16 years after zzso advancement surgery for zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated that a multiple zzso mass extended from the frontal zzso to the zzso space along the zzso zzso During surgery, we found that the zzso consisted of mostly thin, yellow zzso which developed from an zzso zzso frontal zzso containing yellow zzso zzso zzso There was no gross local invasion by the zzso We easily dissected and removed the zzso zzso from the large frontal zzso completely with frontal zzso zzso We zzso the zzso large frontal zzso by removal of the zzso wall of the frontal zzso and then widening the zzso drainage with zzso zzso 

We report the first case of a frontal zzso zzso that developed after zzso advancement surgery in the literature and suggest that the zzso development after zzso advancement supports the hypothesis of frontal zzso role in frontal zzso zzso
