In compliance with institutional regulations for care and use of laboratory animals, the aim of this study was to establish and characterize a zzso liver tumor model to provide a platform for zzso assessment of new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso A zzso tumor was implanted in the right and left liver zzso of 20 rats, for a total of 40 zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso images, zzso images, and dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso images were obtained up to 16 days after tumor zzso and were compared with zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso images, digital zzso and zzso zzso Fifteen tumors were examined with zzso zzso MR zzso All tumors grew, with a mean volume doubling time of zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso and a final size of 591 zzso zzso The zzso tumor showed zzso at MR imaging, three-dimensional CT, zzso and zzso zzso On dynamic zzso zzso zzso images, the maximum signal intensity decrease differed in time and extent between the tumor and the liver, with a significantly zzso zzso zzso higher relative blood volume, relative blood flow, and zzso value in the tumor than in the zzso With zzso MR zzso the zzso tumor and the liver featured significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso peaks, zzso zzso of a zzso tumor in the zzso of rats is feasible and zzso and this animal model seems promising for future testing of new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
