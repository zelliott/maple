We present two patients in whom a free zzso zzso muscle zzso was used to close zzso traumatic zzso zzso 

CT scan of both patients showed frontal lobe zzso and zzso after zzso zzso In the first patient, because the site of zzso leakage was not identified and the patient underwent three unsuccessful attempts to close the zzso using the zzso zzso we treated the patient by unifying all zzso zzso and by filling them with a free zzso zzso muscle zzso In the second patient, zzso zzso recurred 6 years after closure of the zzso using the zzso zzso The patient underwent separation of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and a free muscle zzso was placed zzso because the zzso pulse pressure in the enlarged left anterior horn eroded the previously repaired zzso zzso resulting in the recurrence of zzso zzso 

Although zzso is the primary procedure for repairing zzso zzso the zzso free muscle zzso is an alternative method when the location of the zzso is not identified or the patient with zzso zzso zzso has severe frontal lobe zzso and zzso
