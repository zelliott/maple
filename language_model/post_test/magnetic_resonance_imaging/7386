zzso zzso spatial frequency analysis was used on standard zzso sections to identify salient directional bias in the spatial zzso of zzso and zzso patterns within tumor zzso This directional bias is shown to be correlated to the zzso of reduced fluorescent zzso zzso zzso images of tumor specimens contain a complex distribution of randomly oriented zzso features used for zzso grading that varies with tumor type, size, and zzso The internal organization of these patterns in frequency space is shown to provide a precise fingerprint of the zzso zzso complexity, which is well known to be related to the movement of drugs and zzso into the zzso thereby identifying the characteristic spatial zzso of regions that inhibit drug zzso The innovative zzso methodology and tissue validation techniques presented here provide a tool for future investigation of drug and particle transport in tumor zzso and could potentially be used a zzso to identify barriers to zzso and to analyze real-time monitoring of transport with respect to therapeutic zzso
