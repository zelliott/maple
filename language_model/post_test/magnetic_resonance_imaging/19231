zzso high-intensity changes on zzso magnetic resonance images zzso occur in patients with spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso Reduction of the high-intensity area after treatment has been zzso however, there are still questions about whether the change is related to zzso clinical grade, zzso improvement, or efficacy of zzso This study tried to clarify the relationship between zzso changes in the high intensity area with the treatment and clinical zzso 

zzso changes in an zzso high-intensity area after surgery were zzso analyzed in recent 13 patients with spinal zzso zzso who were treated and followed by zzso 

zzso zzso high-intensity areas were observed on zzso images in all zzso The extent of the high-intensity area correlated with zzso neurological zzso The zzso high-intensity area was reduced or diminished after successful interruption of zzso The high-intensity area started to decrease within 1 to 4 months after treatment in all patients, and disappeared at 2 weeks to 23 months in seven zzso The reduction may suggest interruption of the zzso and improvement of zzso zzso but was not always correlated to clinical zzso The zzso high-intensity areas rapidly disappeared in two patients, but did not clearly zzso to the clinical zzso 

The time course of zzso zzso changes is helpful for evaluating the efficacy of treatment after surgery for spinal zzso zzso
