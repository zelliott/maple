To define magnetic resonance imaging zzso appearances of the brain in extremely zzso infants between birth and term, a sequential cohort of infants born at a zzso age zzso weeks was studied with a dedicated zzso magnetic resonance zzso Images of infants zzso zzso zzso with a median zzso age of 27 weeks zzso 23 to 29 weeks) were initially obtained at a median age of 2 days zzso 1 to 20 zzso and then repeatedly zzso 29 zzso infants had zzso at a median zzso age of 43 weeks zzso 38 to 52 weeks) zzso zzso On the initial zzso scan 28 of 41 infants had zzso either zzso zzso zzso layer zzso zzso zzso or diffuse and excessive high signal intensity in the white matter on zzso zzso When magnetic resonance images for zzso infants at term gestation were compared with those of infants in the control group born at term, 22 of 29 infants had zzso of the lateral zzso 24 of 29 had zzso of the anterior or zzso horns of the lateral zzso 11 of 29 had a widened zzso zzso or zzso space, and 22 of 29 had diffuse and excessive high signal intensity in the white zzso There were no cases of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso abnormalities are commonly seen in the brain of zzso infants on whom images are obtained within 48 hours of birth and that further abnormalities develop between birth and zzso A characteristic appearance of diffuse and excessive high signal intensity in the white matter on zzso images is associated with the development of cerebral zzso and may be a sign of white matter zzso These zzso appearances may help account for the high zzso of zzso impairment in extremely zzso zzso
