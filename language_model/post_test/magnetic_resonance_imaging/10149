A number of studies have used functional zzso to examine the neural mechanisms of sentence zzso however, few zzso studies have examined zzso patterns associated with sentence comprehension after accounting for zzso attributable to zzso tasks important for sentence zzso To investigate the patterns of zzso associated with sentence comprehension after controlling for single word reading and maintaining single words in memory, 20 zzso adult readers completed a block design paradigm which included sentence zzso single word reading, and short-term memory (for zzso zzso zzso indicated that, regardless of the aspect of sentence comprehension being controlled for, zzso was observed in bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso right) as well as bilateral zzso zzso and middle frontal zzso Additional findings showed that bilateral superior zzso lobe zzso was greatest for short-term memory for words, while left anterior inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso around zzso area zzso was greatest for single word zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso right) is a core region important for sentence comprehension beyond the short-term memory and semantic requirements inherent in processing zzso
