This study aimed to describe magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings in women with zzso dysfunction who perform manual zzso 

This is a retrospective study of 29 patients from a single zzso center who presented with complaints of zzso dysfunction and who reported manual zzso to assist with zzso zzso Patients were scheduled for an zzso study with a novel zzso protocol to evaluate the effects of their manual zzso on the pelvic zzso The protocol involved asking patients to zzso during the zzso as they normally would when trying to zzso The goal was to evaluate any change in pelvic anatomy and compensation for an zzso zzso that could potentially lead to their zzso zzso zzso resonance images of the pelvis were obtained at rest, with pelvic floor contraction, with zzso and during manual zzso These images were then reviewed by zzso who evaluated various zzso including zzso angle, zzso zzso muscle integrity, and the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The external and internal zzso zzso were also evaluated for zzso 

From September 2008 to October 2010, 29 women reported zzso dysfunction and the need for manual zzso Their mean zzso age was zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance images showed a zzso in zzso of the study group, zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso muscles in zzso zzso zzso women had more than 1 of these zzso In addition, zzso had an zzso angle less than 90 degrees or greater than 105 zzso in the study group zzso in the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso or on the zzso zzso In all but 1 woman zzso zzso improved or completely corrected the identified zzso as evidenced with zzso Among those who used zzso zzso zzso of defects were corrected and zzso were zzso zzso zzso corrected zzso and improved zzso of cases and was ineffective in zzso of cases, whereas zzso zzso corrected zzso and improved zzso of zzso 

Most women in our study group who used manual zzso to assist in zzso are zzso for a pelvic floor zzso that can be detected on zzso zzso resonance imaging of the pelvis may help zzso the zzso of the zzso dysfunction in some women and may assist pelvic zzso surgeons in planning surgical correction of pelvic floor zzso zzso resonance imaging may also identify defects in the pelvic floor that are, at the present time, not amenable to surgical zzso
