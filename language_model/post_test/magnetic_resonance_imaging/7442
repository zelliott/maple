In monkey zzso head restraint is currently achieved via surgical zzso zzso such invasive head restraint from otherwise zzso monkey studies could represent a substantial progress in terms of Reduction and zzso Two zzso zzso methods are available but they are used exclusively by the pioneering research groups who designed zzso In the absence of independent zzso they have had little impact in replacing the surgical zzso Here, we built a modified version of the helmet system proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tested it for resting state zzso in awake zzso Extremely vulnerable to motion artifacts, resting state zzso represents a decisive test for zzso head restraint zzso We compared two monkeys restrained with the helmet to one monkey with a surgically implanted head post using both a zzso approach and an independent component zzso zzso the helmet system proved relatively easy to zzso zzso although it allowed more extensive movements than the head post system, the helmet proved viable for resting state zzso in particular when combined with the independent component analysis that deals more effectively with zzso noise than the zzso zzso We also discuss the pros and cons of such device in light of the European Union new 2013 regulation on zzso zzso research and its firm Reduction and zzso zzso
