The zzso zzso resulting from direct zzso stimulation can be detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or, zzso zzso zzso To establish the zzso of the latter possibility, we have performed a number of zzso We measured the regional selectivity of two different zzso zzso the zzso release compound zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso Both compounds led to increased signal intensity in zzso echo images in regions of the brain with high zzso zzso density zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the animals with unilaterally administered zzso zzso led to zzso of the zzso response on the zzso side; control zzso of zzso and zzso using zzso injections of zzso showed that the baseline zzso and zzso values were intact on the zzso zzso The time course of the zzso signal changes paralleled the changes observed by zzso zzso of zzso release in the zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso after injection and returning to baseline at about zzso zzso Signal changes were not correlated with either heart rate, blood pressure or zzso zzso of PET binding in the same animals showed an excellent correlation with the zzso data when compared by either zzso of the number of zzso activated or percent signal change in a given zzso The time course for the behavioral zzso of rotation in the zzso zzso animals correlated with the zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso will become a valuable, zzso tool for investigation of neurotransmitter activity in zzso
