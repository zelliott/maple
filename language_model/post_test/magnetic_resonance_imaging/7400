zzso studies of many neurological and psychiatric disorders are increasingly turning toward zzso investigations of infant brain development in order to discern zzso structural and/or functional differences prior to the onset of overt clinical zzso While zzso provides a zzso window into the developing brain, zzso of infants and toddlers is challenging due to the zzso extreme motion sensitivity and children's difficulty in remaining still during image zzso 

Here, we outline a broad research protocol for successful zzso of children under zzso of age during natural, zzso zzso 

All children were zzso during natural, zzso zzso Active and passive measures to reduce acoustic noise were implemented to reduce the likelihood of the children waking up during zzso zzso cushions and vacuum zzso were used to limit zzso motion zzso 

More than 380 zzso zzso have been successfully acquired from 220 children younger than zzso of age within the past zzso zzso measures permitted children to remain asleep for the duration of the scan and allowed the data to be acquired with an overall zzso success zzso 

The proposed method greatly advances current pediatric imaging techniques and may be readily implemented in other research and clinical settings to facilitate and further improve pediatric zzso
