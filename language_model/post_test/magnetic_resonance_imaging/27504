Numerous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that the zzso face area zzso in the human brain plays a key role in face zzso Recent studies have found that both the zzso information of faces zzso eyes, nose, and mouth) and the zzso information of faces zzso spatial relation among zzso are zzso in the zzso However, little is known about whether the zzso information is zzso independent of or combined with the zzso information in the zzso Here we used zzso pattern analysis to examine holistic representation of faces in the zzso by zzso spatial patterns of zzso with behavioral performance in discriminating face parts with face zzso either present or zzso zzso the absence of face zzso zzso zzso impaired discrimination of face parts, suggesting a holistic representation in the zzso zzso spatial patterns of zzso in the zzso were more similar among correct than incorrect trials only when face parts were presented in a zzso face zzso In contrast, spatial patterns of zzso in the zzso face area, as well as the zzso lateral zzso complex, were more similar among correct than incorrect trials regardless of the presence of zzso face zzso This finding suggests that in the zzso faces are represented not on the basis of individual parts but in terms of the whole that emerges from the zzso
