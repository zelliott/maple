zzso zzso zzso including joint zzso zzso zzso cartilage degradation and anterior knee pain, affect nearly zzso of the zzso Researchers have investigated the influence of zzso geometry on zzso and contact mechanics in order to gain insight into the zzso of these zzso The purpose of the current study was to create a three-dimensional statistical shape model of the zzso joint and to characterize relationships between zzso shape and function zzso and contact zzso A statistical shape model of the zzso and zzso zzso surfaces and their relative alignment was developed from magnetic resonance zzso Using 15 shape zzso the model characterized zzso of the variation in the training zzso The first three shape modes primarily described variation in size, zzso zzso and depth of the zzso zzso A previously verified finite element model was used to predict zzso and contact mechanics for each zzso Combining the shape and joint mechanics data, a statistical zzso model was developed that established quantitative relations of how changes in the shape of the zzso joint influence zzso The zzso capability of the zzso model was evaluated by comparing statistical model and finite element predictions, resulting in zzso root mean square errors of less than zzso and zzso zzso The key results of the study are zzso in the zzso of a novel approach linking statistical shape and finite element models and the relationships zzso between zzso zzso geometry and zzso
