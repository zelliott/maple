This study describes the creation and characterization of drug carriers prepared using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coated on zzso zzso to form three types of magnetic zzso zzso these particles were used to enhance the therapeutic capacity and improve the zzso stability of zzso zzso a compound used to treat brain zzso The average zzso diameter of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and all the zzso displayed zzso zzso A maximum effective dose of zzso zzso zzso could be immobilized on 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was more stable than zzso when stored at 4 zzso 25 zzso or 37 zzso zzso could be concentrated at targeted sites in zzso and in zzso using an zzso applied zzso When applied to brain tumors, magnetic targeting increased the concentration and retention of zzso This drug delivery system promises to provide more effective tumor treatment using lower therapeutic doses and potentially reducing the side effects of zzso
