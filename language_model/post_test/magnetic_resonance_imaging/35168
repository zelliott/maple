In spite of considerable technical advance in zzso techniques, the optical resolution of these methods are still zzso zzso the zzso of zzso fields based on zzso maps and brain volume changes, as well as small-scale changes seen in zzso scans need to be verified by zzso diagnostic zzso To attend the current interdisciplinary needs of the scientific community, brain banks have to broaden their scope in order to provide high quality tissue suitable for zzso zzso correlation zzso The Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Research Group zzso of the University of zzso Paulo Medical School zzso collaborates with researchers interested in zzso correlation studies providing brains submitted to zzso zzso zzso In this paper we describe and discuss the parameters established by the zzso to select and to handle brains for zzso zzso correlation studies, and to exclude zzso autopsy zzso We tried to assess the impact of the zzso time and storage of the corpse on the quality of the zzso scans and to establish fixation protocols that are the most appropriate to these correlation zzso After investigation of a total of 36 zzso zzso zzso and low body temperature proved to be the main factors determining the quality of routine zzso zzso zzso fixation of the brains after autopsy by zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso was the best method for preserving the original brain shape and volume, and for allowing further routine and zzso zzso Taken to together, these parameters offer a zzso progress in screening and processing of human zzso tissue in order to guarantee high quality material for unbiased correlation studies and to avoid expenditures by zzso analyses and zzso processing of brain zzso
