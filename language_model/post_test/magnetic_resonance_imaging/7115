The zzso of zzso zzso between sessions in an zzso group of subjects was zzso zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso in response to zzso and zzso presented 1 zzso tone bursts were recorded from the right zzso of 12 subjects with normal hearing in two replicate sessions several days zzso Three zzso components of the zzso were zzso occurring at zzso near 50 zzso zzso near 100 zzso zzso and near 165 zzso zzso A zzso model of the head was used to fit zzso zzso to the zzso zzso analysis of zzso parameters revealed virtually no differences between the two testing zzso The zzso between sessions had a mean absolute difference of 3 to 10 zzso for the spatial zzso zzso of zzso parameters between components showed that there was a zzso but zzso trend for a difference in the location of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and a statistically significant confirmation that the zzso is located anterior to the zzso for zzso zzso zzso resonance images from each subject were used to locate the zzso near the primary auditory zzso in the zzso zzso
