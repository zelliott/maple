We sought to determine the accuracy of zzso contrast zzso zzso index of zzso blood flow and zzso blood volume fraction zzso in predicting zzso extent of zzso and zzso zzso 

Low and high mechanical index zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging were performed 5 to 7 days after successful zzso zzso in 30 patients with acute zzso zzso and regional zzso change was assessed 3 months zzso The index of zzso blood flow was calculated as A zzso beta zzso using the equation y zzso A (1 - zzso zzso which fits the zzso curve of low mechanical index zzso The zzso zzso g zzso was calculated as 100 zzso zzso contrast intensity zzso using the relative zzso by zzso the cavity zzso from the adjacent zzso zzso using high mechanical index zzso The zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso extent of delayed zzso zzso in 16 segments were measured and compared with corresponding zzso zzso 

Among zzso zzso 382 measurable segments were subdivided into 5 groups as zzso no zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to 50% zzso 51% to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso An zzso of the extent of DE was significantly related to a zzso of A zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The optimal zzso zzso for predicting greater than 50% DE was zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso P zzso zzso and persistently dysfunctional motion was zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso A zzso beta and zzso can be effective zzso of zzso extent of zzso and zzso recovery in the zzso acute zzso zzso
