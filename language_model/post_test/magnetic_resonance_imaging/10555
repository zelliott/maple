Small zzso MR zzso and wireless capsule zzso zzso are new diagnostic tools for the investigation of the small zzso The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of zzso with MR zzso in the detection of small zzso zzso 

A total of 36 patients were included in the zzso zzso for imaging of the small zzso were proven or suspected small zzso Crohn's disease zzso zzso obscure gastrointestinal zzso bleeding zzso and zzso surveillance zzso 

In patients with Crohn's disease zzso detected significantly more inflammatory zzso in the first two segments of the small zzso compared with MR zzso (12 patients zzso 1 patient, zzso In 5 out of 14 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso was detected as a possible bleeding zzso Three of these patients had active bleeding sites detected by zzso One patient had scattered inflammation of the zzso MR zzso did not reveal any zzso abnormalities in this patient zzso MR zzso provided zzso zzso in 10 out of 36 zzso zzso 

In patients with Crohn's disease zzso revealed significantly more inflammatory zzso in the zzso and middle part of the small zzso in comparison to MR zzso whereas in patients with obscure zzso bleeding zzso was superior to MR zzso
