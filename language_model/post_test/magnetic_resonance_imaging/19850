zzso zzso is a focal zzso zzso by excessive zzso closure of the zzso The zzso of primary zzso is zzso 

To pinpoint zzso changes that are associated with primary zzso 

16 right-handed patients with primary zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso years; 12 zzso were compared with 16 healthy volunteers matched for sex and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of each participant was obtained and zzso by zzso zzso a method to detect regionally specific differences in zzso matter between patients and control zzso To evaluate whether the identified zzso changes were correlated with the duration of primary zzso or zzso zzso treatment zzso separate zzso analyses were carried zzso 

In patients with primary zzso zzso increase in the zzso was observed, whereas zzso analyses did not indicate a correlation between zzso increases and the duration of primary zzso or zzso zzso decrease was detected in the left inferior zzso zzso here zzso analyses of zzso decrease showed a significant zzso zzso zzso correlation of zzso decrease with the duration of zzso 

The data suggest structural changes in primary zzso and point to a crucial role of the zzso for the zzso of this focal zzso
