zzso zzso reduces clinical zzso and disease activity in multiple sclerosis as shown by magnetic resonance imaging, but the mechanism of action is zzso We investigated the correlation between the levels of soluble zzso molecules and a reduction in zzso zzso on zzso zzso magnetic resonance images after treatment with zzso zzso We determined levels of soluble vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso in monthly serum samples from patients with zzso multiple sclerosis before and during treatment with zzso zzso The level of soluble zzso molecules was correlated with the number of newly enhancing zzso on monthly zzso zzso zzso of soluble vascular cell zzso zzso during treatment were significantly increased compared to control or zzso zzso The median levels zzso of this zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso for the healthy subjects, and zzso zzso for patients prior to treatment and zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the other soluble zzso molecules and soluble tumor necrosis factor zzso were not significantly changed during zzso The increase in soluble vascular cell zzso zzso correlated with a decrease in the number of zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso These data suggest a novel mechanism of action for zzso zzso by direct interference with the zzso zzso which may prevent activated T cells from trafficking into the central nervous zzso
