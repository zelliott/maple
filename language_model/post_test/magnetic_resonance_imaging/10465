A proposed explanation for memory zzso in zzso stress disorder zzso is zzso zzso damage due to elevated cortisol zzso We have previously reported smaller zzso in police officers with zzso In this study, we examined changes in and associations between zzso learning, memory, attention, and zzso volume in zzso 

In a zzso control study, 12 police officers with zzso and 12 traumatized police officers without lifetime zzso were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (for zzso zzso zzso cortisol tests, and zzso zzso 

zzso smaller zzso and higher early morning zzso cortisol levels were found in zzso zzso with zzso performed worse on a delayed visual memory recall task at trend level, and made more zzso and zzso on a verbal memory zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso symptom severity and immediate recall function, and between zzso symptoms and left zzso zzso A positive correlation was found between zzso cortisol level in early morning and right zzso zzso however, zzso volume did not correlate with zzso 

Smaller zzso higher cortisol levels, and memory zzso were associated with zzso but were not directly correlated to one zzso Memory zzso in zzso do not seem to be a direct consequence of zzso zzso
