To apply zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to study the effects of zzso low dose hormone replacement therapy zzso on the brain zzso of zzso zzso 

A total of 155 zzso healthy female medical staff members from zzso Union Medical College Hospital were zzso The zzso group was composed of 71 subjects who had been given a low dose of zzso for over 4 years, while 84 women who had never been given zzso were enrolled in the control zzso The zzso State zzso zzso was used to evaluate mental state, and an zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect plasma levels of sex zzso In addition, all participants were subjected to an zzso including zzso zzso weighted imaging zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso weighted imaging zzso zzso zzso vertical to the zzso slice thickness 3 zzso without zzso and a zzso image of the whole zzso 

The zzso showed that the plasma level of zzso in the zzso group was significantly higher than that in the control group zzso No differences were observed in the zzso between the two zzso In participants older than 70 years of age, the number of deep white matter zzso zzso in the control group was significantly higher than that in the zzso group zzso however, in other age subgroups, no statistical differences were zzso Finally, no significant difference in zzso zzso zzso between the two groups was zzso 

We found that a high plasma level of zzso in zzso women receiving long-term zzso was correlated with the survival of brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
