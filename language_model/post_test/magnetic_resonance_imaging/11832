zzso concentric sclerosis is a zzso disorder in which bands of zzso alternate with concentric bands of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso is zzso Previous reports using modern zzso techniques have shown the bands of zzso preservation to be comprised of zzso or partially zzso zzso Here we report a case of zzso concentric sclerosis in a 24-year-old East Indian patient with a previous history of zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso the bands of zzso preservation showed zzso zzso of normal zzso with focal areas of zzso The findings, taken together with those of previously reported cases, suggest that zzso concentric sclerosis is a zzso of zzso and the concentric zzso may be an zzso form in evolution of a chronic active zzso zzso The zzso of this concentric zzso may be explained by periodic suppression of zzso in the rapidly expanding border, allowing zzso or only transient incomplete zzso to zzso
