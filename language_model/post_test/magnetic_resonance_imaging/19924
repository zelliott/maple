We used zzso to study the neural zzso of zzso zzso extinction in a single case zzso zzso zzso has chronic extinction after a zzso zzso on right inferior zzso cortex, and has previously been investigated extensively in purely visual zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Clarke, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of visual zzso in the damaged right zzso of a zzso patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Koch, zzso zzso zzso zzso of consciousness in zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso With concurrent stimulation of the right visual field plus left index finger, zzso showed zzso extinction of left touch on approximately half of such trials here zzso impaired sensitivity, zzso lowered zzso albeit becoming aware of left touch on the other zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso primary zzso zzso on zzso trials when touch was extinguished from zzso suggesting unconscious residual processing zzso When zzso became aware of the left touch, additional zzso was found in surviving right zzso cortex, and in frontal zzso moreover, functional zzso was enhanced with a region of frontal zzso implicated in awareness by previous zzso Finally, on trials where zzso extinction zzso surviving right zzso zzso showed stronger functional zzso with the left visual and right zzso regions driven by the competing zzso indicating that zzso extinction arises when zzso to separate zzso interact competitively via zzso zzso
