Better zzso of outcome would allow improved zzso therapy for pediatric zzso zzso of the zzso We investigated the zzso value of MR zzso measures of absolute and relative tumor size and volume at the time of zzso We also assessed the relation of tumor size to age and zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso treatment history, and outcome information of patients treated on a single institutional zzso A single pediatric zzso zzso manually measured each primary zzso and the affected native bone in three dimensions on MR images obtained at the time of zzso Eight parameters of tumor size were analyzed for their value in predicting overall survival zzso and zzso survival zzso 

The median age of the 42 patients was zzso years zzso zzso zzso 50% were female and zzso were zzso Absolute tumor volume was an important predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso absolute tumor depth zzso as a continuous zzso was a significant predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative measures of tumor size were not found to predict zzso No relation was seen between tumor size and zzso zzso 

Absolute tumor size at the time of diagnosis is significantly zzso of zzso and zzso If validated in a larger study, this indicator should be used in the design of zzso treatment protocols for zzso
