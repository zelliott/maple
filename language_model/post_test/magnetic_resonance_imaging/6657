The authors assessed manual performance and verbal zzso listening performance in 16 zzso children with zzso unilateral brain zzso and normal zzso to investigate cerebral zzso In all children, the zzso hand had fair grip function, but reaction times were impaired, and cerebral reorganization of hand function in those with right zzso was shown by the high zzso of pathological zzso The zzso listening results showed that most children with left zzso had a left ear advantage significantly related to the extent of brain zzso This finding suggests that extent of cortical damage and presence of zzso involvement, irrespective of zzso are the primary factors inducing rightward cerebral language reorganization in children with unilateral zzso brain zzso
