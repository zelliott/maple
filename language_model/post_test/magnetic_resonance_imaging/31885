Our ability to recognize the actions of others is zzso by a complex network of brain areas, including the inferior frontal zzso zzso inferior zzso lobe zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso An unresolved issue is whether the activity within these regions requires zzso control or whether it arises relatively automatically during passive action zzso Here we used zzso to determine whether cortical activity associated with action observation is modulated by the strategic allocation of selective zzso Participants observed moving and stationary images of zzso hand actions, while they performed an zzso demanding task at the zzso We first defined zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso which responded to the perception of these zzso We then zzso these zzso while participants observed the zzso but now zzso actions and instead performed an easy zzso zzso zzso or difficult zzso zzso zzso visual discrimination zzso Our data indicate that the activity of the left zzso was consistently attenuated under conditions of high zzso load, while the remaining action observation areas remained relatively unaffected by zzso zzso The suppression of the left zzso was unique to the observation of hand actions, and did not occur during the observation of zzso control zzso in the form of coherent dot zzso We propose that the left zzso is the site at which descending zzso processes affect the processing of observed actions, and that the zzso zzso of this region is responsible for filtering zzso actions during ongoing zzso
