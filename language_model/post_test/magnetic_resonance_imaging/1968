Our objective was to evaluate the frequency of contrast enhancement of the zzso zzso in patients with sudden hearing zzso Forty consecutive patients with sudden zzso hearing loss (20 males and 20 zzso age range zzso zzso 40 zzso control subjects, and 5 patients with zzso disease were examined using the same imaging protocol on a zzso MR zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso flip zzso zzso images were obtained using a zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement in the area of the zzso zzso was assessed by two zzso and the frequency of contrast enhancement was compared between the three study zzso Enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso was observed in 30 of the 40 patients with sudden hearing loss zzso Twenty of these 30 patients also showed enhancement on the zzso side, and 1 patient showed enhancement only on the zzso zzso Only 1 of the 5 patients with zzso disease showed zzso Nine of the 40 control subjects zzso showed enhancement zzso enhancement in 5 subjects, unilateral in zzso The frequency of enhancement in patients with sudden hearing loss was significantly higher than that in control subjects ( zzso or patients with zzso disease ( zzso The frequency of contrast enhancement of the zzso zzso is significantly increased in patients with sudden hearing loss, but further study is necessary to clarify the relationship between this finding and the zzso of sudden hearing zzso
