zzso thickness is a highly zzso structural brain zzso and reduced thickness has been associated with zzso bipolar disorder, and decreased cognitive performance among healthy control zzso zzso genes that contribute to variation in cortical thickness provides a means to zzso some of the biological mechanisms underlying these diseases and general cognitive zzso 

To identify common genetic zzso that affect cortical thickness in patients with zzso patients with bipolar disorder, and controls and to test these zzso for association with cognitive zzso 

A total of zzso 198 zzso zzso were tested for association with average cortical thickness in a zzso association zzso zzso associated zzso zzso were tested for their effect on several measures of cognitive zzso 

Four major hospitals in Oslo, zzso 

A total of zzso case individuals and controls were analyzed in the zzso association study and follow-up cognitive zzso The zzso association study included controls zzso zzso zzso and individuals with zzso zzso schizophrenia spectrum disorder zzso zzso zzso bipolar spectrum disorder zzso zzso zzso and other psychotic and affective disorders zzso zzso zzso 

zzso thickness measured with magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive performance as assessed by several zzso zzso 

Two closely linked genetic zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso and zzso syndrome region on zzso zzso showed a zzso significant association zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with average cortical thickness and modest association with cognitive performance zzso P zzso zzso specifically among patients diagnosed as having zzso 

This zzso association study identifies a common genetic zzso that contributes to the zzso reduction of cortical thickness in zzso These results highlight the usefulness of cortical thickness as an intermediate zzso for zzso zzso Future independent replication studies are required to confirm these zzso
