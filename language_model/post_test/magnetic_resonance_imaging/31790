zzso implies a failure of zzso zzso responses to caloric zzso We studied the mechanisms, effectiveness, and limits of such responses in six lean zzso zzso zzso zzso healthy men based in a zzso suite for 17 zzso of progressive intermittent zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso ad zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso ad zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso ad zzso Body composition was assessed by a zzso model using dual X-ray zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance imaging assessed zzso fat at abdominal level at baseline and at the end of zzso zzso Energy intake was assessed zzso energy expenditure zzso and zzso zzso rates were measured repeatedly by whole body zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was measured by doubly labeled water at baseline and after zzso zzso At the end of zzso zzso zzso and zzso had increased by just zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weight and body fat zzso zzso had increased by zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The relative increase in visceral fat zzso P zzso zzso exceeded that of subcutaneous fat zzso P zzso zzso in the abdominal zzso The zzso energy cost of tissue zzso differed from the excess zzso by only zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating an absence of effective zzso zzso We conclude that zzso in zzso provide very limited zzso capacity in body weight regulation, and that regulation must be dominated by zzso zzso of energy zzso This result supports present conclusions from genetic studies in which all known causes of human obesity are related to defects in the regulation of zzso
