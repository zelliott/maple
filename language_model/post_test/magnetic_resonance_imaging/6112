zzso zzso rotator cuff repair has become more popular, and some studies have shown better footprint coverage and improved zzso of the zzso 

zzso rotator cuff repair leads to superior cuff integrity and early clinical results compared with zzso zzso 

zzso controlled zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

Forty patients were zzso to either zzso or zzso rotator cuff repair at the time of surgical zzso Patients were followed with clinical measures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as range of motion, internal rotation strength, and external rotation zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso studies were performed on each shoulder zzso 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after zzso 

Mean zzso tear size by zzso was zzso zzso A mean of zzso anchors for single row zzso and zzso for double row zzso were zzso There were 2 zzso at 1 year in each zzso There were 2 additional cases that had severe thinning in the DR repair group at 1 zzso The zzso zzso of footprint coverage, zzso zzso and zzso signal showed no significant differences between the 2 repair zzso At 1 year, there were no differences in any of the zzso measures of motion or zzso At 1 year, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scores showed no significant differences between zzso
