We used quantitative magnetic resonance zzso imaging to determine if relationships exist between proposed molecular zzso for degenerative joint disease zzso and structural characteristics of zzso zzso zzso were eight male and eight female volunteers diagnosed with zzso zzso resonance images of the symptomatic knee were taken and blood samples were zzso zzso of serum cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso collagen zzso were compared to cartilage volume and cartilage zzso respectively, in four compartments of the zzso zzso A zzso negative correlation was found between serum zzso and zzso zzso volume in the male subject group zzso zzso A zzso positive correlation zzso zzso was found between serum zzso and lateral zzso volume in the female subject zzso In both groups, positive correlations were found between serum zzso and cartilage zzso which were significant in two compartments of the male group zzso zzso zzso zzso and similarly strong, but not statistically significant zzso zzso in one compartment of the female zzso We identify strong and biologically relevant correlations between two proposed molecular zzso for zzso and MR measures of symptomatic knees of a small number of zzso zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that cartilage molecular zzso reflect the molecular processes of cartilage zzso and zzso
