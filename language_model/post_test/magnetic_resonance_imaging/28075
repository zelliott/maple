Based on a retrospective study of 179 zzso records covering four populations zzso presenting with zzso without known injury zzso zzso zzso post-traumatic shoulder pain zzso zzso zzso instability or dislocation zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso criteria are suggested to define zzso normal arches and arches compatible with zzso zzso The zzso arch is presumed normal or without zzso if the zzso and frontal views show it to be parallel to the zzso head, and/or if there is a fatty layer zzso between the arch and the zzso zzso The arch is presumed zzso or actually capable of giving rise to zzso if, in either the zzso or frontal view, there is a zone of narrowing of the zzso passage with an impression of the arch on the zzso zzso or zzso thinning at this level or just lateral to this narrowed zzso Based on these criteria, study of the 179 zzso records demonstrated a significant difference of distribution of the arches in the four zzso zzso arches were found in zzso of patients with zzso zzso of patients with zzso pain, zzso of patients with an acute or zzso dislocation and zzso of zzso zzso a zzso normal arch was found in zzso of the controls, zzso of patients with dislocation, zzso of zzso painful shoulders and only zzso of patients with clinical zzso zzso zzso may be due to the type 3 zzso zzso described by zzso or to a zzso of the zzso ligament at its zzso zzso This study was supplemented by 15 zzso zzso which confirmed the zzso of attachment of the zzso ligament at the inferior aspect of the zzso along its lateral zzso
