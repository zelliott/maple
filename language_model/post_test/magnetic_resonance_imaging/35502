To assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging zzso and dynamic zzso MR zzso in the depiction of local prostate cancer recurrence in patients with zzso progression after radical zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were performed in 70 patients at high risk of local recurrence after zzso The population was divided on the basis of the clinical validation of MR results with the use of a zzso ultrasound biopsy examination in a group of 50 patients zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso serum level zzso after external beam zzso in a group of 20 patients zzso zzso 

In group A, zzso analysis alone showed a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso the zzso analysis alone, a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso combined zzso a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso Areas under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve for zzso zzso and combined zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso In group B, zzso alone showed a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso combined zzso and zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Areas under the zzso curve for each of these groups were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results show that combined zzso and zzso is an accurate method to identify local prostate cancer recurrence in patients with zzso progression after zzso
