Many studies have reported that patients with schizophrenia often have structural abnormalities of the anterior zzso zzso zzso and that some of these seem to be of genetic origin, therefore predating the onset of zzso The present study aimed to investigate whether these zzso in the zzso are genetic in origin by comparing the zzso patterns of three groups: normal controls, subjects at genetic high risk zzso for zzso and patients with zzso The relationships between zzso variations and executive function were also zzso 

This study examined the magnetic resonance images of zzso zzso zzso zzso folding patterns in 222 subjects zzso normal subjects, 30 individuals at zzso and 89 patients with zzso and evaluated differences in the zzso and zzso patterns of the zzso among zzso zzso tests were then performed and differences in cognitive performance were analyzed according to zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso folding were zzso the control group was significantly more likely than were other groups to show a well-developed left zzso zzso and zzso asymmetry of the zzso zzso However, neither zzso subjects zzso nor patients zzso showed this zzso zzso No statistically significant differences in zzso continuity were zzso A more prominent left zzso zzso and zzso zzso asymmetry zzso were both associated with higher scores on the working memory zzso 

The results suggest that zzso subjects have distinct zzso anomalies that resemble those of patients with schizophrenia even though they do not display any psychotic zzso Certain zzso zzso in the zzso such as the loss of zzso zzso asymmetry in patients with zzso might be related to genetic zzso Additionally, this zzso zzso might partly account for the impaired executive function in zzso
