zzso resonance imaging with zzso tissue tagging permits quantitative assessment of regional zzso zzso zzso We sought to investigate the utility of this imaging zzso to zzso determine zzso impairment and zzso improvement in zzso function in patients with zzso heart zzso 

zzso resonance imaging with zzso tissue tagging was performed on 6 patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso with coronary artery disease and 32 control subjects with no known heart zzso Patients with coronary artery disease underwent imaging before and 3 months after coronary artery bypass zzso The zzso was divided into 6 segments within a zzso zzso Regional zzso left zzso zzso strain was calculated from zzso magnetic resonance images throughout zzso zzso strain results were compared in patients before and after and 3 months after coronary artery bypass zzso and also in control zzso 

Before the operation zzso strain identified zzso zzso of all regional wall motion abnormalities seen by zzso zzso zzso improvements were demonstrated in zzso zzso of the regions, and these improvements agreed with viability testing by zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso Additionally, zzso global zzso strain for the zzso group was significantly depressed relative to that in control subjects zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso Global zzso strain correlated with ejection fraction by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and improved after coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

zzso resonance imaging with zzso tissue tagging permitted zzso strain zzso This technology zzso demonstrated improvements in left zzso wall motion after coronary artery bypass zzso for both individual regions and the entire zzso This zzso method may prove useful in zzso evaluation and zzso serial assessment of left zzso wall zzso
