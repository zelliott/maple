We report two functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments which reveal a cortical network activated when zzso zzso grids, and experiencing the zzso effect zzso Our results show that perception of zzso and zzso zzso activate the right zzso zzso zzso zzso plus the left and right zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso and left zzso The ME activated the left anterior zzso zzso as well as the zzso prefrontal cortex, and in common with zzso perception, the left zzso These data confirm the critical role of the zzso zzso in actual and zzso zzso perception as well as revealing localized frontal cortical zzso associated with the ME, which would suggest that a zzso mechanism is implicated in this zzso
