The role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in diagnosing the zzso zzso was reviewed with emphasis on its diagnostic value of zzso zzso 94 zzso zzso masses in 77 patients were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso just before zzso at zzso University Hospital from 1984 to 1987 and these images were followed up by zzso zzso From these obtained images, 6 zzso that is zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the cyst, zzso presence or absence of zzso image, and zzso zzso zzso signal intensity and zzso zzso value of the zzso zzso were extracted and analyzed zzso In zzso of zzso zzso zzso internal pattern was observed in all 3 images (short spin echo zzso inversion recovery zzso and long zzso and its signal intensity was at the same level or higher than that of zzso On the other hand, in all cases of zzso cyst, zzso cyst, corpus zzso zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso contents showed either lower signal intensity than the zzso or similar to it in zzso contrast images (short zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso signal intensity in all 3 images and their signal intensity levels were widely zzso High signal intensity of zzso contents in all 3 images could be observed in zzso of zzso cyst, zzso of zzso zzso with internal zzso zzso of zzso zzso with internal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso consisted of fatty tissue zzso zzso zzso showed markedly shortened zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso showed comparatively short value zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso value of non zzso zzso was as high as the level of zzso All of zzso zzso were clearly defined from the other pelvic zzso In result, zzso zzso were found to exhibit the characteristic findings in zzso images such as zzso high signal intensity of internal fluid and clear zzso of zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of zzso in zzso zzso were considered zzso in our zzso
