In zzso detection of zzso produced via zzso reduction of zzso zzso gas is demonstrated using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso which may be readily implemented on any zzso zzso is applied as an indirect zzso imaging method to zzso monitor the distribution of metabolically produced zzso water zzso in the rat zzso The delivery of zzso to rats is conducted via a specially designed closed zzso circuit that zzso the expensive zzso zzso mapping of zzso performed via zzso zzso zzso is validated by direct zzso resonance zzso The zzso data show that a zzso zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) is achieved in the rat brain within approximately 30 zzso under the zzso inhalation paradigm zzso From the first minute of the zzso time courses, cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso is estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a value that is consistent with the zzso
