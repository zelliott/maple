To explore the brain regions associated with impulsive decision-making behaviors and interpret the nervous mechanism for addiction and zzso in heroin zzso 

Using the zzso of psychological experiment, the subjects in both heroin addiction group zzso zzso and normal control group zzso zzso performed Iowa gambling task zzso and simultaneously underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso All the above data were gathered and then analyzed by zzso software to explore both the brain regions and their functional changes correlated with impulsive zzso 

Evidence by zzso behavioral consequences demonstrated that the net scores in HC group increased with numbers of decision-making whereas no zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed in zzso zzso Based on the results of zzso analysis, right zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso left zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso were activated in both zzso But the right zzso was more active while the right zzso and left zzso were weaker in zzso group versus the HC zzso Meanwhile, zzso of right zzso nucleus, right thalamus, right zzso zzso and left zzso nucleus were observed in zzso zzso 

zzso abusers are incapable of impulsive decision-making in behavioral zzso Such a brain region as prefrontal zzso zzso in the decision-making performance and control of zzso zzso abnormal brain regions correlated with impulsive decision-making may be one cause of zzso maintenance and zzso of heroin zzso
