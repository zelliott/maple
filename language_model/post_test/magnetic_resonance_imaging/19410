Due to the development new of imaging devices which produce a large number of zzso zzso advanced techniques for the evaluation of the large amount of data are zzso Computer supported extraction of dynamic zzso of the patients anatomy from zzso series thus is highly zzso Since the zzso should be able to quickly make sensible decisions based on the models, high accuracy is required within a minimum of zzso We present modeling and zzso techniques that are realized within the zzso zzso zzso for the application of these techniques to cardiac image data demonstrate their zzso Besides giving information about the patients zzso functional parameters can be derived from the data and zzso together with the zzso In order to verify the model with the original image data and for the planning of real intervention interaction techniques are zzso
