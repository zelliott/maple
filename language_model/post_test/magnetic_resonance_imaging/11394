To identify patients zzso at risk of late zzso follow-up after surgery for type A zzso dissection is zzso We assessed the value of zzso to monitor patients after surgery for type A zzso zzso 

80 out of 108 zzso operated between 1989 and 1999 for type A zzso dissection survived zzso 62 zzso with at least one zzso CT or zzso examinations during follow-up were included in this zzso All zzso had zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso 51 had CT, and 39 had zzso 

At the first zzso 12 of 48 zzso with zzso valve sparing surgery presented with zzso zzso zzso degrees detected using zzso 16 zzso evolved a zzso zzso aneurysm of over 5 zzso all seen in zzso CT and zzso A zzso zzso zzso was present in 39 zzso and could be seen in zzso CT and zzso in all zzso A new zzso zzso root dissection took place in 5 zzso Progressive zzso pathology led to zzso in 9 zzso zzso was especially useful in 2 zzso to confirm zzso in 1 zzso to rule out zzso assumed by CT, and in 1 with zzso blood flow after ascending zzso zzso zzso led to additional information in 1 patient with false aneurysm of the zzso zzso and 1 with zzso not seen in zzso 6 month zzso CT and zzso were superior to zzso in demonstrating zzso arch pathology, whereas zzso was more effective in showing the flow pattern and residual entry zzso 

zzso is an effective and zzso diagnostic tool to monitor zzso after surgery for type A zzso zzso and should be the method of choice to ascertain zzso pathology initially after zzso zzso intervals and need for additional CT or zzso should be determined afterwards according to specific zzso
