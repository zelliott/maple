zzso MR zzso can be used to study zzso changes occurring in the brain in zzso We used it to examine the relationship between zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso size of zzso clinical deficit, and zzso clinical outcome in patients with middle cerebral artery zzso territory zzso 

Thirty-one patients with acute zzso territory zzso were recruited within 72 hours of the onset of zzso zzso short echo time zzso echo zzso mode zzso was used to obtain zzso data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined with use of variable projection time zzso zzso zzso size was determined with zzso zzso Patient outcome groups at 3 months were zzso zzso or zzso 

All patients zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso who had an zzso zzso zzso did zzso zzso of 20 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with a core zzso concentration zzso zzso did poorly at 3 months, whereas 7 of 11 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with an initial zzso concentration zzso zzso did zzso Combining these results showed that all patients who had an initial zzso volume zzso zzso did poorly, irrespective of the zzso zzso Of those patients with zzso zzso zzso those who had a core zzso concentration zzso zzso did well zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso whereas those with a lower zzso concentration did poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso There was no association between other zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso volume and zzso concentration can together predict clinical outcome in zzso zzso in zzso
