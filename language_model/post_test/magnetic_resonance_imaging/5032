zzso is a neurological disorder zzso by high pressure zzso zzso within the spinal zzso As zzso is associated with abnormalities of the central nervous system that zzso zzso fluid zzso flow, it is thought that changes in zzso dynamics play an important role in its zzso Using three-dimensional zzso models of the spinal zzso space zzso this study aims to determine zzso zzso such as zzso change in zzso dynamics in the zzso The geometry of the zzso was reconstructed from a series of zzso zzso zzso is zzso as an zzso zzso fluid with a dynamic zzso of 1 zzso zzso Three zzso models simulated zzso flow in either the zzso zzso or with the zzso zzso by a porous region simulating zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of this porous obstruction was varied for the model with zzso zzso The results show that zzso increases flow resistance in the zzso and this is accompanied by a modest increase in magnitude and/or shift in timing (with respect to the cardiac zzso of the zzso pressure drop across the region of zzso This study suggests that zzso formation may be related to a change in zzso zzso pulse pressure zzso
