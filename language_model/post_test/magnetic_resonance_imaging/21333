This study proposes an zzso zzso zzso approach with sparse prior zzso to better estimate an zzso zzso zzso using the results of an independent component analysis zzso method applied to a temporally zzso group of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data zzso zzso zzso An ordinary DR approach estimates the spatial patterns zzso of zzso zzso and corresponding time courses zzso specific to each zzso zzso data with two steps involving zzso zzso zzso Our proposed approach employs zzso zzso solutions to refine both the individual zzso and zzso with an additional a zzso assumption of zzso in the zzso zzso minimally overlapping zzso based on zzso zzso To zzso evaluate the performance of this approach, zzso zzso data were created from zzso zzso data with the following zzso zzso an artificially designed spatial layout of zzso zzso patterns with varying overlap sizes across subjects and zzso a zzso time series zzso with variable parameters such as onset time, zzso and maximum zzso zzso To systematically control the spatial layout zzso of zzso zzso patterns across the zzso zzso the degree of spatial overlap across all subjects was varied from a minimum of 1 zzso zzso zzso cubic zzso to a maximum of 81 zzso zzso zzso zzso across the zzso zzso with a size of 100 zzso for both the zzso and zzso task zzso In addition, several levels of maximum percentage zzso intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used for each degree of spatial overlap zzso From the results, the estimated individual zzso of zzso zzso obtained from the proposed zzso DR approach with a sparse prior showed an enhanced true positive rate and reduced false positive rate compared to the ordinary DR zzso The estimated zzso of the zzso zzso from our proposed approach showed greater zzso correlation zzso with a reference zzso response function than those of the ordinary DR zzso Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed DR approach was also successfully demonstrated by the results of real zzso data acquired from zzso zzso tasks in both zzso and zzso task zzso
