The current study investigated the effects of aging on the neural basis underlying true and false zzso Although older adults, compared with younger adults, exhibited equivalent rates of true recollection, age differences in true recollection showed a pattern of activity commonly found among previous memory studies zzso age-related decreases in zzso and increases in prefrontal zzso suggesting reduced retrieval of zzso details associated with zzso items and a greater reliance on zzso zzso zzso With regard to false recollection, older adults exhibited significantly greater false recollection yet did not exhibit increased neural zzso They did exhibit decreased activity in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortex, suggesting a reduced reliance on reconstruction processes zzso false recollection in zzso An individual differences analysis in older adults found false recollection rates predicted activity in several zzso including bilateral zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that increases in false recollection in aging may be zzso by reduced access to zzso details as well as reliance on semantic zzso and zzso neural zzso
