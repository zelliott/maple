zzso acid transport and protein synthesis are important steps of tumor zzso We investigated the time course of tumor metabolism in zzso zzso zzso during zzso chemotherapy, and compared zzso responses as measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso with volume responses as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso A homogeneous population of 11 patients with progressive zzso zzso was zzso zzso Imaging was done at zzso intervals starting six months, and in a second series starting three months after treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with PET as metabolically active tumor volume, and was compared with the tumor volume on zzso Response was defined as zzso reduction of the initial tumor zzso Eight patients showed zzso zzso Already 3 months after start of chemotherapy the active zzso volumes decreased in 2 patients to a mean of zzso from zzso First MR volume responses were noted at 6 zzso zzso showed a volume reduction to 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from baseline for zzso and to 73 zzso zzso for zzso The time to zzso volume reduction was zzso zzso zzso months for zzso and zzso zzso zzso months for zzso The initial zzso response correlated with the best volume response on MR zzso Rank P zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid transport represents an early indicator of chemotherapy response in zzso Response assessment based on MR only has to be zzso The time window obtained from PET may assist for individual treatment decisions in zzso zzso
