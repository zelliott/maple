zzso disease, or zzso cell zzso is an zzso zzso disorder caused by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although most cases are diagnosed in infancy and show a fatal outcome in childhood, adult patients have been identified, showing progressive zzso zzso to zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The disease can be diagnosed by detecting the zzso of zzso activity (less than zzso of zzso in any available tissue zzso The cloning of the human zzso gene allowed the molecular characterization of newly diagnosed zzso More than 75 zzso zzso and zzso in this gene have been zzso 

To describe a 28-year-old woman with zzso disease, zzso clinical and zzso abnormalities to a novel zzso on the zzso zzso 

Clinical investigation was enriched by zzso and zzso zzso The activity of zzso was zzso in white blood cells using zzso natural zzso zzso DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and the zzso gene was zzso The zzso gene was expressed and zzso activity was measured in zzso zzso zzso 

The patient had progressive and bilateral zzso starting at 8 years of zzso Although she was experiencing weakness in all her zzso her intellect remained zzso She was found to be zzso for a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso which leads to low, but not totally zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of this zzso in zzso cells using the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in low, although not zzso zzso activity, which can explain the protracted clinical course in this zzso Patients carrying the zzso described zzso might be potential candidates for therapeutic trials, such as bone zzso transplantation or gene zzso
