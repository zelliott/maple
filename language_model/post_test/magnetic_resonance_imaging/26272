Conventional and zzso enhanced magnetic resonance zzso were done on 14 hips in 10 children ages 7 to 24 zzso The zzso normal hips in those with unilateral disease were studied with zzso magnetic resonance imaging for zzso By conventional zzso there were no well zzso zzso zzso structures seen as filling defects were the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By magnetic resonance zzso well zzso structures were the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By zzso magnetic resonance imaging, well zzso structures were the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso by magnetic resonance zzso versus conventional zzso was statistically significant with respect to all five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The difference in zzso by magnetic resonance zzso versus zzso magnetic resonance imaging was statistically significant with respect to the zzso and zzso zzso resonance zzso is indicated for assessing complete concentric reduction when it does not appear to be achieved by conventional zzso for confirming closed reduction immediately after zzso and potentially for zzso planning for an open zzso
