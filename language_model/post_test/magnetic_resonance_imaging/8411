zzso zzso is an anatomical basis for understanding the zzso zzso because it includes not only the focus of zzso lobe infection but of the frontal lobe as zzso With it we can explain many of the phenomena accompanying zzso zzso the change of the effects, and so zzso The goal of this assignment was to explore the asymmetry of zzso complex in the patients with complex partial zzso The results show that the smallest number of patients with zzso have a zzso zzso zzso zzso complex on the left side and the zzso According to the asymmetry direction the difference in the number of patients with zzso is not statistically zzso zzso of asymmetry shows that the asymmetry on the left side is more frequent in men, while women have the same distribution on both zzso The greatest differences were found when considering the age zzso So, in all the three groups of evaluated data the differences in average age of patients with zzso according to total zzso were not statistically zzso But, the differences in average age depending on the direction of asymmetry were zzso Patients with longer zzso complex on the left side are significantly younger, both male and female zzso to the zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso Thus, we propose the application of zzso technique in examining the asymmetry of the zzso complex that we used in this assignment as a template for future examinations in a sense of shedding light on the anatomical functions that zzso zzso zzso
