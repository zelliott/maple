This study aims to identify the cerebral networks involved in the zzso processing of zzso zzso for zzso zzso In particular, we investigated how muscle zzso and tactile messages can result in a unified zzso of one's own body zzso We zzso either separately or zzso these two sensory channels in order to evoke zzso illusions of a zzso rotation of 10 subjects' right hand in an zzso zzso zzso first show that, whether induced by a tactile or a zzso zzso the zzso illusion was accompanied by the zzso of a very similar cerebral network including cortical and zzso zzso areas, which are also classically found in passive or imagined movement zzso In addition, the strongest zzso illusions occurred under the zzso zzso zzso zzso They were specifically associated to brain area zzso distinct from those evidenced under the zzso zzso the inferior zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso the zzso region, and the zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso areas may zzso zzso zzso mechanisms at cortical and zzso zzso They also suggest the zzso processing might consist of detection of the spatial zzso between the two zzso messages involving the inferior zzso zzso activity and of a detection of their zzso coincidence via a zzso relay, the zzso structure, usually linked to the relative zzso of different zzso Finally, the involvement of the superior zzso zzso in the feeling of biological movement and that of the zzso in the movement timing control are also zzso
