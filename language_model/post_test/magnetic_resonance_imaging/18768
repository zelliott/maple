The zzso of immature rat brain to zzso of zzso zzso has provided a widely used paradigm to study zzso relevant to acute neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral zzso In this study, zzso was induced via injection of zzso (1 zzso zzso a zzso zzso into zzso rat brain and compared with zzso zzso The aim of the study was to induce zzso secondary to cellular membrane zzso thereby more closely mimicking the zzso processes of zzso brain injury where zzso zzso by zzso zzso not zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso caused an zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of water, as measured using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and resulted in zzso zzso as measured using zzso zzso and zzso up to 2 weeks zzso zzso one- and two-dimensional zzso resonance zzso zzso demonstrated that the early zzso diffusion changes were not accompanied by an overall zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso demonstrated that energy depletion is not a prerequisite for zzso decrease or zzso cell zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso (1 zzso attenuated the volume of tissue exhibiting a decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso injury is indeed zzso in zzso The authors argue that, compared with zzso zzso zzso elicits more appropriate zzso zzso and is better suited to detect relevant zzso in that it is more sensitive to zzso of synaptic zzso zzso
