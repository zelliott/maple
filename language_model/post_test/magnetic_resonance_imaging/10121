The objective of this study was to implement a clinically relevant zzso zzso imaging sequence in order to zzso zzso zzso relaxation times for normal volunteers at both zzso and 3 zzso zzso data were fitted using a zzso least square zzso Twelve echo data with zzso echo sampling were acquired using a zzso zzso phased array zzso and volume head zzso for zzso and normal volunteers, and compared to zzso data with linear echo zzso It was observed that the performance of the 180 degrees zzso trains was more zzso uniform for the zzso zzso phased array zzso than for the head zzso particularly at 3 zzso The phantom study showed that the estimated zzso relaxation times were accurate and zzso for both zzso and zzso acquisition from a commercial phantom with known zzso relaxation zzso Short zzso components zzso zzso zzso were mainly observed within the white matter for normal volunteers, and the fraction of short zzso water components zzso zzso water) was zzso of total zzso It was observed that the calculated zzso water fraction map from the zzso sampled zzso data was comparable with that from the zzso sampled zzso zzso zzso of zzso relaxation times from zzso images was accomplished with a clinically acceptable scan times (16 zzso for normal volunteers by using a zzso zzso prep imaging zzso The use of the zzso head zzso involved more accurate zzso of zzso relaxation times particularly when the number of echoes was zzso
