MR imaging and zzso allow the zzso measurement of brain function and zzso but excellent magnetic field zzso is required for meaningful zzso The homogenization of the magnetic field distribution in the mouse brain zzso zzso is a difficult task due to complex zzso field zzso combined with the small size of the zzso To date, the achievement of satisfactory whole brain zzso in the mouse remains a major zzso The magnetic fields generated by a set of 48 circular coils zzso 13 zzso that were arranged in a zzso pattern of 32 zzso diameter and driven with individual dynamic current ranges of zzso A are shown to be capable of substantially reducing the field zzso encountered in the mouse brain at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fields allowed the reduction of the standard zzso of zzso zzso by zzso compared to second order zzso zzso zzso and a zzso narrowing was achieved with the zzso application of the zzso zzso with a dynamic zzso For zzso echo imaging, zzso zzso minimized zzso signal voids in the brain periphery and allowed overall signal gains of up to 51% compared to zzso zzso zzso
