To assess the effect of zzso zzso characteristics on the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso identification of zzso extension zzso of prostate zzso 

The study included 176 patients zzso age zzso years, range zzso who underwent zzso zzso before radical zzso between January 2001 and July 2004, had no previous treatment and had zzso zzso pathological specimens showing at least one zzso zzso The likelihood of zzso of zzso zzso was zzso scored from 1 to 5 based on zzso prospective zzso zzso zzso zzso equation zzso models were used to determine the effect of the following zzso variables on the sensitivity of zzso for identifying zzso of zzso zzso maximum diameter, largest perpendicular diameter zzso zzso diameter product, zzso grade, and zzso zzso 

On zzso 339 zzso zzso were found, including 54 with zzso zzso correctly identified zzso in zzso zzso zzso including nine of 18 with focal zzso and zzso with established zzso giving sensitivities zzso confidence zzso of 67 zzso 50 zzso and 75 zzso zzso zzso incorrectly identified zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso sensitivity for zzso zzso identification was significantly associated only with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifty-one patients zzso had zzso zzso had a sensitivity zzso confidence zzso of 69 zzso and specificity of 90 zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso in zzso identification of prostate cancer zzso is significantly associated with the zzso zzso at zzso
