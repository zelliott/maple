To characterize zzso and zzso zzso mechanics in zzso zzso zzso with a new metric of zzso zzso 

Eleven healthy subjects and eight patients with zzso underwent zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso gated zzso movies, 3 zzso zzso zzso A zzso strain rate zzso zzso was compared with wall thickness and zzso 

The normal pattern of zzso included regional zzso a zzso increasing zzso to zzso zzso and minimum zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso increased in zzso Regional zzso zzso correlated with regional wall thickness zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso global zzso assignment agreed in seven of eight zzso All four patients with New York Heart Association class 1 disease had a low global zzso deficit score, whereas three of four patients with class 2 or 3 disease had a high zzso deficit score zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso characterization may provide an objective measure of disease course in zzso
