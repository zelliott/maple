The purpose of this zzso was zzso to examine the effect of the zzso plateau slopes zzso and zzso on anterior cruciate ligament zzso injury and zzso to investigate gender differences between zzso subjects and zzso zzso 

The zzso database was searched through to 1 November 2011 to identify studies that met zzso inclusion zzso zzso lists of retrieved articles were also zzso Two authors independently extracted information on the designs of the studies, the characteristics of the study participants, exposure and outcome zzso and control for potential zzso zzso A zzso was conducted, and either a zzso or a zzso model was used to calculate the overall weighted mean difference zzso 

Twelve studies zzso zzso zzso zzso patients in the zzso group and zzso patients in the control zzso were zzso The zzso zzso plateau slope in the zzso group ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso while it ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso among the zzso The lateral zzso plateau slope in the zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso zzso significant increased angles were observed in zzso group compared to control group for zzso zzso plateau slope zzso zzso 95 % confidence zzso zzso and lateral zzso plateau slope zzso zzso 95 % confidence zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso analysis proved this to be a reliable zzso 

The current zzso suggests that both, increased zzso and lateral zzso plateau slopes, are associated with increased zzso to zzso injury regardless of zzso In addition, this study indicates a stronger evidence for lateral zzso plateau slope to be associated with zzso injury compared with zzso zzso plateau slope due to the larger increased angle value and on the basis of consistency among the included zzso
