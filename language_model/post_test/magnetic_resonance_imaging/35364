The purpose of the study was to relate magnetic resonance imaging zzso features at baseline with zzso determined joint space narrowing zzso in the zzso compartment of the knee after 2 years in a group of patients with symptomatic zzso at multiple joint zzso 

zzso of the knee and standardized zzso were obtained at baseline and after 2 years in 186 patients zzso zzso aged zzso years; mean 60 zzso zzso was analyzed for bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso joint zzso and zzso pathology in the zzso zzso zzso were scored zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso joint using the zzso Research Society International zzso zzso zzso progression was defined as zzso or zzso grade zzso zzso between baseline magnetic resonance zzso parameters and subsequent zzso zzso changes were assessed using zzso zzso Relative risk zzso was then zzso 

zzso progression of zzso was observed in 17 zzso of 186 zzso Eleven patients had a zzso and Lawrence zzso score of zzso or zzso A significant association was observed between all patients and zzso tears zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso 2 and zzso tears zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 years zzso zzso MR in 15 of 17 patients with progressive zzso showed only new zzso abnormalities and no progression of cartilage zzso 

zzso pathology zzso and/or zzso zzso was the only zzso zzso to be associated with subsequent zzso progression of zzso in the zzso zzso compartment on a zzso 2 years later, as assessed by the zzso zzso
