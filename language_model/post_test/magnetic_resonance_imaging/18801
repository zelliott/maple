zzso of the zzso may play a role in the zzso of depression, but efforts to identify a structural zzso in this brain structure among depressed patients have produced mixed zzso Previous research may have been limited by exclusive reliance on measures of zzso zzso zzso brain mapping is a new zzso method that zzso characterizes the shape as well as volume of a brain zzso In this study, zzso brain mapping was used to evaluate zzso shape and volume in patients with major depressive disorder and healthy comparison zzso 

By using magnetic resonance imaging, brain scans were obtained from 27 patients with major depressive disorder and 42 healthy comparison zzso zzso brain mapping generated a series of 10 variables zzso that represented zzso shape, and zzso volumes were also zzso Analysis of zzso techniques were used to compare depressed patients and comparison subjects on zzso shape and zzso 

While the depressed patients and comparison subjects did not differ in zzso volume, there were highly significant group differences in zzso zzso The two groups did not overlap on a zzso function zzso from a model zzso the 10 zzso The pattern of zzso surface deformation in the depressed patients suggested specific involvement of the zzso 

Patients with major depression may have structural abnormalities of the zzso that can be detected by analysis of zzso shape but not zzso A specific zzso in the zzso could have widespread effects throughout zzso that appear to be abnormal in zzso
