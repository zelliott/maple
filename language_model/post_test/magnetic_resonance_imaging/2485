Increased water zzso values indicates the presence of zzso zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps reveal zzso areas displaying zzso zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities spread through the middle cerebral artery zzso territory up to 24 h after middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Also, it was found that zzso and zzso contours closely match at zzso and 24 zzso Since zzso reduces zzso zzso and improves energy status in various models of zzso we used these two techniques to investigate putative improvements in zzso and zzso zzso after permanent zzso performed on zzso zzso were given no treatment zzso zzso zzso or a treatment with 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso before and zzso h after zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps of brain water were zzso from which the volumes presenting abnormalities were calculated at various time points up to 24 zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso and zzso values in these areas were zzso zzso reduced neither the zzso volume nor the initial zzso zzso However, it reduced zzso volumes by zzso at zzso h and zzso at 24 h zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso increase in the zzso at zzso h zzso zzso our results show for the first time that a pharmacological agent such as zzso can delay the development of zzso zzso but does not limit the development of zzso zzso but does not limit the development of zzso zzso zzso imaging detects areas of severe zzso zzso but not moderately zzso peripheral areas where zzso is presumed to be more zzso
