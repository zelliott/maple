zzso understanding of numbers and related concepts can be zzso from rote knowledge of zzso zzso However, distinctions among different kinds of semantic representations related to numbers have not been fully zzso Working with numbers and zzso requires representing semantic information that is both analogue zzso the approximate magnitude of a zzso and symbolic zzso what zzso zzso In this article, the authors describe a patient zzso who exhibits a zzso between tasks that require symbolic number knowledge zzso knowledge of zzso symbols including numbers, knowledge of concepts related to numbers such as zzso and tasks that require an analogue magnitude representation zzso comparing size or zzso zzso is impaired on a variety of tasks that require symbolic number knowledge, but her ability to represent and process analogue magnitude information is zzso Her deficit in symbolic number knowledge extends to a variety of concepts related to numbers zzso decimal points, Roman zzso what a quartet zzso but not to any other semantic categories that we have zzso These findings suggest that symbolic number knowledge is a functionally independent component of the number processing system, that it is category specific, and that it is zzso and functionally distinct from magnitude zzso
