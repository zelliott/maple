zzso de la zzso syndrome is a zzso disorder characterized by an impaired ability to inhibit unwanted zzso Although the presence of chronic motor and vocal tics defines Tourette's syndrome, other distinctive zzso features like zzso and zzso and zzso socially inappropriate zzso are also core zzso We investigated zzso zzso during zzso execution and zzso of prepared movements in Tourette's zzso To this end, we performed zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging and structural diffusion zzso imaging in 15 moderately affected uncomplicated patients with zzso Tourette's syndrome and 15 healthy control participants matched for age and zzso zzso underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a zzso reaction time zzso They had to withhold a prepared finger movement for a variable time until a stimulus instructed them to either execute zzso or inhibit it zzso zzso were monitored throughout the experiments, combining surface zzso video recording, and clinical assessment in the zzso Patients with Tourette's syndrome had longer reaction times than healthy controls in Go trials and made more errors in zzso Their functional brain zzso was decreased in left primary motor zzso and secondary motor areas during movement execution zzso zzso but not during response zzso zzso zzso compared with healthy control zzso Volume of interest analysis demonstrated less zzso zzso in patients with Tourette's syndrome in primary and secondary motor zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso and cortical zzso zzso They showed reduced zzso between the left primary zzso hand area and a network of zzso zzso areas and zzso zzso zzso There were no zzso differences in structural connectivity of the left primary zzso zzso as measured by diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results link reduced zzso cortical zzso during movement execution to a decreased zzso between the zzso zzso and other brain areas involved in motor zzso These functional changes in patients with Tourette's syndrome might result from zzso reorganization in zzso brain networks engaged in motor and zzso control, possibly triggered by abnormal processing and presumably zzso in zzso zzso This might enable patients with Tourette's syndrome to better suppress unwanted movements but comes at a price of zzso deficits in other zzso
