The age-related modifications of magnetic resonance imaging parameters in the skin have been studied in zzso zzso of these parameters should provide important information about zzso in water structure and content in aged zzso zzso times, zzso and zzso and relative zzso density, which zzso to the mobile water zzso fraction of zzso have been measured on people under age 40 and over 70 on a zzso zzso zzso have confirmed in zzso skin layer differentiation through relaxation times performed in a previous zzso Moreover, relative zzso density zzso has shown that zzso mobile water is at least twice as abundant as zzso mobile zzso No significant age-related zzso and zzso modification could be established, basically because of a large zzso of zzso The main result concerns the upper part of zzso (about 200 zzso in zzso which contains significantly more mobile water zzso in zzso aged skin than in young adult zzso This increase has been related both to an increase of total water content in zzso with age and to an apparent decrease of collagen and zzso zzso Associated with zzso of their structure, this decrease reduces zzso interaction zzso This finding has to be compared with ultrasound evaluation of aged skin, which is characterized by modifications of the zzso related to collagen zzso size and density, in the outer part of zzso zzso Both of the imaging techniques tend to consider the outer part of zzso as one of the privileged sites of skin zzso
