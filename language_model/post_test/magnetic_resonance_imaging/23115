zzso and zzso zzso are both related to zzso activity, but not all components of the zzso appear to be equally reflected by the zzso zzso To evaluate potential zzso zzso of the auditory zzso zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso tones and zzso with zzso tone frequency and zzso tone duration were presented to 12 listeners in zzso and zzso The zzso evoked by zzso is readily separated from the zzso offset and sustained fields in zzso by a zzso zzso For zzso a contrast of zzso versus zzso was used to estimate activity related more specifically to the zzso zzso but excluding other activity that is evoked by AM and zzso zzso This contrast showed sustained zzso zzso confined to the zzso part of zzso zzso the location of the primary auditory cortex, as well as activity in the zzso zzso body zzso and the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso onset and offset responses were prominent throughout the auditory zzso In contrast, sustained zzso activity for zzso was weak and did not match well with the time course of the sustained field, suggesting that there is no reliable zzso correlate of the sustained field in zzso The sustained zzso activity in primary auditory zzso is therefore more likely linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso for AM compared to zzso in the zzso and zzso may similarly be related to phase zzso
