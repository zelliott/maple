The development of cellular tracking by zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has introduced a number of advantages for following immune cell therapies in zzso These include improved signal selectivity and a possibility to correlate cells labeled with zzso particles with conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso While the zzso of the cellular labeling method is clearly important, the impact of labeling on cellular dynamics should be kept in zzso We show by zzso MR zzso zzso that the efficiency in labeling cells of the zzso immune system zzso zzso by zzso zzso particles increases with increasing particle size zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are professional zzso presenting cells and with respect to impact of zzso particles on DC function, we observed that markers of maturation for these cells zzso zzso were also significantly elevated following labeling with larger zzso particles zzso zzso When labeled with these larger particles that also gave an optimal signal in zzso DC presented whole zzso more robustly to zzso T cells than control zzso Our data suggest that increasing particle size is one important feature for zzso cell labeling by zzso zzso but may also present possible pitfalls such as zzso of the zzso status of these zzso Therefore depending on the clinical scenario in which the zzso cellular vaccines will be applied zzso zzso disease, zzso it will be interesting to monitor the fate of these cells in zzso in the relevant zzso mouse zzso
