The relationship between zzso zzso vascular disease zzso and zzso in normal elderly is zzso in part because of zzso inconsistencies across zzso To clarify this relationship, the current study investigated a well characterized cognitively normal elderly sample zzso zzso with quantitative zzso and zzso robust zzso measures within a zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso selectively zzso zzso tasks by zzso zzso zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso markers of zzso would be selectively associated with worse executive zzso 

We studied 94 participants who were cognitively and functionally zzso zzso measures of white matter signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume, and cortical gray matter were obtained to predict performance on composite measures of executive functioning and episodic zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated that after controlling for demographic zzso zzso and total zzso volume, the total number of zzso zzso was the only significant zzso with a greater number of zzso associated with poorer executive zzso zzso volume best predicted episodic memory zzso 

zzso suggest that zzso in the form of silent zzso zzso to poorer executive functioning even in otherwise normal elderly, which is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The clinical importance of these findings is highlighted by the fact that zzso of the normal elderly participants in this study had zzso zzso
