zzso therapy is a potentially zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso have an advantage over photons zzso by zzso energy at the target with no exit dose, providing a lower dose to adjacent normal zzso Until recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso was available at only two zzso zzso use will increase as zzso facilities are under zzso 

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zzso for persistent zzso disease zzso and Nelson's syndrome zzso 

This was a retrospective review of 38 patients zzso with CD and five with zzso treated between 1992 and zzso 

All patients had zzso surgery without zzso zzso Four had previous zzso with zzso The patients with zzso underwent bilateral zzso zzso months zzso 40) before zzso 

zzso zzso was delivered at a median dose of 20 zzso Gray zzso zzso zzso on 1 treatment zzso 

Complete response zzso was defined as sustained zzso or zzso zzso zzso of urinary free cortisol off medical zzso zzso in zzso was based on zzso of plasma zzso 

At a median follow-up of 62 months zzso zzso zzso was achieved in five patients zzso with zzso and 17 zzso patients with zzso Among all patients with zzso median time to zzso was 18 months zzso zzso No secondary tumors were noted on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans, and there was no clinical evidence of zzso nerve damage, seizure, or brain zzso There were 17 patients zzso who developed new zzso zzso 

zzso is effective for patients with persistent zzso zzso with low morbidity after a median follow-up of 62 zzso longer follow-up is warranted for late zzso zzso
