The initial and follow-up CT and zzso images of ten patients with zzso zzso from zzso tumors were zzso analyzed to establish their features and sequential changes in zzso 

Ten patients with zzso zzso from zzso tumors received initial and follow-up CT and zzso zzso Six patients were followed up every two to three weeks before surgical tumor zzso Both CT and MR images were analyzed by two zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were detected by CT and zzso in 10 zzso All 14 zzso were demonstrated as areas of marked zzso on zzso zzso Eleven zzso tumors were demonstrated as round or oval low density zzso on CT and as areas of zzso on zzso zzso Three zzso were shown as solid masses with slightly low zzso at the initial CT examination and slightly low or zzso areas on zzso imaging, and these zzso showed early peripheral zzso enhancement and delayed enhancement on zzso CT and MR zzso Cystic formation was observed two to three weeks later after initial study in all the 3 solid zzso Rapid zzso zzso which showed obvious enhancement on delayed zzso enhanced MR imaging, was observed in two zzso 

The zzso zzso tumor from zzso zzso zzso may manifest as a zzso zzso zzso or as a solid mass, and the solid mass shows delayed enhancement on zzso CT and MR zzso Furthermore, rapid zzso formation and rapid zzso extension is frequently zzso
