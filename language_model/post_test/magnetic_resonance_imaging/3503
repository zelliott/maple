The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso and muscle volume in children with cerebral zzso zzso using zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

A retrospective sample of 8 children with zzso zzso was zzso One set of 10 passive knee zzso movements was completed at a zzso of zzso per second with concurrent surface zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to assess knee zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was used to measure maximum zzso area and muscle volume of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso muscle volume was positively correlated with zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and peak knee zzso passive zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The present findings suggest that higher levels of knee zzso muscle zzso are associated with greater zzso muscle volume in children with zzso zzso zzso
