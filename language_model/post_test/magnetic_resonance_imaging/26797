To compare the zzso gross tumor volume zzso to the zzso tumor volume zzso zzso defined by zzso in patients with cervical zzso 

Forty seven patients with cervical cancer underwent zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were acquired with a spatial resolution of zzso MR imaging was performed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso was contoured on the zzso zzso images while zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were zzso 

zzso patients zzso had tumors zzso zzso on zzso zzso patients zzso had tumors zzso and zzso zzso while 12 patients zzso had tumors zzso zzso zzso of patients in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cohort had Grade 3 images as defined by zzso et zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had a zzso coverage factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso This fell to zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso These differences were statistically significant on zzso testing zzso 

zzso provided better zzso of larger tumors than smaller tumors in reference to zzso zzso zzso tumor volumes different from zzso zzso especially in tumors zzso zzso in regard to zzso
