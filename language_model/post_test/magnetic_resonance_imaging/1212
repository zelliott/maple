To assess the masking effect of magnetic resonance zzso acoustic noise and the effect of passive hearing protection on speech zzso 

zzso recordings were made at zzso T at patient and operator zzso in the MR zzso locations for relevant pulse zzso In an zzso laboratory, zzso ratios zzso were determined, defined as the difference between the absolute sound pressure levels of MR noise and zzso The recorded noise of the MR sequences was played simultaneously with the recorded sentences at various zzso and 15 healthy volunteers zzso women, eight zzso median age, 27 zzso repeated these sentences as accurately as zzso The zzso that corresponded with a 50% correct repetition was used as the measure for speech zzso In addition, the effect of passive hearing protection on speech zzso was tested by using an zzso zzso 

Overall, speech understanding was reduced more at operator than at patient zzso Most problematic were fast zzso train and spiral zzso zzso As the absolute sound pressure level of these sequences was approximately 100 zzso at patient location, the vocal effort needed to attain 50% zzso was shouting zzso zzso At operator location, less effort was required because of the lower sound pressure levels of the MR zzso Fast zzso zzso and zzso imaging sequences showed relatively favorable results with raised voice at operator location and loud speaking at patient zzso The use of hearing protection slightly improved zzso 

At zzso zzso the level of MR noise requires that large vocal effort is used, at the operator and especially at the patient zzso Depending on the specific MR sequence used, loud speaking or shouting is needed to achieve adequate zzso communication with the zzso The wearing of zzso improves speech zzso
