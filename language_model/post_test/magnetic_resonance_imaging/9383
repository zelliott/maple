In aneurysm surgery, understanding the zzso around the aneurysm such as zzso arteries and zzso nerves is zzso 

To assess the usefulness in determining the zzso around the cerebral zzso by the use of fast imaging employing zzso acquisition zzso images of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in addition to zzso zzso and digital zzso zzso 

Between October 2006 and June 2009, 123 patients with 140 zzso cerebral zzso were treated in our zzso zzso patients were assessed with FIESTA by the operators on the zzso of the magnetic resonance image before surgical clipping of the zzso The small vessels and zzso nerves were confirmed zzso before or after obliteration of the zzso 

zzso and zzso of FIESTA imaging were zzso in detecting zzso artery around anterior zzso artery zzso zzso nerve attachment to the zzso zzso artery aneurysm zzso and anterior zzso artery zzso to the zzso zzso artery zzso This technique was also useful for predicting zzso between the aneurysm and adjacent main trunks or zzso Although the specificity was zzso sensitivity was zzso in detecting vessel zzso around the middle cerebral zzso This technique can provide limited information in large zzso or zzso located in minimal zzso fluid zzso The overall outcomes of the patients included 120 excellent recoveries, 1 moderate deficit, 1 severe deficit, and 1 persistent zzso state according to the zzso zzso zzso 

By giving information on the minute anatomical structure around the aneurysm, FIESTA can contribute to thorough zzso evaluations of cerebral zzso
