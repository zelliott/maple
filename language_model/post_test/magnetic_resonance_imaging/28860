zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate neural activity during the judgment of visual stimuli in two groups of experiments using seven and five normal zzso The subjects were given tasks designed zzso to involve zzso (more generally, visual zzso zzso and zzso zzso These tasks included the judgments of whether a line was zzso whether a zzso or zzso string included a horizontal line, whether a Japanese zzso zzso character or character string included a certain zzso or whether a character string was meaningful zzso or zzso or zzso zzso activity related to the visual form process was commonly observed during judgments of both single zzso and single zzso in lateral zzso visual cortex, the zzso zzso or zzso zzso area, and the zzso inferior zzso area of both zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was observed in the latter two areas during judgments of zzso and zzso zzso These results show that there is no zzso zzso form zzso whose activity is specific to real zzso zzso related to the zzso process was observed, in zzso area, the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso superior zzso area, with greater zzso in the left zzso These zzso zzso for visual form and zzso processes of zzso also were reported for the English alphabet in previous zzso The present zzso showed no additional areas for contrasts of noun judgment with other conditions and was similar between noun and verb judgment tasks, suggesting two zzso no strong semantic zzso was produced, or the semantic process shared zzso zzso with the zzso zzso
