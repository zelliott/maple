The metabolism of zzso zzso zzso was studied in dogs after intravenous infusion for zzso zzso with either 10, 30 or 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of plasma samples obtained 1, 5 and 30 zzso after the end of infusion revealed that zzso was rapidly zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with simultaneous zzso to the corresponding zinc zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso group, the parent compound zzso was present at the lowest concentration compared to the zzso at the first sampling time point, 1 zzso after the end of infusion, whereas zzso was the main zzso At 30 zzso zzso zzso was the main zzso The zzso and high-dose groups showed a similar zzso zzso In the high-dose group, zzso was the main zzso at all sampling time zzso The estimated plasma zzso of total zzso was 20 zzso and it was zzso with an apparent volume of distribution of zzso zzso The rate of zzso was similar to the rate of zzso and both were zzso However, calculations of the total zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the apparent plasma elimination was zzso The zzso for total zzso zzso which is a combination of both metabolism and zzso were 10 and 20 zzso at 10 and 100 zzso zzso The zzso for total zzso zzso which is the zzso for rate of formation of zzso zzso were 40 and 65 zzso at 10 and 100 zzso zzso No sex differences in zzso pattern were observed in any of the three dosage zzso
