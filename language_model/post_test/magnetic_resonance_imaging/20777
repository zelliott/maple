zzso thickness reductions in prefrontal and zzso zzso have been repeatedly observed in patients with zzso However, it remains unclear whether regional variations in cortical thickness may be attributable to zzso or zzso zzso 

The structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 48 zzso schizophrenia patients, 66 first-degree zzso relatives of schizophrenia patients, 27 community comparison zzso zzso and 77 zzso relatives were examined using cortical pattern matching methods to map and compare highly localized changes in cortical gray matter thickness between groups defined by biological risk for zzso 

zzso patients showed marked cortical thinning primarily in frontal and zzso zzso when compared to unrelated zzso zzso zzso were similar, though less pronounced when patients were compared with their zzso zzso zzso thickness reductions observed in unaffected relatives compared to zzso zzso relatives suggestive of zzso genetic liability were zzso surviving correction for the left zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso 

Observations of pronounced zzso cortical thinning in schizophrenia patients replicate prior zzso The lack of marked cortical thickness zzso in zzso relatives of patients, suggests that disease processes are primary contributors toward cortical thickness reductions in the zzso However, genetic factors may have a larger influence on abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso
