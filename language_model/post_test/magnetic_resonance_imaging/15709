Continuous zzso spin labeling zzso is a zzso technique for the measurement of cerebral blood flow zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the zzso of zzso zzso and its suitability to consistently detect differences between groups, regions, and resting zzso 

zzso healthy subjects (19 zzso were examined at zzso T on two measurement occasions that were seven weeks zzso zzso zzso was measured with eyes open and eyes zzso 

In different regions of interest zzso the zzso estimates varied between 9 and 19 zzso zzso There were no significant mean differences between occasions in all zzso zzso zzso zzso Greater zzso in the zzso than in the zzso state was consistently present in the primary and secondary visual zzso Furthermore, zzso was consistently greater in the right than in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso and differed between zzso and between zzso territories zzso zzso zzso Finally, we consistently observed greater zzso in women than in men zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates the suitability of zzso to consistently detect differences between groups, regions, and resting states even after seven zzso This emphasizes its usefulness for zzso zzso
