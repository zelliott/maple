To demonstrate different zzso features of zzso tumors on zzso between juvenile and adult zzso 

We have zzso analyzed clinical records and 121 zzso findings in 40 patients (8 juveniles and 32 zzso with proven zzso zzso The Fisher exact test and zzso curve were zzso for statistical zzso 

zzso in the juvenile patients were more multiple zzso vs zzso and appeared significantly earlier than in the adult zzso Adult patients demonstrate a much greater recurrence-free rate zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern was significantly zzso in the juvenile patients zzso whereas the zzso pattern was more frequent in the adult patients zzso zzso intensity zones on zzso and zzso imaging as well as the type of contrast enhancement did not show any significant relationship with biological zzso Four cases with no significant contrast enhancement showed low signal zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso resonance demonstrates different zzso features between juvenile and adult patients with zzso same zzso zzso These differences may be useful in consideration of zzso follow-up zzso
