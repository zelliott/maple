The authors zzso the accuracy of a method for brain volume measurement from magnetic resonance images and evaluated the effects of the acquisition zzso slice zzso and tissue sampling on the measurement zzso 

The method uses two magnetic resonance imaging sequences to account explicitly for partial volume zzso The accuracy was measured with one-, zzso and zzso zzso that mimic the relaxation properties of brain zzso The sensitivity of the method to section thickness was measured by repeated scans of human zzso 

Using a strongly zzso sequence and zzso zzso the average error was zzso with zzso error for zzso larger than 90 zzso In the zzso zzso the error varied from zzso to zzso zzso the section thickness from 5 to 10 zzso on zzso zzso and from zzso to 10 zzso in the human brain did not significantly affect zzso zzso 

The experimental study zzso the feasibility of monitoring localized volume changes in a zzso zzso
