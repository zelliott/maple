The aim of conducting this study was to assess the clinical relevance of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso an effective zzso zzso in a rat model of extensive zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to extensive anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or saline zzso injections were started for nine days zzso The effect of zzso on zzso activity in the zzso and remote zzso was measured by zzso in another zzso zzso zzso zzso nine days after zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies were performed at one and thirty days after zzso to assess zzso zzso and zzso After 4 weeks, hearts were zzso and subjected to zzso and zzso zzso Compared with control, zzso treatment attenuated zzso and zzso activity in both zzso and remote zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso failed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso study showed that zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, compared with control, zzso reduced vessel density zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso 46 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Our work suggest that effective zzso zzso in the zzso and remote zzso by zzso does not prevent zzso zzso and dysfunction but zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our findings caution against aggressive, zzso zzso of zzso in the early healing phase after zzso
