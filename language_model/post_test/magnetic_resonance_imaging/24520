To evaluate outcomes in a zzso series of zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of traumatic isolated tears to the zzso zzso ligament zzso 

This study includes 53 consecutive cases of zzso isolated zzso tears treated with zzso zzso zzso with minimum zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso We confirmed all zzso tears via zzso before performing a precision zzso zzso zzso using a modified zzso zzso We assessed outcomes using grip strength zzso and Chun and zzso modified zzso zzso wrist scoring system, which includes zzso and objective outcome zzso 

zzso 45 cases were graded as fair zzso zzso zzso zzso or poor zzso zzso zzso 30) on the modified zzso zzso zzso There were insufficient data to calculate grades in 8 cases zzso At final zzso most patients exhibited excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso or good zzso zzso zzso 17) scores, some scored fair zzso zzso zzso zzso and none scored as zzso All zzso and objective variables significantly improved over a mean follow-up of 36 months zzso zzso zzso Mean grip strength increased from a value of 23 zzso before surgery to 33 zzso over the same period, a zzso zzso All patients achieved clinical and zzso union by 10 zzso zzso plates were removed routinely in most cases zzso zzso zzso zzso at a mean of 17 zzso
