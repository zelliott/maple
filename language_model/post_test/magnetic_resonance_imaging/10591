To describe the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso zzso fractures in patients with zzso and compare the zzso appearance of these fractures with that of zzso bone zzso 

zzso examinations were reviewed in 16 patients with a known zzso zzso and severe hip pain that raised the possibility of local recurrence or zzso zzso Six patients had received pelvic zzso and three patients were receiving steroid zzso 

The total number of fractures detected was zzso a solitary fracture was present in 11 patients and five patients had bilateral zzso zzso Two patients had associated zzso zzso fractures, and one of them had stress fractures involving both zzso zzso Conventional zzso allowed the diagnosis of 14 zzso zzso six zzso zzso examinations were zzso and one zzso examination was zzso for zzso Available zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed typical findings of zzso Using zzso zzso fractures appeared as linear regions of low signal intensity on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident in all zzso zzso characteristically were parallel to the superior zzso in a zzso fashion in 18 zzso instances, and were zzso in three zzso zzso The fractures demonstrated considerable enhancement after intravenous zzso zzso No associated soft tissue masses were zzso 

zzso zzso fractures are a cause of hip pain, which may mimic skeletal zzso in the patient with zzso and pelvic zzso zzso of the characteristic zzso findings of these fractures can zzso zzso and unnecessary bone zzso
