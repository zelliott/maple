The objective was to correlate the change in the zzso load zzso and brain zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso with progression of clinical zzso represented by the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso and to test if zzso of patients according to magnetic resonance imaging zzso criteria can increase the zzso ability of zzso for zzso clinical zzso 

181 patients with clinically zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso for a period of up to 5 zzso zzso of patients according to the zzso value at the study entry revealed a substantial increase in the zzso rank correlation zzso zzso 

For the low zzso cohort of patients, we found a statistically significant correlation (R up to zzso with p zzso zzso of a later increase in the zzso score (years 4 and 5) with increased brain zzso in the first 2 zzso For the high zzso group, we found a statistically significant correlation (R up to zzso with p zzso zzso of a later increase in the zzso score (years 4 and 5) with an increase in the zzso value in the first zzso 

We conclude that zzso of patients according to the zzso criterion zzso can increase the zzso ability of zzso
