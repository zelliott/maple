The measurement of temperature variation along the surface of the body, provided by digital infrared zzso imaging zzso is becoming a valuable auxiliary tool for the early detection of many diseases in zzso However, zzso is essentially a zzso technique and its image does not provide useful anatomical information associated with zzso However, zzso image registration and fusion may overcome this difficulty and provide additional information for diagnosis zzso In this paper, a new method of registering and merging zzso zzso and 3-D zzso is zzso Registration of the images acquired from the two zzso is necessary as they are acquired with different image zzso zzso the body volume of interest is scanned by a zzso system and a set of zzso zzso of it, at zzso angles, is zzso Next, it is necessary to register these two different sets of zzso This is done by creating zzso zzso projections from the reconstructed 3-D zzso volume and registering it with the zzso Once zzso the zzso is then projected over the 3-D zzso The program developed to assess the proposed method to combine zzso and zzso resulted in a new tool for fusing two different image zzso and it can help medical zzso
