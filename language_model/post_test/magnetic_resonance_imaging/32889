zzso vascular contributing factors to multiple sclerosis zzso have been known for some zzso Only recently has the scope of their potential role become more apparent with the theory of chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso As research expands to further explore the role of vascular pathology in the zzso population, it is zzso to review the evidence from an imaging zzso In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art methods using magnetic resonance imaging zzso as applied to imaging zzso patients and zzso This includes evaluating imaging signatures of vascular structure and flow as well as brain iron zzso Upon review of the literature, we find that zzso zzso anomalies including zzso zzso zzso and zzso of flow in the major veins of the neck have been observed to be prevalent in the zzso zzso zzso flow has been reported in zzso patients both in major vessels using zzso flow zzso and in the brain using zzso zzso We discuss the role of quantitative flow imaging and its potential in assessing possible zzso for abnormal zzso Finally, it has been suggested that the presence of high iron content may indirectly indicate progression of existing vascular zzso To that end, we review the use of zzso imaging in monitoring iron in the thalamus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
