The objective of our study was to assess the utility of five MR zzso findings in zzso type II superior zzso zzso zzso zzso from superior zzso zzso 

The MR zzso of 55 patients zzso zzso with either type II SLAP zzso zzso zzso or superior zzso recess zzso zzso who underwent zzso surgery and MR zzso were zzso zzso Two independent zzso searched for the extension, direction, and shape of high signal intensity in the superior zzso on MR zzso In addition, the presence of zzso zzso zzso tear and zzso extension of high signal intensity on zzso images was zzso The zzso of these findings in cases of type II SLAP zzso and zzso recess were zzso and the statistical significance of each finding in differentiation of the two groups was zzso 

Extension of high signal intensity behind the biceps anchor that extended beneath the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso images was found in 33 zzso of the cases of type II SLAP zzso and 21 zzso of the cases of zzso zzso zzso curved high signal intensity was found in 17 zzso of the cases of type II SLAP zzso but in only four zzso of the cases of zzso zzso zzso or irregular shape of the superior zzso was present in 22 zzso of the cases of type II SLAP zzso and in 10 zzso of the cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tear was seen in 14 zzso of the cases of type II SLAP zzso but in only two zzso of the cases of zzso zzso zzso extension of high signal intensity in the superior zzso on zzso zzso zzso images was detected in 33 cases of type II SLAP zzso zzso and in 14 cases of zzso recess zzso 

Although the MR zzso findings were similar for type II SLAP zzso and zzso zzso zzso curved high signal intensity on zzso zzso images, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extension of high signal intensity on zzso images were helpful findings in the diagnosis of type II SLAP zzso
