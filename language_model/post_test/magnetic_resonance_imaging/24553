zzso and depression are zzso syndromes with symptoms that overlap zzso This clinical overlap leads to problems with zzso and diagnosis in clinical zzso No functional imaging study has attempted to separate brain regions altered in apathy from those altered in depression in a clinical zzso Parkinson disease zzso is a disorder in which apathy and depression co-exist in a single zzso We evaluate the relationship between zzso depression, and motor severity of disease in zzso focusing on the relationship between these factors and the zzso of the low frequency fluctuation zzso in the resting zzso We first evaluated if the resting zzso signal is a reliable measure for our clinical zzso For this, we develop and introduce a cross validation approach we term the zzso zzso of Reliable zzso zzso method to evaluate reliability of regions of interest deemed zzso by standard zzso zzso Using this approach, we show that the apathy score in this sample is best predicted by zzso signal in the left supplementary motor cortex, the right zzso cortex, and the right middle frontal cortex, whereas depression score is best predicted by zzso signal in the right zzso zzso Disease severity was best predicted by zzso signal in the right zzso A number of additional regions are also statistically (but not zzso correlated with our zzso measures and disease zzso Our results support the use of resting zzso as a means to evaluate zzso states and motor disease progression in Parkinson disease, and the clinical and zzso observation that apathy and depression are distinct pathological zzso Our finding that zzso and zzso are zzso properties of regions of interest identified as significant using standard zzso techniques suggests that including reliability analyses may add useful scientific information in zzso zzso
