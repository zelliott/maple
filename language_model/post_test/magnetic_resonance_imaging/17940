zzso zzso therapy is a minimally invasive treatment zzso that has been used clinically for zzso both primary and secondary brain zzso Here a zzso zzso ultrasound zzso is described that allows for increased spatial control during zzso zzso of tumors as compared to existing clinical zzso The device consists of an array of 56 ultrasound elements operating at zzso oriented on the seven faces of a zzso flexible zzso The device was first characterized using the acoustic zzso method to examine the functioning of the zzso Then experiments were performed to measure heating in zzso gel zzso and ex zzso tissue samples using magnetic resonance zzso zzso Experimental zzso were compared with results obtained using zzso zzso zzso simulations were performed to study the feasibility of using the device for zzso zzso in the zzso Experimental results show that the device can be used to induce a temperature rise of greater than zzso in ex zzso tissue samples and zzso simulations further demonstrate that tumors with diameters of greater than zzso could potentially be zzso
