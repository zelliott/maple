There are many methods of testing covert face recognition in zzso but it is not clear whether different types of covert recognition share a common zzso 

To determine whether direct zzso techniques and indirect zzso methods yielded similar behavioral estimates of covert ability in a series of zzso zzso 

The authors tested seven control subjects and seven zzso zzso Six patients had an zzso zzso one with childhood zzso three with bilateral zzso and two with unilateral zzso zzso The last had an zzso zzso from bilateral anterior zzso zzso The direct tests of covert function involved sorting faces by occupation or the forced choosing of which of two faces was famous with a name zzso The indirect test assessed name zzso by occupation after zzso with a facial zzso 

In normal subjects, the chief zzso effect was zzso by the true zzso In the six patients with zzso zzso direct covert measures were correlated with the zzso effect, with better covert ability in patients with unilateral zzso zzso In the patient with zzso zzso there was a zzso between excellent direct covert function and absent face zzso 

zzso and indirect covert functions likely share similar mechanisms in patients with zzso zzso and may reflect residual activity in anterior and left zzso components of the normal zzso zzso However, face zzso may be zzso in patients with severely zzso facial memories from anterior zzso zzso This may indicate a difference between residual patterns of zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso
