The zzso profiles of visual processing are normally distributed in two zzso zzso each lasting about 100 zzso Within each phase, cortical processing begins in zzso and zzso the visual cortical zzso However, the zzso role of zzso in starting each of these two zzso is zzso Here we used zzso to study the zzso profiles of visual processing and the zzso contribution of zzso in three zzso intact participants and in a rare patient zzso with unilateral destruction of zzso in whom residual visual functions zzso by the zzso pathways have been zzso In healthy subjects, visual processing in the first 200 zzso zzso onset proceeded in the two usual zzso zzso perceived stimuli in the left zzso of zzso zzso a zzso profile in the intact right zzso that closely matched that of healthy zzso However, stimuli presented in the zzso blind zzso produced no zzso response during the first phase of processing, indicating that the responses in zzso visual areas during this phase are determined by the zzso progression of activity initiated in zzso The first responses occurred during the second processing phase, in the zzso high-level visual zzso The activity then spread forward toward zzso areas and backward toward zzso zzso However, in contrast to responses in the intact hemisphere, the zzso activity in the early visual zzso did not exhibit the classic zzso organization and did not have zzso response zzso
