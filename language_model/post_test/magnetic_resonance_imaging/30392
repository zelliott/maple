To investigate the structural basis of three cases of apparent superior zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso 

Three subjects were diagnosed as having zzso idiopathic left SO zzso on the basis of zzso in diagnostic gaze positions, response to the head tilt test, and results of the Hess screen zzso zzso resonance imaging of the orbits in zzso planes was used to determine SO muscle size and zzso and to define the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso computer simulation was performed for each subject by using measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment was compared with the zzso 

The zzso SO cross sections of both eyes of each subject were similar, and exhibited similar zzso zzso from zzso to zzso The superior zzso muscle pulleys in three eyes exhibited significant zzso zzso while the lateral zzso muscle pulleys in five eyes and the zzso zzso muscle pulleys in two eyes were displaced significantly zzso compared with published zzso zzso based on observed zzso position abnormalities alone predicted measured Hess screen data better than did simulations incorporating SO zzso either alone or combined with other structural zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso pulleys may be associated with zzso zzso that simulates SO zzso
