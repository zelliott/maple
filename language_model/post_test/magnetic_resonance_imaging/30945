To report our experience with zzso in the zzso evaluation of patients with traumatic penile zzso 

Between January 1998 and December 2001, we performed zzso examinations on five patients zzso zzso years; mean age 40 zzso with suspected traumatic fracture of the zzso occurred during sexual zzso In all cases, zzso SE, zzso zzso and zzso sequences in the zzso zzso and zzso planes were zzso The study was performed without IV administration of zzso contrast agents and in conditions of zzso A zzso surface zzso was used in four cases and a body zzso was used in one zzso All patients had suspected penile fracture with indications for surgical zzso The MR examination was performed within 12 to 48 hours of the trauma and was requested to aid surgical zzso 

The MR image quality was adequate in all zzso The examination documented unilateral zzso of the corpus zzso in all zzso This finding was associated with zzso located both zzso and inside the corpus zzso zzso In no case was there zzso of both zzso zzso In only one patient was there a suspicion of injuries to the zzso corpus zzso which was confirmed by surgery along with the other MR zzso 

Many imaging methods are available to evaluate traumatic penile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In agreement with the literature, our experience shows that zzso is useful in evaluating penile injuries zzso to its zzso capabilities, its good spatial resolution and its excellent tissue contrast zzso These characteristics enabled a more adequate surgical zzso In our view, zzso can be regarded as an emerging method to obtain helpful diagnostic information, with no risks for the zzso
