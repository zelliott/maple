zzso continues to reign with regard to the need for zzso zzso of zzso and to which are the most sensitive and accurate diagnostic imaging zzso Our aim was to determine the role of diagnostic procedures and suggest which of them are really zzso 

Over a 12-year period 34 patients underwent several zzso diagnostic procedures to zzso the zzso zzso zzso in 20 cases, zzso zzso zzso in 26, magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 28, selective zzso in 8, zzso stimulation zzso sampling zzso in 23 and zzso in zzso All patients underwent surgical zzso and in 32 cases zzso zzso zzso was zzso Twenty-six cases underwent zzso six had zzso pancreatic zzso and two patients had only exploratory zzso with liver zzso We compared the findings of the diagnostic procedures and analyzed the surgical treatment chosen according to the pancreatic site of the zzso 

In 32 zzso of the 34 patients with clinically suspected pancreatic zzso the tumor was found at zzso zzso US achieved zzso sensitivity, CT zzso selective zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso achieved zzso sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy whereas zzso achieved only zzso diagnostic zzso zzso zzso performed before zzso identified the tumors in zzso zzso in the other four cases, one was a zzso result (a zzso in the pancreatic zzso two were true zzso and one was a false zzso zzso zzso therefore yielded zzso diagnostic zzso zzso was performed in 32 cases and localized the tumors in zzso cases zzso zzso with one zzso result zzso zzso zzso The operative mortality was zzso and the morbidity zzso zzso in patients treated by tumor zzso 

No single diagnostic imaging zzso is reliable for zzso zzso We therefore suggest combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides particularly useful information for planning manual zzso and zzso zzso
