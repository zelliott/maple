To study the effect of laser zzso on normal zzso discs, a zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso was applied to the 83 zzso discs of 23 adult zzso The extent of disc zzso the temperature changes in the surrounding zzso and changes in the zzso and zzso findings were assessed after laser zzso When laser zzso was delivered to the discs, the disc weight decreased zzso with the increase in total laser energy, indicating steady zzso of disc zzso The temperature was highest at the site of the guide zzso zzso zzso was delivered at zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso to the zzso discs, and zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso discs were investigated at 1, 4, and at 12 weeks after zzso At 1 week after zzso at zzso and zzso zzso the zzso showed a decrease in the disc zzso At 12 weeks after zzso at zzso zzso the disc height had restored to normal, while the decrease was persistent after zzso at zzso zzso At 1 week after zzso zzso showed a decrease in the signal intensity of discs treated at zzso zzso but the decrease was recovered at 12 zzso After zzso at zzso zzso the decrease in signal intensity was also recovered by 12 weeks, but the recovery was less than the recovery after treatment at zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for the treatment of zzso discs, but it is necessary to select the optimal operating zzso It may also be necessary to change the power of zzso according to the pathological condition of the disc being zzso
