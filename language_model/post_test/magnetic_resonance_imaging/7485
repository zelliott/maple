The purpose of this study was to determine whether dynamic zzso contrast MR zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso zzso with prognosis of World Health Organization zzso grade III zzso tumors and their different zzso zzso evaluation of zzso tumor zzso derived from dynamic zzso contrast MR zzso was performed in 34 patients with zzso diagnosed WHO grade III zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso free survival was correlated with zzso using zzso rank zzso zzso curve analysis was performed to determine the operating point for zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso at the median progression free survival zzso For all grade III tumors zzso zzso 34) the mean zzso was zzso with a progression free survival of zzso zzso The mean zzso of zzso zzso was zzso with progression free survival zzso zzso In contrast, the mean zzso for zzso tumors was zzso with a progression free survival of zzso zzso Although there was no significant correlation between zzso and progression free survival among all types of grade III zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso there was a significant correlation between zzso zzso and progression free survival with correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The operating point for zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso at the median progression free survival time zzso zzso was zzso with 78 % accuracy and there was a significant difference between the survival of patients with zzso zzso in the zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may serve as a zzso imaging zzso for zzso zzso but not grade III zzso zzso
