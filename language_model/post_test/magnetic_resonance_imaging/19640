Many real-life decision-making problems incorporate zzso structure, involving zzso between different zzso actions, and subsequent zzso It is not known whether brain regions implicated in decision making, such as the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso use a stored model of the task structure to guide choice zzso decision zzso or merely learn action or state values without assuming zzso structure as in standard reinforcement zzso To discriminate between these possibilities, we scanned human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a simple decision-making task with zzso structure, zzso reversal zzso We found that neural activity in a key decision-making region, the zzso was more consistent with a zzso model that exploits zzso structure than with simple reinforcement zzso These results suggest that brain regions, such as the zzso use an abstract model of task structure to guide behavioral choice, zzso that may zzso the human capacity for complex social interactions and abstract zzso
