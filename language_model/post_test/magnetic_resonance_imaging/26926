Loss of zzso is a feature of many zzso diseases including multiple zzso Here, we have established and characterized a novel model of genetically induced adult zzso zzso zzso primary loss of adult zzso leads to a well defined and highly zzso course of disease development that can be followed zzso by magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed progressive zzso zzso in parallel to disease development that includes motor deficits, zzso and zzso zzso damage and clearance were associated with induction of zzso precursor cell zzso albeit with some regional zzso zzso was present in the mildly affected corpus zzso zzso of acutely induced cell death of adult zzso included secondary zzso zzso zzso were activated in affected areas but without significant influx of zzso zzso cells, or zzso zzso Analysis of the model on a zzso zzso zzso zzso background, lacking functional zzso did not change the observed disease and pathology compared with zzso zzso We conclude that this model provides the opportunity to study the consequences of adult zzso death in the absence of primary zzso injury and zzso cells of the zzso immune zzso Our results indicate that if the zzso barrier is not zzso zzso debris is not removed zzso zzso is impaired, and zzso integrity is compromised, likely as the result of zzso zzso This model will allow the evaluation of strategies aimed at improving zzso to foster zzso zzso
