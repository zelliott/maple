We explore the world around us by making rapid eye movements to objects of zzso zzso these eye movements go zzso and we perceive the world as zzso zzso updating is one of the neural mechanisms that contributes to this perception of spatial zzso Previous studies in zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that individual zzso update, or zzso the locations of salient visual stimuli at the time of an eye zzso The existence of zzso implies that zzso have access to visual information from regions far beyond the classically defined receptive zzso We hypothesized that zzso have access to information located anywhere in the visual zzso We tested this by recording the activity of zzso zzso while systematically varying the direction in which a stimulus location must be zzso Our primary finding is that individual zzso zzso stimulus traces in multiple directions, indicating that zzso zzso have access to information throughout the visual zzso At the population level, stimulus traces are updated in conjunction with all zzso directions, even when we consider direction as a function of receptive field zzso These results show that spatial updating in zzso is effectively independent of zzso zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that the activity of zzso zzso contributes to the maintenance of spatial constancy throughout the visual zzso
