Studies using zzso zzso and structural imaging zzso in adolescent zzso stress disorder zzso are zzso in the current study we used both zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso differences, and zzso to examine the relationship between zzso and regional brain zzso 

Participants were 21 traumatized adolescents with zzso matched with 32 traumatized adolescents without zzso zzso resonance images were obtained on a zzso zzso zzso Symphony zzso zzso implemented on zzso was then used to compare zzso zzso matter volumes, after which zzso was used to obtain global volume and thickness zzso in different brain zzso 

zzso zzso zzso differences were found for tests of attention, delayed recall and visual zzso On zzso reduced zzso matter was found in three regions in the zzso group: left zzso right zzso and right zzso zzso using zzso values zzso zzso zzso while no statistically significant zzso differences were found on the initial zzso zzso Further zzso analysis on zzso revealed significant reductions in the zzso for the zzso zzso In addition, zzso changes in the corpus zzso and zzso were significantly associated with deficits in logical memory and visual reproduction on zzso zzso 

zzso exposure of itself may be sufficient to cause structural changes in adolescents regardless of zzso zzso
