zzso white matter injury zzso in zzso infants is a leading cause of cerebral zzso zzso stem cell zzso transplantation in experimental models of adult zzso conditions is reported to reduce neurological deficits so we investigated their potential for treating zzso zzso Neonatal rat zzso when cultured and labeled in zzso with zzso zzso zzso iron oxide particles zzso retained their differentiation zzso zzso received bilateral zzso injections of zzso acid at zzso day 5 causing zzso zzso with localized zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were transplanted near the zzso in the right zzso 1 day zzso Animals receiving cell transplants showed significantly increased zzso zzso in the corpus zzso and improved reaching and retrieval skills, compared to animals receiving zzso medium zzso In separate experiments, in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso cells migrated away from the injection site toward zzso areas in both zzso confirmed by zzso zzso but zzso studies found little evidence of differentiation into neural zzso zzso transplantation led to significantly more zzso cell zzso zzso by zzso zzso than in zzso zzso transplants may have been zzso and indirectly contributed to brain zzso
