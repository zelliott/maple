Standard methods for the evaluation of human zzso nerve zzso provide limited zzso In this pilot study, the authors investigated the feasibility of qualitative zzso imaging, a recently developed zzso technique, as a method of assessing human zzso zzso nerve blood zzso 

zzso zzso imaging (based on magnetic resonance fast zzso zzso was used to study the zzso nerves of 7 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with known zzso nerve zzso Data regarding both study subject background and zzso in zzso nerve signal intensity were statistically zzso 

Control group subjects were significantly younger than study group zzso No significant differences in zzso nerve signal patterns were found within the control zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso against the normal composite revealed substantial differences in enhancement zzso 

zzso zzso imaging of the human zzso nerve is feasible and may serve as the basis for more advanced zzso studies of zzso nerve blood flow zzso
