A zzso zzso on either CT or zzso as a finding associated with zzso has occasionally been described and is almost always associated with zzso zzso The cause of the zzso of the zzso in these images is still zzso Some reports have found that zzso was responsible whereas others have advocated zzso zzso as the zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso are caused by zzso zzso or zzso with the sequential imaging zzso 

Five patients presenting with an acute onset of either zzso or zzso zzso and showed either unilateral or bilateral zzso zzso on the initial CT were zzso zzso studies including sequential CT and zzso examinations and detailed zzso tests were zzso 

Three patients had pronounced zzso and the other two patients had no zzso zzso In all patients, the first CT scans, performed within two weeks of the onset of chorea, showed a high density over the zzso zzso to the chorea, which diminished or disappeared two months zzso zzso weighted imaging disclosed zzso zzso over the zzso zzso to the zzso on admission which diminished two months zzso zzso weighted imaging at two months showed zzso intensity changes corresponding to the area with zzso changes on zzso weighted images, zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the evolution of clinical manifestations and the findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a new entity causing either zzso or zzso zzso
