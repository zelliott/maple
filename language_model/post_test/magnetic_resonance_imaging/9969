One of the most robust zzso cortical dynamics is reduced neural activity when stimuli are zzso This reduction has been linked to performance improvements due to repetition and also used to probe functional characteristics of neural zzso However, the underlying neural mechanisms are as yet zzso Here, we consider three models that have been proposed to account for zzso reductions in neural activity, and evaluate them in terms of their ability to account for the main properties of this phenomenon as measured with zzso recordings and zzso zzso We also discuss future directions for distinguishing between these models, which will be important for understanding the neural consequences of repetition and for interpreting zzso effects in zzso zzso
