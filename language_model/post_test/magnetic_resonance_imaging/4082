By means of MR imaging, to determine signal abnormalities in the zzso zzso to determine their location, extent and zzso over time; and to correlate these findings to the zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 247 MR images in 86 patients (101 zzso with zzso disease were zzso The MR images were taken in the zzso plane, and the images through the center of the zzso head were used for this zzso 

zzso images proved as good as zzso images for the MR evaluation of the extent of the zzso In almost every case, the zzso part of the zzso showed a low initial zzso In zzso group I, the zzso part was never zzso In zzso III and IV, almost the entire zzso showed signal zzso In the period 3-6 years after diagnosis, we still found signal changes in the zzso in some hips but there was no correlation with the zzso zzso After 6 years, the zzso showed normal signal intensity in MR zzso In zzso images, zzso occurred in the peripheral regions in the early stages of the zzso The central part of the zzso became more enhanced over time and peaked in the period 1-3 years after zzso 

MR is a valuable zzso for monitoring changes in the zzso zzso We propose a new zzso of the extent and pattern of zzso bone-marrow abnormalities based on the 4 zones most commonly observed in MR zzso
