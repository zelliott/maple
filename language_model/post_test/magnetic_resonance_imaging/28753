An appropriate detecting technique is necessary for the early detection of neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso rats serve as the animal model for one neurodegenerative disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging were applied to study zzso evolution and spatial distribution of brain zzso which were produced by intravenous injection of zzso acid in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and corpus zzso but not in the zzso were observed 3 and zzso h after zzso acid injection (30 zzso on the zzso and zzso images, respectively zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso imaging is not only superior to zzso imaging in detecting onset of zzso zzso zzso brain damage but also zzso zzso and zzso areas with better spatial resolution than zzso zzso Additionally, to correlate structural zzso with zzso conditions, dynamic zzso contrast magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and 4 h after zzso acid administration zzso zzso zzso The relative cerebral blood volume was significantly elevated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso after zzso acid zzso The changes in regional relative cerebral blood volume were well correlated to the changes in signal zzso in the corresponding areas on the zzso and zzso zzso The combined structural and functional information in this study may provide new insights and therapeutic strategies in treating neurodegenerative zzso
