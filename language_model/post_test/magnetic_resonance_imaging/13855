Five zzso containing contrast media zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging, zzso NJ, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso added with zzso and a surface active zzso were evaluated for their efficacy in magnetic resonance depiction of lung zzso 

All contrast agent zzso were generated by a jet zzso Twelve zzso domestic pigs were mechanically zzso with the respective zzso contrast agent and studied on a zzso T MR zzso zzso zzso images using respiratory gating were obtained before and after a 10-minute ventilation zzso Pulmonary signal intensity zzso and zzso zzso changes were measured for both zzso 

Mean zzso increases ranged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes ranged from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso for the right and left zzso zzso The highest zzso and zzso increases were observed in the zzso zzso 

The use of zzso for MR ventilation imaging is primarily hindered by its zzso properties and thus, its capability of zzso Of the five agents tested, the medium with the lowest zzso at room temperature zzso showed the most promising enhancement zzso The results zzso the potential of zzso contrast agents as a pulmonary imaging zzso With a reduction of ventilation duration down to ten minutes, the method appears tolerable in a clinical zzso
