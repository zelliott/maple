In this study, using high resolution zzso implanted growing rat brain tumors were zzso zzso with 3-D volume zzso generated by means of a clinical magnetic resonance imaging system zzso and commercially available wrist zzso Ten female zzso rats were used, eight were implanted with zzso rat zzso cells and two served as zzso The images that were used for the three-dimensional zzso zzso were obtained from zzso weighted post contrast zzso A commercially available computer work station with 3-D image analysis software was used to generate the tumor zzso In addition to the rat studies a mouse was included to see if the resolution would be adequate for imaging very small zzso Six rats had brain tumor growth after transplantation and two rats did not have any tumor growth, however, their images were similar to the controls zzso zzso volumes varied widely among the implanted zzso The number of implanted tumor cells had no direct relationship to developing tumor zzso This study demonstrates that high resolution images of a rat brain tumor can be obtained from a zzso system using a commercially available wrist zzso which is capable of imaging two rats at the same time or even a mouse zzso A commercially available computer work station was able to generate the tumor zzso The ability to image brain tumor and generate volume zzso over time has potential for animal zzso
