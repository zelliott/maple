The accurate description and zzso of altered brain water resulting from different zzso conditions is of critical clinical zzso In this work we determined the influence of total water content, zzso fraction and magnetic field strength on observed zzso relaxation rates by means of in zzso and in zzso model studies and developed a scheme for determining water content at any field zzso zzso relating zzso relaxation times and brain water content are zzso This allows a zzso measure of brain water to be determined in the clinical zzso
