Recent studies that have compared CT or zzso images of an zzso zzso anatomy and measures of their zzso sensitivity have found a correlation between specific anatomical areas and performance on zzso zzso Using zzso fluid dynamics zzso techniques, we have developed a method to quickly zzso zzso convert zzso CT scans from an individual patient into an zzso accurate 3-D zzso zzso model that can be used to predict zzso and zzso zzso which may ultimately determine zzso zzso The 3-D model can be also be rapidly modified to depict various anatomical zzso such as zzso and their zzso that may alter zzso zzso and impair zzso zzso To evaluate the degree to which variations in critical zzso areas such as the zzso slit and zzso valve can alter zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso were simulated using zzso finite volume zzso zzso suggest that anatomical changes in the zzso region zzso zzso below the zzso zzso and the zzso valve region will strongly affect zzso patterns and zzso transport through the zzso region, with subsequent effects on zzso zzso The ability to model zzso transport through individualized models of the zzso passages holds promise for relating anatomical zzso to generalized or selective disturbances in zzso perception and may provide important guidance for treatments for zzso disease, occupational zzso and surgical interventions that seek to zzso zzso and improve deficient zzso zzso
