To describe methods of assessing cochlear implant candidacy in patients with potentially significant peripheral and central nervous system zzso zzso 

A patient with a degenerative zzso disease zzso zzso undergoing evaluation for cochlear zzso is zzso 

This study took place at a zzso care zzso 

A patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso episodes zzso who had cortical zzso and profound zzso hearing loss was evaluated and rehabilitated with cochlear zzso 

zzso zzso behavioral responses to zzso stimulation electrical auditory zzso response, and zzso evoked zzso responses zzso were used to assess eighth zzso auditory zzso and cortical auditory zzso zzso zzso with zzso Corporation mini 22 implant was zzso 

zzso zzso evoked zzso and behavioral responses to zzso stimulation documented the presence of auditory cortical zzso zzso zzso resulted in open set speech recognition and communication using the zzso zzso 

This report describes successful zzso in a patient with zzso syndrome and demonstrates the ability to preoperatively confirm the integrity of zzso and cortical auditory pathways despite significant zzso zzso
