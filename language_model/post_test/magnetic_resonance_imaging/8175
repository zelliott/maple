We describe a characteristic pattern of bone zzso zzso about the foot and ankle seen by zzso in patients who have undergone recent zzso therapy and investigate potential zzso as well as possible clinical zzso 

Three zzso zzso evaluated 52 ankle zzso examinations in 18 patients with abnormal signals compatible with bone zzso zzso who had been treated with various types and zzso of zzso of the lower limb after traumatic zzso Bone zzso zzso patterns were characterized by distribution, extent, location, and zzso evolution or resolution on subsequent followup zzso zzso These zzso findings were then correlated with clinical history, zzso and treatment zzso 

All patients had a characteristic pattern of bone zzso zzso about the foot and ankle zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The occurrence of this zzso pattern was most often noted on zzso within the first 12 weeks after completion of zzso therapy or resumption of partial or full zzso and did not correlate well with new zzso or zzso In patients with protracted imaging zzso the bone zzso zzso ultimately resolved and was not associated with reported setbacks in recovery course or unexpected delays in restoration of zzso All zzso examinations performed more than 18 weeks after the zzso period showed resolution or stabilization of bone zzso zzso with no continued zzso No patient had a clinical picture suspicious for zzso sympathetic zzso 

A distinctive pattern of bone zzso zzso on zzso of the foot and ankle can be seen on zzso after a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This pattern has a consistent appearance on zzso and does not seem to be related to clinical zzso At present, no substantial conclusions can be made regarding the zzso of this zzso However, these bone zzso signal zzso should not mandate further imaging or a change in therapy on the basis of zzso findings zzso
