The purpose of this zzso was to investigate the safety of a novel cooled bipolar zzso system by examining zzso and monitoring temperature distribution in the disc, zzso space, and adjacent to the nerve zzso In our study we used two human zzso zzso zzso one moderately to severely zzso and the other mildly zzso 

zzso zzso of the disc zzso zzso is a theoretically plausible technique to zzso the zzso and to modify collagen of the zzso zzso A novel cooled bipolar zzso system is used to perform a procedure called zzso disc zzso to heat the zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso Four zzso zzso discs were treated in each spine sample using the bipolar system while two zzso discs of each spine were used as zzso 

Temperatures developed in the zzso zzso of the disc were on average zzso zzso zzso degrees C, while in the zzso zzso and in the spinal canal were zzso zzso zzso degrees C and zzso zzso zzso degrees C, zzso There was no zzso evidence of damage to any other structures including zzso end plates, zzso space, or nerve zzso Additionally, there were no zzso changes in the zzso zzso that were consistent with zzso changes to collagen zzso 

Temperatures reached in the zzso zzso during zzso zzso were greater than required zzso degrees zzso for zzso Temperatures reached at the neural zzso and zzso were low enough to avoid neural zzso
