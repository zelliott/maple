In multiple sclerosis zzso conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is very sensitive in detecting new zzso formation and changes of zzso sizes over zzso However, it lacks specificity to the zzso pathological zzso of the zzso zzso This might explain the lack of correlation between zzso findings and the development of disability in zzso zzso transfer zzso imaging is promising for a more accurate monitoring of the evolution of zzso zzso changes indicate a reduced capacity of the zzso in brain tissue to exchange zzso with the surrounding water zzso thus reflecting zzso zzso The analysis of zzso changes can be performed on a regional basis, thus obtaining information about individual zzso or discrete areas of the zzso white matter, or on a more global basis, using zzso zzso thus zzso the amount and severity of microscopic and zzso disease burden in zzso The present review will zzso the major contributions given by zzso for the understanding of how individual zzso zzso zzso Monitoring individual zzso evolution may be relevant not only for the understanding of the disease zzso but also as a new approach for assessing treatment efficacy in zzso
