zzso studies and single cell recordings in monkey zzso zzso have documented greater sensitivity to differences in viewpoint zzso or zzso properties zzso straight zzso zzso than metric properties zzso degree of zzso of simple zzso Are we similarly more sensitive to zzso zzso than metric zzso differences of the relations between objects? We addressed this question with sets of scene triplets that could, from a reference or zzso scene zzso a brick slightly separated from a zzso undergo a zzso zzso change zzso the brick attached to the zzso or an zzso zzso change zzso the brick further separated from the zzso zzso both zzso variations were matched in physical zzso using zzso energy and the zzso system, a model of zzso zzso In an zzso staircase zzso zzso subjects required more than double the presentation zzso for detecting differences in zzso than zzso relations to achieve equivalent levels of zzso In two zzso experiments, zzso changes consistently produced greater responses in the lateral zzso zzso zzso but not in earlier zzso zzso compared to zzso changes, implicating zzso as the potential neural locus for where the greater zzso of the differences of zzso than zzso is made zzso zzso a model of cell tuning in zzso zzso visual areas, did not consistently reflect the marked zzso advantage witnessed in behavioral performance and in zzso zzso
