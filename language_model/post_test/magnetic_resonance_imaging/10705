The objective of this study is to determine the relation between the size of the corpus zzso zzso and motor performance in a zzso cohort of zzso zzso zzso born children zzso zzso zzso with a zzso age less than or equal to 32 weeks and/or a birth weight below 1500 g were eligible for this zzso At the age of 7 or 8 years, zzso middle, zzso and total areas zzso of the corpus zzso were measured on true zzso zzso Due to anxiety of 10 children and motion artifacts in 7 other children, 204 zzso could be assessed in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso weeks, zzso zzso zzso 1200 zzso zzso zzso The zzso group consisted of 15 children with cerebral zzso zzso and 189 children without zzso Motor function was established by using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, and the zzso Test of Visual Motor zzso was zzso The same examinations were performed in 21 term born zzso The mean total zzso zzso area was significantly smaller in zzso born infants compared with their term born controls zzso zzso versus 422 zzso P zzso zzso The zzso children with zzso had significantly smaller mean zzso areas compared with the zzso who did not develop zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso born without zzso also had significantly smaller body, zzso and total zzso areas compared with term born controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only the difference in frontal area zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso zzso zzso zzso The association existed in all parts of the zzso but increased in the direction of the zzso part: zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso zzso An association between zzso area and its zzso and the standard scores of the zzso was also zzso A larger zzso was strongly related zzso o better scores zzso zzso test total area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for zzso age, birth weight, and total cerebral area, these associations were still zzso There is a strong association between the size of the corpus zzso zzso zzso cross area as well as zzso middle, and zzso zzso and motor function in zzso children, investigated at school zzso A poorer score on the Movement ABC was related to a smaller zzso A larger zzso was strongly associated with better zzso standard zzso
