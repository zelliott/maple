Four patients with zzso and four with zzso were studied by median nerve zzso evoked zzso The peripheral zzso zzso and the zzso time between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and cervical zzso were normal in both zzso In zzso the cortical components were absent on the zzso zzso but normal on the healthy side, whereas in zzso an zzso prolonged zzso wave was recorded zzso The difference presumably relates to the absence of normal cortical zzso in zzso and to the presence of a zzso zzso in zzso
