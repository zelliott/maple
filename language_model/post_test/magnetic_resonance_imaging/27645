An zzso model consists of a set of agents representing the components of a zzso These agents interact with each other according to rules designed with knowledge of the system in zzso Although rules control the low-level interactions of agents, these models often exhibit emergent behavior at the system zzso We apply the zzso modeling framework to functional brain imaging zzso In this model, agents are defined by network zzso and represent brain regions, and links representing functional connectivity between zzso dictate which agents zzso A link between two regions may be positive or negative, depending on the correlation in functional activity between the two zzso Agents are either active or zzso and systematically update based on the activity of their immediate zzso Their dynamics are observed over a certain time period starting from predetermined initial zzso While the information received by each zzso is limited by the number of other zzso connected to it, we have shown that this model is capable of producing emergent behavior dependent on global information zzso Specifically, the system is capable of solving zzso test problems, such as the density zzso and synchronization zzso The model is capable of producing a wide range of behaviors varying greatly in complexity, including zzso with cycles ranging from a few steps to zzso and zzso patterns over hundreds of thousands of time zzso We believe this wide dynamic range may impart the potential for this system to produce a myriad of zzso functional zzso
