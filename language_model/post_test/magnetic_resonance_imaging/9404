This study examines whether differences in late-life well-being are linked to how older adults zzso emotionally zzso zzso Using zzso with 39 older adults varying in life satisfaction, we examined how viewing positive and negative images would affect zzso and connectivity of an zzso zzso Participants engaged most regions within this network more robustly for positive than for negative images, but within the zzso this effect was moderated by life satisfaction, with individuals higher in satisfaction showing lower levels of activity during the processing of positive zzso Participants high in satisfaction showed stronger correlations among network zzso between the zzso and other emotion processing zzso viewing positive, as compared with negative, zzso Participants low in satisfaction showed no zzso zzso zzso suggest that late-life satisfaction is linked with how zzso regions are engaged and connected during processing of zzso zzso This first demonstration of a link between neural recruitment and late-life well-being suggests that differences in neural network zzso and connectivity may account for the preferential zzso of positive information seen in some older zzso
