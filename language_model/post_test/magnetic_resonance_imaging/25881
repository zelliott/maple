Thirty-one patients were investigated with magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the lower abdomen before and after the administration of zzso zzso zzso solution per zzso or per zzso or from both routes for the zzso of the zzso zzso The parameters evaluated were: zzso contrast medium distribution, zzso degree of filling of the zzso zzso zzso contrast between the zzso zzso and the surrounding normal or pathological structures, and zzso whether the administration of the contrast agent improved the diagnostic ability of MR compared to zzso zzso zzso or plain MR of the same zzso zzso at a concentration of 1 zzso produced a positive signal irrespective of its dilution in the zzso and good contrast between the zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso or any possible pathological zzso From the diagnostic point of view, after the administration of contrast zzso MR is comparable to CT and much superior to plain zzso It is concluded that zzso of the zzso with zzso solution will improve the diagnostic yield of MR imaging of the lower zzso
