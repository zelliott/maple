In an exploration of the schizophrenia spectrum, the authors compared zzso size, shape, and zzso activity in zzso patients with schizophrenia and zzso personality disorder to findings in zzso and zzso healthy control zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained in 27 schizophrenic patients, 13 patients with zzso personality disorder, and 32 control subjects who performed a serial verbal learning test during zzso zzso After zzso edges were outlined on zzso zzso scans, a zzso zzso program yielded significance probability mapping in three zzso 

zzso probability mapping (with zzso identified an area in the region of the zzso nucleus zzso with significantly lower relative metabolism in the schizophrenia group than in either the control or zzso personality disorder groups, which did not differ from each zzso The three groups did not differ significantly in total zzso volume in square zzso or zzso volume relative to brain zzso Shape analyses revealed that schizophrenic patients had significantly fewer zzso in the left anterior region, whereas patients with zzso personality disorder had significantly fewer zzso in the region of the right zzso nucleus than did control zzso 

zzso patients showed significant metabolism and shape differences from control subjects in selective zzso of the thalamus, whereas patients with zzso personality disorder showed only a difference in zzso Because the zzso and anterior zzso have different connections with zzso and prefrontal structures, the anterior zzso shrinkage and zzso zzso and shape changes might relate to the different clinical pictures in zzso personality disorder and zzso
