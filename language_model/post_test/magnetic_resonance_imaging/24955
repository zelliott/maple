To estimate the value of zzso zzso in determining the side of seizure onset for zzso assessment in patients with zzso lobe zzso The zzso value of zzso protocols was evaluated for all patients and in zzso depending on surgical outcome with regard to seizure control, speech dominance, zzso and need for zzso zzso zzso 

A battery of zzso procedures was carried out preoperatively in 125 patients who underwent left zzso zzso zzso or right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to find sets of variables that allowed the best prediction of the side of seizure onset zzso to be the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso tests and Wada zzso showed the highest zzso zzso zzso for all patients, zzso in zzso patients, zzso in patients not rendered seizure free, zzso in left speech patients, zzso in zzso speech patients, zzso in patients with zzso zzso sclerosis zzso zzso in zzso patients, zzso in patients who underwent zzso zzso recordings, and zzso in those who did zzso 

The zzso value zzso of zzso protocols appears similar to that of other tests widely accepted for zzso zzso and zzso scalp zzso and zzso Attention should be paid to zzso results, particularly from the Wada test, during zzso assessment of zzso lobe zzso as they can provide strong support for findings from other zzso tests, particularly in patients with presumed zzso or in zzso zzso
