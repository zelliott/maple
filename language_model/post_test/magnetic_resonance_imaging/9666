Recent studies have reported that the insular zzso is involved in the zzso of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso However, specific zzso abnormalities of the insular zzso remain zzso In this study, we examined insular cortical volume to determine whether the volume of the anterior and zzso insular zzso of zzso zzso patients differed according to different symptom zzso 

Using magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the gray matter volumes of the insular zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 41 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso and 53 healthy zzso zzso measures of the insular zzso were compared according to different OC zzso zzso anterior and reduced zzso insular zzso were observed in zzso zzso The insular zzso zzso were more significant in zzso patients with zzso checking rather than cleaning symptoms when compared with healthy zzso 

Our results suggest the presence of unbalanced anterior and zzso insular zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso patients and emphasize the distinct role of the insular zzso in different OC zzso We propose that the insular zzso zzso may influence the zzso of zzso processing, the insular functional role, in zzso patients with different zzso
