The human zzso is functionally organized into zzso zzso and zzso zzso which process information related to zzso zzso and motor zzso zzso projections ascending from the zzso provide important zzso input to these zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso of zzso zzso receptors after zzso administration in the functional subdivisions of the human zzso zzso zzso availability zzso was measured with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 14 healthy volunteers under control conditions and after the intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso For each condition, zzso was administered as a zzso zzso followed by constant infusion, and zzso of zzso zzso availability were obtained under sustained binding equilibrium zzso zzso induced a significantly larger reduction in zzso zzso availability zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions compared with zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso analysis were confirmed by a zzso zzso Correction for the partial volume effect showed even greater differences in zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso zzso The increase in euphoria reported by subjects after zzso was associated with larger zzso in the zzso and zzso regions, but not in the zzso zzso These results show significant differences in the zzso response to zzso between the functional subdivisions of the human zzso The mechanisms potentially accounting for these regional differences in zzso zzso release within the zzso remain to be zzso but may be related to the zzso zzso influences zzso the integration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso function via zzso cell territories in the zzso zzso
