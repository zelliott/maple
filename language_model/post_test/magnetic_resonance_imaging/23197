A new class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso contrast agents has been zzso The probe consists of a zzso iron oxide zzso or zzso oxide core coated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso to zzso zzso The zzso modified zzso allow zzso of copper for PET zzso These surface zzso zzso zzso have been characterized by various zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso have been evaluated and compared with the same properties of one of the most commonly zzso zzso contrast agents, zzso zzso this new zzso has a great potential for use in cell tracking with zzso and PET in the absence of zzso zzso It is noteworthy that there is a sharp increase in zzso zzso of these zzso on coordination with zzso zzso Thus these iron oxide zzso can also be explored as the smart magnetic resonance zzso sensor for the detection of zzso changes in copper concentration for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, zzso and Wilson's diseases, zzso lateral sclerosis and prion zzso
