Early studies reported comparative results of functional outcomes between zzso zzso and zzso radical zzso zzso However, zzso zzso prospective studies comparing the outcomes are zzso 

To compare functional outcomes after zzso and zzso performed by a single surgeon, and to identify factors zzso of early return of zzso and zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive patients undergoing zzso between 2007 and 2010 were zzso included and serially followed zzso for comparative zzso 

zzso was performed in zzso patients, and 235 underwent zzso 

zzso was defined as being completely pad zzso zzso was defined as having zzso sufficient for zzso with or without a zzso type 5 zzso zzso and potency recovery were checked serially by interview and questionnaire at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards method analyses was performed to determine zzso factors for early zzso 

After the initial 132 cases, patients who underwent zzso demonstrated faster recovery of urinary zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso recovery was more rapid in the zzso group at all evaluation time points, beginning from the initial zzso In zzso analysis, younger age and longer zzso zzso zzso length seen by prostate magnetic resonance imaging zzso demonstrated statistical significance as independent zzso factors for zzso zzso younger age, surgical method zzso vs zzso and higher zzso serum testosterone were independent zzso factors for potency zzso The limitations of the present study were that it was zzso and used interview to evaluate potency zzso 

Patients after zzso demonstrated superior functional zzso Moreover, zzso zzso length on zzso zzso and patient age were factors independently zzso of zzso recovery, while patient age and higher zzso serum testosterone were independent zzso factors for potency zzso
