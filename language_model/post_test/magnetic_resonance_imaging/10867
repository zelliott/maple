To investigate the ability of high-resolution zzso to determine composition and zzso of zzso in mouse zzso root and zzso zzso 

zzso root and zzso arteries of zzso E knockout zzso mice fed Western diet for 10, 20, or 30 weeks were zzso ex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso Using zzso zzso methods, zzso accurately zzso zzso areas in the zzso root zzso zzso and zzso artery zzso zzso compared with zzso Similarly, zzso caps in zzso roots, zzso by zzso and zzso correlated closely zzso zzso Reconstruction of segmented zzso arteries in zzso provided unique insights into plaque zzso and enabled zzso zzso of plaque and zzso zzso Between 10 and 30 weeks, zzso measurement identified an zzso increase in plaque volume zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso increase in plaque zzso core volume zzso zzso for zzso indicating superior power of zzso zzso 

zzso high-resolution zzso zzso accurately zzso zzso core and zzso cap areas in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Reconstruction and zzso zzso of segmented zzso arteries demonstrated greater sensitivity in detecting changes in plaque size and zzso composition over time than zzso zzso
