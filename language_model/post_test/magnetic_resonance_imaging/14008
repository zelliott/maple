zzso zzso zzso is an approach to the treatment of brain tumors especially in poorly accessible zzso Its clinical zzso with tumor cell destruction has been shown in several zzso However, no data are known about specific effects on tumors cells due to zzso in the time course of the zzso 

zzso was performed in adult Lewis rats with implanted zzso cells in the brain using a standard exposure of 3 W for 30 zzso Before and following zzso zzso zzso were monitored by zzso zzso of implanted cells and zzso were assessed by several zzso techniques and zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso 

Our experiments show a destruction of zzso cells by zzso but surviving tumor cells at the margin of the zzso zzso was detected following zzso restricted to residual zzso zzso Marginal survival of tumor cells lead to a secondary outgrowth into the zzso zzso adjacent to zzso zzso 

zzso is a suitable technique for the treatment of brain zzso However, further investigations are necessary to prevent tumor zzso after zzso
