zzso figurative language, such as zzso is unique in that it requires one to make associations between words and zzso zzso that are zzso zzso At the neural level, processing idiomatic phrases has been linked to recruitment of bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso zzso the left zzso cortex, superior zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the left inferior frontal zzso zzso This functional zzso study examined the brain responses associated with processing idiomatic compared to literal zzso In addition, gender differences in neural responses associated with language comprehension were also zzso In an zzso zzso zzso healthy adult volunteers viewed sentences that were either literal or idiomatic in nature, and answered subsequent comprehension zzso This sentence comprehension tasks activated mainly prefrontal language areas zzso zzso and zzso zzso with previous findings, idiomatic sentences showed increased response in zzso These results are discussed in the backdrop of the graded zzso zzso Furthermore, we found gender differences in brain zzso and functional connectivity during this zzso Women showed greater overall zzso than men when zzso literal and idiomatic zzso whereas men had significantly greater functional connectivity between zzso and zzso than women across zzso Overall, the findings of this study highlight the gender differences in neural responses associated with figurative language zzso
