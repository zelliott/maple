zzso networks supporting zzso of new information are affected early in the course of zzso disease zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies in zzso have reported decreased zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso when comparing novel versus repeated zzso It is, however, unclear whether this finding is related to a failure of normal suppression of zzso activity to repeated stimuli in zzso 

zzso healthy older subjects zzso a comparison group zzso and 15 mild zzso patients underwent zzso during an zzso memory paradigm in an academic medical zzso The task consisted of blocks of Novel and zzso zzso pairs and visual zzso To reveal neural zzso of processing repeatedly presented zzso zzso blocks were contrasted to zzso 

zzso patients demonstrated greater zzso during zzso stimuli in the zzso and in prefrontal and superior zzso zzso compared with zzso In contrast, OC showed greater zzso zzso zzso than zzso Increased zzso activity during zzso was correlated with more impaired zzso zzso and poorer performance of the zzso recognition memory test of zzso the zzso zzso 

Reduction of zzso activity to repeated zzso which become highly zzso to healthy zzso was impaired in zzso This abnormal increased zzso zzso was related to disrupted zzso zzso and to poor recognition memory zzso These preliminary results suggest that the typical episodic memory impairment seen in mild zzso may manifest as a failure of normal repetition suppression and loss of zzso zzso in the zzso memory zzso
