In this study, we reviewed the findings of diagnostic imaging of cerebral vascular anomalies classified as cerebral cavernous zzso zzso zzso zzso anomalies zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we described the imaging findings of cavernous zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has 2 zzso a sporadic form characterized by isolated zzso and a familial form characterized by multiple zzso with an zzso dominant mode of zzso Furthermore, zzso are divided into 4 categories on the basis of magnetic resonance zzso signal zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In general, the zzso is zzso or zzso or has a core of zzso signal intensity surrounded by a zzso rim on conventional zzso zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of a cluster of zzso zzso that zzso into a collecting zzso resulting in the typical zzso zzso appearance of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso images show flow voids and zzso artifact produced by the collecting vein of a zzso and by the large zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging is useful for the assessment of zzso features of zzso In some cases, changes in zzso signal intensity within the drainage territory of the zzso are identified on zzso image and zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso are small zzso and tend to appear as faintly zzso regions on zzso image and faintly enhanced regions with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso imaging zzso characteristically show this zzso as a zzso zzso zzso is a novel imaging technique that exploits phase shifts to maximize sensitivity to differences between magnetic zzso between adjacent zzso This technique is widely used with zzso MR zzso zzso has improved the diagnosis of zzso brain zzso cerebrovascular disease, degenerative disease, zzso zzso is superior to zzso zzso imaging for determining zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso for determining the number of zzso zzso is significantly higher than that of zzso zzso zzso
