In zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso studies of zzso humans have demonstrated significant zzso abnormalities that vary by brain region, but the causes are poorly zzso zzso changes in the frontal cortex, zzso zzso and white matter in 18 zzso zzso were investigated using MRS during the first month of zzso 

Changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso both in absolute terms and relative to the zzso zzso Most abnormalities were observed at the time of peak zzso 2 weeks post infection zzso At that time point, significant decreases in zzso and zzso reflecting zzso injury, were observed only in the frontal zzso zzso was significantly elevated only in the white zzso Changes in zzso and zzso were similar across the brain regions, increasing at 2 zzso and falling below baseline levels at 4 zzso zzso and zzso levels were increased across all brain zzso 

These data best support the hypothesis that different brain regions have variable intrinsic vulnerabilities to zzso injury caused by the AIDS zzso
