zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate local zzso acid zzso in brain tissue surrounding focal zzso 

PET using zzso oxygen and water for measuring cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso zzso for determination of blood volume zzso and calculation of oxygen extraction zzso and zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso acid zzso was applied in 14 patients zzso age, 52 zzso zzso zzso with acute zzso zzso zzso Two zzso PET studies were completed, the first 8 to 24 hours after onset of neurological symptoms and the follow-up study 14 zzso 1 days after the zzso zzso zzso changes were compared with zzso damage on zzso CT or zzso zzso matching and volume of interest evaluation procedures were used to study zzso zzso in relation to various zzso variables in zzso and zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso mirror regions, initially increased regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was found in zzso areas in the immediate vicinity of zzso as well as in distant areas within the same zzso In those areas, regional zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and oxygen extraction fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were highly zzso and regional zzso was preserved or slightly reduced zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso data comprised severely zzso as well as high values zzso to zzso zzso g per zzso zzso CT and zzso zzso in five patients demonstrated preserved zzso In all zzso areas zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed a positive correlation with delta zzso as the relative improvement of zzso zzso between the two PET studies zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Particularly in areas with increased oxygen extraction fraction zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed a mild correlation with zzso at follow-up measurement zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In all zzso areas, zzso zzso showed a negative correlation with oxygen extraction fraction zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a positive correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In all zzso and zzso areas, zzso initial zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso at follow-up zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso increases of zzso zzso seen in this study were generally zzso They might be seen in the core of zzso indicating breakdown of the zzso barrier with poor tissue zzso but they also frequently occurred during or after zzso compromise in surviving brain tissue surrounding focal cerebral zzso perhaps representing zzso of zzso acid transport or protein synthesis in brain tissue with a favorable zzso
