We evaluated the zzso and clinical value of zzso findings including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intensity zzso and instability in patients with traumatic central zzso syndrome without evidence of fracture and zzso 

The zzso and clinical findings of 23 patients who had undergone surgery between 1996 and 2002 were reviewed zzso All of the patients underwent dynamic motion study and magnetic resonance zzso imaging after zzso zzso status was evaluated with American Spinal zzso Association motor score zzso and zzso and compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and fusion were performed in 12 patients with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso was done for 11 cases of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was found in 17 zzso Among them, instability was revealed in 11 zzso There was significant correlation between zzso zzso and instability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in varying degrees in all patients on MR zzso zzso zzso intensity was found preoperatively in 19 zzso of 23 patients, and it was revealed at the most compressed level of the spinal zzso in all zzso The zzso level was consistent with the level of instability zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean American Spinal zzso Association motor scores in patients with instability were lower than in those without instability zzso zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso influenced the zzso status of the zzso The instability was significantly associated with poor prognosis for zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso MR imaging may be a possible indicator of instability in patients with central zzso syndrome after zzso zzso
