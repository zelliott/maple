Military personnel involved in Operations zzso Freedom and Iraqi Freedom zzso commonly experience zzso mild to moderate traumatic brain injury zzso In this study, we used zzso functional zzso zzso to determine if zzso zzso has a differential impact on brain zzso in comparison with zzso caused primarily by mechanical forces in civilian zzso Four groups zzso zzso zzso military zzso zzso zzso zzso military controls zzso zzso zzso zzso civilian zzso zzso zzso and zzso civilian controls zzso zzso with orthopedic zzso zzso to moderate zzso zzso occurred 1 to 6 years before zzso Participants completed the Stop Signal Task zzso a measure of zzso control, while undergoing zzso Brain zzso was evaluated with 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso corrected for multiple zzso During correct zzso zzso zzso was lower in the zzso than zzso subjects in regions commonly associated with zzso control and the default mode zzso In contrast, zzso failures showed significant interaction effects in the bilateral inferior zzso left superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso group demonstrated more zzso than the zzso group when failing to zzso in contrast, the zzso group exhibited less zzso than the zzso zzso zzso analyses controlling for the effects of education and zzso psychological symptoms did not alter the brain zzso zzso These results indicate that the chronic effects of zzso are associated with abnormal brain zzso during successful response zzso During failed zzso the pattern of zzso distinguished military from civilian zzso suggesting that zzso zzso has a unique effect on brain function that can be distinguished from zzso resulting from mechanical forces associated with sports or motor vehicle zzso The implications of these findings for diagnosis and treatment of zzso are zzso
