To evaluate the accuracy of the acoustic reflection zzso technique for determination of zzso cavity zzso areas, the zzso function of both sides of the nose was determined in 10 subjects and compared with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso variation for the correlation between zzso and zzso was seen, but in general the areas from 1 to 6 zzso into the zzso cavity measured by zzso were larger than areas measured by zzso especially where the surface was most zzso The total volume for this region was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso It was demonstrated that this could be due to errors in calculation of the areas on the basis of zzso and zzso In the zzso part of the zzso cavity and the zzso there was a convincingly higher correlation between acoustic zzso and a scan perpendicular to the assumed geometrical axis of the zzso than between acoustic zzso and zzso zzso This indicates that the sound axis roughly follows the geometrical zzso In a model of two tubes zzso zzso joined in a larger tube (the zzso closure of the zzso part of the latter revealed that the zzso zzso cavity is likely to cause zzso of the zzso part of the zzso during zzso compared with zzso
