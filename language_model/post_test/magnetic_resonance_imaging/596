zzso zzso zzso is a common, largely genetically determined, rheumatic disease that is zzso by spinal inflammation and new bone zzso However, the exact zzso and pathology are still not zzso 

To zzso tissue obtained at spinal surgery by zzso and compare the zzso of patients with AS to those with degenerative disc disease zzso 

zzso and soft tissue specimens of 30 patients with AS and 20 with zzso were obtained during spinal zzso from different zzso regions including zzso and zzso zzso zzso ligaments and zzso zzso zzso was performed with established markers for zzso K, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso K and zzso cells were only observed in AS zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were detected at zzso processes adjacent to zzso zzso zzso was expressed in smaller zzso cells attached to zzso Invasion of bone by zzso cells was seen at zzso zzso In the zzso zzso most zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso cells expressing these zzso zzso found in zzso never showed signs of zzso No differences were found for zzso between AS and zzso Clear expression of zzso zzso was only detected in one patient with zzso 

zzso K is strongly expressed in different regions of the spine in zzso zzso K was mainly expressed by zzso cells, zzso cells and cells attached to bone and at sites of bone zzso suggestive of high zzso zzso This supports the role of persistent inflammation in the zzso of zzso How these changes relate to zzso remains to be zzso
