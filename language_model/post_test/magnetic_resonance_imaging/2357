zzso zzso is associated with enhanced zzso injury in the zzso rat zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the zzso zzso of brain injury is associated with enhanced generation of zzso zzso in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery zzso (2 zzso followed by zzso (2 zzso zzso resonance images revealed the zzso of focal brain injury in zzso zzso The zzso zzso method was used in conjunction with zzso to continuously estimate zzso radical production by measurement of the stable zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso during zzso In zzso rats, from a mean baseline level of 130 zzso zzso levels surged to peak levels of zzso zzso 45 zzso into zzso and to 197 zzso zzso zzso into the zzso period, returning to baseline by 2 h into zzso A similar zzso profile was observed in zzso rats, except that absolute zzso levels were higher zzso zzso at zzso 317 zzso peak during zzso zzso zzso peak during zzso and levels remained significantly high zzso zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso radical is an important contributor to the zzso of zzso and cerebrovascular injury after focal zzso in zzso zzso
