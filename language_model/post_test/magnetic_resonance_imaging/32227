Recent developments in imaging and computer power have led to the ability to acquire large three zzso data sets for target zzso and complex treatment planning for radiation zzso Conventional simulation implies the use of a machine capable of the same mechanical movements as treatment zzso Images obtained from these machines are essentially two zzso with the facility to acquire a limited number of zzso slices to provide patient contours and tissue density zzso The recent zzso of cone beam imaging on zzso has transformed them into three zzso imaging devices able to produce the data required for complex treatment zzso The introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the 1970s was a zzso in imaging and its potential use in zzso was quickly zzso However, it remained a predominantly diagnostic tool until modifications were introduced to meet the needs of zzso and software was developed to perform the simulation zzso The zzso of conventional and virtual simulation has been the subject of a number of studies at different disease zzso The development of different cross zzso imaging zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso has provided additional information that can be incorporated into the simulation software by image fusion and has been shown to aid in the zzso of zzso Challenges still remain, particularly in zzso moving zzso Fast zzso scanning protocols freeze patient and organ motion in time and space, which may lead to inaccuracy in both target zzso and the choice of margins in three zzso Breath holding and gated zzso techniques have been demonstrated to produce zzso data sets that can be used to reduce margins or to minimize dose to normal tissue or zzso at zzso Image guided zzso is being developed to address the zzso movement of both target volumes and critical normal zzso zzso method of zzso and simulation is adopted, the role of quality control is important for the overall accuracy of the patient's treatment and must be adapted to reflect the networked nature of the zzso
