To assess the value of an interactive zzso method for detecting the offending vessels in zzso zzso syndrome in patients with facial zzso and zzso zzso Computer graphics models are created by fusion of fast imaging employing zzso acquisition and magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso and fast imaging employing zzso acquisition were performed preoperatively in 17 patients with zzso zzso syndromes zzso spasm, zzso zzso 10; zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) using a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Computer graphics models were created with computer software and observed zzso for detection of offending vessels by zzso enlargement, reduction, and zzso on a graphic zzso zzso images were reviewed by 2 zzso blinded to the clinical details, and 2 zzso predicted the offending vessel with the interactive zzso method before zzso zzso from the 2 imaging approaches were compared with surgical zzso The vessels identified during surgery were assumed to be the true offending zzso 

zzso vessels were identified correctly in 16 of 17 patients zzso using the interactive zzso method and in 10 of 17 patients using zzso zzso These data demonstrated a significant difference zzso zzso zzso by zzso exact zzso 

The interactive zzso method data corresponded well with surgical findings zzso field, offending vessels, and zzso zzso reality zzso computer graphics using fusion magnetic resonance zzso and fast imaging employing zzso acquisition may be helpful for zzso zzso
