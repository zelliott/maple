An zzso system for the zzso G frame was constructed to enable accurate placement of the frame for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and successful zzso zzso The zzso prevents inaccurate placement of the zzso box on the patient's head and prevents contact of the frame holder with the patient's shoulder while in the zzso zzso It also helps to ensure optimal positioning of desired targets within the three-dimensional zzso space defined by the zzso 

The zzso is made of transparent acrylic plates, which simulate the zzso box that is attached to the frame for the zzso zzso zzso zzso An air cuff at the top supports the frame at any desired height and makes minute adjustments zzso Side cuffs help to keep the frame at the desired position from right to zzso zzso attached to the frame for the anterior zzso plate prevent potential contact of the plate with the anterior posts and help avoid a poor fit caused by zzso of the frame from excessive zzso on the zzso fixation zzso zzso for the zzso frame holder on the foot screws predict potential collision of the holder with the patient's shoulder before actually applying the holder on the zzso The zzso shows the range and limits of the zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso system has been used effectively in more than 89 zzso functional zzso zzso These include zzso zzso zzso of deep brain zzso and zzso of depth zzso It has functioned well and has facilitated excellent operative results in these zzso 

This simple frame zzso eliminates the need for zzso of the zzso frame and additional imaging studies, thus providing successful and appropriate frame placement for zzso zzso
