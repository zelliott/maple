Although the literature on degenerative disease of the cervical spine contains numerous articles studying the changes on levels adjacent to a fusion, there exist very few such studies concerning cervical spine stabilization for zzso 

Over a 16-year period zzso one hundred and twelve patients underwent stabilization of the lower cervical spine zzso for zzso cervical spine injuries, either with an anterior or zzso zzso or zzso Eighty-one patients with adequate follow-up were included in the study and 3 groups were zzso Group A, consisting of 8 patients who underwent anterior stabilization and developed zzso Level zzso Development zzso Group B, zzso 53 patients who were zzso zzso but who did not develop zzso and Group C, zzso 20 patients who received zzso zzso 

Eight out of 61 patients zzso who were zzso operated developed zzso in 11 adjacent levels zzso zzso Severe zzso 3) zzso was noted in zzso patients at the zzso adjacent level, and in zzso patients at the zzso zzso Three out of 8 patients presented with early zzso at 3, 4 and 18 months zzso Despite the zzso abnormalities showing zzso all the patients had an uncomplicated course without zzso All the zzso of Group B and Group C patients demonstrated grade 0 zzso for both the zzso and zzso adjacent zzso 

zzso zzso in cervical spine injuries may appear very early in the zzso period and it can have a different course than in the degenerative disc disease population, at least in some zzso The first zzso level adjacent to a fusion appears to be at greater zzso However, even when zzso is evident zzso it very rarely produces any zzso
