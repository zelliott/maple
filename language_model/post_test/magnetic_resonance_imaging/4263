zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are rare benign zzso tumors, and the standards for diagnosis and treatment still remain zzso Usually zzso is an indication for zzso due to its tendency to bleed and to zzso zzso on the contrary, may be treated zzso zzso differential diagnosis is, however, difficult, often zzso 

zzso patients with presumed zzso zzso and/or zzso were studied at our department from 1984 to zzso zzso assessment included clinical evaluation and symptoms, laboratory tests, liver zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso and zzso Thirteen patients had a presumed diagnosis of zzso 16 of zzso and 9 of zzso benign zzso 27 had zzso zzso (3 with zzso zzso and 11 were not operated on and are actually under a strict follow-up zzso 

The final diagnosis was 19 zzso and 19 zzso (2 of which contained areas of zzso zzso diagnosis was confirmed in zzso of zzso Use of oral zzso abdominal symptoms, and zzso liver test results were frequent in patients with zzso There were no deaths after zzso All zzso patients were tumor free during the zzso and in 10 of the 11 zzso cases, the size of the zzso remained zzso We conclude that precise diagnosis of these benign liver tumors remains difficult and sometimes impossible, despite new imaging zzso zzso zzso can be performed under very safe zzso zzso surgery may play a role in selected zzso zzso and uncertain cases are clear indications for zzso Only when a diagnosis of zzso can be firmly confirmed in zzso patients is strict observation without surgery zzso
