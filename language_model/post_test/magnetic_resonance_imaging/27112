The aim of this study was to compare zzso duct zzso zzso depicted by magnetic resonance imaging zzso with TD zzso described in the anatomical zzso 

zzso zzso were acquired with a three-dimensional zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso with a two-dimensional prospective acquisition correction zzso technique in 63 zzso We found with zzso that TD displacement occurred more on the left side than that reported in the anatomical literature, and this tendency was more marked in elderly zzso In patients with marked zzso TD zzso the TD zzso on zzso was compared to the descending zzso zzso on chest zzso The degree of correspondence between the zzso findings and the anatomical literature was assessed by a zzso zzso test, and P zzso zzso indicated a significant zzso The degree of similarity was determined between TD zzso and zzso zzso by Kendall's zzso of zzso zzso 

On zzso scans the TD was often located to the left of the zzso line compared to the location reported in the anatomical literature zzso zzso zzso Nine patients had marked zzso TD zzso a zzso similar to that of the descending zzso zzso zzso zzso however, no association with age was zzso 

The TD zzso depicted by zzso differed from that described in the anatomical zzso
