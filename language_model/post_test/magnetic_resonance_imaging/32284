zzso of cortical development can cause zzso activity and zzso zzso yet zzso zzso of jerks can be difficult to zzso 

We studied a woman who had frequent episodes of persistent zzso jerking since zzso zzso and zzso zzso had shown no zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging experiments were performed with concurrent video monitoring to document the timing of foot zzso These studies mapped brain regions controlling voluntary zzso and zzso movements, and spontaneous zzso zzso 

zzso structural MR imaging revealed a zzso zzso extending zzso off the left central zzso zzso analysis of spontaneous jerks revealed prominent zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso motor zzso bilateral zzso frontal regions zzso motor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso response modeling to foot jerks revealed the zzso response peaked earlier in the zzso zzso and zzso regions than in the foot zzso 

zzso zzso in a patient with spontaneous and induced zzso foot jerks revealed brain regions active during zzso The results of this analysis allowed us to tailor subsequent zzso zzso Analysis of the timing of the zzso response showed certain brain regions with an earlier rise in zzso zzso suggesting a possible initiating role, or different zzso response zzso zzso response timing should be considered carefully when interpreting zzso studies of zzso zzso
