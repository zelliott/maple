Deep brain stimulation zzso together with concurrent zzso recording has shown promise in the treatment of zzso A novel device is capable of combining these 2 functions and may prove valuable in the treatment of zzso in zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso in dogs has not yet been zzso 

To evaluate the feasibility and safety of zzso stimulating and recording zzso in the brain of normal dogs using the zzso system and to evaluate the function of a novel zzso and recording zzso 

Four male intact zzso confirmed to be normal by clinical and zzso examinations and zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso imaging of the brain was performed after attachment of zzso zzso zzso scans were used to calculate zzso for zzso placement in the zzso and zzso which was performed via zzso hole zzso zzso CT scanning was performed to evaluate zzso location and accuracy of placement was zzso zzso zzso examinations were performed to evaluate zzso deficits and zzso recordings obtained to evaluate the effects of zzso 

zzso were successfully placed in 3 of 4 dogs with a mean accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings showed evoked zzso in response to stimulation with a zzso variation in zzso zzso No zzso deficits were seen in any zzso 

zzso placement of zzso is safe and feasible in the zzso The development of a novel device capable of providing simultaneous zzso and zzso recording potentially represents a major advance in the treatment of zzso
