To assess the correlation of zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso findings with the severity of acute zzso deficit and their ability to predict short and long-term clinical outcomes of zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to predict the outcome was compared with the ability of clinical stroke scales to predict the zzso 

Forty-eight patients with acute stroke underwent diffusion zzso and zzso on the first and eighth day after the zzso Clinical and functional scales were carried out before each scan and 3 months after the zzso 

The volumes of both the zzso and the zzso zzso correlated well with the acute zzso deficit and the final zzso The first day zzso zzso zzso zzso and the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso scores zzso zzso zzso correlated well with the final zzso However, in zzso zzso analysis, only the zzso score at the acute stage was the only independent predictor of the long-term clinical zzso 

While the zzso and zzso zzso volumes correlated well with the outcome of the stroke, the imaging zzso did not improve the zzso power over plain clinical stroke scale zzso
