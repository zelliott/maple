zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of brain function is used in zzso to gain insight into the mechanisms of neural recovery following neurological injuries such as zzso The behavioral zzso involving the use of force motor tasks zzso in the scanner often lack the ability to control details of motor zzso They are often limited by zzso lack of zzso and complexity that may exclude evaluation of patients with poor zzso In this paper we describe a novel MR compatible wrist device that is capable of measuring zzso forces generated at the hand and joint moments along wrist zzso and wrist zzso zzso zzso Joint moments measured by the system can be visually displayed to the individual and used during target matching block or event related zzso Through a small set of pilot testing both inside and outside the MR environment, we have found that the force tracking tasks and performance in the scanner are zzso and that high quality force and moment recordings can be made during zzso studies without compromising the zzso zzso Furthermore, the device recordings are extremely sensitive making it possible for individuals with poor hand and wrist function to be zzso
