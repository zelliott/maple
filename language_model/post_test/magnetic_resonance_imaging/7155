The effectiveness of synthetic vaccines is dependent upon the chance event that zzso formed against largely zzso peptides can bind native protein surfaces which are often zzso To improve on this situation, new methods are being developed for the zzso restriction of synthetic zzso zzso zzso sequences often form predictable secondary structures in proteins characterized by distinct zzso zzso These weak hydrogen bonds have now been replaced with zzso mimics to zzso restrict selected peptides to the Type 1 reverse turn and alpha zzso Potential uses for this chemistry are discussed in the context of malaria zzso The zzso component of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso These studies are consistent with the formation of zzso ordered zzso structures which provide a guide for the design and synthesis of a zzso restricted synthetic zzso To assess the effects of zzso restriction and chemical modification on the zzso zzso zzso zzso were linked around zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to this shaped zzso show a strong zzso with living zzso
