To assess bone mineral density zzso at zzso spine and hip in a large cohort of patients with early inflammatory back pain zzso suggestive of zzso zzso zzso and to assess systemic and bone inflammation zzso to zzso as risk factors of low zzso 

332 zzso zzso patients with zzso suggestive of zzso zzso defined by zzso or Berlin criteria were zzso they had zzso spine and hip zzso and body composition zzso Low zzso was defined by zzso (at least one zzso zzso biological zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso protein zzso and imaging zzso spine and zzso joint zzso parameters were compared in patients with and without low zzso zzso zzso parameters in zzso analysis were tested in zzso zzso 

Patients zzso age zzso zzso had a short duration of zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso fulfilled the Assessment of zzso International Society criteria for zzso zzso and zzso was present in zzso 43 zzso had low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that parameters significantly associated with low zzso zzso zzso were the presence of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and male gender zzso zzso zzso 

This study conducted in a large cohort of young adults with early zzso suggestive of zzso shows that zzso of patients have a low zzso and that the main risk factor associated with low zzso was inflammation on zzso
