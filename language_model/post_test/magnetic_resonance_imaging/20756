zzso and de zzso zzso in sodium channel genes zzso a variety of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the brain sodium channel zzso have previously been reported to be associated with benign familial zzso infantile seizures, zzso zzso zzso and intractable zzso of zzso 

We evaluated the clinical characteristics in a patient with a zzso complex episodic zzso zzso We screened zzso for zzso and carried out in zzso zzso analyses to study the consequences of the identified zzso We studied the zzso expression of zzso in zzso by zzso zzso 

The patient presented with zzso zzso and variable episodes of zzso zzso headache, and back pain after 18 months of zzso The patient carries a de zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which leads to a pronounced zzso in particular an increased persistent zzso zzso zzso studies suggest a zzso increasing expression of zzso in zzso cell zzso projecting to zzso zzso 

These results can explain a zzso zzso resulting in zzso and other episodic symptoms extending the spectrum of zzso zzso The zzso increasing expression of zzso in zzso may be responsible for the later onset of episodic zzso
