To develop and test an zzso cartilage scoring system for use at the wrist in zzso arthritis zzso 

zzso scans were obtained using a zzso zzso scanner with dedicated wrist zzso in 22 early and 16 established zzso patients plus 22 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso spin echo sequences were zzso Eight wrist zzso were scored for cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso second zzso zzso and third zzso zzso using a system based on the Sharp van der zzso zzso joint space narrowing zzso score by three zzso Fifteen sites at the wrist were also scored for zzso bone zzso and erosion using the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso reliability zzso 1 and 2) for the cartilage score were zzso zzso correlations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso scores zzso zzso were higher in the established zzso group zzso zzso than the early zzso group zzso zzso zzso but early zzso scores did not differ from healthy controls zzso zzso zzso scores correlated with zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and erosion scores zzso zzso for all, and with zzso zzso scores zzso to zzso 

This zzso cartilage score demonstrated excellent reliability when tested in a zzso zzso However, cartilage loss in early zzso could not be distinguished from that seen in healthy zzso
