A review of the existing functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies on reward anticipation in patients with zzso disorder zzso is zzso zzso showed a significant medium effect size zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso in zzso Studies on zzso and trait zzso in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, zzso zzso positively correlated with VS zzso during reward zzso Against the background that zzso may represent an extreme on a zzso of normal zzso the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be zzso We discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which zzso the opposing findings: zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso We conclude that at the present stage the number of existing studies in the healthy population as well as in zzso groups is too small for a final zzso zzso our presented zzso approaches should be understood as an attempt to frame future research directions by generating testable hypotheses and giving practical suggestions for future zzso
