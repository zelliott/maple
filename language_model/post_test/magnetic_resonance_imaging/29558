zzso rat strains exhibit an increased stroke risk and sensitivity, and reduced zzso mechanisms of zzso brain zzso This experiment provides a zzso serial evaluation of neurological deficits and brain injury following middle cerebral artery zzso focal stroke in this high-risk zzso zzso spontaneously zzso zzso spontaneously zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats were evaluated over 28 days using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and diffusion zzso was performed after 1, 10 and 28 days to measure the degree of zzso brain zzso zzso zzso rats receiving the same stroke and other zzso rats receiving sham surgery were used for control zzso zzso deficits were scored after 1, 4, 11, 18 and 28 zzso The degree of brain zzso was practically identical in zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited significantly smaller zzso zzso with neurological function recovering quickly to normal by day 11 in this zzso zzso deficits persisted longer in zzso rats, with function recovering to normal by day 18 zzso zzso deficits in zzso rats persisted the zzso and were observed even after 28 days zzso This increased and prolonged zzso dysfunction exhibited by zzso compared to zzso rats, while exhibiting practically identical degrees of brain zzso reflects the increased stroke risk and sensitivity of this strain and suggests a reduced zzso brain plasticity following zzso zzso the zzso rat provides an enhanced and prolonged functional deficit model that can be used to zzso those zzso targets critical to zzso zzso recovery zzso
