We undertook a retrospective study of children who present with significant zzso of zzso zzso during sleep to examine the clinical spectrum of disorders that present with such an zzso zzso 

zzso status zzso in sleep zzso is an zzso pattern characterized by nearly continuous zzso zzso in slow wave sleep, usually with a frequency of zzso zzso and usually diffuse and bilateral in zzso A variety of zzso and behavioral problems have been associated with this zzso zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of zzso zzso records of patients admitted to University of California, Los Angeles zzso for overnight zzso monitoring during a 5 year zzso zzso clinical and zzso variables were zzso 

zzso records for 102 patients meeting criteria were zzso Clinical information was available for 90 of those zzso zzso of these patients could be diagnosed with zzso syndrome zzso Key findings include: zzso zzso abnormalities were uncommon in our zzso zzso zzso among children who do not fit the specific diagnostic criteria for zzso a zzso index zzso zzso was more likely to be associated with global zzso disturbances than zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Children with generalized zzso were more likely to experience severe or global zzso zzso than those with focal zzso without reaching statistical significance zzso 

zzso of zzso can vary over time between and within patients and clinical status does not always directly correlate with zzso However, the prognosis of zzso is substantially better than zzso and these two disorders could be classified in a zzso manner rather than be seen as two points along a zzso
