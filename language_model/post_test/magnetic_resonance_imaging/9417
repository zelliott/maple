zzso zzso in the vicinity of the motor zzso poses a challenge to all zzso For zzso assessment of eloquent cortical areas, functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is used, whereas zzso direct cortical stimulation zzso is zzso zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso is comparable to zzso in zzso cortical zzso zzso 

To evaluate the reliability of zzso compared with zzso and zzso for zzso zzso planning of centrally located zzso 

In a prospective series, 11 patients zzso zzso years; mean, zzso zzso zzso years, 2 zzso with tumors located in or adjacent to the motor zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso and zzso were applied for zzso assessment of the extent of tumor zzso A zzso zzso data set with superimposed zzso data was integrated in the zzso zzso Brain zzso station for ensuing motor zzso mapping by zzso zzso from zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso During surgery, the coordinates of each zzso site were zzso defined and integrated into zzso A post hoc comparison of the coordinates of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly smaller than those from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso anticipates information usually only enabled by zzso and therefore allows surgical planning in eloquent zzso zzso
