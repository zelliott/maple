zzso with temporary implants may prolong survival in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso but it is associated with relatively high costs and zzso This study reports the time to progression and survival after permanent zzso of zzso seeds for zzso zzso and examines factors zzso of zzso 

Forty patients with zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso plus permanent placement of zzso seeds into the tumor zzso A total dose of 120 to 160 zzso was zzso and patients were followed up with magnetic resonance imaging scans every 2 to 3 zzso 

zzso survival from the time of zzso was 47 weeks, with 7 of 40 patients still alive at a median of 59 weeks after zzso Survival was significantly better for patients younger than 60 years, and a trend for longer survival was demonstrated with gross total zzso and tumors with a low zzso (a nuclear zzso present in all cell cycles of zzso zzso zzso zzso Median time to progression was 25 weeks and, on zzso analysis, was favorably influenced by gross total zzso and patient age younger than 60 zzso After zzso 27 of 30 patients with failure had a local component to the zzso No patient developed symptoms attributable to radiation necrosis or zzso 

Permanent zzso implants for zzso zzso result in survival comparable with that described in previous reports on temporary zzso but with less zzso zzso are most favorable for patients who are younger than 60 years, and who undergo gross total zzso Despite this aggressive treatment, most patients die as a consequence of locally zzso zzso
