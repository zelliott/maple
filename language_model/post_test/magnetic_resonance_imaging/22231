zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso allows the characterization of zzso zzso in the living human zzso Thus far, the zzso and zzso of receptors with PET have been limited to series of two-dimensional zzso image planes of the zzso zzso zzso The development of high-resolution PET has increased the number of planes to approximately 50, zzso an excessive amount of image information from a single zzso The inherent limitations of zzso techniques make them insufficient to zzso and efficiently analyze this cumbersome amount of zzso In the present communication we describe procedures to zzso and zzso in three dimensions zzso the total image information from the compound set of 47 zzso planes of a PET experiment using commercially available zzso zzso computer graphic and volume rendering techniques were used to analyze and display the zzso For the experimental application the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso population in the brain of a healthy human zzso zzso images of the zzso binding zzso population were displayed with regard to volume and form in relation to the corresponding zzso structures in the brain reconstructed from MR zzso The zzso technique allowed the inspection of PET signals representing zzso populations in the interior of the zzso as viewed from the zzso zzso zzso and seeding techniques were used to define volumes and zzso Using the PET data and volume zzso the total amount of cerebral zzso zzso and the apparent volume they take into account zzso zzso could he calculated for the first time using an automated zzso The zzso of the healthy subject contained zzso zzso of zzso in a volume of approximately zzso zzso The principles and application of the technical development described offer new dimensions to clinical zzso and should be practically useful for automated quantitative determination of zzso number in brain regions of patients with zzso disorders and in relation to drug zzso
