The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect and delineate the gross zzso volume of head and neck cancer before zzso and to compare the results with those obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso verified zzso cell zzso were investigated by zzso and dynamic zzso prior to zzso The two scans were performed on the same day or on consecutive days, except in one patient in whom they were done 5 days zzso zzso CT or zzso was performed in all zzso The image data sets were zzso both visually and zzso All primary zzso and zzso were delineated automatically by using the 50% threshold of maximum zzso corrected for zzso The mean zzso zzso value zzso and the zzso volumes were evaluated and zzso 

All ten primary zzso were detected by zzso while nine primaries were detected by zzso and CT and/or zzso The zzso zzso tended to be lower than the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso The zzso volumes delineated with zzso were on average 51% larger than the zzso volumes zzso zzso identified zzso zzso zzso zzso while only zzso zzso were detected by zzso and zzso zzso by CT or zzso 

zzso appears promising for the staging of head and neck zzso The biological information provided by both zzso and zzso must be carefully validated before it can be used in clinical routine for radiation treatment zzso More studies are needed to evaluate the differences in volumes and to confirm the clinical potential of both zzso and zzso especially in zzso
