zzso image analysis methods have been developed for the human brain, but such tools still need to be adapted and zzso for quantitative small animal zzso We propose a framework for quantitative anatomical zzso in mouse models of neurological and psychiatric zzso The framework encompasses an zzso space, image acquisition zzso and software tools to register images into this zzso We show that a suite of zzso tools zzso Epstein et zzso zzso designed for human zzso can be incorporated into a pipeline for zzso mouse brain images acquired with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso We present a flexible approach for zzso such zzso zzso zzso and identifying optimal combinations of image channels for particular zzso Brain imaging with zzso zzso and zzso contrasts yielded accuracy in the range of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso but only zzso in white matter zzso and zzso for the zzso The addition of diffusion zzso zzso images improved accuracy for large gray matter structures (by zzso white matter zzso and zzso zzso The use of zzso random field zzso further improved overall accuracy in the zzso strain by zzso so zzso zzso for zzso and zzso reached zzso for white matter zzso for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the zzso pipeline for the widely used zzso strain, and two test strains zzso zzso This approach appears promising for characterizing zzso changes in mouse models of human neurological and psychiatric conditions, and may provide anatomical constraints for other zzso imaging, zzso zzso and molecular zzso This is the first demonstration that multiple MR imaging zzso combined with zzso zzso methods lead to significant improvements in anatomical zzso in the mouse zzso
