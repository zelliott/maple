The diagnosis of a zzso tear may require zzso which is zzso zzso has been used to image the zzso but there are no reliable data on its zzso We performed a prospective study investigating the sensitivity and specificity of zzso in comparison with zzso the final outcome was determined at zzso The study included 35 patients with a mean age of 47 years zzso to zzso There was a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 75 to zzso a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso 70 to zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso This compared zzso with a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso 75 to zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso Given that the sensitivity matched that of zzso we feel that zzso can reasonably be applied to confirm the clinical diagnosis before zzso zzso However, the lower specificity suggests that there is still a need to improve the technique to reduce the number of zzso diagnoses and thus to avoid unnecessary zzso
