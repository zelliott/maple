zzso thickness is considered a potentially relevant marker for neurodegenerative zzso However, the relationship of demographic and vascular risk factors with cortical thickness remains zzso In a zzso sample of zzso zzso elderly persons zzso age zzso zzso we examined aging effects on global and zzso cortical thickness and the relationship with demographic variables and cardiovascular risk zzso We used a validated zzso approach to calculate mean cortical thickness zzso in brain zzso We found that women had a significant thicker zzso than men zzso Further, with increasing age, cortical thickness decreased zzso zzso per year), with the largest age effects for the zzso and zzso zzso and the decrease in the frontal lobe being more apparent in men than in women zzso Additionally, higher education, higher zzso blood pressure and larger zzso volume were related to a larger cortical zzso whilst diabetes zzso and higher HDL cholesterol levels were related to a thinner zzso
