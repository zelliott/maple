zzso and zzso zzso zzso are both debilitating conditions where the underlying genetic zzso is unknown in the majority of zzso We identified a patient with bilateral zzso and absence of the zzso nerves, zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and ear anomalies with a de zzso apparently balanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using FISH and high-resolution zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso has identified a zzso zzso deleted region on the long arm of zzso 14 which includes the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three other patients with zzso deletions involving zzso have been zzso all with bilateral zzso zzso zzso ear anomalies, and a facial zzso similar to our zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso and the severity of the zzso zzso in our patient and the other zzso deletion patients, suggests this zzso region harbors other zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to contribute to the zzso zzso on the basis of its expression pattern and observed zzso zzso zzso In addition, deletion of zzso and zzso is likely to contribute to the abnormal zzso development, and zzso deletion may contribute to the ear and other zzso zzso This indicates that zzso gene deletion may contribute to the zzso features in the zzso deletion zzso
