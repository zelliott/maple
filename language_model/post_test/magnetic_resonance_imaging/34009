The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of MR zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Thirteen patients with zzso zzso tumors were examined by zzso zzso using a zzso acquisition zzso zzso spin echo zzso sequence with a body zzso zzso 

zzso retrograde zzso zzso and zzso completely zzso the entire main pancreatic duct in 12 and in all 13 patients, zzso zzso demonstrated the whole zzso of the zzso zzso in only one zzso zzso depicted the whole of the zzso zzso in all 11 patients who had zzso zzso zzso and zzso source images depicted a zzso duct between the main pancreatic duct and the zzso zzso in 8 and in all 11 patients, zzso zzso depicted zzso projections in the main pancreatic ducts in two zzso zzso source images depicted zzso projections in the main pancreatic ducts or zzso zzso in five zzso 

zzso may be more useful to reveal the main pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso duct between the main pancreatic duct and zzso zzso and zzso projections than zzso in patients with zzso zzso tumors of the zzso
