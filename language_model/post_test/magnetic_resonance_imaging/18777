To investigate the possibility of using combined blood oxygen zzso zzso imaging and zzso imaging zzso to detect pathological and zzso changes in zzso tissue damage of the kidney induced by chronic zzso zzso 

The apparent diffusion zzso zzso and the zzso value within the inner compartments of the zzso of 17 rats with diabetes zzso were compared with the results obtained from a control group (N zzso zzso The influence of dynamic changes of the zzso function on the zzso zzso was evaluated by comparing the zzso values before and after the active reduction of zzso transport by zzso zzso 

All compartments of the diabetic kidney showed significantly zzso zzso zzso lower zzso compared to the control zzso In particular, the very low values in the outer stripe zzso of the outer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated either zzso due to zzso or zzso blood volume zzso zzso imaging of the same area showed significantly lower zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that correlated with pathological findings on zzso The injection of zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in all compartments of both populations while the zzso remained zzso 

zzso imaging appears to be able to depict tissue at risk from zzso by revealing information about the balance between zzso workload and delivery of zzso and thus may reflect a measure of the reserve zzso The diffusion zzso apparently reveal complementary zzso Although zzso imaging is not sensitive to the current energy zzso it appears zzso the pathological changes within the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a sensitive indicator of the severity of zzso zzso
