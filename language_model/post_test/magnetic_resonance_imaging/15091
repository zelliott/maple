The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso thickness in cases of pregnancy with previous zzso section, by zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to correlate precision of zzso zzso thickness with actual measurement of zzso zzso A total of 35 pregnant patients with previous zzso section planned for zzso zzso section, were evaluated zzso Their zzso thickness was measured by zzso and zzso on the day of zzso repeat zzso zzso These zzso were correlated with each other and with zzso thickness measured during zzso repeat zzso section by using a zzso The correlation zzso between zzso thickness measured by zzso and zzso with zzso evaluation with a zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The study concluded that as zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso has better correlation zzso with actual zzso zzso zzso can be considered to be the better zzso for zzso zzso thickness zzso
