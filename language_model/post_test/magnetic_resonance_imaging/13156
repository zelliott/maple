Although some degree of bilateral zzso involvement might be frequent in patients with zzso lobe zzso severe bilateral zzso zzso sclerosis zzso is very zzso We present our experience while treating patients with severe bilateral zzso submitted to invasive zzso 

Nine adult patients were zzso All patients had simple and complex partial zzso All patients had bilateral independent zzso zzso lobe zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed severe bilateral zzso and no other brain zzso All patients had severe verbal and zzso memory zzso All patients were submitted to invasive recordings after bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in all patients on the side suggested by invasive zzso zzso time ranged from 5 to 10 zzso 

zzso zzso showed exclusively unilateral seizure onset in seven zzso in two patients, zzso originating from both zzso zzso were found zzso of them originated from one zzso Five patients were submitted to left and four to right zzso Seven patients were rendered zzso after surgery zzso zzso the other two were rated as Engel zzso There was no additional memory zzso There was no surgical morbidity or zzso zzso examination showed zzso in all zzso 

Good surgical outcome zzso zzso zzso could be obtained even in this apparently zzso group of zzso All patients benefit from the zzso We did not see any cognitive decline in our patients with severe bilateral zzso Patients with severe bilateral zzso would need invasive recordings despite any findings during surface zzso
