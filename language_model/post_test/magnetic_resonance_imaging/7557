To assess knee cartilage quality and zzso knee function, 20 years after injury in anterior cruciate ligament zzso injured zzso 

We examined 32 knees using delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of cartilage zzso 20 years after a complete zzso zzso Only subjects who had zzso with the zzso injury without zzso reconstruction zzso and who presented without zzso signs of zzso zzso at an earlier 16-year zzso were included in this zzso The quality of the central zzso parts of the zzso and lateral zzso cartilage was estimated with zzso zzso These results were compared with corresponding results in 24 healthy individuals, and with the subjects' zzso zzso knee function using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The values of zzso in the zzso and lateral zzso cartilage of the study group zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso not statistically different from those of the healthy reference group zzso and zzso The zzso knee function 20 years after the injury, according to the five zzso of the zzso score, was good, with a mean score of zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso cartilage were correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso who have managed to cope with their zzso injury for 20 years with sustained good zzso knee function also seem to have knee cartilage of good quality, with zzso values not very different from a healthy reference zzso
