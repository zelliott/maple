zzso evidence suggests a role for the zzso not only in long-term memory zzso but also in zzso working memory zzso zzso challenging the view of the zzso as being solely involved in episodic zzso However, zzso involvement reported in some zzso studies using zzso zzso tasks may at least partly reflect incidental zzso zzso To zzso zzso processing and zzso formation we administered a zzso zzso zzso task in an zzso zzso study zzso Each trial of the zzso task consisted of four pairs of faces and houses, which had to be maintained during a delay of 10 zzso This was followed by a probe phase consisting of three zzso presented zzso for each pair participants were to indicate whether it matched one of the pairs of the zzso zzso After zzso an unexpected zzso zzso task was zzso Brain activity during zzso was analyzed based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity predicting zzso success in the absence of successful zzso formation could be zzso Furthermore, regions critical for successful zzso formation for pairs previously correctly processed in zzso were zzso zzso showed that the left zzso zzso including the zzso zzso predicted subsequent accuracy on zzso zzso The right anterior zzso and left inferior frontal zzso in contrast, predicted successful zzso for pairs that were previously correctly classified in the zzso zzso Our results suggest that brain regions associated with zzso zzso processing are involved in successful zzso zzso zzso whereas the anterior zzso and left inferior frontal zzso are involved in successful zzso formation during incidental zzso
