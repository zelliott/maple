Visual function in the fellow eye at the onset of unilateral zzso zzso has not been systematically zzso The authors zzso determined the prevalence of abnormalities in the fellow eyes of the zzso eligible patients entered into the zzso zzso Treatment zzso 

All patients underwent testing of visual zzso contrast sensitivity, color vision, and visual field, as well as magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain and a zzso zzso 

zzso in the fellow eye were found on measurement of visual acuity in zzso contrast sensitivity in zzso color vision in zzso and visual field in zzso of zzso The majority of the fellow eye deficits resolved over several zzso A higher prevalence of zzso changes consistent with zzso of the brain was found in patients with a past history of zzso zzso in the fellow eye compared with patients without such a history zzso zzso zzso Patients with abnormal fellow eyes but no history of previous zzso zzso were no more likely to have clinical zzso zzso zzso or zzso evidence zzso zzso zzso of multiple sclerosis than patients with normal fellow zzso 

The improvement of many of the visual deficits indicates that visual abnormalities detected in the fellow eye at the onset of zzso unilateral zzso zzso may not represent zzso zzso nerve zzso Whether the presence of these deficits is zzso of the development of clinical multiple sclerosis cannot be determined at this zzso
