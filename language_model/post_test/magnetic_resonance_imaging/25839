To evaluate the clinical desired accuracy of the left zzso ejection zzso zzso calculated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Within one to three days post coronary zzso and left zzso zzso adults were studied by MR zzso They had nuclear medicine studies for left zzso ejection zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in end zzso and end zzso in a plane parallel to the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso volumes and ejection zzso were performed using the zzso zzso The zzso calculation by gated zzso were compared with that obtained by zzso and nuclear medicine zzso The linear zzso line obtained for ejection fraction was y zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The above figure indicate a reasonable correlation among these three zzso
