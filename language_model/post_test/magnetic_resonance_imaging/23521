To identify a consistent pattern of brain zzso imaging in primary complex I zzso Complex I zzso a major cause of respiratory chain dysfunction, accounts for various clinical presentations, including Leigh zzso Human complex I comprises seven core zzso zzso by zzso DNA zzso and 38 core zzso zzso by nuclear DNA zzso Moreover, its assembly requires six known and many unknown assembly zzso To date, no correlation between zzso and brain zzso zzso has been found in complex I zzso 

The brain zzso of 30 patients carrying known zzso in genes involved in complex I were zzso collected and compared with the brain zzso of 11 patients carrying known zzso in genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso complex as well as 10 patients with zzso zzso 

All complex I deficient patients showed bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed anomalies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were only observed in complex I deficient patients carrying zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso the isolated zzso images observed in patients with zzso zzso or the corpus zzso zzso observed in zzso deficient patients, were never observed in complex I deficient zzso 

A common pattern of brain zzso imaging was identified with abnormal signal zzso in zzso and zzso zzso with zzso peak as a clue of complex I zzso Combining zzso data with brain imaging may therefore help orient genetic studies in complex I zzso
