To investigate the value of various MR imaging sequences for the assessment of zzso cartilage and to determine the most optional zzso 

MR zzso scanning of knee zzso were performed in nine fresh bovine zzso MR scan sequences consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The signal noise ratio zzso and contrast noise ratio zzso between cartilage and adjacent tissue were calculated and zzso The knees of zzso healthy volunteers were zzso with the selective MR sequences and the zzso zzso and their efficiency were calculated and analyzed zzso 

In bovine knee models, the cartilage zzso was higher in the sequences which attached zzso zzso and zzso than that of without these zzso There was a statistically significant zzso The zzso between cartilage and adjacent tissue was also higher in the zzso In healthy volunteers, the cartilage zzso was better in zzso zzso zzso zzso between cartilage and bone, zzso muscle, fat were better in zzso zzso zzso zzso between cartilage and liquid was better in zzso zzso zzso zzso between cartilage and zzso ligament was better in zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso efficiency were higher in zzso zzso zzso There was a statistical difference between these sequences and others zzso zzso zzso The cartilage zzso and zzso between cartilage and bone, muscle of zzso weren't significantly higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between cartilage and liquid, zzso fat were higher in zzso and significantly different than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cartilage zzso and zzso between cartilage and its surrounding tissue are higher in sequences attached zzso zzso so fat suppress technique should routinely be used in clinical cartilage zzso zzso has high scan speed and suppress the fat signal evenly, so it can substitute zzso zzso is one of the most sensitive sequences in showing cartilage shape and detecting its zzso The cartilage zzso the zzso between cartilage and adjacent tissue and their efficiency are high in zzso and it can be used in the clinical zzso
