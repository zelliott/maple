Several zzso studies have reported reductions in zzso lobe volumes in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso have been usually obtained with zzso zzso drawn manually on selected zzso and lateral portions of the zzso zzso with variable choices of anatomical borders across different zzso We used the fully automated zzso zzso zzso approach to investigate gray matter abnormalities over the entire extension of the zzso lobe in 14 zzso patients zzso zzso and 14 healthy zzso zzso of significantly reduced gray matter volume in zzso patients were detected in both zzso and lateral zzso regions, most significantly in the right and left zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso At a more flexible statistical threshold zzso zzso for multiple zzso circumscribed zzso of significant gray matter reduction were also detected in the right zzso cortex, the anterior and zzso borders of the superior zzso zzso zzso and the anterior portion of the left middle zzso zzso These zzso results confirm previous findings of zzso lobe zzso changes in zzso and suggest that these abnormalities may be confined to specific sites within that zzso rather than showing a widespread zzso
