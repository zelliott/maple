To investigate the zzso reorganization of the zzso network zzso in patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso and whether, relative to healthy control subjects, patients with zzso would be more likely to show disrupted functional connectivity and altered zzso zzso of the zzso during the memory task compared with that observed during the resting zzso 

This study was approved by the institutional review board of Beijing zzso University Imaging Center for Brain zzso Written informed consent was obtained from each zzso Healthy control subjects zzso zzso 26) and patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25) performed an episodic memory task and also rested while undergoing functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso into different regions associated with the zzso zzso connectivity across all pairs of regions was zzso to construct the zzso zzso zzso theoretical approaches were used to characterize zzso properties of this zzso 

Patients with zzso showed similar zzso in the zzso to that observed in healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso but showed significantly decreased zzso functional connectivity only during the task zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in local efficiency zzso zzso zzso but not in global efficiency zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso only during the zzso zzso functional connectivity was zzso of increased local efficiency zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso correlations between these network measures and cognitive performance zzso zzso zzso indicated their potential use as early markers to assess the risk of zzso disease zzso 

This study suggests the early onset functional reorganization of the zzso toward a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and expands the understanding of dynamic functional reorganization in brain networks along the zzso from normal aging to zzso zzso
