To assess the clinical significance of bulky zzso central nervous system disease in patients with zzso zzso 

Forty patients (24 women and 16 zzso ranging in age from 32 to 74 years zzso zzso zzso with zzso documented zzso zzso were demonstrated by zzso or spinal magnetic resonance imaging to have either no bulky central nervous system zzso disease zzso zzso 20 zzso or bulky central nervous system zzso disease zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso patients were treated with zzso zzso and all patients were treated with sequential zzso zzso 

Median survival was 7 months in group A zzso zzso zzso as compared with 4 months in group B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso log rank zzso zzso of death was similar in both patient zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso zzso demonstration of bulky zzso central nervous system disease independently predicts survival and is useful in determining which patients are candidates for zzso zzso
