The use of zzso functions to model zzso data in people zzso may lead to inaccurate descriptions of zzso brain zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether the zzso profile of zzso responses zzso obtained from stroke survivors during an zzso experiment could be used to develop individualized zzso functions that would enhance zzso signal detection in block zzso Our long term goal was to use this information to develop individualized zzso functions for stroke survivors that could be used to analyze brain activity associated with zzso zzso We also aimed to examine the zzso of zzso obtained across two scan sessions in order to determine whether data from a single zzso session could be used to analyze block data obtained in subsequent zzso zzso indicate that the zzso profile of zzso measured with zzso in stroke survivors was not the same as that observed in individuals without zzso We observed small zzso differences in the rates of rise and decline of zzso that were more apparent in individuals with cortical as compared to zzso zzso There were no differences in the peak or time to peak of zzso in people with and without zzso Of interest, differences in zzso were not as substantial as expected from previous reports and were not large enough to zzso the use of individualized zzso functions to obtain valid measures of zzso brain zzso We conclude that all strokes do not affect the zzso characteristics of zzso in such a way as to produce inaccurate representations of brain activity as measured by zzso However, care should be taken to identify individuals whose zzso data may not provide an accurate representation of underlying brain zzso when zzso models are zzso zzso of zzso need not be done for each scan session, as our data suggest that the characteristics of zzso in stroke survivors are zzso across zzso
