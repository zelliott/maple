Though the zzso typically has been implicated in processes related to zzso zzso special types of zzso as those created by zzso mental zzso be supported by processes implemented in other zzso zzso or sensory processing zzso Here, we investigated what neural mechanisms zzso the formation and subsequent retrieval of integrated mental images, and whether those mechanisms differ based on the zzso of the integration zzso whether it contains an emotional item or zzso Participants viewed pairs of words while undergoing a functional zzso zzso They were instructed to imagine the two items separately from one another zzso zzso or as a single, integrated mental image zzso zzso They provided ratings of how successful they were at generating vivid images that fit the zzso They were then given a surprise zzso recognition test, also while undergoing an zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso correspondence to increasing imagery success selectively during zzso and retrieval of emotional zzso while the zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso showed zzso correspondence during the zzso and retrieval of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that selectively during negative integration, left zzso activity was zzso correlated with frontal and zzso zzso These data indicate that individuals zzso two different neural routes for forming and retrieving zzso depending on their emotional content, and they suggest a potentially disruptive role for the zzso on frontal and zzso regions during negative zzso
