zzso state functional zzso zzso of the brain has the potential to elicit networks of functional connectivity and to reveal changes zzso in animal models of neurological zzso In the present study, we investigate the contribution of zzso noise and its impact on assessment of functional connectivity in zzso of zzso sedated, spontaneously breathing rats at zzso field of zzso zzso We employed zzso echo zzso imaging zzso with repetition times of zzso and used simultaneous recordings of zzso zzso A model of linear zzso was applied to zzso the amount of zzso zzso signal fluctuations attributable to zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso noise - mainly originating from the respiratory cycle zzso the zzso time course in the form of zzso complex correlation zzso As a consequence, these zzso fluctuations introduce severe artifacts into zzso correlation maps and lead to zzso of corresponding connectivity zzso We demonstrate that a scheme of motion correction and linear zzso can significantly reduce zzso noise in the zzso time course, remove artifacts, and hence improve the zzso of functional connectivity zzso In conclusion, zzso noise can severely compromise functional connectivity zzso zzso of the zzso at high fields and must be carefully considered in design and interpretation of future zzso Motion correction should be considered the primary strategy for reduction of apparent motion related to respiratory zzso Combined with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso this strategy has proven successful in reducing zzso noise and related artifacts affecting functional connectivity zzso The proposed new and rigorous protocol now opens the potential of zzso to elicit the role of brain connectivity in pathological processes without concerns of zzso contributions from zzso zzso
