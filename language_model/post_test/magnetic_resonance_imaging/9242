In multiple sclerosis zzso an early neurodegenerative affection of zzso gray matter has been zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thought to reflect iron zzso in a number of primary neurodegenerative zzso The present study deals with the question of whether zzso can also display deep gray matter zzso in patients with zzso and whether zzso findings relate to severity and progression of zzso 

We zzso studied 75 patients with different courses of zzso and 55 zzso healthy subjects clinically and with zzso zzso patients additionally had zzso zzso at the time of zzso Disease progression was assessed clinically 2 years after zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the patients with zzso with similar frequency in patients with zzso and primary or secondary progressive zzso if corrected for disease zzso but only in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and none zzso zzso zzso of the control zzso zzso of zzso and zzso correlated with more pronounced zzso zzso zzso thought to reflect iron zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso area was related to higher rate of disease zzso whereas small zzso zzso area zzso zzso predicted a disease course without further progression within 2 zzso 

zzso zzso deep gray matter zzso can be frequently detected by zzso zzso zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso zzso suggest that zzso shows changes of brain iron metabolism which correlate with future progress of zzso
