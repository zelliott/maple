To develop methods for absolute zzso of the deposition of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso anatomical regions of the nose, and to enable accurate comparisons of different zzso administration techniques in the same zzso 

The volunteer was seated and positioned relative to the zzso camera field of view by means of a fixation zzso After zzso administration, a dynamic series of images was acquired for 32 zzso with a lateral direction of zzso The images were corrected for zzso zzso by the use of a lateral transmission image acquired before the delivery of zzso or zzso zzso images, obtained with a line source fixed to a balloon and kept for a short while against the zzso as well as with a point source held on anatomical landmarks, were used to zzso the zzso images to zzso sections through a three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso The MR set was used to define the inner nose zzso and the zzso regions used for zzso 

zzso correction factors ranged from zzso to zzso in different parts of the zzso zzso zzso of the markers on the teeth and zzso with the zzso MR images could be reproduced with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The new method provides reliable zzso of the deposition in zzso regions that can be defined in MR zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential when comparing distribution and clearance patterns for different administration zzso
