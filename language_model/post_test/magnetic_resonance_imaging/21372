The aim of this study was to test an oral contrast solution with zzso for the magnetic resonance imaging of small zzso zzso 

The study sample included 3 zzso 17 healthy volunteers zzso zzso 22 patients with small zzso disease zzso zzso Both groups underwent MR zzso and 24 patients with small zzso disease zzso zzso underwent magnetic resonance zzso Various zzso in 1000 zzso vs 500 zzso of experimental solution were zzso All zzso completed questionnaires evaluating the solution characteristics and zzso during and after zzso 

A zzso concentration of 800 zzso zzso g zzso in 1000 zzso solution was sufficient for proper zzso zzso An experimental solution of 500 zzso was sufficient for magnetic resonance zzso and 1000 zzso for MR zzso There were no statistically significant differences between groups for taste, taste characteristic or appearance of the experimental zzso zzso experienced during drinking were: zzso zzso and zzso zzso in group A, in group B zzso and zzso zzso in group zzso zzso 2 h after drinking zzso in group A zzso zzso and in group C zzso zzso The best tolerance of experimental solution was found in group B with a higher median patient age than groups A and zzso The experimental solution was evaluated more favorably in the older subjects (age over 50 zzso 

The experimental oral solution with zzso was well tolerated in all 3 zzso Our study supports its use in magnetic resonance zzso
