The relative utility of various zzso diagnostic imaging zzso including PET zzso zzso and zzso CT, and MR imaging, for evaluation of zzso and zzso especially zzso zzso was zzso 

Imaging findings in 32 patients with zzso documented zzso including one with zzso and one with zzso and 25 patients with zzso whose zzso included 10 zzso 10 zzso and 5 other types were reviewed zzso zzso imaging included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso and MR imaging zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significant imaging features of MR images favoring a diagnosis of zzso involved zzso containing less than zzso fat zzso zzso zzso as well as the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso As compared with zzso zzso benign zzso were differentiated significantly only by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso which also provided significant differentiation on CT zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso for zzso tumors were significantly higher than those for benign zzso in both zzso and zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso value for zzso and zzso set at zzso and zzso respectively, which provided the highest zzso benign zzso were differentiated significantly from zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso Furthermore, benign tumors and the three zzso of zzso were divided significantly into four biological grades by zzso and zzso rates zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso A zzso value of zzso for zzso provided significant differentiation between benign zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso on MR images differentiated zzso from zzso even zzso zzso PET analysis, especially zzso zzso provided not only the differentiation but also the zzso separation among zzso of zzso zzso of the visual diagnostic zzso requires extensive experience and carries a risk of ignoring a critical portion of zzso PET zzso imaging may be an objective and useful zzso for evaluating zzso tissue tumors zzso
