zzso can be understood based on form cues zzso zzso body zzso as well as motion cues zzso gait zzso A fundamental debate centers on the question of whether the functional and neural mechanisms processing these two types of cues are zzso Here, using zzso zzso and zzso magnetic stimulation zzso all within the same human participants, we show that mechanisms underlying body form and body motion processing are functionally and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity patterns in the zzso body area zzso but not in the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso carried cue zzso information about the body form of an acting zzso zzso zzso patterns in zzso but not in zzso carried information about the body motion of the same zzso In a zzso experiment, we selectively impaired body form and body motion zzso by manipulating different visual zzso zzso the zzso that made up a dynamic walker stimulus selectively disrupted body form zzso while varying the presentation duration of the walker selectively affected body motion zzso Finally, a zzso experiment revealed zzso evidence for a zzso between neural mechanisms underlying body form and body motion zzso zzso over zzso selectively disrupted body form discrimination, whereas zzso over zzso selectively disrupted body motion zzso Together, these findings reveal zzso but zzso functions of zzso and zzso during action zzso They provide constraints for theoretical and zzso models of action perception by showing that action perception involves at least two parallel pathways that separately contribute to the understanding of others' zzso
