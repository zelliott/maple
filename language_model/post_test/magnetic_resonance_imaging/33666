zzso iron oxide particles zzso are usually referred to as zzso MR contrast agents, reducing signal intensity zzso on zzso MR images zzso zzso This study reports the original use of zzso as zzso contrast agents, primarily assessed in zzso and then applied to an in zzso investigation of a zzso zzso zzso Using a strongly zzso zzso MR sequence with zzso intravenous zzso zzso injection, MR imaging of zzso zzso after zzso was performed, on a dog model of coronary zzso followed by zzso Immediately after the intravenous zzso injection of 20 zzso of zzso a positive signal intensity enhancement was observed respectively, in the right and left zzso cavity and in the zzso left zzso Moreover, compared to normal zzso the remaining zzso zzso region zzso wall of the left zzso appeared as a lower and delayed zzso enhancing area zzso zzso Mean peak zzso in the zzso zzso zzso wall) was significantly higher than in the zzso zzso zzso wall) (110 zzso zzso zzso 74 zzso zzso zzso test alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso 0, U zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso effect of zzso at low dose, during their first zzso distribution, suggests their potential use as positive markers to investigate the regional zzso blood flow and some zzso defects such as the zzso zzso
