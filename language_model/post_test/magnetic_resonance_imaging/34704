To zzso a zzso fast zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence using zzso data and to study its clinical utility for imaging the zzso 

Relative signal zzso and contrast of relevant normal and zzso zzso in the spine were zzso using an inversion recovery equation modified to account for a hybrid zzso zzso acquisition with relaxation zzso zzso A range of inversion time zzso and repetition time zzso pairs that zzso the signal from zzso was zzso A zzso heavily zzso fast zzso zzso based on the generated data, was zzso compared with conventional zzso zzso sequences for imaging various spinal zzso 

A zzso pair of approximately zzso was extracted from the computer-generated data to produce effective zzso of zzso zzso to achieve heavy zzso zzso and to zzso contrast between abnormal zzso and zzso zzso Clinical zzso of the zzso zzso fast zzso sequence revealed superior contrast at the zzso zzso better zzso of zzso of the spinal zzso and bone zzso and reduced zzso artifacts as compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso fast zzso technique has zzso advantages over zzso sequences for imaging the zzso zzso acquisition times render the zzso sequence the method of choice for zzso imaging of the zzso
