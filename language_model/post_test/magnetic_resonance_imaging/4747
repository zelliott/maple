zzso resonance zzso imaging of zzso zzso is usually carried out in dynamic studies with zzso contrast material injections, with the result that few strong images are zzso Dynamic studies using a slowly injected contrast material were carried out in 14 cases of zzso zzso The examinations were performed with a zzso zzso zzso MR imaging system using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was slowly injected zzso 90 zzso by hand, providing seven to nine dynamic images during 350 zzso from the start of zzso The average time to reach the maximum signal intensity was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso The maximum contrast signal intensity ratio of zzso to normal zzso was zzso in the fifth zzso The contrast of zzso to normal zzso tissue was calculated by the following formula: zzso zzso signal intensity zzso zzso zzso signal zzso signal zzso signal zzso The most remarkable contrast between zzso and normal tissue was obtained from the fourth to eighth zzso In other words, we could obtain the strongest contrast at zzso zzso to zzso zzso from the start of contrast zzso Our results with slow injection suggest that stronger images can be obtained a longer period after contrast zzso
