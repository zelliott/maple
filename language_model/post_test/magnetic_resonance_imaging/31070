The Quality zzso zzso of the American Academy of zzso and the zzso Committee of the Child zzso Society develop practice parameters as strategies for patient management based on analysis of zzso For this zzso the authors reviewed available evidence on the assessment of a child suspected of having cerebral zzso zzso a zzso disorder of posture or movement due to a zzso of the developing zzso 

zzso literature was zzso zzso and zzso zzso were based on a zzso scheme of evidence zzso 

zzso is a common problem, occurring in about 2 to zzso per 1,000 live zzso In order to establish that a brain zzso exists in children with zzso that may, in turn, suggest an zzso and zzso zzso is recommended with zzso preferred to CT zzso zzso zzso and genetic studies should not be routinely obtained in the evaluation of the child with zzso zzso zzso If the clinical history or findings on zzso do not determine a specific structural zzso or if there are additional and zzso features in the history or clinical examination, zzso and genetic testing should be considered zzso zzso zzso of a brain zzso in a child with zzso warrants consideration of an underlying genetic or zzso zzso Because the zzso of cerebral zzso is high in children with zzso zzso diagnostic testing for zzso disorders should be considered zzso zzso However, there is insufficient evidence at present to be precise as to what studies should be zzso An zzso is not recommended unless there are features suggestive of zzso or a specific zzso syndrome zzso zzso Because children with zzso may have associated deficits of mental zzso zzso and hearing zzso speech and language disorders, and zzso dysfunction, screening for these conditions should be part of the initial assessment zzso zzso 

zzso results in children with zzso are commonly abnormal and may help determine the zzso zzso for associated conditions is warranted as part of the initial zzso
