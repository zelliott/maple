We investigated whether intensive follow-up leads to earlier diagnosis of zzso more effective treatment, and longer survival in patients with small cell lung cancer zzso who had shown a complete or partial response to zzso zzso The subjects of this retrospective study were 94 patients with zzso who had shown a complete or partial response to zzso zzso The patients were separated into two arms: an intensive follow-up arm in which patients underwent regular blood tests, chest zzso zzso zzso of the chest and upper abdomen, magnetic resonance or zzso zzso of the brain, and bone zzso zzso for 6 months and then quarterly for zzso years; and a zzso follow-up arm in which these examinations were performed at the zzso zzso All patients also underwent interviews and physical examinations monthly for 2 years and zzso for a further 3 zzso Patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the zzso Disease recurred in 55 of 62 patients of the intensive arm and 29 of 32 patients of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected more frequently in the intensive arm than in the zzso zzso The response rate to salvage therapy among all patients with zzso disease was significantly higher in the intensive arm zzso than in the zzso arm zzso zzso Both median zzso survival and overall median survival were significantly longer in the intensive arm (9 and 20 months, respectively, zzso and zzso than in the zzso arm (4 and 13 months, zzso zzso follow-up helps detect recurrence earlier, enhances the effectiveness of treatment, and lengthens survival in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso trials including a cost-benefit analysis are needed to compare intensive and zzso follow-up zzso
