The aim of the present study was to use magnetic resonance imaging as a zzso measure of zzso enlargement and zzso in experimental diabetes in zzso zzso were zzso into three groups: zzso zzso control animals, zzso diabetic animals, zzso for 30 days after zzso treatment and zzso diabetic animals treated with insulin from day 21 to day 30 after zzso zzso zzso resonance images were obtained from zzso rats and zzso cortex, zzso and pelvis volumes were calculated throughout the experiment until day zzso In zzso diabetic animals, a marked increase in kidney volume was seen 4 days after the induction of diabetes zzso zzso zzso and after 30 days this increase amounted to zzso with similar increases in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso No change was seen in the pelvis zzso zzso administration on day 21 to zzso diabetic rats abruptly reduced kidney volume by zzso zzso volume by zzso and zzso volume by zzso and after 4 days all three parameters were similar to those seen in zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated the zzso of magnetic resonance imaging as a zzso measure of zzso enlargement and zzso in experimental diabetes in zzso In zzso zzso diabetic rats, with manifest diabetic zzso enlargement, acute zzso in zzso volume was observed zzso with zzso zzso
