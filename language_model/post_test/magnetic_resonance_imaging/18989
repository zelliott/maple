A theoretical model is described for a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso that is useful at zzso zzso The device is a zzso zzso which is based on a concept originally proposed by zzso zzso The zzso comprises a circular zzso structure containing several zzso transmission lines operating in a zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso The model developed zzso treats the empty zzso and is based on zzso transmission line zzso This work zzso and extends similar analyses of the device by zzso zzso and zzso and Zhang zzso The model employs explicit calculation of zzso parameters for zzso lines having arbitrary zzso zzso of the zzso frequency response are found to compare well with zzso Fields produced by linear zzso and zzso drive are also zzso and compared to images of zzso zzso
