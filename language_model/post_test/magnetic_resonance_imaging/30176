To characterize reading zzso caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

We gave six patients with these zzso reading and writing tests and located a critical site for zzso using zzso and zzso 

The patients read zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly or at a near significant level more poorly and slowly than normal subjects, whereas they read zzso zzso zzso almost correctly but more zzso zzso reading with a zzso character identification impairment (in five zzso a zzso effect, zzso zzso a zzso effect, and minor to mild zzso for zzso (in three zzso were zzso These deficits were characteristic of pure zzso zzso disappeared within a few months except in one patient who had extensive zzso in the left zzso zzso A shared zzso was located in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and there was blood flow reduction around this area on zzso This area coincided with the zzso site for zzso word covert reading in our previous zzso 

These results suggest that pure zzso particularly for zzso or more generally pure zzso for letters, is caused by a zzso in the zzso inferior zzso cortex, characterized primarily by impaired zzso character or letter zzso with relatively preserved zzso or word zzso
