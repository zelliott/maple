Although it has been shown that the phase of the MR signal from the brain is particularly prone to variation due to zzso the overall zzso information contained in phase time series is not well zzso Here, we explore the different zzso processes contributing to the phase time series noise, identify their zzso characteristics and examine their relationship to zzso and zzso zzso noise in the magnitude time zzso This was performed by manipulating the contribution of zzso noise to the total signal zzso by modulating the TE and zzso volume, and using a short zzso in order to adequately sample zzso signal zzso The phase and magnitude signals were compared both before and after removal of signal fluctuations at the primary respiratory and cardiac zzso with zzso We found that the zzso phase noise increased with TE at a faster rate than predicted by zzso as a result of zzso zzso As suggested by previous studies, the primary contributor to phase zzso noise was zzso effects which were zzso at a large scale zzso zzso zzso zzso removed zzso large-scale artifacts and this resulted in considerable improvements in the zzso phase stability zzso zzso noise in the magnitude time series after zzso consisted of zzso zzso fluctuations zzso zzso localized to gray matter and the zzso and fluctuations in the zzso correlated with slow zzso zzso variations in zzso volume and cardiac zzso zzso noise in the phase signal after zzso also occurred in zzso below zzso zzso and was consistent with zzso residual large-scale zzso effects correlated with slow variations in zzso volume and cardiac rhythm over time, and zzso local scale zzso zzso effects localized in gray matter and zzso most likely due to vascular zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso While zzso magnitude noise exhibited a TE dependence similar to zzso the zzso noise in the phase data increased with increasing TE and thus caused the overall phase noise to increase at a faster rate with TE than predicted by zzso Interestingly, the spatial specificity of this effect was more evident for the higher resolution phase data, as opposed to the magnitude data, suggesting that at a higher spatial resolution the phase signal may contain more information on zzso processes than the magnitude zzso
