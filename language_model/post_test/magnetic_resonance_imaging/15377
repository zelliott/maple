The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of an zzso injection of zzso zzso contrast medium on human zzso blood flow using zzso zzso zzso 

We examined 12 healthy adult zzso Blood flow in one zzso artery was measured using zzso zzso imaging zzso MR zzso Each volunteer received 120 zzso of zzso sodium zzso on study day 1 and 120 zzso of a zzso zzso zzso contrast medium zzso 400 zzso zzso on study day zzso zzso zzso were performed before (up to five zzso in 5 minutes) and after (up to 13 zzso in 30 minutes) the injection was zzso 

Mean zzso zzso artery blood flow was zzso zzso In response to the injection of the test zzso we found a significantly larger decrease in average zzso blood flow for contrast medium than for sodium zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, in analyzing the zzso at early time points, we found a significant decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso blood flow 2 minutes after the injection of the contrast medium was zzso zzso zzso did not produce a significant effect at any zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can measure a decrease in zzso blood flow in humans in response to an zzso injection of zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be a helpful and zzso tool for further investigations of contrast zzso changes in human zzso blood flow and their possible impact on the development of zzso zzso
