To assess the value of the peripheral zzso sign on delayed contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso images in differentiation of benign from zzso breast zzso 

In 49 women with 79 breast zzso (55 zzso and 24 zzso dynamic zzso MR imaging was performed every 90 seconds during the first 7 minutes and repeated at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes after injection of contrast zzso zzso analysis of the images was performed to evaluate the presence of the peripheral zzso sign (a zzso zone in the periphery of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso analysis of the images was performed by measuring the signal intensity of the periphery and center of the zzso 

The peripheral zzso sign was seen in 28 zzso of the 55 zzso on delayed zzso MR images zzso 10 zzso zzso analysis demonstrated different enhancement profiles of the periphery and center of these zzso The periphery showed early increase and decrease of enhancement, while the center showed gradual increase and persistent zzso The peripheral zzso sign was not seen in any of the benign zzso zzso was zzso and sensitivity was 51% for diagnosis of breast zzso 

zzso zzso may be a reliable sign of zzso on delayed zzso MR images of the zzso
