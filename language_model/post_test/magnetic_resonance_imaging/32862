To report the case of identical zzso zzso female twins with unilateral zzso in zzso deletion zzso 

Clinical and zzso zzso combination of multiple zzso probe amplification, zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were zzso 

zzso facial features, marked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with left to right shunt and light zzso of right chambers, 5th finger zzso zzso toes zzso 2nd toe overlapped to 3rd zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso evaluation revealed unilateral zzso in both zzso zzso resonance imaging detected corpus zzso zzso in both zzso A zzso deletion involving bands zzso and including the zzso gene was identified in both zzso The deletion was not present in the DNA of their parents and older zzso 

zzso features in children must be always suspicious of zzso deletion syndrome and a short zzso follow-up is necessary to detect the presence of a zzso
