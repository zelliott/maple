zzso resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging are important zzso diagnostic and evaluation tools, particularly in patients who have undergone spinal zzso zzso in materials and imaging techniques have lessened artifact and improved overall imaging zzso Systems that combine titanium zzso and zzso components have been introduced to reduce implant profile while maintaining zzso The objective of this study was to determine if there were any differences in the clarity of imaging between two types of implant materials in a zzso spine construct zzso 

One of two zzso spine stabilization implant systems, titanium zzso zzso or titanium zzso with zzso zzso zzso was placed to simulate a zzso fusion construct in two human zzso spine zzso followed by zzso and CT zzso The implant systems were then removed from each zzso and implanted in the other zzso Nine physician graders from three zzso scored the images using a zzso scale, with higher imaging scores indicating greater clarity of the region of zzso zzso scores were compared across systems and between physician zzso 

There were no significant differences in the overall mean total scores on the basis of construct zzso zzso mean scores were zzso for titanium and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Among images of the zzso zzso no significant differences in mean scores were found between specimens with use of zzso zzso zzso zzso or with use of CT only zzso zzso zzso Among images of the titanium system, a slightly significant difference was found between specimens with use of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with CT imaging zzso zzso zzso 

zzso image clarity scores were not significantly different between titanium and zzso implant systems in the zzso zzso Observation of pertinent anatomy in the regions of interest was not zzso by the presence of either zzso
