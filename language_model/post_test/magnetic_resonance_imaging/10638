Heart disease is one of the more life-threatening zzso zzso diagnosis and treatment are central to the survival of zzso Numerous diagnostic methods that can assess abnormalities of the heart have been zzso Among these methods, cardiac functional analysis has been widely used to derive cardiac functional parameters that describe the functionality of the heart and are frequently used in diagnosis of various heart zzso zzso of the zzso boundaries is an essential step for zzso these cardiac functional zzso and the accuracy of parameters depends much on the correctness of the segmented zzso zzso it is essential that cardiac zzso be accurate and zzso However, current zzso techniques still have difficulty both zzso accurate zzso zzso especially the zzso boundary and performing a fully automatic process because of low image quality, the complex shape and motion pattern of the heart, and lack of clear zzso between the zzso and adjacent zzso zzso A zzso cardiac zzso method based a modified active zzso model, the zzso orientation zzso force zzso and phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been developed to improve the accuracy of zzso of the zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso Furthermore, the initial seed zzso tracking zzso zzso has been also developed to improve the accuracy of automatic sequential frame zzso in conjunction with the zzso zzso zzso The performance of the proposed method was assessed by zzso on a phase contrast zzso data set of three normal human zzso The results of the individual frame zzso showed that the accuracy and zzso of zzso of the zzso boundary by the use of the zzso was generally improved around the lower level of the zzso and end zzso The results of the sequential frame zzso showed that the propagation of errors caused was significantly reduced by the use of the zzso in addition to the zzso and improvements in the accuracy and zzso of zzso of the zzso boundary were much higher than the individual frame zzso However, improvements were generally negligible around the upper level of the zzso and end zzso and the zzso zzso problem and blood turbulence around the zzso level of the zzso even zzso the performance of boundary zzso Although this work demonstrates the potential of using the zzso information from phase contrast zzso for cardiac zzso the zzso zzso artifacts in phase contrast zzso data sets can degrade the zzso zzso future work must include the development of appropriate methods to cope with these zzso
