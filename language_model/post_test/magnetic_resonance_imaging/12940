zzso zzso imaging is essential for zzso of the position of zzso implanted for deep brain stimulation zzso zzso offers superior zzso of the zzso targets relative to CT, but previous adverse incidents have heightened concerns about risks of zzso zzso zzso zzso fused with zzso CT offers an alternative method for evaluating zzso position, but before this method can be clinically applied, the image registration accuracy must be zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso assess the accuracy of three different image registration and fusion zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso CT were acquired from 20 patients zzso going zzso surgery (35 zzso in zzso The zzso CT was registered and fused with the zzso zzso using three different registration zzso The position of each zzso tip was determined in zzso coordinates both in the zzso zzso CT and the fused zzso The difference in tip position between the CT and fused zzso was used to evaluate the registration zzso 

The mean error along the zzso zzso and vertical axes was zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso 

zzso fusion provides a safe, practical technique for zzso identification of zzso zzso
