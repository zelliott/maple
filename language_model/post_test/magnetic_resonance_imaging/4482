In a prospective study zzso zzso zzso of clinically suspected zzso was compared with the findings of abdominal zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

From zzso 1990 to zzso 1995 11 patients zzso zzso median age 42 zzso zzso were enrolled in the zzso The zzso zzso findings were compared to surgery zzso zzso 7) or clinical follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ultrasound identified a solitary zzso zzso size zzso zzso in 7 of 11 patients, which was proven at surgery in 5 patients and by zzso portal zzso sampling after negative partial zzso zzso in 1 zzso One patient is still awaiting zzso Clinical follow-up zzso zzso 2) and negative zzso and zzso findings of partial zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) confirmed a true negative examination in 3 zzso One patient with negative zzso ultrasound is still under medication for zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 5) were negative in all investigated zzso 

zzso ultrasound is highly accurate for zzso of zzso and should be performed early in the zzso management of these zzso
