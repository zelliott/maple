We examined the usefulness of zzso zzso in zzso as a liver specific contrast agent for magnetic resonance zzso zzso experiments showed that the effective dose for imaging experiments was 7 to 11 times lower than the zzso of free zzso In rats with implanted liver tumors, zzso zzso zzso caused a two- to zzso increase in the relaxation rate of the liver while having little effect on the relaxation rate of tumor zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images obtained at zzso T of an zzso zzso implanted in the liver showed an increase in the signal intensity of both normal liver and tumor tissue after the injection of free zzso zzso zzso However, after the injection of zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso the liver exhibited a marked increase in signal intensity with little change in the signal intensity of the tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso has excellent potential as a liver specific contrast agent for the improved detection of liver zzso
