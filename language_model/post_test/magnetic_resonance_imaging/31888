It is well known that iron accumulates in the brains of patients with various neurodegenerative zzso To better understand zzso iron changes, it is necessary to know the zzso distribution and zzso of iron in the human zzso Studies have shown that brain iron levels increase with zzso However, the effects of gender and zzso zzso on iron zzso and distribution are not well zzso In this study, we estimated the brain iron levels in zzso in 78 healthy adults ranging in age 22 to 78 years using magnetic zzso phase zzso The effects of age, zzso and zzso location on brain iron levels were evaluated within the framework of a general linear zzso We found that the left zzso had higher iron levels than the right in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and frontal white zzso We argue that the zzso asymmetry of iron content may zzso that of the zzso system and may be related to motor zzso in zzso In addition, significant age-related iron zzso occurred in the zzso red nucleus, and frontal white matter, but no zzso differences in iron levels were zzso The results of this study extend our knowledge of the zzso distribution and zzso of iron in the human zzso
