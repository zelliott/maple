zzso studies show that the native zzso consists of two distinct functional zzso termed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The utility of using routine magnetic resonance imaging zzso to distinguish the individual zzso of the zzso has not been zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso and zzso agreement for assessment of the AM and zzso zzso using zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso viewing zzso We identified a series of patients seen in the senior author's clinic during a zzso zzso Images were independently evaluated in blinded fashion at two separate time points by a musculoskeletal zzso and two zzso zzso The AM bundle was detected in most planes of view with high frequency and zzso while detection of the zzso bundle was less frequent and had a lower associated zzso Our results indicate that it is difficult to reliably detect both the AM and zzso zzso using a zzso strength magnet with standard planes of zzso It has been demonstrated that the zzso may be zzso effectively in planes that are based on the natural course of the zzso and it is likely that this will also facilitate zzso of the individual AM and zzso zzso The use of additional zzso planes of view offers a potential approach for improved evaluation of the zzso even with low field strength zzso Future work in this area may assist in the zzso assessment of isolated AM or zzso bundle injuries, zzso a more zzso approach to zzso zzso
