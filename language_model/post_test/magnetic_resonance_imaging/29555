zzso of human neural precursor proliferation can give rise to a small brain zzso and failure of zzso to migrate properly can lead to an abnormal arrest of cerebral cortical zzso in zzso zones near the lateral zzso zzso zzso Here we show that an zzso zzso condition characterized by zzso and zzso zzso maps to zzso 20 and is caused by zzso in the gene zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis, we found that mouse zzso zzso levels are highest during embryonic periods of ongoing zzso proliferation and migration, and by in zzso zzso we found that the zzso is widely distributed throughout the embryonic central nervous system zzso zzso encodes the large zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein zzso which is required for zzso and membrane trafficking from the zzso network zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or by a dominant negative zzso zzso decreases cell proliferation in zzso suggesting a zzso regulation of neural zzso zzso of zzso also disturbed the zzso zzso of such molecules as zzso and zzso by preventing their transport from the zzso apparatus to the cell zzso Our findings show that zzso trafficking is an important regulator of proliferation and migration during human cerebral cortical zzso
