It is widely accepted that zzso prefrontal zzso zzso is activated at the time of action generation in zzso However, the previous functional zzso studies that have supported this hypothesis temporally integrated brain dynamics and therefore could not demonstrate when zzso underwent zzso relative to the emergence of voluntary zzso Data that are zzso to the instant of voluntary action execution do not reveal zzso zzso at that zzso Rather, activated zzso are seen at the frontal zzso We investigated this apparent conundrum through three zzso constrained experiments, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify those prefrontal areas exhibiting functional change at the moment of spontaneous action zzso We observed profound functional zzso between anterior and zzso regions, compatible with their involvement at different points during the zzso evolution of zzso zzso the frontal poles activated at the moment of execution, while simultaneously (and relative to a prior zzso zzso left zzso zzso
