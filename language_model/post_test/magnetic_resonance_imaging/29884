zzso zzso gene disruption is known as responsible for so called zzso zzso mental zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso In order to search for a possible specific clinical and zzso profile for zzso in the zzso zzso clinical and zzso brain zzso studies were performed in the two families with a known zzso in zzso reported so far: a 19-year-old female with an zzso balanced zzso encompassing zzso and four affected males of family zzso sharing a zzso zzso in zzso Clinical data shared by affected individuals were zzso zzso with motor delay but no obvious zzso marked zzso early onset complex partial seizures, and moderate to severe zzso Brain zzso performed in three individuals exhibited a specific zzso zzso including an incomplete zzso of anterior and zzso zzso with the most prominent zzso in zzso VI and zzso In addition, a zzso cerebral zzso zzso was also zzso These clinical and zzso features suggest a distinct zzso zzso These preliminary data need to be confirmed in other families and will be helpful for further targeted zzso screening of the zzso gene in male patients with similar zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso should be considered as a relevant model of zzso zzso zzso leading to a better understanding of the possible role of the zzso in zzso
