zzso therapies using genes and drugs are promising therapeutic strategies for various zzso In this research, a zzso carrier of zzso and zzso DNA zzso was developed by zzso of zzso to zzso (2 zzso zzso for zzso therapy of zzso zzso Dynamic light zzso atomic force zzso and flow zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso complex was 150 zzso in size and was taken up by cells more easily than zzso zzso The tumor necrosis zzso zzso level was decreased more efficiently by zzso complex than zzso only in zzso activated Raw zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso complex increased the delivery efficiency and therapeutic effect of zzso In in zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher zzso efficiency than zzso and zzso However, the simple mixture of zzso and zzso did not show this effect, suggesting that the zzso of zzso to zzso increased DNA delivery efficiency of zzso To evaluate the effects of zzso therapy in zzso zzso complex was applied to a transient focal zzso animal zzso At 24 h after the injection, mean zzso volume and the zzso level were reduced more efficiently in the zzso injection group, compared with the control, zzso or zzso injection zzso The zzso volume and inflammatory zzso were further decreased by delivery of zzso using zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso studies confirmed the therapeutic effect of zzso complex at 10 days after the zzso zzso zzso complexes may be useful in zzso therapy for zzso diseases such as zzso
