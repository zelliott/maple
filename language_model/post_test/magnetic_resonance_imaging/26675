Stress is associated with zzso in neural zzso pathways in the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes, and weight zzso The relationship between these different factors is not well zzso We hypothesized that body mass index zzso status and zzso factors would be associated with VS zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare brain responses of overweight and obese zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso individuals with normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals during exposure to personalized stress, alcohol zzso and zzso situations using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, including zzso plasma zzso zzso insulin, and zzso were examined for their association with VS zzso zzso with previous studies, stress and alcohol cue exposure each increased activity in zzso zzso Compared with zzso individuals, zzso individuals showed greater VS zzso in the zzso and stress zzso zzso was correlated with VS zzso zzso associations between VS zzso and zzso factors during stress and relaxation suggest the involvement of zzso factors in zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso This relationship may contribute to zzso feeding in zzso
