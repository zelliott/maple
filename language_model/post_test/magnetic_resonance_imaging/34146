The aim of this study was to investigate sequential zzso changes in the brains of infants after transient zzso zzso We used magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso head zzso 

zzso symptomatic zzso infants whose serum zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso without any other diseases were included in the zzso zzso zzso and US head scans were performed at zzso age and at the age of 2 zzso The imaging results were compared with the findings of zzso and US scans in 19 healthy zzso term newborn infants at the respective zzso The zzso outcome was followed in the both zzso 

zzso or US showed evidence of zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso detected more abnormalities in the brains than zzso Four infants showed zzso zzso zzso either in the zzso zzso white matter or the zzso on zzso zzso These zzso had a good tendency to recover and only 1 of these infants appeared to be zzso zzso Of the 19 controls, zzso (2 of zzso had zzso zzso which were detected both with zzso and zzso The relative risk of the zzso child compared with zzso child, to have any zzso detected in the brain, was zzso with a zzso confidence zzso from zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and US scans showed abnormalities four times more often after transient zzso zzso than in the healthy control zzso However, most often zzso were absent 2 months zzso The clinical relevance of these abnormal findings remains to be clarified with detailed zzso examinations and zzso
