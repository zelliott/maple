Several lines of evidence suggest that structures involved in zzso attention zzso respond to increasing processing zzso Investigation of differences in zzso zzso however, has been complicated by zzso inconsistencies and zzso discrepancies in degree of difficulty and subject effort between disparate zzso In this study, we zzso zzso to compare neural zzso patterns associated with two related attention tasks associated with different degrees of processing load while controlling for degree of performance zzso Healthy volunteers performed two continuous performance tasks, utilizing an identical pairs paradigm zzso and a matched simple number recognition paradigm with zzso stimuli zzso during a single zzso zzso Degree of stimulus resolution degradation in the latter zzso was designed to zzso degree of performance difficulty between the two zzso zzso and zzso were both associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and sensory zzso zzso zzso administration was associated with significantly greater zzso of left zzso prefrontal cortex, bilateral zzso zzso cortex, bilateral zzso and zzso This study demonstrates both that differing attention tasks are associated with a high degree of functional overlap and that increasing processing demand is associated with increased zzso of specific portions of zzso zzso
