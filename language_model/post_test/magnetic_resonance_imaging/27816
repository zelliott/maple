We review the current status of multidisciplinary care for patients with inflammatory breast cancer zzso and discuss what further research is needed to advance the care of patients with this zzso 

We performed a comprehensive review of the English-language literature on zzso through computerized literature zzso 

zzso advances in imaging, including digital zzso high-resolution zzso with zzso capabilities, magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso have improved the diagnosis and staging of zzso There are currently no established molecular criteria for distinguishing zzso from zzso breast zzso Such criteria would be helpful for the diagnosis and development of novel targeted zzso zzso of zzso systemic chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy have led to an improved zzso however, the overall zzso survival rate for patients with zzso remains very low zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy and zzso mastectomy are not recommended for patients with zzso 

zzso management of zzso requires close coordination among zzso zzso and radiation zzso as well as zzso and zzso There is a need to identify molecular changes that define the zzso of zzso to enable zzso of zzso with the use of zzso targeted zzso
