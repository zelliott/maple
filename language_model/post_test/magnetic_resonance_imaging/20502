This study evaluated the clinical utility of the zzso Assessment Battery zzso in a stroke sample by examining the zzso ability to differentiate a chronic stroke group with zzso confirmed unilateral damage zzso zzso zzso and a demographically matched healthy control zzso group zzso zzso zzso The stroke group performed more poorly than the control group across zzso Total score and all five zzso zzso zzso operator zzso zzso were derived and area under the curve zzso showed moderate diagnostic effectiveness zzso zzso to zzso for zzso Total score, all five zzso scores, a motor zzso and a Global Deficit zzso zzso that has been shown to closely approximate clinical ratings of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and motor composite had comparable clinical utility, whereas the Attention and Executive domain scores demonstrated better zzso utility compared with the Memory zzso Because zzso of our stroke sample had middle cerebral artery territory strokes, the comparison of motor and cognitive zzso utility may be zzso However, follow-up analyses showed that the zzso accounted for additional zzso even when motor composite was included in the zzso zzso zzso and odds ratios at various clinical zzso are zzso These results suggest that the zzso is a useful clinical tool for detection of cognitive deficits in individuals with chronic unilateral stroke, although zzso clinical zzso appear warranted to maximize zzso
