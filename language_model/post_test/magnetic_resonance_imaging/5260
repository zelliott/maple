The zzso zzso particularly the nucleus zzso is commonly associated with the processing of reward and positive zzso positive affect as well as zzso zzso 

The present study examined whether the zzso zzso is implicated in analgesia resulting from positive mood change induced by pleasant zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies were conducted in healthy individuals receiving painful heat stimuli in the presence of pleasant or unpleasant zzso which were used to induce positive and negative mood zzso zzso zzso activity was examined in the two mood zzso 

For most subjects, pleasant zzso improved mood and reduced pain zzso perception relative to unpleasant zzso In the pleasant zzso condition, the maximum zzso of both the left and right zzso zzso was positively correlated with the amount of pain zzso Furthermore, the left and right zzso zzso zzso positively zzso with one another, and the right zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with that in the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of the right zzso thalamus, left zzso anterior zzso cortex, left zzso prefrontal zzso and right zzso prefrontal zzso 

Because both the zzso zzso and anterior zzso are involved in pain affect perception, and zzso within the prefrontal areas and zzso zzso matter were previously shown to correlate with zzso pain zzso it is concluded that the zzso zzso is likely implicated in the zzso effect of positive mood changes induced by pleasant zzso on pain zzso
