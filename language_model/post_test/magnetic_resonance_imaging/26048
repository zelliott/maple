In order to zzso the neural mechanisms involved in the perception of the three-dimensional zzso orientation of a surface, we trained monkeys to discriminate the zzso orientation of a surface from zzso disparity cues using a zzso type zzso zzso task and examined the properties of the zzso zzso zzso We recorded 57 zzso zzso from the zzso part of the lateral bank of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of three zzso of two Japanese monkeys zzso zzso We tested 29 of 57 zzso zzso using the square plate of a solid figure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso without perspective zzso almost all of the tested zzso zzso showed surface orientation selectivity for the zzso and/or the zzso without perspective zzso Eight of these 28 zzso zzso showed selectivity for both the zzso and zzso 7 zzso were zzso selective for the zzso and 13 zzso were zzso selective for the zzso These results suggest that zzso that show surface orientation tuning for the zzso without perspective cues zzso surface orientation from the zzso of the zzso disparity given by the zzso across the zzso On the other hand, zzso that show surface orientation tuning for the zzso without perspective cues may represent surface orientation primarily from the zzso of the zzso disparity along the zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso in the area zzso are likely to operate higher order processing of disparity signals for surface perception by zzso the input signals from many zzso zzso with different disparity zzso
