zzso contrast media zzso are reported to induce acute kidney injury zzso in a high-risk population group at the usual dose for magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso We assessed zzso zzso in patients with zzso impairment who underwent zzso or zzso zzso and evaluated the risk zzso 

In this retrospective study, zzso patients with baseline zzso zzso who received zzso or zzso examinations with zzso were zzso After all other zzso zzso zzso severe heart failure, all kinds of zzso and severe zzso patients on dialysis were zzso 158 patients were zzso zzso was defined as a decrease in zzso zzso rate zzso zzso of baseline data within 3 days after administration of zzso zzso analysis was used to find independent risk factors for zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-six of the 158 patients zzso developed zzso There were no significant differences in zzso age, or baseline zzso between those who did and who did not develop zzso zzso coronary artery disease, liver zzso diabetes zzso and hypertension were not significantly associated with the development of zzso However, zzso was an independent risk factor for zzso after zzso zzso analysis zzso odds zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

It is potential zzso after administration of zzso under zzso condition at the dose for zzso and zzso examinations in patients with zzso zzso It is important to identify high-risk patients and closely monitor zzso function after administration of zzso
