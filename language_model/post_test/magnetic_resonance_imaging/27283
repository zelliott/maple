Achilles zzso zzso are common in middle-aged zzso Diagnosis is based on clinical examination or zzso Although zzso is commonly used to document zzso there is no literature supporting its routine use and we wondered whether it was zzso 

We zzso determined the sensitivity of physical examination in diagnosing acute Achilles zzso zzso compared the sensitivity of physical examination with that of zzso and zzso assessed care delays and impact attributable to zzso 

We zzso compared 66 patients with surgically confirmed acute Achilles zzso and zzso zzso with a control group of 66 patients without zzso zzso Clinical diagnostic criteria were an abnormal Thompson test, decreased resting tension, and palpable zzso Time to diagnosis and surgical procedures were compared with those of the control zzso 

All patients had all three clinical findings preoperatively and complete zzso zzso zzso of zzso MR images were read as complete tears in 60, partial in four, and zzso in two zzso It took a mean of zzso days to obtain zzso after the injury, zzso days for initial zzso and zzso days for surgical zzso In the control group, initial evaluation occurred at zzso days and surgical intervention at zzso days after zzso zzso patients in the zzso group had additional procedures whereas none of the control group patients had additional zzso 

Physical examination findings were more sensitive than zzso zzso is time zzso expensive, and can lead to treatment zzso zzso should rely on the history and physical examination for accurate diagnosis and reserve zzso for ambiguous presentations and zzso or chronic injuries for zzso zzso
