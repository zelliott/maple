The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction using Achilles zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso with respect to objective knee testing measures, zzso zzso and zzso tunnel zzso 

A total of 131 patients who underwent zzso reconstruction between 2000 and 2006 were zzso zzso Achilles zzso zzso were used in 81 patients zzso zzso These patients were compared with 50 patients in whom zzso zzso zzso were used zzso zzso The two groups were assessed using International zzso Documentation Committee zzso zzso and zzso activity scores, as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were zzso zzso area zzso perpendicular to the long axis of the zzso tunnel was also calculated digitally using magnetic resonance zzso 

No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to zzso zzso or zzso activity scores or the results of zzso testing with zzso zzso coverage of more than 50 % was found in zzso % cases in group I and 75 % cases in group zzso Mean zzso enlargement of 15 % zzso I) and 38 % zzso zzso was detected zzso zzso zzso 

The clinical results associated with Achilles and zzso zzso were not significantly zzso The zzso evaluation and zzso zzso demonstrated no significant differences between group I and group zzso However, Achilles zzso plugs for zzso tunnel fixation reduced zzso tunnel enlargement compared to the zzso zzso Achilles zzso zzso for zzso reconstruction could be a reasonable option in selected zzso
