In patients, early after acute zzso zzso zzso rapid magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques have been used to assess left zzso zzso structure, global and regional function, zzso artery zzso or contrast zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso could be used as a comprehensive evaluation of the zzso patient, studying all of these parameters in zzso 1 zzso zzso patients were studied after first zzso Complete examinations were performed in 23 patients, 16 with anterior and 7 with inferior wall zzso zzso on day 5 zzso 2 after the zzso For measurement of zzso structure and regional function, a zzso segmented zzso zzso echo tagging sequence was zzso A zzso segmented zzso zzso sequence was used for coronary artery zzso zzso zzso images during zzso zzso transit through the zzso were obtained to assess zzso contrast zzso No adverse events were noted during the zzso zzso which was completed in 46 zzso 5 zzso The zzso mass index, zzso and zzso volume indexes, and ejection fraction were zzso zzso zzso 107 zzso 13 zzso 87 zzso 23 zzso 54 zzso 20 zzso and 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso percent zzso zzso was 11 zzso zzso at the zzso 14 zzso zzso in the zzso and 15 zzso zzso at the zzso zzso within all zzso arteries was zzso zzso of 23 patients had regions of reduced contrast zzso on zzso imaging with mean signal intensity of 47 zzso zzso that of remote zzso In patients with recent zzso comprehensive assessment of zzso structure and function, zzso artery zzso and regional zzso contrast zzso was safe and feasible with zzso of zzso 1 zzso
