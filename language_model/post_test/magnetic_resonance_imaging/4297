Within the framework of statistical zzso there are up to now only two tests used to assess the regional significance in functional zzso One is based on the magnitude of the zzso and tends to detect high intensity signals, while the second is based on the spatial extent of regions defined by a simple zzso of the statistical map, a test that is more sensitive to extended zzso The aim of this paper is to combine the two tests into a single test that is more sensitive to a wider range of zzso This combined test is based on an zzso approximation of the distribution of these two parameters zzso and zzso and is applied in the context of statistical zzso The risk of error in zzso zzso or zzso volumes is assessed under a wide range of experimental conditions obtained by varying both the resolution of the map and the threshold at which clusters are zzso In addition, we have investigated this new test on simulated signals, and applied it to an experimental PET zzso The experimental risk of error is close to the predicted one, and the overall sensitivity increases when analyzing a volume containing different types of zzso
