zzso studies in late life depression have reported decreased structural integrity of white matter tracts in the prefrontal zzso zzso studies have identified changes in functional connectivity among several key areas involved in mood zzso Few studies have combined structural and functional zzso In this study we sought to examine the relationship between the zzso zzso a key zzso tract and resting state functional connectivity between the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The sample consisted of 24 older patients zzso from zzso major zzso Each participant had a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan using standardized protocols to obtain both diffusion zzso imaging and resting state functional connectivity zzso Our statistical approach compared structural integrity of the zzso zzso and functional connectivity zzso 

We found positive correlations between left zzso zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso and resting state functional connectivity zzso between the left zzso zzso and left zzso and between the left zzso zzso and the left zzso In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between left zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso The right zzso zzso did not correlate with any of the seed region based zzso 

These results support the notion that resting state functional connectivity reflects structural integrity, since the zzso zzso is structurally connected to zzso regions by the zzso Future studies should include larger samples of patients and healthy comparison subjects in which both resting state and zzso functional connectivity are zzso
