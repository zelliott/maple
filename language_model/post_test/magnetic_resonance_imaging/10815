Current knowledge of zzso cruciate ligament function is mainly based on in zzso zzso zzso There are few studies on the in zzso function of the zzso cruciate zzso The objective of the study was to zzso the zzso deformation of the zzso cruciate zzso 

During in zzso zzso zzso the zzso cruciate ligament zzso complex zzso zzso including zzso twist, and changes in zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images of 5 human knees were used to create zzso computer models of each zzso knee, including the zzso areas of the zzso cruciate zzso zzso zzso images of each zzso knee were acquired as a zzso zzso was zzso The images and computer models were used to reproduce the in zzso motion of the zzso The relative motion of the zzso and zzso insertions was described in terms of zzso twist, zzso (the angle between the zzso plateau and zzso cruciate zzso measured in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso orientation, measured in plane of zzso zzso 

The length of the zzso cruciate ligament increased significantly with increasing zzso It twisted almost 80 degrees as the knee zzso from 0 degrees to 90 degrees zzso The zzso angle remained relatively constant at 50 degrees zzso The zzso angle was zzso oriented by 20 degrees at full extension, then decreased to approximately 10 degrees at 30 degrees through 90 degrees of zzso 

The zzso cruciate ligament zzso a complex twisting motion as it zzso with zzso 

During zzso the tunnels and graft may need to be placed such that the zzso deformation of the intact zzso cruciate ligament is zzso
