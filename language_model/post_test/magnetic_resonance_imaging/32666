The increasingly widespread use of minimally invasive surgery has allowed surgeons to exploit this approach for complex procedures, such as pancreatic zzso though its actual role outside simple operations remains zzso 

This is a study of 12 consecutive patients, 5 men and 7 women, with pancreatic zzso who were treated at our institution from 2000 to September zzso All patients presented with typical symptoms and laboratory findings of zzso and were good candidates for zzso zzso zzso diagnostic zzso operating time, zzso complication rate, length of hospital zzso and clinical outcome were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was performed in 11 out of 12 zzso 4 had tumor zzso and 7 had zzso zzso among these latter 5 had zzso zzso zzso In 1 case conversion to open surgery was zzso Mean operative time was 170 zzso The median tumor size was 18 zzso and all the zzso were zzso Four complications were observed in this group, and the median hospital stay was 8 zzso 

The zzso approach proved to be feasible and safe, although the average operative time was longer and demanded good surgical skills as well as precise zzso of the tumor and definition of its zzso zzso located in the body or tail of the zzso that are benign in nature can better benefit of zzso zzso
