zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso zzso a devastating disorder characterized by zzso zzso gastrointestinal dysfunction and zzso To characterize zzso zzso and to correlate it with clinical, zzso and molecular data, four zzso patients with zzso clinical zzso zzso arthritis, exercise zzso zzso zzso and typical zzso were studied by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso weighted imaging zzso with apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps were also zzso In two patients we also investigated the role of brain zzso in monitoring the evolution of zzso by performing follow-up imaging studies at an zzso of one and two zzso The extension and distribution of zzso were not clearly linked with age, zzso or disease severity, and did not seem to be related to zzso zzso zzso activity or zzso zzso In the studied patients MRS revealed reduced zzso and increased zzso zzso Although zzso appeared normal in all patients but one, zzso maps always showed moderate increased zzso zzso worsened over a two-year period in two patients, regardless of the clinical course, indicating a lack of correlation between clinical zzso size and progression of white matter abnormalities during this zzso Brain zzso should be considered a very useful tool to diagnose both classical and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and treated zzso patients will help to establish whether the zzso is a zzso condition or zzso
