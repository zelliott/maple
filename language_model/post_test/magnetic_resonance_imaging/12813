The onset of progressive zzso zzso in early childhood is considered a key feature of zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso and hypersensitivity to zzso zzso 

We describe the clinical features and course of three Mennonite children who were diagnosed with zzso following the completion of therapy for zzso zzso 

Prior to cancer therapy, all had zzso zzso neurological zzso with onset by age 30 months, including zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso without zzso zzso zzso was noted in only one of the children and was mild until his death at age eight zzso None had severe zzso All three children were zzso of their zzso zzso but experienced severe adverse effects from the treatments zzso The two children who received zzso zzso developed zzso primitive zzso tumors of the brain, an association not previously zzso with fatal zzso 

The range of neurological presentations of zzso is zzso zzso and zzso may be minimal or absent and the course seemingly zzso The diagnosis of zzso should be considered in all children with zzso dysfunction or peripheral zzso particularly those who develop zzso zzso The consequences of missing the diagnosis may be zzso zzso therapy and zzso drugs should be avoided in individuals with zzso
