In heart valve tissue engineering, assessment of cell migration under dynamic states can provide insights on the evolving tissue zzso We labeled human vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and zzso them using magnetic resonance imaging zzso under steady zzso We determined that vascular cells were able to remain reasonably viable and zzso well after being labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso cells were successfully zzso using zzso zzso When zzso representative zzso stresses zzso zzso were applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso regions seemed to have decreased after 2 weeks in some locations, whereas others revealed sustained levels of zzso zzso similar observations were seen in the case of zzso zzso This could be attributable to increased zzso cell migratory activity, which occurred from the zzso mechanical cues received, which was not previously evidenced in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso were labeled with remarkably high zzso of zzso Moreover, steady fluid flow enhanced zzso cell migration of vascular zzso and zzso as well as zzso which, in turn, significantly improved construct zzso and zzso collagen zzso
