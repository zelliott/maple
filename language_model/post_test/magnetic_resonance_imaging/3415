zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso has recently revealed that several brain structures are involved in generalized spike and wave zzso zzso in idiopathic generalized zzso zzso In particular, zzso and zzso have been observed within the so-called brain default mode network zzso and thalamus, zzso In the present study we analyzed the dynamic time course of blood oxygen zzso zzso changes preceding and following 3 zzso zzso in a group of adolescent and adult patients with zzso who presented with absence zzso zzso Our aim was to evaluate cortical zzso changes before, zzso and after zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso analyses were run both at the zzso and at group level zzso zzso The zzso analysis was conducted for 3 s time windows before, zzso and after zzso and they were included until no further zzso signal changes were zzso 

Fifteen patients zzso female, mean age 28 zzso had zzso during zzso zzso zzso total events, mean duration 4 zzso zzso group analysis showed zzso increments starting approximately 10 s before zzso onset located in frontal and zzso cortical areas, and especially in the zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso increments were located in thalamus, zzso and anterior zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were observed in the zzso regions zzso until 9 s after zzso 

zzso changes zzso zzso occurred in specific cortical areas, namely the zzso cingulate, lateral zzso and frontal zzso several seconds before zzso onset of zzso A dysfunction of these brain regions, some of which belongs to the zzso may be crucial in generating zzso in patients with zzso
