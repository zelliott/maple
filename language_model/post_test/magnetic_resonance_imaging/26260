To assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso versus conventional zzso in patients with zzso zzso and to determine whether MR zzso can be considered an alternative to conventional zzso 

Thirteen patients with zzso zzso were examined by MR zzso and conventional zzso zzso resonance zzso employed zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso single and zzso zzso fast zzso zzso including source images with maximum intensity zzso The diagnostic value of MR zzso and conventional zzso was assessed and compared using the criteria of depiction of zzso anomalous zzso duct union and demonstration of complications such as zzso A zzso diagnostic scale was applied to the zzso of the zzso anatomy with the zzso zzso test and zzso test used for statistical zzso 

The depiction of the zzso zzso was significantly better with MR zzso than with conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso The detection rate of an anomalous zzso duct union was not significantly different with either method zzso zzso zzso nor was the detection rate of zzso duct stones zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance zzso provides data equivalent to or superior to those from conventional zzso in evaluating zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso is recommended as a zzso examination of choice for the evaluation of zzso zzso
