Central pain processing is altered in patients with zzso syndrome zzso The zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso seems to play an important zzso 

We investigated the effect of the local injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the perception and central processing of pain in zzso patients using painful mechanical stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso within the framework of a zzso zzso zzso 

In the zzso primary zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso cortex, we found that the zzso was significantly reduced after zzso On average, patients rated the zzso pain intensity as stronger in the session after treatment compared to before treatment, although the individual data revealed a zzso zzso All patients showed zzso during the painful zzso which was not influenced by the zzso 

Both the zzso and zzso components of pain as measured by zzso were altered by zzso
