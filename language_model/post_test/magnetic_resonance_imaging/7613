This study was used to test the feasibility of using additive fabrication techniques zzso zzso printing to create zzso zzso zzso physical models from clinical zzso studies for surgical resident zzso 

zzso imaging data from either zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging scans, in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format, were rendered and manipulated with computer software, translating the medical imaging data sets into useful zzso geometry files in stereo zzso format for zzso zzso A commercial third party was used to print the zzso models in laser zzso zzso which provided access to expensive, zzso high-resolution 3-D printers at a low zzso 

Multiple zzso zzso zzso physical models were printed of portal and zzso zzso anatomy at a cost of less than $100 per zzso 

Current zzso printing techniques can be used to create low-cost zzso zzso zzso models from clinical zzso studies for surgical resident zzso
