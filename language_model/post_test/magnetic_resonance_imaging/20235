In the setting of primary zzso coronary intervention, patients with a chronic total zzso in a zzso related artery were recently identified as a high-risk zzso It is unclear whether zzso zzso zzso patients with a chronic total zzso in a zzso related artery should undergo additional zzso coronary intervention of the chronic total zzso on top of optimal medical therapy shortly after primary zzso coronary zzso zzso beneficial effects include reduction in adverse left zzso zzso and preservation of global left zzso function and improved clinical outcome during future coronary zzso 

The Evaluating zzso V and left zzso function in zzso coronary intervention on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trial is a randomized, zzso zzso zzso trial with blinded evaluation of zzso Three hundred patients after primary zzso coronary intervention for zzso zzso zzso with a chronic total zzso in a zzso related artery are zzso to either zzso zzso coronary intervention of the chronic total zzso within seven days or standard medical zzso When assigned to the invasive arm, an zzso coronary zzso is zzso zzso zzso are left zzso ejection fraction and left zzso zzso volume assessed by cardiac zzso zzso Imaging at four zzso Clinical follow-up will continue until five zzso 

The ongoing zzso trial is the first zzso clinical trial powered to investigate whether zzso of a chronic total zzso in a zzso related artery after primary zzso coronary intervention for zzso zzso zzso results in a better preserved residual left zzso ejection zzso reduced zzso volume and enhanced clinical zzso
