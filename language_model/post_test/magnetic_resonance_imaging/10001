The aim of this study was to compare a zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso sequence with zzso free zzso zzso for the assessment of left zzso zzso The improved zzso border definition seen with zzso was not observed at the zzso zzso zzso in zzso at the left zzso zzso border have been observed with this zzso zzso Left zzso zzso mass and zzso zzso volume zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso were compared between images acquired with a dual inversion zzso and zzso zzso The zzso standard zzso zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso measured with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso This difference was not statistically significant zzso For zzso the mean value of zzso mass was zzso g and zzso g for zzso a statistically significant difference zzso The zzso zzso imaging showed improved zzso for zzso mass zzso compared with zzso and improved spatial zzso For studies requiring zzso mass zzso the zzso zzso sequence offers improved spatial resolution and improved zzso to zzso
