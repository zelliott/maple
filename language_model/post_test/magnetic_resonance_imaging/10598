The aim of this study was to estimate zzso zzso and zzso zzso values that lead to a validated zzso zzso for the zzso overall survival, in order to discriminate zzso patients with good and poor prognosis at an early stage during zzso zzso 

We studied patients who underwent zzso zzso and zzso before and after two courses of zzso zzso values were retrieved from the Cox zzso Patients were classified according to the zzso zzso values, creating zzso of patients with different prognosis in terms of survival zzso zzso zzso stable disease zzso zzso progression zzso The differences between the zzso were assessed by zzso zzso The zzso performance of the zzso procedure was evaluated by a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso classified zzso of the patients as zzso zzso as zzso and zzso as zzso zzso classified zzso of the patients as zzso and only zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso zzso Of those patients with a relatively long overall survival zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso estimates of zzso zzso zzso rates were 50% zzso and 50% zzso and zzso estimates of zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We constructed a zzso zzso model that makes it possible to identify zzso patients with a good or a poor prognosis at an early stage during zzso zzso With this model, accurate predictions can be made with regard to the expected duration of zzso
