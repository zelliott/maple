This paper reviews the recent development of a new high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging approach to visualizing small veins in the human brain with diameters in the zzso range, which is smaller than a zzso It briefly introduces the physical background of the underlying bulk magnetic zzso effects, on which this approach is based, and it demonstrates the successful application of the method for imaging different zzso zzso like zzso anomalies, zzso zzso and brain zzso The zzso difference between zzso blood and the surrounding tissue is used to generate zzso Using this method it is possible to zzso draining veins in zzso better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging methods, which often require application of a contrast medium or even conventional zzso zzso zzso of the method are zzso The ability to highlight zzso blood with high spatial resolution yields important vascular parameters which may be helpful for improved modeling of MR signal changes during functional brain zzso it may lead to a better understanding of brain function in diseased states, or it may even offer the possibility of zzso benign from zzso tumors zzso
