Little is known about long-term cognitive functioning and quality of life zzso in patients with symptomatic carotid artery zzso who do not undergo zzso zzso 

To assess the course of cognitive impairment and changes in zzso in these patients and whether impaired cerebral metabolism predicts the course of cognitive zzso 

In 73 consecutive patients with zzso or a minor stroke associated with an zzso of the internal carotid artery zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso follow-up study were zzso The presence of cerebral zzso zzso was examined by zzso the zzso zzso zzso ratio and the presence of zzso were measured by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to the symptomatic zzso zzso 

zzso percent of patients with a stroke and zzso of patients with a zzso were cognitively zzso In patients with zzso zzso during zzso cognitive functioning remained at the same zzso level zzso impairment zzso at baseline zzso at zzso follow-up zzso p zzso zzso In patients without zzso at baseline and without zzso symptoms during zzso cognitive functioning improved zzso impairment zzso at baseline zzso at zzso follow-up zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso remained affected at 12 months' zzso although not to a large extent zzso zzso from norm scores zzso 

In patients with a symptomatic zzso zzso cognitive functioning improved within zzso years after the zzso event, if no further symptoms occurred and patients had no zzso at zzso zzso zzso remained slightly zzso
