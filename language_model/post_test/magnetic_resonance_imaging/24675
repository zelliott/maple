To show the flexibility in magnetic resonance imaging zzso of seminal zzso zzso and zzso segment of zzso zzso for the patients with zzso absence of the zzso zzso zzso including zzso bilateral absence of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso unilateral absence of zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen consecutive patients with zzso had zzso zzso zzso and further zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso zzso and images of the zzso were zzso calculated in the zzso zzso zzso studies were performed with a zzso zzso system, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging of the pelvis was zzso If the zzso were present, then their size was measured for the zzso zzso and zzso All of the patients also received zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene zzso zzso 

In a series of 12 men with zzso only 4 were found to have bilateral zzso zzso using zzso The remaining 8 men with unilateral zzso still had zzso zzso zzso also detected the zzso segment of the zzso zzso Through our study of zzso zzso zzso is not well associated with the presence of zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso provides a precise zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso which is superior to the zzso examination for the patients with zzso Compared with the previous inaccurate examination method of zzso this study demonstrates that zzso can provide better images for the patients with zzso for the clinical diagnosis of existing defects of internal seminal tract and internal zzso
