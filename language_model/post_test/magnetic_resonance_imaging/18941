The relationship between zzso measures of zzso and sustained attention and structural brain differences in the regions of the zzso and the frontal region was examined in males with attention deficit disorder with zzso zzso 

Ten males with zzso zzso zzso and 11 male controls zzso zzso participated in a zzso evaluation and had a magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

As had been reported previously by these authors, the children with zzso were found to have reversed asymmetry of the head of the zzso smaller volume of the left zzso head, and smaller volume of the white matter of the right frontal zzso Children with zzso were found to score more poorly on measures of zzso and sustained attention but not on measures of zzso achievement, or motor zzso zzso of zzso measures and brain structure measures indicated a significant relationship between reversed zzso asymmetry and measures of zzso and zzso zzso zzso children with reversed zzso asymmetry performed more poorly on measures of zzso regardless of group zzso Poorer performance on sustained attention tasks was related to smaller volume of the zzso white zzso 

There is emerging evidence that compromised brain zzso of selected regions is related to behavioral measures of zzso and zzso
