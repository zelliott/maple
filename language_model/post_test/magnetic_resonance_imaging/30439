Patients with unilateral zzso failure zzso experience zzso zzso motion of the visual zzso during rapid head movements due to increased retinal slip caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso is always smaller than the net retinal slip and decreases over time in patients with acquired zzso zzso this zzso with increased thresholds for visual motion detection and increased tolerance to retinal zzso We investigated the underlying cortical zzso processes using visual motion stimulation during blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in seven patients with zzso and seven patients with zzso unilateral zzso zzso and in seven zzso and zzso healthy zzso Patients showed diminished zzso of bilateral visual zzso areas (including the zzso area zzso zzso middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso motor regions compared to their controls during visual motion zzso zzso zzso signal decreases of zzso and insular zzso cortical areas occurred in controls and zzso The diminished zzso of visual motion processing areas zzso reflects an zzso mechanism that suppresses zzso zzso in patients with zzso and thereby zzso the perceived visual zzso This study provides for the first time zzso evidence of suppressed cortical visual motion processing in patients with zzso
