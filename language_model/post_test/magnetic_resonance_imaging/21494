zzso volumes including left zzso mass were determined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 30 patients using a zzso zzso zzso Eleven patients were studied on two different zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso variation were zzso For volume zzso the standard zzso of differences zzso was rather constant, independent of the size of the measured volume indicating lower zzso zzso in measuring large zzso zzso zzso was noticed for left zzso zzso mass estimates between observers as well as between zzso In 13 patients left zzso mass was estimated by this technique as well as by a method using only one long axis and four short axis slices and by two-dimensional zzso Although highly zzso limits of agreement between the methods were too wide to accept interchangeable clinical use of the zzso
