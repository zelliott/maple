To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional MR zzso in the evaluation of traumatic injuries of the zzso zzso 

Twenty patients with clinical and zzso evidence of traumatic zzso zzso were examined with three-dimensional MR zzso conventional cervical zzso and CT zzso 1 to 9 months after zzso zzso MR zzso was performed on a zzso MR unit with a constructive interference in steady state zzso zzso For each patient, maximum intensity zzso projections and zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso sections were obtained from the same 3-D data zzso zzso MR zzso findings were compared with findings at cervical zzso and CT zzso zzso findings were available for comparison in 13 zzso 

zzso MR zzso enabled detection of zzso with zzso or intact nerve roots, partial or complete zzso zzso without disruption of the zzso zzso zzso sleeve zzso and zzso zzso Assuming cervical zzso and CT zzso as the standards of reference, 3-D MR zzso showed zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of nerve root zzso 

zzso MR zzso can show the majority of traumatic zzso that involve the zzso portion of the zzso zzso in a single rapid zzso On the basis of our findings, we propose this technique as a screening examination for patients with traumatic zzso zzso zzso
