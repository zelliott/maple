zzso tumor and zzso are commonly observed with magnetic resonance zzso imaging following zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images of zzso following treatment with zzso were zzso analyzed to evaluate whether zzso changes associated with residual tumors, zzso tumors, and zzso could be distinguished 1 month and 3-6 months after zzso 

MR images were analyzed for 108 patients who completed zzso for zzso and underwent zzso of zzso The presence and zzso of residual tumor versus zzso was evaluated and compared with zzso tumor recurrence zzso 

zzso tumors were detected in zzso zzso patients 1 month after zzso and in zzso zzso patients 3-6 months after zzso Fibrosis was only detected in zzso zzso patients 3-6 months after zzso After 5 years, tumor recurrence occurred in zzso zzso patients, with the average zzso between tumor recurrence and the completion of zzso being zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the images zzso significant differences in tumor recurrence and residual tumor rate zzso zzso zzso and between tumor recurrence and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed 1 month and 3-6 months after zzso zzso 

In this zzso tumor recurrence was detected 2-3 year after zzso and a strong correlation between zzso recurrence rate and detection of residual tumor or zzso by zzso up to six months after zzso was zzso
