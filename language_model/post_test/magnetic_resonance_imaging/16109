One hundred and zzso elderly individuals aged zzso 60 without neurological deficits were zzso zzso deep white matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were rated zzso zzso in each category were then divided into three groups zzso zzso grade II, grade zzso according to the zzso zzso 

Plasma zzso levels were positively associated with grades of zzso (for zzso zzso in grade zzso zzso in grade II, and zzso in grade III, zzso for zzso zzso in grade zzso zzso in grade II, and zzso in grade III, zzso zzso analysis showed higher zzso levels, age and hypertension were the independent risk factors associated with the presence and severity of zzso More than zzso increased risk of zzso was observed in patients with the highest zzso of zzso (all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Increased plasma zzso suggests inflammatory process may be involved in the zzso of zzso
