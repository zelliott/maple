The aim of the study was to determine whether the reduction in brain zzso matter volume associated with hypertension persisted or was zzso among zzso patients newly treated over the course of a zzso A total of 41 zzso patients were assessed over the course of a zzso successful zzso zzso Brain areas identified previously in zzso studies differing in volume between zzso and zzso individuals were examined with a zzso measurement technique zzso zzso zzso Volumes of zzso matter regions were zzso at baseline after a year of treatment and compared with archival data from zzso zzso zzso in regional zzso matter volume over the follow-up period were observed despite successful treatment of blood pressure zzso The comparison group of older, but zzso individuals showed no significant changes over a year in the regions tested in the treated zzso zzso These novel results suggest that essential hypertension is associated with regional zzso matter zzso and successful reduction of zzso may not completely counter that zzso
