zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has emerged during the last decade as the main zzso technique for the investigation of human brain zzso More recently, zzso was also proposed for functional studies of the human spinal cord, but with controversial zzso In fact, the functional contrast is not zzso and even its origin has been zzso In the present work, we characterized the zzso features of the functional signal evoked in the human spinal zzso by a motor task, studied with an approach based on zzso averaging of functional time series of different zzso Based on the results here reported, we defined an zzso function zzso able to explain the functional response for motor tasks in the zzso of zzso s of zzso thus suggesting the zzso of the phenomenon in this zzso zzso with stimulation zzso ranging between 3 and 9 zzso the functional signal was not zzso and was under the level predicted by a linear behavior, suggesting zzso from zzso during short zzso The zzso function appeared slower than in the brain, zzso at about 9 s after its zzso The observed contrast was generally larger than in the brain, on the order of about zzso of baseline signal at zzso zzso The findings further suggested that the zzso origin of zzso weighted functional imaging is similar in the spinal zzso and in the zzso
