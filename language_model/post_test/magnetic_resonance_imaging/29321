The exact role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in visually directed reaching is zzso We propose that, by building an internal representation of instantaneous hand location, zzso zzso a dynamic motor error used by motor centers to correct the ongoing zzso With unseen right hands, five subjects pointed to visual targets that either remained stationary or moved during zzso eye zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso was applied over the left zzso during target zzso zzso disrupted path corrections that normally occur in response to target jumps, but had no effect on those directed at stationary zzso Furthermore, zzso movement corrections were not zzso ruling out visual or zzso effects of zzso
