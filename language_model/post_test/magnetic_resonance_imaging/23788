A magnetic resonance imaging zzso method was used for a zzso study of current density zzso and current pathways zzso inside the skull during zzso zzso in zzso The zzso impulse current directions studied were those previously used in zzso electric treatment either zzso or zzso zzso data were collected from slices perpendicular to the direction of current zzso In these zzso only the perpendicular component of the CD was zzso Computer methods for accurate zzso mapping of the main areas with high CD and for reconstruction of zzso are zzso It was revealed that current applied on the head zzso passed mostly through the zzso fluid in the zzso brain zzso connected in series, and through the anterior horns of the lateral zzso zzso of zzso zzso part of the third zzso zzso and fourth zzso zzso connections between these zzso are zzso zzso applied current passed through the brain and skull core more zzso without zzso in zzso and zzso The results of the present study suggest an explanation for the observation that zzso applied current more effectively stimulates brain structures with zzso function and elicits more pronounced zzso zzso
