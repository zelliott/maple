zzso zzso has a prevalence of approximately zzso in the zzso Central zzso have been described in zzso but there is not consensus with respect to the role of peripheral factors for the maintenance of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso has been used to investigate the metabolism of zzso in muscles of zzso patients, but the results in the literature are not in zzso The aim was to investigate the quantitative content of zzso and pH in resting zzso muscle of patients with zzso zzso and in healthy controls zzso zzso using zzso zzso It was also investigated whether the zzso of these substances correlated with measures of pain and/or physical zzso 

zzso lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso No significant group differences existed with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso muscle fat content was significantly higher in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly lower hand and leg capacity according to specific physical test, but there were no group differences in body mass index, zzso activity level and in zzso zzso In zzso the specific physical capacity in the leg and the hand correlated positively with the zzso of zzso and zzso no significant correlations were found with pain zzso 

zzso in intramuscular zzso zzso and fat content in zzso probably reflect a combination of zzso related to pain and dysfunction of muscle zzso
