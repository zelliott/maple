The use of zzso wide zzso zzso has the potential to assess entire groups of genetic disorders in one application and has begun to emerge as an aid to diagnosis in clinical zzso zzso families may suffer from diseases because of zzso of zzso zzso zzso tracks can be easily identified by using these high zzso zzso zzso allowing the rapid mapping of zzso segments that may be associated with the zzso According to this, we performed zzso mapping using zzso wide zzso zzso in a North Indian family with an zzso zzso disorder of zzso zzso cognitive decline and visual zzso In this zzso a large number of zzso regions were zzso In zzso analysis was also carried zzso The zzso gene found in one of the zzso tracks has genetic defects previously reported with a similar zzso as our zzso zzso it was the most likely candidate gene and at large the first to be zzso A zzso zzso two base pair zzso segregating with the disease was zzso expanding the spectrum of disease seen in zzso and proving that the genetic zzso underlying zzso disorders can rapidly identify by employing zzso zzso along with detailed candidate gene zzso
