zzso models of text processing, such as the zzso zzso pose fundamental questions about zzso zzso making that are not easily addressed by behavioral zzso In particular, a common result is that zzso zzso has a different effect on text reading times than on memory for the zzso Whereas reading times increase zzso as zzso zzso zzso memory for the text is best for events that are related by a moderate degree of zzso zzso and is poorer for events with low and high zzso Our functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the processing of zzso passages that varied in their degree of zzso zzso suggests that the zzso process can be analyzed into two zzso generation and integration, that are zzso by two large-scale cortical networks (a reasoning system in zzso prefrontal zzso and the zzso language zzso These two cortical networks, which are distinguishable from the classical zzso language areas, approximately zzso to the two functional relations observed in the behavioral zzso
