The traditional approach to studying brain function is to measure zzso responses to controlled zzso motor and cognitive zzso However, most of the zzso energy consumption is devoted to ongoing zzso activity not clearly associated with any particular stimulus or zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the zzso signal occur continuously in the resting zzso In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that zzso the functional architecture of responses evoked by zzso administered zzso Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in zzso monkeys even at zzso levels known to induce profound loss of zzso We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human zzso Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an zzso zzso aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of zzso
