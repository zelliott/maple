To determine the accuracy of high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso against surgical and zzso standards in Crohn's disease, and to determine quantitative zzso findings that can differentiate minor from advanced zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients who underwent 51 surgical procedures underwent standard zzso and zzso prior to zzso zzso images were assessed for superficial ulcers, deep ulcers, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso such as mural zzso enhancement ratios zzso of the abnormal zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso were zzso zzso findings were compared with surgical and zzso results to obtain sensitivity, zzso and zzso zzso of inflammation was compared with zzso parameters for correlation and discriminating zzso 

The sensitivities and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the detection of abnormal segments were zzso and zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly more sensitive than zzso and zzso in the detection of superficial and deep ulcers, zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso versus zzso zzso versus zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ME had positive correlation with higher grades of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed deep and superficial ulcers, zzso and mural thickness zzso were independent zzso of advanced zzso 

zzso has significantly greater diagnostic accuracy as compared to zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ulcers, mural enhancement ratio zzso are strong zzso of advanced zzso
