zzso the human zzso region is of interest in image analysis mainly because it can be used for zzso separation and as a zzso step for zzso structure zzso Many existing methods focus on only one of these zzso 

Here a new zzso and zzso based zzso Surface extraction method zzso that enables both applications is zzso A combination of zzso intensity and local symmetry is used to zzso a surface from zzso zzso 

zzso was evaluated in regard to cerebral zzso separation using manual zzso It was also evaluated in regard to being a zzso step for zzso structure zzso using manually placed zzso 

zzso were compared to cerebral zzso zzso by zzso and zzso as well as to a zzso plane zzso extraction zzso zzso had less zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had less zzso zzso than zzso for one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but failed to produce usable results for zzso Total zzso distance from all manual landmarks did not differ significantly between zzso and the MSP method zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was found successful in both cerebral zzso separation and as a zzso step for zzso structure zzso It needs no time consuming zzso and extracts the zzso surface in less than 30 zzso
