A brain image registration algorithm, referred to as zzso is proposed to achieve fast and accurate image registration with the help of an intermediate template generated by a statistical deformation zzso The statistical deformation model is built by principal component analysis zzso on a set of training samples of brain deformation fields that zzso a selected template image to the individual brain zzso The statistical deformation model is capable of characterizing individual brain zzso by a small number of zzso which is used to rapidly estimate the brain deformation between the template and a new individual brain zzso The estimated deformation is then used to zzso the template, thus generating an intermediate template close to the individual brain zzso Finally, the shape difference between the intermediate template and the individual brain is estimated by an image registration algorithm, zzso zzso The overall registration between the template and the individual brain image can be achieved by directly combining the deformation fields that zzso the template to the intermediate template, and the intermediate template to the individual brain zzso The zzso has been validated for spatial zzso of both simulated and real magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain zzso Compared with zzso the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed zzso can achieve over five times zzso with similar registration accuracy and statistical power in detecting brain zzso
