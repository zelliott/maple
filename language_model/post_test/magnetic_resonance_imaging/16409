White matter zzso zzso are frequently characterized as markers of cerebrovascular disease, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recognized marker of zzso disease zzso Our purpose was to test the reliability of a visual rating system zzso in evaluating zzso and zzso and in distinguishing healthy from cognitively impaired zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso enrolled in the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were diagnosed with no cognitive zzso zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso or probable zzso The severity of zzso was assessed on zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso MR images, and the severity of zzso was evaluated on zzso zzso MR images by using a computer-based visual rating zzso zzso risk factor scores were calculated as the sum of 10 independent cardiovascular risk zzso 

zzso and zzso scores were greater in subjects with probable zzso relative to those with no cognitive impairment and zzso zzso scores differentiated subjects with zzso from those with no cognitive impairment and zzso The total zzso score was significantly related to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not to cardiovascular risk factor scores zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso The overall correct zzso rate of probable zzso versus no cognitive impairment by using zzso scores was zzso improving to zzso when combined with zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso scores distinguished subjects with no cognitive impairment and probable zzso Combining zzso and zzso scores improved the correct zzso rate, whereas zzso scores were significantly related to zzso scores, but not to cardiovascular risk factor zzso This finding suggests that among subjects with zzso and probable zzso zzso on MR images are primarily associated with neurodegenerative zzso
