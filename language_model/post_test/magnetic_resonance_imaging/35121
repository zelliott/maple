zzso stress disorder zzso is known to be associated with altered zzso prefrontal zzso in response to threatening stimuli and with zzso deficits in prefrontal functions such as working memory and zzso Given the importance of these areas and processes for decision-making, this functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated whether decision-making is altered in patients with zzso In particular, the neural response to gain and loss feedback was evaluated in a decision-making task in which subjects could zzso their number of points total by learning a particular response zzso zzso controls learned the correct response pattern faster than zzso zzso patients and controls differed in their neural response to gains, but not in their response to zzso During the processing of gains in the late phase of learning, zzso patients as compared to controls showed lower zzso in the nucleus zzso and the zzso zzso critical structures in the reward zzso This reduced zzso was not due to different rates of learning, since it was similarly present in patients with zzso learning zzso These findings suggest that positive outcome information lost its zzso for patients with zzso This may reflect decreasing motivation as the task zzso
