This study investigated whether repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is helpful in the zzso of zzso zones and whether it can provide information confirming that an area of increased zzso is really the culprit zzso zzso zzso repeated zzso zzso studies were performed in 24 patients with ambiguous or unexpected findings on the first zzso zzso zzso These patients were enrolled from among 502 patients with intractable zzso in whom zzso zzso of zzso zones was attempted with a view to possible surgical zzso Video monitoring of zzso zzso and zzso was performed in all zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when there was no prominently zzso area or when unexpected findings were obtained during the first zzso Two zzso zzso studies were performed in 19 patients, three studies in four patients and four studies in one zzso The average delay between zzso onset and injection was 28 s for the first study and 22 s for the second, third and fourth zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired and zzso with the population magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso study and surgery were performed in 18 patients, and in these cases the surgical outcome was zzso In the other six patients, zzso zzso were determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two patients were found to have zzso zzso lobe zzso two lateral zzso lobe zzso eight frontal lobe zzso three zzso lobe zzso and one zzso lobe zzso The other eight had zzso zzso The first study was normal in 12 patients zzso I) and indicated certain zones to be zzso in the other 12 zzso zzso Among group I, the correct zzso zone or zzso was revealed at the repeated study in nine patients, while in the other three it was zzso Among group II, six patients showed the same results at the second study, thus confirming that the initially identified zones were of zzso zzso In the other six patients, different areas were identified on the first and second studies, and repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso findings in zzso These results indicate that repeated zzso zzso is useful because it can yield new or additional information about the zzso zones and can confirm that a region of interest is an zzso zone or that the zzso is of zzso zzso
