zzso profile of 25 patients with zzso zzso due to zzso Hodgkin's zzso and zzso is zzso The main objective was to study the signal intensity pattern of the zzso zzso zzso both in plain and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso and find out its potential value in the zzso Fifteen patients of zzso zzso zzso 5 patients of Hodgkin's zzso and 5 patients of zzso zzso were studied by zzso T Siemens, zzso Both intensity and enhancement pattern were zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared zzso in both zzso and zzso On contrast administration multiple zzso zzso were seen in 14 out of 15 zzso The zzso zzso zzso revealed solitary or multiple zzso central zzso in zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso Though the zzso zzso revealed mild to moderate type of enhancement, the zzso zzso revealed dense enhancement of the multiple zzso which were seen in zzso zzso zzso the MR characteristics of the zzso zzso may be useful index in evaluating the zzso of the zzso zzso
