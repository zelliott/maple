zzso disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disease that causes zzso cognitive and psychiatric zzso including an early decline in ability to recognize emotional states in zzso The zzso underlying the earliest manifestations of the disease is not fully understood; the objective of our study was to clarify zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate changes in brain mechanisms of emotion recognition in zzso carriers of the abnormal zzso disease gene zzso with zzso zzso zzso 16 subjects with zzso zzso disease and 14 control subjects underwent zzso zzso magnetic resonance scanning while viewing pictures of facial expressions from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso anger and happiness were chosen as emotions of zzso zzso is the emotion in which recognition deficits have most commonly been detected in zzso zzso anger is the emotion in which impaired recognition was detected in the largest zzso study of emotion recognition in zzso zzso disease to date; and happiness is a positive emotion to contrast with disgust and zzso zzso facial expressions were also used to zzso emotion recognition accuracy outside the scanner and structural magnetic resonance imaging with zzso zzso was used to assess the relationship between emotion recognition accuracy and regional zzso matter zzso zzso processing in zzso zzso disease was associated with reduced neural activity for all three emotions in partially zzso functional zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso of disgust and happiness processing was zzso correlated with genetic markers of zzso disease progression in distributed, largely zzso zzso The modulated disgust network included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso right zzso right thalamus, zzso middle zzso middle zzso right superior and left inferior zzso zzso and left superior zzso zzso The modulated happiness network included zzso zzso left zzso right zzso cortex, right superior and inferior zzso zzso and right superior zzso middle zzso middle zzso and zzso zzso These effects were not driven merely by zzso zzso We did not find equivalent associations between brain structure and emotion recognition, and the zzso zzso disease cohort did not have a zzso deficit in zzso emotion recognition relative to zzso In addition, we found increased neural activity in the zzso subjects in response to all three emotions in frontal regions, predominantly in the middle frontal zzso Overall, these findings suggest that zzso effects of zzso disease may zzso the development of overt clinical symptoms and zzso cerebral zzso
