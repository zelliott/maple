To study the feasibility of using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso which is sensitive to the diffusion of water molecules in zzso for detection of early tumor response to radiation zzso and to evaluate the additional information obtained from high zzso which is more sensitive to zzso water molecules (such as zzso or bound zzso in increasing the sensitivity to zzso 

Standard zzso and zzso were acquired before and at regular intervals after initiating radiation therapy for 10 zzso brain zzso in eight zzso 

One week zzso three of six responding zzso showed an increase in the conventional zzso zzso Another three responding zzso showed no zzso Four zzso zzso showed a decrease or no zzso The early change in the diffusion parameters was enhanced by using high zzso When high zzso was used, all responding zzso showed increase in the diffusion zzso and all zzso zzso showed no change or zzso Response was determined by standard zzso 7 weeks zzso The changes in the diffusion parameters measured 1 week after initiating treatment were correlated with later tumor response or no response zzso zzso This correlation was increased to P zzso when high zzso was zzso 

The significant correlation between changes in diffusion parameters 1 week after initiating treatment and later tumor response or no response suggests the feasibility of using zzso for early, zzso prediction of tumor zzso The ability to predict response may enable early termination of treatment in zzso patients, prevent additional zzso and allow for early changes in zzso
