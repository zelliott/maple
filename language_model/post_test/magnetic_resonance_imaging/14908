The precise zzso of the site of origin of a premature zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso would facilitate the planning and execution of the zzso zzso Current zzso imaging zzso techniques require body surface zzso a costly and complex zzso that requires as many as 256 leads to zzso the zzso zzso We developed and tested a novel zzso zzso based zzso technique utilizing the readily available zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso 

The major components of the zzso zzso method are: the source model, proximity effect and spatial orientation, volume conductor, and patient specific model of the heart, zzso and zzso as derived from magnetic resonance imaging zzso For the zzso origin zzso the fastest route zzso is used on patient specific models created by newly developed morphing zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was correlated to the site of successful zzso 

Seven patients that underwent zzso mapping and zzso of zzso were zzso All patients zzso had accurate prediction of the zzso zzso However in two patients, no specific zzso was used for zzso that resulted in an incorrect switch between the RV free wall and zzso of the zzso With zzso models, these latter two cases would likely be localized zzso 

This feasibility study of a novel zzso zzso zzso using only the standard zzso zzso shows promise to zzso the origin of zzso This zzso method yields zzso estimates of zzso on both zzso from which the zzso origin location is zzso This method has the capability to zzso the zzso from any part of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso
