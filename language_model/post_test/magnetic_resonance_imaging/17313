zzso magnetic resonance image makes it possible to examine the zzso anatomy of the zzso portion of the zzso nerve in patients with zzso The zzso diameters of the zzso portion of the zzso nerve and its zzso space were measured on zzso images just behind the zzso in the middle of the latter and the zzso zzso and at the zzso zzso in 10 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with zzso In patients with zzso the diameter of the zzso space of the zzso nerve was increased as compared with that in the control zzso In its moderate form, that of the zzso nerve was significantly increased as compared to the control zzso In patients with severe zzso and secondary zzso the diameter of the zzso nerve just behind the zzso was significantly less than that in patients with moderate zzso It may be suggested that elevated zzso pressure leads to the zzso zzso space of the zzso zzso The clinical and X-ray signs of zzso of the zzso nerve are zzso in patients with severe zzso and secondary zzso
