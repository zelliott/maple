Several methods of flip angle mapping for magnetic resonance imaging have been zzso We evaluated the accuracy of five methods of flip angle measurement in the presence of measurement zzso Our analysis was performed in a closed form by propagation of probability density functions zzso The flip angle mapping methods compared were zzso the zzso method, zzso the zzso method using zzso recalled echoes zzso zzso an extended version of the zzso zzso method incorporating phase information, zzso the zzso method and zzso an extended version of the zzso method incorporating phase zzso Our analysis took into account differences in required imaging time for these methods in the comparison of noise zzso zzso of the flip angle estimate for each method for each value of true flip angle were zzso These zzso completely characterize the performance of each zzso Mean bias and standard zzso were zzso from these zzso to more simply zzso the relative accuracy of each method over its range of measurable flip zzso We demonstrate that the zzso method provides the lowest mean bias and standard zzso of flip angle estimate of the five methods evaluated over a wide range of flip zzso
