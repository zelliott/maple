The objective of this study was to evaluate zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso for the monitoring of regional zzso zzso in patients with soft tissue zzso of the lower zzso and zzso 

zzso MR monitoring during zzso was performed in 9 patients who had high-risk soft tissue zzso of the lower zzso or pelvis during zzso chemotherapy plus zzso in the scope of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer zzso Society for zzso Oncology zzso zzso zzso and zzso data sets were acquired every 10 minutes before and during zzso zzso zzso with variable echo zzso MR temperature zzso were derived from the phase differences by using the zzso frequency shift zzso A phase zzso setting phase shifts to zero in the fat tissue was performed as a drift zzso The mean MR temperatures in the tumor and muscles and the index temperatures zzso zzso which covers zzso of the target zzso and zzso doses were determined and compared with zzso responses and direct temperature zzso if zzso 

Thirty of 72 zzso data sets zzso of heat zzso were zzso A significant correlation was observed between zzso response zzso as a necrosis rate zzso and standardized zzso zzso such as zzso dose cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C to zzso of the target volume zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation of 13 conventional temperature zzso performed in selected patients and sessions zzso in the tumor or zzso in zzso and zzso revealed an excellent correlation with MR temperatures zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR zzso of soft tissue zzso was feasible and suitable for zzso the quality of heating during zzso
