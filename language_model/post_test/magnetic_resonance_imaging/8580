zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso can be classified into single domain zzso and multiple domain zzso zzso However, there have been no studies that specifically investigate the structural differences that support this zzso In an attempt to compare regional cortical thickness in two zzso of zzso we aimed to map the distribution of cortical thinning using a surface based cortical analysis of magnetic resonance zzso The cortical thickness across the entire brain was measured in 9 patients with zzso 22 patients with zzso and 61 normal healthy zzso zzso in the patterns of cortical thinning between zzso and zzso were assessed using zzso on a zzso basis, and statistical maps of differences in cortical thickness between the groups were constructed using a surface zzso Relative to controls, zzso patients showed cortical thinning in the left zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients showed cortical thinning in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior and inferior zzso zzso insular, and zzso association zzso When the two zzso groups were directly zzso zzso patients showed cortical thinning in left zzso Our studies suggest that zzso is a transitional state between zzso and Alzheimer's disease, and that the cortical thinning is evidence that the zzso is responsible for the multiple cognitive zzso in zzso
