The formation of a zzso bridge across the growth plate was studied with magnetic resonance zzso imaging, zzso and zzso examination in 12 zzso zzso studies performed zzso weeks after the creation of a zzso in the zzso demonstrated zzso bone formation with no evidence of cartilage zzso zzso enhancement indicated the development of zzso through the plate, which preceded the formation of a zzso zzso Enhancement was faint at 4 days after surgery, was zzso at 1 week, was zzso at 2 weeks, and decreased at 3 weeks and beyond as the zzso was replaced by zzso A dark rim representing bone deposition at the periphery of the zzso was seen at 2 zzso At 4 weeks and beyond, the bridge was seen as a dark band of dense bone or as a wider area that was zzso with adjacent fatty zzso zzso in the cartilage and development of zzso zzso which zzso the formation of a zzso bridge after zzso can be detected with MR zzso
