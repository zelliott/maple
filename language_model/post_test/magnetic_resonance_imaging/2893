zzso resonance imaging with zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to study relationships between zzso blood flow patterns and the geometry of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Ten patients with 13 zzso zzso zzso single or zzso or zzso zzso participated in the zzso The causes of disease were zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso trauma zzso and unknown zzso and there were two zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso mapping in 10 zzso thick slices with vertical and horizontal zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the two zzso components were processed into multiple computer-generated streaks whose orientation and length corresponded to zzso zzso in the chosen zzso The dynamic zzso maps were compared with previously reported zzso zzso maps from normal zzso The forward flow occupied the entire zzso in the normal zzso in zzso and small zzso were only present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the ascending zzso were located at the anterior right and had zzso eccentric jet flows that created a large secondary vortex in the zzso Patients with zzso syndrome had a central jet and two large zzso one on each zzso All other zzso zzso and zzso had irregular flows and zzso not seen in normal zzso zzso resonance imaging with zzso zzso mapping is a powerful zzso tool to assess zzso features and disturbed blood flow in zzso zzso and zzso zzso altered flow patterns were found to be associated with altered vessel zzso The significance of this requires further zzso
