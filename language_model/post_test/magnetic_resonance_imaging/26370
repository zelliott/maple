zzso evoked magnetic fields zzso were recorded to investigate the interaction of the zzso zzso using the zzso of electrical finger stimulation in 6 normal zzso 

zzso stimuli were given to the index zzso middle zzso or little zzso fingers individually, and also to pairs of either the II and III zzso or the II and V zzso The interaction ratio zzso was calculated as the ratio of the zzso zzso by simultaneous zzso stimulation to the zzso summed zzso zzso of two zzso zzso 

zzso showed 3 major zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso revealed a clear zzso organization in the primary sensory zzso zzso in the sequence of II, III and zzso while the zzso showed a cluster with zzso location compared with zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso had a significantly greater zzso in II and III stimulation compared to that in II and V zzso The zzso also showed a similar trend in the zzso but was greater than that of zzso In contrast, the zzso in zzso showed no such zzso 

The interaction of zzso was most influenced when adjacent receptive fields were activated in the zzso of electrical finger zzso Our results were consistent with the concept that the zzso areas in zzso which produce the 3 components of the zzso have different functional zzso
