Gender differences in brain zzso have previously been reported in the zzso lobe and an zzso dosage zzso has been described in Turner syndrome zzso To examine this further, we investigated zzso lobe zzso metabolism and function in nine children with zzso Turner syndrome using magnetic resonance imaging, zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso testing and compared outcomes with results from nine zzso control girls zzso Turner subjects were found to have significantly larger superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso The size of the zzso lobe was found to correlate zzso with zzso lobe zzso compounds suggesting that increased zzso lobe size is associated with larger cells and/or decreased zzso This suggests a zzso failure to prune zzso The degree of enlargement zzso zzso with functional performance on zzso associated tasks, suggesting that the enlargement may be a zzso zzso or possibly zzso in the case of semantic zzso zzso These zzso lobe abnormalities are discussed with reference to genes which are absent in Turner syndrome and to hormonal differences between Turner syndrome subjects and zzso zzso
