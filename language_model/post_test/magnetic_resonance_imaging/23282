Previous zzso experiments showed an involvement of the zzso in the processing of zzso direction in joint zzso Since zzso direction can also be used for the assessment of another person's zzso focus, we compared the mechanisms underlying the processing of zzso and zzso direction using a combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso actively followed the zzso or zzso direction of a person in a photograph towards one of seven possible targets by moving their zzso We showed that the right zzso superior zzso zzso zzso as well as the right zzso zzso zzso were involved in both processing of zzso as well as zzso zzso Another finding was a bilateral zzso of a distinct area in the middle zzso zzso as well as the left anterior zzso zzso that was stronger when subjects followed zzso direction than when they followed zzso zzso We assume that this zzso is based on an active suppression of information arising from the distracting other directional zzso zzso zzso direction in the zzso direction task and zzso direction in the zzso direction zzso These results further support the hypothesis that the human equivalent of the gaze sensitive area in monkeys lies in more anterior parts of the zzso than previously zzso
