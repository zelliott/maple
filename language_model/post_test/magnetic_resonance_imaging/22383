The zzso between zzso changes in zzso activity and the zzso zzso response is central to the interpretation of zzso zzso In the present study, zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso such as cocaine and zzso zzso such as zzso and D1 zzso zzso induced large positive increases in relative cerebral blood volume zzso that were not sensitive to zzso oxide zzso zzso However, zzso zzso antagonism with zzso prevented or blocked the zzso response without any zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, induced negative changes in zzso in brain regions corresponding largely to those endowed with these zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso of responsive brain areas, while zzso and D3 receptors were not consistently associated with the zzso zzso D3 receptors had an zzso zzso Together, these experiments show that direct effects of zzso upon the zzso cannot be ignored in measuring the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso These results further suggest that this zzso is partially zzso through zzso receptors on the zzso leading to increased zzso and through zzso D3 receptors leading to decreased zzso These data provide additional support for the role of local zzso events in zzso zzso and emphasize that the interpretation of zzso signals exclusively in terms of zzso activity may be zzso
