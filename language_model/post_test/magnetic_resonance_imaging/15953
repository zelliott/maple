To determine the diagnostic performance of dynamic zzso resonance imaging zzso in the identification of zzso cancer zzso related to cancer volume at zzso in patients with clinically localized cancer treated by radical zzso with zzso zzso sections as the reference zzso 

zzso consecutive radical zzso specimens from patients referred for a zzso zzso zzso were correlated with zzso zzso zzso results ranked on a zzso scale were correlated with the findings of zzso maps in 8 prostate sectors, including volume, largest surface area, and percentage of zzso grade zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was zzso 

Median zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was suspicious in 55 zzso out of 83 zzso A separate cancer zzso zzso zzso per zzso was present in 212 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was suspicious in 68 of zzso zzso and specificity of zzso at score zzso or 5 for identification of cancer zzso at any volume was zzso and zzso zzso For identification of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso the sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, with the under the receiver operating characteristic curve of zzso Mean volume of zzso detected and missed zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity of zzso for identification of zzso zzso of zzso grade zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso can accurately identify zzso cancer zzso zzso applications are guidance for zzso selection of patients for watchful waiting, and focal treatment zzso
