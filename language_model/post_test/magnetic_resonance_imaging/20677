Comprehensive in zzso zzso studies that include zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a battery of behavioral zzso to assess functional outcome were performed at multiple time points up to 56 days post-traumatic spinal zzso injury zzso in zzso The zzso studies included high-resolution structural imaging for zzso zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso for probing the white matter zzso The behavioral zzso included zzso zzso grid walking, inclined plane, computerized activity box performance, and von Frey filament zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was assessed for correlation with both the zzso and behavioral zzso The zzso patterns of the zzso were documented on structural zzso zzso studies showed significant changes in white matter that is zzso to the injury epicenter and persisted to day zzso White matter in regions up to zzso away from the injury epicenter that appeared normal on conventional zzso also exhibited changes that were indicative of tissue damage, suggesting that zzso is a more sensitive measure of the evolving zzso zzso between zzso and zzso after zzso could not be firmly established, suggesting that injury causes complex pathological changes in multiple tissue components that affect the zzso zzso zzso evidence confirmed a significant decrease in zzso and zzso presence 56 days zzso Multiple zzso to evaluate aspects of functional recovery correlated with zzso and zzso measures, suggesting that damage to specific white matter tracts can be assessed and tracked zzso after zzso
