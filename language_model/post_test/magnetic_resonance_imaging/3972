A magnetic resonance imaging study of the internal zzso response of normal zzso zzso discs to zzso zzso and zzso 

To zzso the pattern of magnetic resonance imaging zzso intensity variation across discs, and zzso monitor displacement of the nucleus zzso during zzso zzso 

zzso techniques used to study zzso movements of the nucleus zzso have suggested that it moves zzso during zzso and zzso during zzso A zzso study based on magnetic resonance images gave similar results for normal young zzso zzso has been problematic, and the invasive procedures may have altered disc zzso 

Ten male subjects zzso zzso zzso with healthy backs were positioned in a magnetic resonance imaging portal with their zzso spine stabilized in zzso and extension by supporting zzso For each disc, a zzso image was zzso as was a computer-generated profile of zzso zzso along a horizontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to characterize the shape of the intensity profile and to zzso the point of maximum zzso zzso 

A single equation fitted the profile for all normal zzso The intensity peak shifted zzso during zzso zzso during zzso 

zzso mathematical modeling of magnetic resonance imaging zzso data can be used to describe the fundamental shape of the zzso intensity profile across a normal zzso disc, to determine the precise location of the site of maximum zzso intensity, and to measure the movement of this peak with zzso and zzso This technique may be of value in recognizing zzso degenerative changes in zzso zzso
