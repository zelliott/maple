The three-dimensional zzso of zzso zzso and adjacent zzso at risk of zzso is an important requirement for staging, therapy planning and zzso zzso from the zzso or metal implants often reduce the diagnostic power of zzso zzso zzso The value of zzso zzso in respect to the standard methods CT and magnetic resonance imaging zzso was therefore zzso 

Between zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in 243 patients by zzso was zzso classified on a zzso scale and compared to the corresponding CT and zzso zzso 

Complete zzso of the zzso was possible in zzso % by zzso whereas the rates of zzso and CT were lower with zzso % and zzso % respectively, mainly because of zzso The best combinations of methods, zzso + CT zzso zzso and zzso + zzso zzso zzso gave almost equivalent results, whereas CT + zzso zzso zzso was zzso In zzso % of the cases none of the methods produced adequate zzso 

By free selection of zzso planes and direct correlation to the clinical findings zzso can improve staging, therapy planning and follow-up of zzso zzso especially in the case of small zzso size, dental zzso metal implants or zzso to zzso
