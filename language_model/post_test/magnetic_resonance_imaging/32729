A zzso network zzso mainly composed of the anterior zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to play an important role in zzso attribution which has been proposed as central to the pathology of paranoid zzso The role of this zzso in the zzso of paranoid zzso however, still remains zzso In the present study, zzso zzso and zzso functional connectivity analyses were combined to identify zzso and functional abnormalities in the proposed zzso in the zzso of paranoid schizophrenia zzso zzso zzso and zzso functional connectivity analyses were applied to 90 zzso patients and 90 zzso and zzso healthy controls zzso zzso analyses were performed to examine the relationships between various clinical variables and both gray matter zzso and functional connectivity within the zzso in zzso Compared to the HC group, the zzso group showed significantly reduced gray matter volume zzso in both bilateral zzso and zzso Moreover, significantly reduced functional connectivity within the zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso and functional deficits in zzso were significantly associated with zzso Additionally, illness duration correlated with reduced zzso in the left zzso in zzso In conclusion, these findings provide zzso evidence for the zzso and functional abnormalities of the zzso in zzso Moreover, the association of illness duration with the reduced zzso in the left zzso suggests that the zzso and the zzso in particular, may manifest progressive zzso changes that are especially important in the emergence of zzso
