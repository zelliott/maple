17 patients with zzso II patients zzso adrenal zzso who were operated on for zzso zzso zzso CT and zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso more than 1 zzso in size was classified as a zzso 

zzso zzso and diagnostic accuracy of combined CT and zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso 

zzso of combined CT and zzso (27 adrenal zzso was zzso with a specificity of zzso and a diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso had a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of only zzso and a diagnostic accuracy of zzso 

If unilateral zzso is done when only one adrenal zzso contains a zzso then zzso should be the method of choice for zzso zzso type II related zzso zzso zzso can be restricted to those patients in whom zzso does not show a zzso
