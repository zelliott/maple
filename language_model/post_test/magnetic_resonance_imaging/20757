zzso in genes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex were identified in patients with zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso 

We report molecular genetic findings in 12 Italian patients with clinical and zzso findings compatible with zzso and zzso 

We zzso selected a cohort of 12 children from 9 Italian families with zzso of zzso zzso structures and clinical manifestations suggesting either zzso or zzso and submitted them to direct sequencing of the genes zzso the 4 zzso of the zzso complex, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In a cohort of 12 children, we detected the common zzso zzso in zzso in zzso available patients from nine unrelated zzso We also detected a novel zzso zzso zzso in compound zzso with the common zzso in a child with a severe zzso zzso In another severely affected patient, the second zzso zzso was not zzso Two zzso without zzso in the zzso complex were zzso to the zzso zzso In addition to typical clinical and zzso features of zzso both children were affected by a zzso resembling zzso zzso 

We confirm that the common zzso zzso in zzso is responsible for most of the patients with a zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a more severe zzso as zzso In addition, we describe a new clinical form of zzso in 2 zzso with clinical and zzso features of zzso
