The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy of imaging techniques in predicting zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso stages and the zzso zzso margin zzso status of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso 

Using pelvic zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso ultrasound zzso 90 consecutive patients with locally advanced zzso zzso cancer were zzso zzso zzso T and N stages and zzso of the zzso as assessed by CT, zzso and zzso were compared with zzso zzso 

The accuracy of zzso staging was low, whatever the imaging technique used zzso by CT, zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso the most frequent inaccuracy being zzso Imaging showed a good specificity and good negative zzso values zzso when mural staging was grouped into zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso in particular, zzso achieved a zzso specificity and zzso zzso zzso involvement was correctly predicted in zzso of patients by CT zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The accuracy for zzso staging was zzso zzso and zzso by CT, zzso and zzso zzso the corresponding zzso were zzso zzso and zzso 

Current imaging techniques are inaccurate in restaging zzso cancer after zzso but are useful in predicting T zzso 3 tumors, cases with negative zzso and zzso zzso These findings may be of clinical relevance for planning less invasive zzso
