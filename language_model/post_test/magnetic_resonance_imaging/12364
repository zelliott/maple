To observe the distribution difference of magnetic resonance imaging zzso signals in zzso of the zzso head zzso patients of different zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso 29 zzso patients were assigned to the zzso and vessel stagnation group zzso zzso and the zzso zzso group (15 zzso according to zzso syndrome zzso The distribution difference of their zzso signals of zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso combined signal were zzso 

There was statistical difference in zzso signal distribution between the two zzso syndrome types zzso zzso zzso There was no statistical difference in zzso + zzso or zzso and zzso combined signal between the two zzso syndrome types zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso signals in the zzso and vessel stagnation group were mainly zzso as zzso zzso they were mainly zzso as mixed signals in the zzso zzso zzso 

Distribution difference of zzso signals exists between zzso patients of different zzso syndrome zzso
