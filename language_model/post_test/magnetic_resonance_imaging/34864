To investigate relations between clinical and zzso features and age of zzso presence of zzso and genetic linkage in zzso dominant zzso zzso type II zzso zzso 

The natural history of zzso II was studied on the basis of clinical and zzso findings in two zzso and genetic linkage studies were carried out with zzso DNA markers in the largest, four generation, zzso 

zzso was constant in all age zzso zzso zzso with early extinction of the zzso constituted an important component in juvenile and early adult zzso 25 zzso onset but was variable in late adult zzso zzso involvement due to spinal anterior horn disease was an important contributing factor to illness in juvenile zzso zzso findings in four patients confirm the general neurodegenerative nature of the disease, which includes prominent spinal anterior horn involvement and widespread involvement of zzso and white zzso zzso linkage was found with markers to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso at zzso 

The sequence of clinical involvement seems related to age at zzso zzso zzso is variable in late onset patients and zzso features are important in patients with early zzso Strong anticipation was found in subsequent zzso zzso of zzso II to zzso zzso is zzso
