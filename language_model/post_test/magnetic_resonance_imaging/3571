Until now, many investigators have focused on describing right zzso zzso dysfunction in groups of patients with pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso but very few have addressed the deterioration of RV function over zzso The aim of this study was to investigate time courses of RV geometric changes during the progression of RV zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were selected who underwent zzso heart zzso and cardiac zzso at baseline and after zzso zzso Based on the survival after this zzso zzso period, patients were classified into two groups: survivors zzso zzso subsequent survival of zzso 4 zzso and zzso (16 zzso subsequent survival of zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso imaging was used to zzso RV zzso zzso zzso distance zzso RV zzso zzso zzso wall distance zzso and RV fractional area change zzso between end zzso and end zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso measured at the beginning of the zzso period and 1 year later were significantly higher in subsequent survivors than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change during the zzso period in either patient zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not change during the zzso period in subsequent survivors but did decrease in subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso This decrease was caused by increased zzso zzso zzso 

Progressive RV failure in zzso is associated with a parallel decline in zzso and zzso zzso until a floor effect is reached for zzso zzso A further reduction of RV function is due to progressive zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso incorporates both free wall and zzso movements, this zzso can be used to monitor the decline in RV function in zzso zzso
