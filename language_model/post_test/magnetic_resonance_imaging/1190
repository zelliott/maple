With the introduction of zzso designs in zzso it has become crucial to zzso design efficiency and zzso filtering to detect zzso at the 1st level with high zzso We investigate the relevance of these issues for zzso population studies, that is, zzso analysis, for a set of zzso zzso zzso designs with different zzso zzso adopting three distinct zzso filtering strategies as implemented in zzso zzso and zzso By theory, experiments, and simulations using zzso zzso noise, we show that both design and filtering impact the outcome of the statistical analysis, not only at the 1st but also at the 2nd zzso There are several reasons behind this zzso First, sensitivity is affected by both design and zzso since the zzso zzso that is the fixed effect, is not negligible with respect to the zzso zzso that is the random effect, in zzso population zzso The impact of the fixed effects error on the sensitivity of the mixed effects analysis can be zzso by an optimal choice of zzso design and zzso Moreover, the accuracy of the zzso and zzso zzso estimates also depend on design and zzso especially, we show that zzso caused by the presence of residual noise zzso can be constrained by designs that have zzso responses with a zzso zzso In conclusion, designs with both good efficiency and zzso properties, for example, such as the geometric or Latin square probability zzso combined with the zzso filters of zzso and zzso give the best result, both for zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso
