We studied perception in three patients with zzso of childhood zzso All had trouble with other zzso zzso All were deficient on face matching tests and severely impaired on tests of perception of the spatial relations of facial features and abstract designs, indicating a deficit in the zzso of coordinate zzso similar to zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso face zzso Two had difficulty zzso feature zzso which correlated with reduced zzso zzso In contrast to zzso patients, zzso discrimination was spared in two and spatial resolution impaired in zzso zzso discrimination was relatively zzso zzso sensitivity showed variable reductions at different spatial zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is similar to the zzso form in zzso deficits for the spatial arrangement of facial zzso zzso in zzso perception and spatial resolution are more associated with defective zzso for basic zzso recognition, as shown on tests of object and spatial zzso
