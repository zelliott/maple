zzso lipids zzso are stored in droplets in the zzso of muscle cells and are an energy storage form readily zzso during long-term zzso zzso zzso methods are presented for zzso determination of zzso in human zzso This is based on zzso the separation of two zzso in the zzso with the one assigned to zzso being independent of muscle orientation relative to the magnetic field and zzso the fact that zzso zzso scale along with signal zzso of zzso in the muscle cell zzso zzso when zzso size is increased, while zzso signals of bulk fat show a disproportionate zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicate that the error of the method is about zzso and that zzso levels differ significantly between identical muscles in different subjects, as well as zzso when measured at 1 week zzso zzso zzso in a single subject before and after zzso exercise indicate that zzso stores recover with a zzso of about 1 zzso
