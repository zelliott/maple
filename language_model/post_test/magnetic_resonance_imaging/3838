Several MR methods have been proposed over the last decade to obtain quantitative estimates of the tissue blood oxygen zzso zzso using a zzso of the blood oxygen level dependent zzso These approaches are all based on mathematical models describing the time evolution of the MR signal in biological zzso in the presence of magnetic field zzso Although the experimental results are very encouraging, possible biases induced by the model assumptions have not been extensively zzso In this study, a zzso approach was used to examine the influence on zzso blood volume zzso and zzso estimates of possible zzso factors such as water zzso zzso zzso and presence of zzso blood in the zzso To evaluate the impact of the vessel zzso straight zzso and realistic data from zzso zzso for zzso geometry were zzso Our results indicate that the models are sufficiently zzso based on a good correlation between ground truth and MR estimates of zzso
