The authors provide the results of the use of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in examining 20 patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso zzso was made using an apparatus with a field force of zzso synchronized with the zzso The zzso were performed both in zzso and inclined planes oriented along the long axis of the left zzso zzso made it possible to identify and to assess with a high accuracy zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso including the cases with zzso zzso of zzso Analysis of the data showed a certain decrease of the left zzso cavity in the zzso zzso of the left atrium and pronounced zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The asymmetry zzso amounted to zzso zzso of the zzso data and two-dimensional ultrasound zzso readings demonstrated good zzso of the results obtained with the use of both zzso zzso can be applied in the diagnosis of zzso in cases where it is difficult to carry out ultrasound zzso as well as for diagnosis zzso provided the results derived with the use of other research methods are zzso
