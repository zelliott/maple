The aim of the study was to evaluate cardiac function and early cardiac dysfunction of patients followed as zzso zzso In this study, the authors compared 100 patients, diagnosed as zzso major with mean age zzso zzso zzso with 60 healthy control subjects at the same age between 2008 and zzso Early diagnosis of iron overload that may occur after repeated zzso is important in this patient zzso To detect early iron zzso the authors compared zzso with the echo findings, the 24-hour zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso values in the patients of same age and sex, treated with zzso without heart failure, zzso and do not differ in the presence of zzso zzso zzso levels, left zzso zzso functions zzso fraction zzso zzso fraction zzso left zzso zzso left zzso zzso functions, zzso image on cardiac magnetic zzso heart rate variables in 24 hours, and zzso rhythm were evaluated to show the early failure of cardiac zzso In this study the authors confirmed that zzso cardiac toxicity damages electrical activity earlier than zzso zzso Left zzso zzso diameter zzso left zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso diameter zzso levels were significantly higher in the patient group with zzso Patients with zzso are the ones in whom zzso and zzso are zzso In zzso major patients with zzso zzso ratio was markedly increased, zzso zzso was clearly found higher in patients with zzso rather than zzso zzso The standard zzso all normal zzso zzso series zzso was found clearly lower in zzso major group with zzso than control group because it is assumed that increase in cardiac sympathetic zzso activity is related to exposure to chronic zzso and zzso zzso
