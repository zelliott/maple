Clinical zzso acquisition protocols entail the use of MR contrast agents zzso that could potentially affect PET zzso following zzso zzso correction zzso We assessed the effect of oral and intravenous zzso zzso on PET zzso in zzso zzso 

We employed two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso First, we determined their reference PET zzso values using a PET transmission scan zzso zzso zzso and a CT scan zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso Second, we evaluated the zzso of PET signals in the presence of zzso zzso were filled with clinically relevant zzso of zzso in a background of water and zzso and zzso using a zzso scanner zzso 16 zzso zzso and a zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso Third, we investigated the effect of clinically relevant volumes of zzso on zzso zzso using human pilot zzso a patient study employing zzso zzso and a volunteer study employing two different oral zzso zzso and pineapple zzso zzso zzso maps were calculated following zzso zzso zzso and an external zzso and pattern recognition zzso zzso 

IV and oral zzso in clinically relevant zzso were found to have PET zzso values similar to those of zzso The phantom experiments showed that under clinical conditions IV and oral zzso did not yield additional zzso of PET zzso zzso Patient scans showed that PET zzso maps are not biased after the administration of IV zzso but may be zzso however, after zzso of iron zzso oral zzso when zzso zzso zzso are zzso Alternative zzso zzso such as zzso or alternative oral contrast agents, such as pineapple juice, can yield unbiased zzso zzso 

In clinical zzso scenarios zzso are not expected to lead to markedly increased zzso of the PET zzso zzso zzso zzso maps may be biased by oral iron zzso zzso unless advanced zzso zzso are zzso
