zzso zzso have been reported for zzso drugs as zzso treatment after zzso We applied an alternative drug delivery strategy, by injection of zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso in an experimental stroke model, and tested the hypothesis that this approach improves behavioral recovery and reduces zzso zzso zzso were subjected to right middle cerebral artery zzso with a blood zzso After 2 zzso animals were zzso injected with zzso plus empty zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Neurological status was evaluated with different behavioral tests up to 7 days after zzso zzso development was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging of tissue and zzso parameters from 0-2 h until 7 days after zzso zzso of brain inflammatory markers was measured with zzso at zzso day zzso Treatment with zzso plus zzso resulted in significantly improved behavioral outcome as compared to treatment with zzso plus empty zzso or free zzso Acute and final brain zzso sizes were comparable between treatment zzso however a zzso zzso revealed a significantly larger salvaged tissue area after treatment with zzso We conclude that delivery of zzso zzso via zzso in combination with zzso zzso can significantly improve outcome after zzso Furthermore, magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso provide a sensitive means to measure treatment effects on zzso zzso
