To zzso the various sources of error in measuring the volume of the zzso nucleus and to understand these errors would lead to the zzso of the zzso protocol and would make the utility of data from around the world more viable in a global zzso 

We collected data at four different sites all using a zzso zzso Vision MR zzso In all cases the same zzso zzso scans were used on a single volunteer and analyzed by a set of five zzso 

The errors estimated were: system zzso (a random variation of up to zzso partial volume error (a bias of up to zzso using zzso resolution of 1 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso geometric distortion (a potential bias of zzso zzso error (a random variation of up to zzso effects of ringing zzso biases of up to zzso when a zzso of 4 was zzso and zzso error (with a bias of usually zzso zzso but sometimes as large as zzso among our five zzso Individual mean variations from one system to another differed by less than zzso (except for two observers at one zzso consistent with a maximum error of zzso coming from the area bias due to limitations in the images zzso We also measured the effect of variable resolution on the volume estimates and found that the measured volumes were consistent over a broad range of zzso zzso 

Given the observed dependence of the zzso volumes on zzso and resolution, if zzso resolution is required because a complicated structure is being zzso then the lower zzso suffered by collecting 1 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso data at zzso still appears to be sufficient to make accurate volume zzso as long as the zzso ratio zzso is on the order of zzso Based on our results, predictions are made as to what the best approach would be to improve the data acquisition scheme to keep individual errors under zzso and biases under zzso We conclude that if users can be trained to identify the structure of interest in the same way, the zzso error could be reduced to that of zzso day-to-day zzso
