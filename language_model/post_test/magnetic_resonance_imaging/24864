zzso data support the idea that schizophrenia is a brain disorder with altered brain structure and zzso New zzso functional connectivity techniques allow us to highlight synchronization of large-scale networks, such as the zzso network zzso and zzso network zzso A large body of work suggests that disruption of these networks could give rise to specific schizophrenia zzso We examined the zzso connectivity strength and gray matter content zzso of zzso and zzso in 26 schizophrenia patients using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed with independent component analysis and zzso zzso We reported reduced functional connectivity within both zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso the zzso patients showed weaker connectivity in a cluster located in the right zzso zzso Moreover, patients showed decreased GMC in this zzso With regard to the zzso patients showed reduced connectivity in the left and right zzso zzso connectivity in the zzso zzso was correlated with difficulties in abstract zzso The connectivity decrease in the left zzso was correlated with delusion and depression zzso zzso between the connectivity of zzso frontal regions and difficulties in abstract thinking emphasizes the link between negative symptoms and the likely zzso of the frontal zzso zzso in zzso zzso between the connectivity of zzso zzso regions and delusions supports the zzso zzso zzso This work provides new insights into dysfunctional brain organization in schizophrenia and its contribution to specific schizophrenia zzso
