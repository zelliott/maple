The authors present the case of a 4-year-old boy in whom a zzso in the left zzso zzso was successfully zzso with no signs of residual tumor on the zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso A second MR imaging study performed 1 month after surgery demonstrated an extensive, zzso zzso in the left zzso hemisphere, which simulated massive zzso zzso and repeated surgery was zzso A third zzso MR imaging study, performed for evaluation of the zzso axis 10 days after the second zzso study, still showed some contrast enhancement in the left zzso hemisphere, but the zzso had almost zzso zzso zzso inflammation seemed to be the most likely zzso This case illustrates that early zzso inflammation can mimic zzso tumor on MR images obtained after zzso of a zzso and caution should be taken in interpreting such zzso Clinical history, neurological examination, laboratory findings, and repeated MR imaging studies can be helpful in evaluating the patient zzso
