zzso zzso object perception involves distributed brain zzso To investigate the network character of these regions of the human brain, we applied zzso group spatial independent component analysis zzso to a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data set acquired during a passive zzso zzso experiment with common object zzso We labeled three zzso independent component zzso maps as auditory zzso visual zzso and zzso based on their spatial zzso and zzso time zzso The overlap between these zzso maps served as definition of a distributed network of zzso candidate regions including superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso During an independent second zzso experiment, we explicitly tested their involvement in zzso zzso zzso in nine out of these twelve regions met the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of this approach with a general linear zzso zzso definition revealed its complementary value for zzso zzso In conclusion, we estimated functional networks of zzso and zzso functional connectivity from one zzso and validated their functional roles in an independent zzso These findings demonstrate the particular value of zzso for zzso zzso research and using independent zzso to test hypotheses generated from a zzso zzso
