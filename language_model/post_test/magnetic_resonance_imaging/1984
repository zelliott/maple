zzso cruciate ligament reconstructions are becoming increasingly zzso and zzso has been shown to be the best imaging zzso for the zzso assessment of surgical zzso Use of the zzso zzso as a biological replacement for injured cruciate ligament is a recent zzso This study evaluated by zzso the results of anterior cruciate reconstruction in 27 consecutive patients who underwent zzso reconstruction with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was carried out on 27 patients who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the middle third of the zzso zzso zzso The examinations were performed on two zzso zzso a permanent zzso dedicated magnet zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso magnet zzso GE Medical Systems Milwaukee, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were acquired with SE, GE and STIR fat suppression zzso The examinations were performed 1, 3, and 6 months zzso in 16 patients, and 1 and 3 zzso in 11 zzso The same zzso surgical technique was employed in all patients, with 20 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 cases with zzso zzso zzso All patients were assessed by zzso and clinical tests after zzso zzso interference screws were used for zzso fixation in all patients and metallic interference screws were used for zzso graft fixation in 8 zzso 

In all cases zzso correctly zzso the tunnel positions, the zzso portion and the zzso of the graft inside the zzso and zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso in the zzso allowed complete zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso images with optimal spatial and contrast zzso In 6 cases, the presence of metal zzso from the surgical zzso prevented correct evaluation of zzso tunnel zzso No new graft or zzso zzso were zzso In zzso cases zzso zzso zzso around the zzso tunnel had disappeared 3 months after zzso The process of zzso incorporation was judged to be correct in all zzso 

The use of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the zzso zzso is a important innovation given the size of the harvested material and the possibility of completely filling the zzso tunnels, without zzso of zzso proliferation or fluid collection between zzso and bone, as confirmed by zzso Furthermore, the use of zzso screws allows zzso evaluation of tunnel content and zzso in the zzso bone around the zzso The study of the double zzso tunnel requires specific zzso in the zzso plane zzso 

This zzso technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction allows thorough zzso evaluation of all portions of the zzso and in particular those coursing within the zzso and zzso The absence of bone zzso around the tunnels and zzso proliferation within the tunnels may be zzso of faster healing and complete bone incorporation of the zzso
