To identify the cause of zzso white matter zzso seen on magnetic resonance imaging in older patients with progressive deterioration of gait and zzso 

zzso examination of three patients with objective impairment of gait and balance thought to be due to zzso white matter zzso identified on magnetic resonance zzso Brain sections were stained with routine methods and for zzso zzso acid protein using an zzso zzso 

Part of a prospective study of gait and balance problems in older zzso None had a history of hypertension or discrete zzso zzso 

Other than a few small zzso in the zzso zzso and internal capsule in the patient with the zzso gait disorder, there were no gross or microscopic features on routine examination post zzso to explain the white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging or the progressive gait zzso By contrast, zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid protein showed prominent zzso zzso high-intensity signal areas on magnetic resonance zzso 

The zzso presumably swell as they take up zzso protein at the site of a breakdown in the zzso barrier, and the increased water content per unit volume increases the magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso may have been initially activated by small zzso or zzso zzso but the process then became zzso ultimately involving most of the white matter and producing the severe gait zzso
