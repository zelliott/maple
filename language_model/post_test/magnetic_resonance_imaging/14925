An efficient method for obtaining zzso relaxation time zzso maps is based on acquiring two zzso zzso recalled echo zzso images in steady states with different flip angles, which has also been extended, with additional acquisitions, to obtain a tissue water content zzso zzso Several factors, including zzso of the zzso zzso fields and low zzso ratios may zzso affect the accuracy of this method and produce systematic errors in zzso and zzso zzso Thus far, these limitations have been addressed by using additional zzso and applying suitable zzso however, the zzso increase in scan time is zzso for clinical zzso In this note, a modified zzso zzso method based on an zzso of the sequence zzso is presented for good and reliable zzso mapping with an zzso spatial resolution of zzso that covers the entire human brain in zzso A combined zzso zzso map is estimated from one of the zzso scans and the optimal flip angles for zzso map are found zzso The method was successfully evaluated in eight healthy subjects producing mean zzso values of zzso (in white zzso and zzso (in gray zzso that are in good agreement with those found in the literature and with high zzso The mean value of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso
