Although deficits in cognitive control are thought to contribute to the diverse cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in individuals with zzso the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits remain zzso In this zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study, the authors tested the hypothesis that during cognitive control tasks, impaired zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso in schizophrenia patients is associated with disrupted coordinated activity between this prefrontal region and a distributed brain network that supports cognitive zzso 

Through the use of an zzso design, 25 patients with zzso schizophrenia and 24 healthy comparison subjects, matched on demographic zzso were assessed while performing a version of the zzso continuous performance zzso zzso zzso data were analyzed using 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso time series and whole brain zzso zzso analysis to confirm the presence of zzso prefrontal zzso dysfunction and 2) zzso analysis to examine zzso prefrontal zzso functional zzso In addition, correlations between zzso prefrontal zzso functional connectivity and the following variables were zzso clinical symptoms, task performance, and coordinated brain activity associated with cognitive zzso 

zzso patients exhibited a specific deficit in cognitive control, with significantly reduced accuracy in the zzso condition relative to any other zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso prefrontal zzso dysfunction during the high cognitive control zzso zzso analysis revealed significant impairment in functional connectivity between the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso correlations were also found between zzso prefrontal zzso functional connectivity and cognitive performance, behavioral zzso and global zzso 

These findings suggest that there is an association between decreased zzso prefrontal zzso activity and connectivity and a zzso neural zzso This deficit in coordinated brain activity may result in the disabling disorganization symptoms related to impaired zzso in individuals with zzso
