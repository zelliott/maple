Chronically zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso are hallmarks of inflammatory zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate changes in zzso tissue in a chronic zzso model resulting from repeated cycles of zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso to mimic the zzso nature of the human zzso 

zzso mice were exposed to zzso in drinking water for 1 week, followed by a recovery phase of 2 zzso This cycle of exposure was repeated for up to 3 times (9 weeks in zzso zzso zzso fibrosis, zzso zzso proteins and zzso gene expression were zzso In zzso zzso T 2 zzso was studied as a potential zzso imaging tool to evaluate zzso wall inflammation and zzso 

zzso cycles of zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso disease course, which induced a chronic zzso zzso colitis after 2 and 3 cycles of zzso with clear induction of zzso and zzso of the muscular zzso zzso expression mirrored its expression in Crohn's zzso zzso data identified a gene expression profile different in chronic colitis from that in acute zzso Additional recovery was associated with zzso of unique zzso in particular zzso pointing to zzso of molecular pathways for healing and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of the colon showed a clear shift towards higher zzso values in the acute stage and a gradual zzso of zzso values with increasing cycles of zzso 

zzso cycles of zzso exposure induce zzso and zzso tissue changes with typical features, as occurring in Crohn's zzso zzso gene expression analysis revealed unique expression profiles in chronic colitis compared to acute colitis and after additional recovery, pointing to potential new targets to intervene with the induction of zzso In zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso assessment of inflammation and zzso
