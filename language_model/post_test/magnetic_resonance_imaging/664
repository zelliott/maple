The interplay of zzso and zzso regulated mechanisms is of particular relevance for the rapid zzso of attention to environmental zzso The purpose of the study was to explore the differential contributions of zzso zzso networks involved in zzso and zzso processing to the detection of zzso and zzso events in a visual zzso oddball zzso Thirteen healthy subjects underwent separate zzso potential zzso and zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso during the oddball zzso The targets, which were difficult to zzso zzso a classical zzso zzso whereas the zzso stimuli were followed by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso data showed zzso of the zzso junction zzso zzso and right prefrontal zzso associated with both the target and zzso zzso This network has previously been described as an zzso system that is predominantly stimulus driven and that responds to rare zzso Furthermore, target processing produced bilateral zzso activity, which has been related to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activated the frontal eye fields zzso and bilateral superior zzso cortex, areas engaged in attention switching and voluntary allocation of zzso Additional left prefrontal zzso suggested an involvement of the cortical system for working memory zzso Our results thus demonstrate that zzso and target processing engage a common zzso system for the detection of rare events, but also zzso zzso related to attention and memory zzso
