We argue that published results demonstrate that new insights into human brain function may be obscured by poor and/or limited choices in the zzso pipeline, and review the work on performance metrics for zzso zzso zzso zzso and related empirical zzso zzso zzso zzso curve zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso framework for zzso zzso metrics zzso et zzso zzso we illustrate its use by testing the relative importance of selected pipeline components zzso zzso spatial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a group analysis of zzso scans from 16 subjects performing a zzso zzso zzso zzso brain networks were detected using a zzso linear zzso analysis zzso zzso analysis, zzso that was tuned to fit the zzso We found that tuning the zzso model and spatial smoothing were the most important processing zzso zzso zzso was essential to remove zzso zzso time zzso the number of zzso basis functions for zzso was zzso by assuming that separate epochs of baseline scans have constant, equal means, and this assumption was assessed with prediction zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso alignment had only a minor impact on the performance zzso We found that both prediction and zzso metrics were required for zzso the pipeline and give somewhat different zzso Moreover, the zzso settings of components in the pipeline interact so that the current practice of reporting the zzso of components tested in relative isolation is unlikely to lead to fully zzso processing zzso
