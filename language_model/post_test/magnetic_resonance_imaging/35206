zzso of zzso containing zzso coated zzso has been shown to be an effective tool for measuring the local fluid zzso However, the zzso buoyant nature of these zzso zzso lengthy zzso due to their vertical migration under gravity and zzso zzso A novel preparation is presented which is shown to minimize both these effects for at least 25 zzso By using a zzso zzso gel base with a small concentration of zzso and zzso coated gas zzso MR zzso are made for pressures between zzso and zzso zzso The signal drifts due to migration and amalgamation are shown to be minimized for such an experiment whilst yielding very high zzso sensitivities up to 38% signal change per zzso
