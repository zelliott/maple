To zzso different zzso patterns in zzso zzso imaging and zzso PET in zzso zzso zzso 

We compared 23 zzso zzso scans and 23 zzso PET scans zzso zzso 10 zzso in 19 patients with a suspected zzso zzso (16 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso images of the abdomen or other zzso regions were available in all zzso zzso for zzso PET were a zzso zzso a zzso in zzso zzso compared to the zzso imaging or imaging results inconsistent with clinical zzso A zzso was found by zzso zzso and/or zzso PET and/or zzso zzso 

A total of 58 suspicious zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso were evaluated and 18 were confirmed by zzso and 40 by clinical zzso The sensitivities of zzso zzso and zzso PET were 50% and zzso and the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso results (three zzso zzso one zzso zzso were due to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso results zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso were due to low zzso and small zzso zzso Combined zzso zzso PET imaging showed the highest sensitivity of zzso In 34 zzso the zzso zzso and zzso imaging findings were zzso zzso PET correctly identified 32 of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were missed by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso PET showed noticeable differences in their zzso zzso zzso PET was more sensitive and specific for the detection of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that a zzso PET scan may be useful in the event of zzso or zzso findings on zzso zzso and zzso zzso
