Fat suppression is important but challenging in balanced zzso free zzso zzso acquisitions, for a number of clinical zzso In the present work, the practicality of performing zzso selective zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso sequence is zzso With careful pulse design, the overall duration of these zzso zzso was kept short to minimize zzso effects on zzso scan time and zzso artifact zzso zzso selective zzso using zzso zzso was demonstrated in both phantom and human zzso imaging at zzso and compared to results obtained using a zzso Dixon zzso The sequence with zzso zzso performed better than the zzso Dixon method, in terms of scan time and suppression zzso Overall, it is concluded here that zzso zzso zzso do represent a viable option for zzso zzso zzso
