A substantial proportion of total body zzso zzso in humans is found in skeletal muscle zzso thus zzso a means of predicting zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso There are now zzso 30 zzso counters worldwide that have large zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We explored 2 zzso prediction approaches, one based on the assumption that the ratio of zzso to zzso is stable in healthy adults and the other on a multiple zzso zzso prediction zzso 

Healthy subjects aged zzso 20 y were recruited for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso counting and zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso A conceptual model with zzso derived data was developed to link zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the ratio of zzso to zzso 

A total of 300 subjects zzso men and 161 zzso of various zzso with a mean zzso zzso body mass index (in zzso of zzso zzso zzso met the study entry zzso The mean conceptual zzso zzso ratio was 122 zzso which was comparable to the zzso zzso ratios in men and women zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), although the ratio tended to be lower in subjects aged zzso 70 zzso A strong linear correlation was observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with sex, race, and age as small but significant prediction model zzso 

Two different types of prediction models were developed that provide validated approaches for zzso zzso mass from zzso zzso by zzso zzso These methods afford an opportunity to predict zzso mass from zzso data collected in healthy zzso
