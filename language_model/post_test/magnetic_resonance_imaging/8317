zzso zzso for anterior spine fusion are made of different materials, which can affect the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso artifacts specially for metallic implants can decrease the image zzso 

This study focused on the influence of determined implant parameters like shape, implant volume, and implant material in zzso zzso with regard to solid geometrical titanium and carbon test zzso 

A comparative study on an in zzso spine zzso The study was performed at a university research zzso 

In this study we evaluated the zzso zzso scans of three determined zzso and six zzso which were made of titanium zzso and carbon fiber reinforced zzso zzso scans were carried out by using zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso The total artifact volume zzso as well as median artifact area zzso were zzso zzso the implant volume zzso and zzso area zzso relation were zzso zzso analyses were calculated with the zzso test and zzso test for multiple zzso 

Considering all test implants with an increasing implant size, the zzso and the zzso became significantly larger zzso with simultaneous reduction of the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the carbon implant group, for titanium zzso with an implant volume equivalent to the zzso significant differences in zzso zzso zzso could be zzso 

zzso artifacts were clearly affected by the implant material, shape, and implant zzso Independent of the implant material, with regard to a more advantageous zzso and zzso zzso for larger implants the artifact rate was more limited to the zzso direct zzso On the basis of a high zzso for titanium implants with an equal IV, the range of zzso zzso artifacts was influenced by the material as well as implant shape in favor of zzso zzso According to the very low zzso artifact rate of carbon zzso the implant shape did not have any significant effect on the artifact zzso
