We zzso the diffusion problem in the traditional zzso zzso gel system employed in zzso studies of radiation zzso The diffusion zzso is measured using an inversion recovery zzso imaging method in a model zzso zzso The diffusion zzso of zzso in zzso zzso gel at pH zzso is D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The diffusion zzso of zzso is D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the diffusion zzso permits simulation of the zzso signal intensity from zzso with model radiation dose zzso We allow for diffusion of both zzso and zzso in our simulations as well as the effect of both relaxation agents on the local zzso relaxation time zzso We also zzso the effects of the physical zzso on the diffusion zzso
