zzso learning systems are thought to be central to the zzso of and impair recovery from zzso The functioning of the brain circuits for episodic memory or learning that support zzso behavior has not been studied previously in persons with cocaine dependence zzso Thirteen zzso CD and 13 healthy participants underwent zzso scanning while performing a task that requires the use of spatial cues to navigate a zzso environment and find monetary zzso allowing the functional assessment of the brain systems for spatial learning, a form of episodic zzso Whereas both groups performed similarly on the reward-based spatial learning task, we identified disturbances in brain regions involved in learning and reward in CD zzso In particular, CD was associated with impaired functioning of zzso zzso lobe zzso a brain region that is crucial for spatial learning (and episodic zzso with zzso recruitment of zzso (which normally zzso in zzso or zzso zzso and prefrontal zzso CD was also associated with enhanced sensitivity of the zzso zzso to unexpected rewards but not to expected rewards earned during spatial zzso We provide evidence that spatial learning in CD is characterized by disturbances in functioning of an zzso system for episodic memory and a zzso system for zzso learning and zzso We have found additional abnormalities in distributed cortical zzso zzso with findings from animal studies, we provide the first evidence in humans describing the disruptive effects of cocaine on the coordinated functioning of multiple neural systems for learning and zzso
