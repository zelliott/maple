To evaluate the distribution of zzso zzso zzso in normal structures and tumors of the head region using zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

We zzso reviewed the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and the zzso images obtained in 17 patients with suspected high-grade zzso The zzso of zzso in the normal structures and in brain zzso was visually and zzso zzso A 4-point grading system was used for the visual zzso A standardized zzso value zzso was used to zzso zzso 

In the normal brain zzso zzso zzso was faint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was generally moderate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cavernous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eye muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso muscles zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was usually moderately intense in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was variable in the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso cavity (for zzso of zzso see zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intense zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was globally faint in grade II and III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated in benign zzso such as a zzso zzso brain zzso 

zzso zzso was faint in the normal brain zzso and usually moderate in the zzso zzso cavernous zzso zzso eye muscles, zzso muscles, and bone zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was generally moderately intense, whereas zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso cavity was zzso zzso zzso had intense zzso Also, zzso in zzso and zzso was usually zzso intense, whereas zzso in grade II and III zzso was globally zzso However, zzso zzso was not tumor zzso
