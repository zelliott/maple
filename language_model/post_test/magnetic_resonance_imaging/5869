zzso plays a crucial role in establishing the diagnosis, planning the therapy, as well as evaluating therapeutic effects and detecting early recurrence in brain zzso It has evolved from a zzso discipline to the zzso assessment of zzso zzso incorporating zzso zzso indicators of cell membrane zzso as well as zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso for tumor zzso therapy, and zzso all of which are provided by dedicated use of advanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques by the zzso zzso views of zzso brain zzso are yielded by diffusion zzso imaging and zzso discriminating between displacement and zzso of highly relevant white matter tracts and guiding the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the spatial relationship between functionally important areas and the tumor zzso Many of these techniques use zzso on zzso MR images within the zzso range, in order to assure precise zzso zzso Yet, the borders of zzso are subject to constant zzso imaging has become one of the most promising research areas, as the molecular fingerprint of the tumor is required for targeting zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso
