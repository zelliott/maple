The aim of the study was to evaluate the advantages of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in determining zzso in zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six patients with unilateral zzso received 33 zzso and plain zzso For each patient, zzso head index zzso was measured on both hips zzso and zzso in a blinded zzso zzso were made from the cortical bone margin on the plain zzso and from the zzso surfaces on zzso On the unaffected side zzso was zzso on the plain zzso and zzso on zzso On the affected side, zzso was zzso on the plain zzso and zzso on zzso These differences were statistically zzso With regard to the unaffected side, the zzso head should be considered zzso if zzso is less than zzso on the plain zzso and less than zzso on zzso On the affected side, in 14 cases the zzso head was zzso on both the plain zzso and zzso In 11 patients the zzso head was zzso both on the plain zzso and on zzso In 8 patients the zzso head was zzso on the plain zzso but zzso on zzso This was due to zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso head, which was clearly seen on zzso zzso appeared to be more sensitive in determining the zzso of the zzso head during the active phase of zzso
