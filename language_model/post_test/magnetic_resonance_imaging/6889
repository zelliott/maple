zzso birth is frequently associated with both zzso and cognitive zzso This study examined cortical zzso zzso and lateral zzso development in association with zzso variables and cognitive zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired and zzso using advanced image processing zzso zzso zzso and 33 term control children ages zzso years were included in the zzso zzso indicated disproportionately enlarged zzso and frontal gray matter, zzso horn, and zzso body, as well as reduced zzso and zzso gray volumes in zzso children compared with control zzso Birth weight was zzso correlated with zzso and frontal gray, as well as zzso horn zzso zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso gray zzso zzso zzso fluid was zzso correlated with zzso gray matter volumes but not with white matter zzso zzso education was the strongest predictor of cognitive function in the zzso zzso zzso birth appears to be associated with zzso cortical development, possibly involving disrupted synaptic pruning and neural zzso Lower birth weight and the presence of zzso zzso may increase the risk for zzso zzso
