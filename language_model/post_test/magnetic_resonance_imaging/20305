As different areas within the zzso have different connectivity patterns with various cortical and zzso regions, we hypothesized that distinct functional zzso may be present within the zzso Because the zzso appears to be the most active region during resting state, it has been zzso to play a fundamental role in the control of baseline brain functioning within the default mode network zzso Therefore one goal of this study was to explore which components of the zzso are specifically involved in the zzso In a sample of zzso healthy volunteers, we performed an zzso zzso zzso zzso based on resting state functional zzso Our results showed four clusters with different network zzso Each cluster showed positive and negative correlations with cortical regions involved in the zzso Progressive shifts in zzso functional connectivity emerged from anterior to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso portions of zzso were found to be part of a network implicated in the zzso guidance of movements, whereas zzso anterior portions of zzso were zzso with areas involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively correlated with a network showing considerable overlap with the zzso indicating that it makes essential contributions in self-referential processing, including autobiographical memory zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso was shown to be functionally connected with a visual zzso paper represents the first attempt to provide a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso using zzso functional connectivity zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso was used to confirm the zzso
