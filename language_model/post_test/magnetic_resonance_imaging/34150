Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso in detection and zzso of mild zzso changes of carotid arteries with reference to zzso ultrasound zzso and contrast zzso 

zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and selective digital zzso zzso were performed on 31 zzso carotid arteries of 27 patients zzso age, 52 years; age range, 17 to 75 zzso undergoing zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and quantitative zzso of plaque zzso zzso zzso and diameter zzso were independently performed for the imaging zzso 

Among 170 zzso segments zzso zzso revealed a total of 48 zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso only 25 of which were depicted on digital zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso source images of zzso zzso resulted in sensitivity of zzso to zzso and specificity of zzso to zzso in zzso depiction for the 2 readers with reference to zzso The values of diameter zzso measured from zzso and zzso were closely interrelated zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is feasible and moderately accurate for evaluation of mild zzso changes of carotid zzso
