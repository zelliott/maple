zzso of zzso psychosis zzso has been linked with poor prognosis and changes in the brain structure in schizophrenia at least at the beginning of the disease, but it is still unknown whether zzso relates to brain zzso in the longer zzso Our aim was to analyze the relation between zzso and the brain structure in schizophrenia in the general population, after several years of zzso 

zzso of subjects with psychosis from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth zzso zzso zzso were scanned with zzso during zzso after an 11-year zzso zzso was assessed from medical records and zzso against global and local tissue density zzso The brain zzso and the zzso information were available for 46 subjects with zzso zzso 

The zzso did not correlate with volumes of the total gray or white matter or the zzso zzso The length of zzso associated positively with reduced zzso of the right zzso area and the right zzso 

Long zzso was slightly associated with reductions of gray matter zzso in the zzso area and especially the zzso after several years zzso supporting the hypothesis that, compared to short zzso long zzso might be a marker of different disease zzso including subtle zzso zzso
