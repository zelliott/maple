To determine the magnetic resonance zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso features of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the differences vs zzso without zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained and the informed consent requirement was zzso for this zzso zzso During one year period, zzso consecutive patients underwent successful zzso without injection of zzso and abdominal zzso studies for a variety of clinical indications using a zzso T magnetic resonance zzso Two experienced zzso zzso reviewed all the studies in zzso zzso were resolved via consultation with a third experienced zzso The assessment included presence and the imaging findings of zzso zzso and distribution of zzso The zzso with zzso constituted the study group while the zzso without zzso served as the control zzso zzso and zzso findings were correlated with final zzso Fisher exact tests and zzso zzso 2 tests were zzso 

zzso was demonstrated at zzso and zzso in 173 cases zzso cases with and 135 cases without zzso among the zzso consecutive zzso The zzso acute zzso accounted for zzso (21 of zzso in zzso patients associated with zzso which was higher than zzso (9 of zzso in the control group, whereas the chronic zzso was a dominant type in the control group zzso 115 of zzso when compared to the study group zzso 16 of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In cases of zzso with zzso the zzso zzso accounted for a much higher percentage than that in zzso without zzso (17 of 38, zzso vs 30 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso can depict the features of zzso associated with zzso zzso acute zzso and isolated zzso involvement are more common in patients with zzso
