It is time-consuming to detect intrinsic spinal zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso by zzso using conventional surface coils and zzso zzso pulse zzso zzso coils and fast zzso pulse sequences permit the generation of high-resolution zzso zzso images of the whole spinal zzso in about 5 zzso Using these advances, we found an area of high signal within the zzso in only zzso zzso healthy subjects aged 18 to 72 years, whereas zzso of those who underwent brain imaging had cerebral white matter zzso zzso zzso column changes, especially in the cervical region, were present in zzso and were associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso areas in zzso measured from zzso zzso images, were usually highly zzso and showed a significant correlation with the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso signal abnormalities within the spinal zzso may be more specific for zzso than cerebral white matter zzso especially in subjects over 50 years old; zzso zzso degenerative changes in the zzso column are common, even in younger adults; zzso measurement of zzso zzso area should allow accurate zzso of the degree of zzso in zzso and other spinal zzso diseases; and zzso zzso coils and fast spin echo represent an important advance in zzso of the spinal zzso
