The contribution of vascular pathology to the rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment zzso to Alzheimer's disease zzso remains zzso 

To ascertain the relative roles of cerebral white matter disease and zzso zzso zzso zzso in predicting progression from zzso to zzso 

zzso patients with baseline zzso and zzso months of zzso follow-up were zzso zzso criteria were used to diagnose conversion to zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso scale and modified zzso zzso 

Of a total of zzso zzso patients, 79 patients with baseline zzso and zzso follow-up were zzso zzso zzso patients who progressed to zzso zzso were identified corresponding to a zzso annual risk of zzso In zzso patients, the mean zzso State zzso and Montreal zzso Assessment decline was zzso and zzso points, zzso zzso zzso zzso and deep zzso zzso were significantly greater in the zzso zzso zzso was found to predict zzso with an odds ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and deep zzso zzso independently predict conversion from zzso to zzso zzso of vascular risk factors among patients with zzso can potentially reduce the conversion from zzso to zzso
