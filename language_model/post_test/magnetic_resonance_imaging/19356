zzso disk tissue is resistant to zzso infection because of its zzso However, zzso is being diagnosed with increasing frequency because of advancement in magnetic resonance imaging zzso There is a dearth of information regarding the zzso zzso features, and zzso correlation of zzso 

The study population consisted of 20 patients diagnosed as having zzso by magnetic resonance imaging with and without zzso 67 enhancement and bone scans with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Ga zzso zzso biopsy and zzso specimens were obtained from these zzso The specimens were cultured for zzso and also processed for zzso zzso zzso sections were examined with zzso and zzso for infectious agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Where zzso disk tissue was present zzso of 27 zzso the zzso changes included zzso (with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was present in all 27 specimens and was associated with acute zzso in 7 cases zzso zzso of 27 cases had positive culture results zzso zzso zzso but special zzso revealed zzso in sections of the disk in only 4 cases (3 cases with zzso zzso and 1 with zzso consistent with zzso zzso acute inflammation was present in all the 4 zzso 

zzso features of acute zzso include vascular zzso zzso zzso and necrosis of the disk tissue with adjacent chronic zzso Acute inflammation is variable and when florid is usually associated with identifiable organisms on zzso zzso At zzso tissue should be submitted for culture, since culture has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting the zzso zzso
