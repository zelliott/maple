zzso and structural changes in 10 zzso male zzso and 10 healthy volunteers were investigated using zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso auditory evoked fields zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso were characterized by single moving equivalent zzso which were superimposed on zzso There were significant differences in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in the left zzso of zzso when compared to the zzso The zzso zzso were found to be associated with a bilateral volume reduction of the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso which was more pronounced in the left zzso Separate analysis of white and gray matter has shown that the zzso volume reduction resulted from decreased gray matter volumes without white matter zzso Both the functional and the zzso data indicate a zzso zzso in our zzso
