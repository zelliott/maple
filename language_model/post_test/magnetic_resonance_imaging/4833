zzso zzso mapping has been a widely used method for the evaluation of pathological cartilage properties, and the zzso assessment system of zzso in the rabbit has been published zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of quantitative zzso mapping evaluation for zzso cartilage zzso of a rabbit model of anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty New Zealand White zzso rabbits were divided into zzso surgical group and sham operated group zzso The anterior cruciate ligaments of the rabbits in zzso group were zzso while the zzso were closed zzso in sham operated zzso zzso resonance zzso examinations were performed on zzso MR unit at week 0, week 6, and week zzso zzso values were zzso on GE zzso zzso All rabbits were killed at week 13, and left knees were stained with zzso and zzso zzso zzso grading was obtained according to the zzso cartilage zzso assessment zzso zzso image analysis was performed to zzso the zzso collagen type zzso 

The average MR zzso value of whole left knee cartilage in zzso surgical group zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in sham operated group zzso zzso zzso at week zzso The average zzso value increased to zzso zzso in zzso group at week 12, but remained near the baseline level zzso zzso in the sham operated group zzso The cartilage zzso level of left knee in zzso group was significantly increased at week 6 zzso and week 12 zzso zzso values had positive correlation with zzso grading scores, but inverse correlation with optical zzso zzso of type II zzso 

This study demonstrated the reliability and zzso of quantitative zzso mapping for the cartilage injury of rabbit zzso zzso zzso
