The inherited disorders of zzso zzso formation represent a zzso group of zzso The zzso zzso gene has been implicated in two zzso forms, zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso type 2, and the gap junction protein zzso zzso gene in a zzso form of zzso The zzso basic protein zzso zzso which encodes the second most abundant zzso zzso protein after zzso presents zzso in zzso zzso zzso and is always included in the minimal region deleted in zzso patients with an abnormal zzso pattern on cerebral zzso In this study, we looked at the zzso copy number at the zzso locus in 195 patients with cerebral zzso suggesting a zzso zzso who do not have zzso zzso Although preliminary results obtained by FISH suggested the zzso of zzso in 3 out of 10 patients, no abnormal gene zzso was found using zzso zzso zzso of Short Fluorescent fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or another FISH protocol using zzso zzso zzso and interest in these different techniques to detect zzso events are zzso Finally, the study of this large cohort of patients suggests that zzso deletion or zzso is rarely involved in inherited defects of zzso zzso
