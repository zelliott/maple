We present an unusual case of simultaneous bilateral zzso zzso in the territory of the zzso and intermediate branches of the zzso inferior zzso arteries zzso The patient, a zzso woman, had no risk factors for cerebrovascular disease but a long-standing zzso zzso hypotheses of this unusual zzso site of zzso may be referred to: zzso two zzso arising from an zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso branches arising from the same zzso on one side; zzso a zzso mechanism with zzso in the most peripheral branches of the zzso zzso a zzso simultaneous zzso stroke in zzso zzso Based on clinical course, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CT scans, and digital zzso zzso none of these hypotheses could be clearly associated with the zzso of the zzso Nevertheless, we propose that an anomalous common zzso for both zzso territories should represent the necessary condition for the zzso insult and, zzso other factors should intervene as possible determining zzso
