To propose a simple, accurate method for measuring zzso in flowing blood and the zzso input function zzso and to evaluate the impact on dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

A total of 10 rabbits were scanned at zzso zzso and administered a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were acquired in the zzso arteries using a rapid three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso recalled echo zzso zzso Correction was made for imperfect zzso fields, zzso and partial volume zzso zzso parameters blood volume zzso and zzso transfer constant zzso in resting skeletal muscle were estimated from zzso analysis using individually measured zzso Literature comparisons were made to assess zzso 

Blood zzso was more accurate and precise after correction for zzso and partial volume errors zzso zzso 72 zzso Measured zzso followed reported zzso zzso characteristics for zzso clearance in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso based on corrected blood zzso were more zzso and in better agreement with literature zzso 

The proposed method enables accurate in zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso and can be easily implemented in a range of zzso applications to improve both the accuracy and zzso of zzso zzso
