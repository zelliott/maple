zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to investigate volumes of different brain structures in 19 patients with zzso major depression zzso 27 patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso and 13 age matched zzso 3-D zzso sequences were acquired using a zzso zzso T zzso Whole brain volume, zzso volume, volume of the frontal and zzso zzso and the volume of the zzso complex were assessed using the software zzso zzso Compared to the controls, depressed patients showed a significantly lower whole brain volume and a significantly higher zzso volume, whereas volumes of the frontal and zzso zzso as well as the zzso complex volumes were not significantly zzso In addition, depressed patients exhibited a higher zzso ratio suggesting a higher degree of central zzso compared to healthy zzso In contrast, zzso patients showed significantly lower volumes than depressed patients and controls with respect to all zzso zzso Although the findings indicate the presence of brain zzso in patients with zzso depression, the pattern of zzso changes in these patients differs markedly from that observed in patients with primary degenerative zzso
