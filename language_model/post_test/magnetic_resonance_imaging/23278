The effective connectivity networks among overlapped core regions recruited by motor execution zzso and motor imagery zzso were explored by means of conditional zzso causality and zzso method, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Our results demonstrated more circuits of effective connectivity among the selected seed regions during right-hand performance than during zzso performance, zzso the influences of brain asymmetry of zzso on effective connectivity zzso The increased zzso connections were found during ME than during zzso suggesting that the ME network may have some additional connections compared to zzso networks to execute the overt physical zzso Furthermore, the zzso degrees of information flow suggested left zzso zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso as zzso sources in zzso tasks, highlighting the dominant function of left zzso zzso and zzso These findings depicted the zzso connectivity of motor related core regions in zzso circuit and might indicate the conversion of zzso networks between ME and zzso
