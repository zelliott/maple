The aim of this zzso study was to compare zzso with zzso weighted zzso scans of the labyrinth after meningitis and to investigate whether waiting with scanning improved the reliability of diagnosing an ongoing process such as cochlear zzso zzso patients were included who suffered from meningitis induced hearing loss zzso imaging zzso year after zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso and 45 zzso weighted zzso scans were scored by two zzso regarding the condition of the zzso These zzso observations were compared with the condition of the zzso as described during cochlear zzso A higher percentage of agreement with surgery was found for zzso (both zzso zzso than for zzso weighted zzso scans zzso 1: zzso zzso zzso zzso but this difference is not zzso There was no significant difference between early zzso zzso and late zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso imaging soon after meningitis allows early diagnosis without suffering from a lower agreement with surgical zzso
