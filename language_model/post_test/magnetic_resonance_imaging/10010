The use of zzso systems zzso for brain biopsy has increased in zzso zzso We sought to evaluate the accuracy of a zzso zzso zzso hole mounted guide for zzso biopsy using an zzso and compare the results of different targeting methods with those of frame based zzso 

zzso were performed on a skull model with mounted zzso with a zzso frame in place and data was loaded onto the zzso zzso The model was placed in a Mayfield head holder and fixed to the OR zzso Registration of imaging to physical space was carried zzso Using three different targeting methods on the zzso zzso the distance between the target and the predicted position of the target, the offset error, was measured in three dimensions and confirmed by 2 zzso A sum of squares for the 3 offset errors in all planes was used to calculate the summed zzso zzso The same zzso zzso used with the zzso zzso zzso frame for zzso The summed zzso error was calculated in the same manner to compare the accuracy of targeting with these guides to the zzso zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso using the zzso guide 4 zzso targeting method the mean error was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso error was zzso zzso zzso zzso For the registration set and target using the zzso guide 4 zzso targeting method the mean error was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso error was zzso zzso zzso zzso The best zzso was obtained with the zzso zzso planning and zzso The mean error was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso error was zzso zzso zzso zzso We found a statistical difference between the different techniques zzso zzso One Way Analysis of zzso on zzso An all zzso multiple comparison procedure zzso zzso found an overall significance level zzso zzso For the zzso zzso the mean error from the target was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean target zzso error zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso We found a statistically significant difference between zzso guide zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Rank zzso zzso 

These results indicate that using MR imaging, surgical planning software and the skull mounted zzso with the zzso eye view option for zzso zzso accuracy appears to fall within acceptable ranges compared with zzso methods which have been the standards for zzso brain biopsy and functional zzso Furthermore, there may be considerable differences in accuracy between different targeting zzso
