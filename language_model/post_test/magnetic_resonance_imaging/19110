zzso resonance imaging has become the standard means of imaging pediatric airway obstruction due to vascular zzso However, magnetic resonance imaging requires a long acquisition time and is prone to motion zzso The development of spiral or zzso zzso zzso provides an alternative imaging zzso for evaluating pediatric airway zzso We present the case of a zzso with a double zzso arch which initially was not identified on magnetic resonance imaging but was zzso with spiral zzso zzso If suspicion of an zzso zzso is high, spiral zzso zzso may be a useful adjunct or replacement to magnetic resonance zzso
