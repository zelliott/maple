The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic performance of the combination of zzso stress zzso and late zzso enhancement zzso in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging allows the detection of significant coronary artery disease by zzso stress zzso and zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso may be altered in patients after zzso zzso to more complex zzso zzso and different distances of the contrast zzso through different zzso and native coronary zzso Additionally, all studies have excluded patients after zzso 

In all, 78 patients (age 66 zzso 8 years; 71 zzso underwent zzso imaging including left zzso function, zzso zzso stress zzso zzso 140 zzso using zzso zzso body weight zzso acid and an additional zzso zzso for zzso 1 day before invasive coronary zzso Images were analyzed visually using the speed of contrast zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso defects of the size of a vessel or graft territory defined by zzso were considered true zzso even when supplied by a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and grafted or zzso native vessels zzso zzso or zzso zzso in invasive zzso were considered zzso 

The prevalence of patients with significant zzso was zzso zzso functionally zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, on a patient basis, and zzso and zzso on a vessel territory zzso zzso if only areas supplied by zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso was zzso and specificity was zzso compared with territories supplied by zzso native vessels zzso zzso zzso with sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and specificity for the 53 areas with prior zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

For patients after surgical zzso the combination of stress zzso and zzso yields good diagnostic accuracy for the detection and zzso of significant zzso However, sensitivity is reduced compared with published data in patients without zzso Prior zzso zzso can be examined without loss of zzso
