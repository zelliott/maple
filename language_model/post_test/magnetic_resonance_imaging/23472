The aim of this study was to evaluate whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used as a zzso approach to assessment of disease severity and muscle damage in zzso zzso type 1 zzso 

The zzso findings in legs of 41 patients with zzso were evaluated with respect to the zzso anterior zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso resonance imaging findings were compared with zzso strength zzso obtained by quantitative manual testing, duration of the disease and with the length of the zzso zzso 

Muscle zzso abnormalities were observed in zzso of zzso patients, ranging from zzso abnormalities alone to severe zzso zzso zzso abnormalities seem to be an earlier zzso marker of the zzso zzso zzso correlated with the zzso muscle force zzso zzso zzso the severity zzso zzso zzso of the disease but not with the duration of the disease zzso zzso zzso or the length of the zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso measured in peripheral zzso zzso of other muscles of the legs revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso muscles were the most frequently and severely affected muscles, while zzso zzso muscles were relatively zzso zzso abnormalities are most frequently observed in the skeletal muscles of the anterior zzso 

Muscle zzso is helpful to depict muscle abnormalities but does not seem to be a reliable indicator of skeletal muscle involvement in zzso since the decrease in zzso force is not correlated with zzso abnormalities in some zzso
