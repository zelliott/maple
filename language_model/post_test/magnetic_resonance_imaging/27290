In clinical practice, both coronary anatomy and zzso zzso information are needed to assess coronary artery disease zzso The extent and severity of coronary zzso can be determined using zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso the presence and amount of zzso can be identified using zzso zzso imaging, such as zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso To determine which specific zzso is associated with which zzso region, experts use assumptions on coronary zzso zzso Due to the high zzso between patient's coronary artery zzso as well as the uncertain relation between zzso territories and zzso coronary zzso zzso systems are zzso 

We present a zzso zzso system, called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for relating coronary zzso and zzso deficits derived from zzso and zzso zzso The system consists of the following comprehensive zzso zzso two or three-dimensional fusion of anatomical and functional information, zzso automatic detection and ranking of coronary zzso zzso zzso of zzso coronary zzso zzso 

The potential benefits of the zzso tool in assessing zzso were investigated through a zzso evaluation zzso zzso zzso zzso two experts analyzed four cases of patients with suspected zzso coronary artery zzso When using the zzso zzso a more reliable zzso of the relation between zzso deficits and zzso led to a more accurate diagnosis, as well as a better zzso diagnosis zzso 

The zzso comprehensive zzso system can be effectively used to assess disease status in zzso zzso patients, offering valuable new options for the diagnosis and management of these zzso
