This study used quantitative zzso imaging to determine the effect of surgical zzso on zzso survival of patients with zzso zzso Previous studies relied on the zzso impressions of the amount of tumor removed, which is a less reliable measure of the extent of zzso 

Information concerning possible zzso factors was collected for 75 patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging or zzso zzso preoperatively and within 10 days zzso Image analysis of the zzso studies was conducted to zzso zzso and zzso total tumor volumes and enhancing zzso zzso and zzso zzso hazards models were used to analyze the zzso of survival regarding 22 zzso that might affect zzso The zzso that were entered included age, zzso tumor grade, cumulative radiation dose, chemotherapy, zzso as a first zzso zzso performance status at zzso zzso and zzso total and enhancing tumor volumes, ratio of zzso to zzso total and enhancing tumor volumes, tumor location, zzso impression of the degree of zzso and subsequent zzso 

There were 23 patients with zzso zzso and 52 with zzso zzso The estimated mean survival time was 27 months for patients undergoing gross total zzso 33 months for zzso zzso and 13 months for open or zzso zzso Five factors that were significant zzso of survival in zzso analysis were tumor grade, age, zzso performance status, radiation dose, and zzso complications zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, tumor grade, radiation dose, age, zzso status, zzso presence of enhancing tumor in zzso imaging, and zzso volume of enhancing tumor were significantly associated with survival zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that the most important zzso factors affecting survival of patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso are tumor grade, age, zzso performance status, and radiation zzso zzso complications adversely affect zzso zzso surgical zzso did not impart a significant increase in survival zzso zzso zzso may improve survival, but its importance is less than that of other factors and may be zzso only by larger zzso
