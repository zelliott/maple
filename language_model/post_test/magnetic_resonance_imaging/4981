To evaluate a fully automatic zzso diagnosis zzso method for breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso which considered dynamic as well as zzso parameters and linked those to descriptions laid down in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso zzso zzso 

MR images of 108 patients with 141 zzso proven zzso zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso were zzso The zzso system automatically performed the following processing steps: zzso zzso motion zzso detection of zzso by a zzso algorithm, extraction of multiple dynamic and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso As one final result, the zzso were zzso by defining their probability of zzso this so-called zzso index zzso ranged from zzso The results of the zzso system were correlated with zzso zzso 

The zzso system had a high detection rate of the zzso proven zzso missing only two zzso of invasive zzso zzso and four benign zzso (three zzso one zzso zzso zzso The 86 detected zzso zzso showed a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso the mean zzso of the 49 coded benign zzso was zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Based on zzso characteristic analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the zzso system was zzso Using an appropriate zzso value zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso combined with specificity of zzso 

The fully automatic zzso technique seems to reliably distinguish between benign and zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso may be a promising additional tool for the interpretation of breast zzso in the clinical zzso
