In zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a marker of poor prognosis regarding seizure zzso but predicts success of anterior zzso lobe zzso Manual zzso of zzso on zzso is time-consuming and limited by investigator zzso zzso ranges of zzso volumes, both in absolute terms and relative to zzso volume, and of zzso asymmetry were defined using an automatic label propagation and decision fusion technique based on thirty manually derived zzso of healthy zzso Manual zzso reliability and zzso of automatically and manually determined zzso volumes were zzso with similarity zzso zzso zzso clinical identification of zzso zzso and zzso normal zzso volumes, was determined in nine patients with zzso confirmed zzso sclerosis in terms of volumes and asymmetry zzso zzso for standard statistical thresholds and with receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso Manual zzso reliability was very high, with zzso between zzso and zzso Manual and automatic zzso labels overlapped with a zzso of zzso on the unaffected but with zzso on the zzso zzso zzso was higher for less zzso zzso The automatic method correctly identified zzso zzso in terms of absolute volume, zzso in terms of relative volume at a standard 2 zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso thresholds allowed clinically desirable correct identification of all zzso zzso zzso with zzso specificity for volumes, and zzso specificity for zzso The method has the potential to automatically detect unilateral zzso but further work is needed to determine its performance in detecting clinically important bilateral zzso
