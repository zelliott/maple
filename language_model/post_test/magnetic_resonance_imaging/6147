The objective was to assess the effect of zzso treatment on a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of cartilage volume loss, and on zzso zzso zzso activity in a guinea pig zzso zzso zzso pigs (9 months old) were zzso with vehicle or zzso zzso zzso zzso for 66 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the left knee was acquired zzso and post zzso Change in zzso zzso plateau zzso cartilage volume zzso was determined using image zzso At zzso zzso cartilage was removed from knees and zzso zzso activity determined using a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso animals lost zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso group lost zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso whilst the zzso zzso group lost zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of active zzso were below limits of detection in all zzso However, zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso acid activated zzso and zzso levels, reduced zzso levels by zzso and zzso levels by zzso zzso treatment resulted in partial protection from zzso loss and was associated with complete reduction in zzso and zzso and partial reduction in zzso zzso These data imply a role of zzso in cartilage zzso but incomplete protection suggests that additional zzso insensitive mechanisms are important in this zzso The protective effect of zzso zzso with the clinical finding of lessened joint space zzso strengthens the utility of this animal model in identifying zzso zzso drugs and supports the use of zzso zzso of cartilage zzso
