To develop an interpretation model, based on repeatedly acquired images, aimed at improving assessments of technical efficacy and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of small zzso 

A theoretical model is zzso The studied population consists of subjects that develop focal zzso which increase in size in zzso of interest during the study zzso The imaging zzso produces images that can be zzso with high precision, zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso At least four repeat examinations are carried zzso 

The interpretation is performed in four or five steps: zzso Independent readers interpret the examinations zzso without access to previous or subsequent zzso zzso zzso found on images at the last examination are included in the analysis, with interpretation in zzso zzso By concurrent zzso in consensus, the zzso are identified on previous images until they are so small that even in zzso they are zzso The earliest examination at which included zzso appear is recorded, and the zzso are verified by their growth zzso reference zzso zzso size and other characteristics may be zzso zzso Records made at step 1 are corrected to those of steps 2 and zzso False zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso type is confirmed by another diagnostic zzso 

zzso on subjects with progressive disease, the proposed image interpretation model may improve assessments of technical efficacy and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of small focal zzso The model may provide an accurate imaging reference standard as well as repeated detection rates and zzso rates for tested imaging zzso However, potential review bias zzso a strict zzso
