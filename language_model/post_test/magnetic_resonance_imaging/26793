The aim of this study was to characterize the association between trait zzso and regional gray matter volume in patients with zzso zzso patients with schizophrenia and 56 healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso to acquire high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured using the Chapman zzso Physical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to investigate brain volume zzso of trait zzso Several brain regions in the patient group, including the left zzso and right zzso zzso zzso were found to show significantly less correlation with zzso scores than those of the control zzso zzso analysis revealed that negative correlations between the regional gray matter volume and the zzso scores in the patient group were found at a trend level in the left zzso and the right zzso In conclusion, these findings suggest that trait zzso in patients with schizophrenia could possibly be associated with a volume deficit in brain regions related to zzso which reflects the impairment of self-referential processing and reward zzso
