The mathematical model of zzso brain zzso which was presented at the previous meeting in 1987, was applied to the analysis of zzso brain zzso associated with zzso zzso resonance images of 90 patients with zzso zzso were reviewed to analyze the spatial extension of zzso brain zzso It is assumed that the zzso pattern of distribution of zzso zzso reflects the zzso of the compact density of the fibers in the white zzso A two zzso finite element model was constructed with zzso triangular elements from a horizontal section of the human zzso The development of zzso the change of zzso pressure, the deformation of the brain and the zzso of zzso fluid could be simulated by the finite element zzso The result of computer simulation represented interactive zzso of the brain zzso zzso fluid, and zzso fluid in the clinical zzso The finite element method zzso may provide a new experimental tool to analyze the zzso of zzso brain zzso
