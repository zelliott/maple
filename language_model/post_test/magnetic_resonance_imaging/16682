zzso is argued to stem from the dysfunctional processing of zzso Investigation of zzso in healthy samples has the potential to offer refined insight into the particular aspects of reward processing in mania that are zzso 

In this study, zzso was employed in contrasting a sample of 12 zzso zzso zzso individuals with a sample of 12 zzso controls in order to investigate zzso processing in a zzso zzso 

Four findings in the zzso group relative to the control group supported zzso reward zzso zzso zzso zzso that correlated with reward value and prediction error was stronger in response to cues and outcomes respectively, consistent with zzso being related to an enhanced perception of the value of goals that may lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was stronger in response to cues, suggesting that in zzso individuals, stimuli in memory were represented in accordance with their perceived zzso zzso these effects failed to be modulated by the actual value of zzso suggesting that zzso is related to a decreased ability to discriminate between cues differing in zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in response to expected, but zzso reward was consistent with a bias towards expecting positive outcomes in zzso 

Together, the findings suggest that enhanced perception and representation of zzso that nonetheless fails to discriminate on the basis of actual zzso coupled with a positive zzso bias, could be zzso related to insatiable and indiscriminate reward seeking in zzso
