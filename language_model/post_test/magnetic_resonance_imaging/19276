Patient VP underwent complete zzso for the control of intractable zzso at the age of 27 zzso zzso zzso however, revealed spared zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso ends of the corpus zzso We report a series of experiments designed to determine whether these zzso support functional transfer of information between the two cerebral zzso Although we found no evidence for transfer of zzso shape or size information, there is good evidence for transfer of word zzso This suggests that the spared zzso zzso in zzso corpus zzso are zzso The results of these experiments illustrate the remarkable degree of functional specificity within the corpus zzso
