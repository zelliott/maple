zzso of the capital zzso zzso is a significant late toxicity of treatment for childhood leukemia and zzso We determined clinical and imaging risk factors predicting clinical joint outcomes of zzso head zzso in pediatric patients with leukemia or zzso 

We reviewed zzso medical records and magnetic resonance imaging scans of 80 patients with zzso of the capital zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine relationships between risk factors and outcomes of joint surface collapse and zzso We used zzso survival zzso to display the time to joint surface collapse and zzso based on selected zzso 

Median time between primary diagnosis and diagnosis of zzso of the hip was zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso patients zzso underwent zzso in 36 hips at a mean of zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso after diagnosis of zzso Median age at time of first zzso was zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso Joint outcome of zzso was predicted solely by zzso size at diagnosis of zzso The worst prognosis was associated with zzso occupying more than zzso of the zzso head zzso zzso of hips with these zzso collapsed within 2 years of diagnosis and 50% required zzso 

zzso size of zzso is the best predictor of clinical joint outcome of hip zzso in survivors of pediatric zzso zzso zzso occupying more than zzso of the zzso head have high likelihood of joint deterioration zzso zzso at a young zzso
