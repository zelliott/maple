The study compared flow reserve zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso with quantitative measures of coronary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso evaluation of zzso flow by zzso has recently been zzso However, a comparison to quantitative flow measurement as assessed by PET has not been reported in patients with coronary artery disease zzso 

Two groups of healthy volunteers and 25 patients with zzso documented zzso were examined by zzso and PET at rest and during zzso zzso Dynamic zzso was performed using a zzso zzso hybrid sequence and a rapid zzso acid zzso injection zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were regionally determined from zzso signal intensity zzso and compared to zzso zzso PET flow reserve zzso 

In healthy volunteers, the zzso analysis showed a zzso index of zzso plus minus zzso which was higher than peak intensity zzso plus minus zzso but lower than flow reserve by PET zzso plus minus zzso zzso of coronary artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso index, yielded sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso index correlated with PET flow reserve zzso zzso zzso A reduced coronary flow reserve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by the zzso index with sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso underestimate flow reserve values, but may represent a promising zzso technique for detection and severity assessment of regional zzso
