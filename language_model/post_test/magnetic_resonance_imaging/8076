To assess the association between the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer zzso assessed by optical zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso disease zzso 

We studied a prospective cohort of 61 patients and 29 matched controls for 2 years, performing a zzso assessment every 3 months and an zzso zzso including zzso scans, every 6 zzso zzso zzso studies were also carried out from which brain volume and zzso load were zzso 

We found that the zzso thickness in patients with zzso was thinner than in controls, particularly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was greater in patients who also had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it also zzso in zzso patients who did not have zzso zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with greater disability zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and longer disease duration zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with the presence of new relapses and changes in the Expanded zzso zzso zzso by the end of the study zzso zzso zzso in all zzso Indeed, zzso thickness was correlated with white matter volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and gray matter volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The presence of zzso was a risk factor for having new relapses in the next 2 years zzso ratio zzso zzso p zzso zzso and patients with zzso had larger zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso 

zzso nerve fiber layer zzso and the presence of retinal zzso are associated with disease activity, suggesting that retinal evaluation can be used as zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso
