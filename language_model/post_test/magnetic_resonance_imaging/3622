zzso zzso function is common in the acute zzso phase but little is known about its effects on functional outcome after acute zzso zzso This study sought to investigate the impact of zzso dysfunction by Ewing's zzso on functional outcome 2 months after acute zzso zzso 

34 consecutive acute zzso stroke patients within 7 days after onset were zzso On admission, zzso function was assessed by Ewing's battery zzso Stroke severity was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso autonomy in activities of daily living by the zzso Index zzso and global disability by the modified Rankin zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also evaluated 2 months after zzso stroke zzso 

On admission, eight patients were diagnosed as minor zzso dysfunction and 26 patients as relatively severe zzso zzso The prevalence of relatively severe zzso dysfunction in zzso stroke patients was zzso There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the minor and severe zzso dysfunction zzso 2 months after stroke zzso the mean zzso score of patients with minor zzso dysfunction and severe zzso dysfunction increased from zzso on admission to zzso zzso on admission to zzso zzso The mean zzso score after zzso stroke onset and the change in zzso from admission to zzso outcome zzso zzso in patients with severe zzso dysfunction were lower than those in patients with minor zzso dysfunction (all zzso 

zzso dysfunction occurs in acute stroke zzso Relatively severe zzso dysfunction is related to an zzso functional outcome in patients with acute zzso zzso
