Older adults show extensive zzso in cognitive performance, including episodic zzso A portion of this zzso could potentially be explained by genetic zzso Recent literature shows that the neurotransmitter zzso plays an important role in memory zzso as enhancements of brain zzso have led to memory zzso Here, we have begun to explore genetic contributions to the performance and underlying brain activity associated with source memory zzso Using a source recognition memory task during zzso zzso this study offers evidence that older adults who carry a short zzso zzso of the zzso zzso linked zzso region zzso in the zzso gene show specific deficits in source memory monitoring relative to older adults who are zzso for the long zzso zzso These deficits are accompanied by less neural activity in regions of prefrontal zzso that have been shown to support accurate memory zzso Moreover, while the older adult zzso group's behavioral performance does not differ from younger adults, their brain zzso reveals evidence of zzso zzso that likely supports their higher performance zzso These results provide preliminary evidence that the zzso zzso profile is cognitively beneficial to older adults, particularly for memory zzso
