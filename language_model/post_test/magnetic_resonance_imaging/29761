To explore the optimal reaction condition of zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso 

The number zzso of zzso zzso and maximum zzso capacity of zzso complex were analyzed at different zzso zzso ratios zzso 500, zzso zzso and in buffer solutions of different pH values zzso 5, 6, 7, and 8, zzso 

The number of zzso zzso zzso increased with the pH value of the reaction zzso When the zzso zzso ratio was below 500, the number of zzso zzso that zzso coupled increased with the zzso zzso ratio, but tended to decrease when the ratio was zzso No significant difference in the maximum zzso capacity of zzso complex was noted between the zzso 

The number of zzso zzso that zzso coupled depends on the pH value of the reaction system and zzso zzso ratio, but the maximum zzso capacity of zzso complex is not affected by the reaction zzso
