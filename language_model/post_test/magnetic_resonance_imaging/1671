This study was designed to determine the enhancement profile of a zzso contrast agent zzso zzso in comparison to a standard zzso agent on zzso magnetic resonance zzso images in acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging demonstrated the ability to accurately zzso zzso size; however, some controversies persist about which contrast medium is best zzso 

Fifteen rabbits underwent zzso and permanent zzso of a branch of the left coronary zzso Two animals died before imaging, eight were examined 48 h after zzso and five animals were zzso six weeks following induction of zzso All animals received 50 zzso of zzso 24 h before the MR zzso Continuous zzso views were collected using an inversion recovery zzso fast low angle shot zzso Imaging was repeated 5 to 10 zzso following additional injection of 100 zzso of zzso The area of zzso demarcated following zzso injection was compared with the region of zzso seen on zzso plus zzso enhanced image using zzso zzso zzso zzso as the standard of zzso 

In acute zzso the mean difference in size of zzso seen on the two different in zzso MR scans was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso showed excellent agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no enhancement with zzso whereas application of zzso resulted in zzso zzso Standard zzso contrast agents do not overestimate the size of acute zzso The combination of zzso and zzso can distinguish acute and chronic zzso injury because chronic zzso do not enhance with zzso
