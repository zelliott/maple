A conclusive mapping of zzso zzso zzso onto the cortical sheet and, thus, a corresponding mapping to zzso zzso zzso does not exist zzso In this paper we present a zzso model which can zzso on the basis of known zzso zzso in different primary and zzso cortical areas, resulting in simulated zzso quantitative zzso zzso The predicted patterns can be used in brain zzso Our model is validated using a similarity distance metric which enables quantitative comparison of the results with empirical data measured using zzso The work presented may provide new perspectives for this line of research, both in imaging and in zzso the relationship with zzso and zzso thus leading the way towards zzso zzso using zzso
