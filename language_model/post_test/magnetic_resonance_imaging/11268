To define zzso zzso relationships for zzso zzso using a rat brain zzso 

A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak zzso beam zzso involving the right zzso Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 zzso gray zzso zzso were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction zzso One extra animal was included at the zzso and zzso zzso Animals were zzso using a standard zzso GE zzso zzso A zzso surface zzso was employed to obtain zzso zzso images zzso 600 and TE 30) and dual echo zzso zzso images zzso 3,000 and TE zzso Animals were zzso at zzso 3, zzso 6 and 9 zzso zzso analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on zzso images, and signal change versus time zzso were zzso zzso zzso imaging was also done at the zzso time point to further evaluate tissue zzso The development of zzso was also zzso 

Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of zzso zzso significant differences were seen between the zzso and zzso animals and between the zzso and zzso animals zzso zzso zzso using zzso Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 zzso The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 zzso which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and zzso compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower zzso zzso developed first in the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated zzso in zzso zzso 

Following zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso serial zzso show zzso signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 zzso as well as the development of zzso zzso relationships using zzso zzso in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain zzso
