Image registration is an often encountered problem in various fields including medical imaging, computer vision and image zzso Numerous zzso for registering image data have been reported in these zzso In this paper, we present a novel curve evolution approach expressed in a zzso framework to achieve image intensity morphing and a simple zzso zzso for the corresponding coordinate zzso The key features of the intensity morphing model are that zzso it is very fast and zzso existence and uniqueness of the solution for the evolution model are established in a zzso space as opposed to using zzso zzso The salient features of the coordinate registration model are its simplicity and zzso zzso The intensity zzso is easily achieved via evolving zzso of one image into the zzso of the zzso To explicitly estimate the coordinate transformation between the images, we derive a zzso zzso motion model which can be solved very zzso We demonstrate the performance of our zzso on a variety of images including synthetic and real zzso As an application of the zzso motion model, zzso based zzso of zzso shape from several MR brain scans is zzso In each of these experiments, automated zzso shape recovery results are validated via manual zzso zzso
