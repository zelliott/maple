In the magnetic resonance zzso evaluation of the zzso zzso all studies to our knowledge have included mixed populations of patients, those with acute shoulder injuries as well as patients with chronic shoulder zzso The focus of this investigation was to assess the effectiveness of MR zzso in patients with chronic zzso tears, excluding those with acute zzso 

Prospective case zzso 

Conventional MR images and MR zzso were obtained in 36 patients from April 1994 to April zzso A single experienced musculoskeletal zzso read all MR zzso Each patient subsequently underwent shoulder zzso performed by a single highly experienced shoulder zzso zzso zzso reports were then reviewed and compared with the MR findings documented before surgery, with zzso findings being the standard of reference for zzso zzso criteria required greater than 6 months of shoulder symptoms before imaging, thus eliminating acute zzso 

SLAP zzso were diagnosed at the time of surgery in 11 of 36 patients zzso The sensitivity was zzso (11 of 11 zzso and the specificity was zzso zzso of 25 zzso zzso for SLAP zzso was zzso zzso of 36 zzso zzso zzso tears were diagnosed surgically in 12 of 36 patients zzso The sensitivity was zzso (12 of 14 zzso and specificity was zzso (19 of 22 zzso zzso for zzso tears was zzso zzso of 36 zzso 

MR zzso is an accurate technique for assessing the zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso
