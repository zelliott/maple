To zzso measure the mean apparent diffusion zzso zzso with zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and the mean zzso ratio zzso with three-dimensional zzso hydrogen 1 zzso MR zzso imaging in regions of interest zzso drawn over benign and zzso peripheral zone zzso zzso tissue and to assess zzso zzso and combined zzso and zzso for identifying zzso zzso with zzso zzso examination as the reference zzso 

The institutional review board approved this zzso retrospective study and issued a waiver of informed zzso From among 61 consecutive patients with prostate cancer, 38 men zzso age, 61 years; range, zzso zzso who underwent zzso zzso MR imaging before radical zzso and who fulfilled all inclusion criteria of no prior hormonal or radiation treatment and at least one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso examination were zzso zzso maps were generated from zzso MR imaging data, and zzso maps of zzso plus zzso plus zzso were calculated from zzso zzso MR zzso imaging zzso zzso in the zzso identified by matching zzso slides with zzso images were zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Areas under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were used to evaluate zzso 

The mean zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso differed significantly from the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso for benign zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso In distinguishing zzso zzso combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso performed significantly better than zzso alone zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and was also better than zzso alone zzso zzso zzso although the difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso performs significantly better than zzso for zzso between benign and zzso zzso in the zzso
