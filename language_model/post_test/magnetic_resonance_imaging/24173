Dynamic zzso MR imaging has been used successfully to identify zzso recurrence or zzso changes in zzso and cervical zzso Our purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of dynamic zzso MR imaging for distinguishing zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients with 20 zzso proved zzso zzso zzso 12; zzso or zzso zzso zzso were enrolled in the zzso Three observers, blinded to zzso results, independently evaluated conventional MR images, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso then were determined by zzso Dynamic images were obtained using fast zzso sequences at 5, 30, 60, 90, zzso zzso 180, and 300 seconds after the injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso intensity zzso of suspected zzso were analyzed by a zzso zzso The calculated zzso and tissue distribution time were used to characterize zzso and their values were displayed as a color-coded zzso 

zzso images yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso images yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso had faster zzso time, 41 versus 88 zzso and higher zzso zzso versus zzso arbitrary zzso enhancement than did zzso or zzso zzso A zzso of 65 seconds for distribution time and zzso units for zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for diagnosing zzso zzso 

Dynamic MR imaging can differentiate accurately zzso zzso from zzso changes and seems to be a valuable diagnostic zzso
