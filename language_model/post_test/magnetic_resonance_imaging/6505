Response zzso deficits are characteristic of individuals with zzso disorder zzso Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies investigating the neural zzso of this dysfunction have used block designs, making it difficult to zzso zzso differences specifically related to response zzso from zzso differences related to zzso involved in task zzso The current study was designed to further enhance our understanding of this critical function in individuals with zzso using zzso zzso 

Ten adolescent boys diagnosed with zzso combined type, and 12 typically developing controls completed a zzso task modified to control for novelty zzso 

The zzso group made significantly more errors of omission and more errors of commission than the control zzso Further, compared with controls, individuals with zzso showed marked abnormalities in brain zzso during response zzso including zzso of the zzso zzso extending to the supplementary motor area and zzso of the left zzso zzso 

The authors suggest that zzso in frontal regions reflects core deficits in zzso abilities for the zzso zzso
