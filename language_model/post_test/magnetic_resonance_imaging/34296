Current investigations suggest that brain white matter may be zzso altered in schizophrenia even in the face of normal white matter zzso zzso zzso imaging provides a new approach for zzso the directional zzso and possibly connectivity of white matter fibers in zzso 

Ten men who were veterans of the US Armed Forces and met the zzso criteria for schizophrenia and 10 healthy, zzso control men were scanned using magnetic resonance diffusion zzso imaging and magnetic resonance structural zzso 

Relative to controls, the patients with schizophrenia exhibited lower zzso in white matter, despite absence of a white matter volume zzso In contrast to the white matter pattern, gray matter zzso did not distinguish the groups, even though the patients with schizophrenia had a significant gray matter volume zzso The abnormal white matter zzso in patients with schizophrenia was present in both zzso and was zzso extending from the frontal to zzso brain zzso 

Despite the small sample size, diffusion zzso imaging was powerful enough to yield significant group differences, indicating widespread zzso in brain white matter integrity but not necessarily white matter volume in zzso
