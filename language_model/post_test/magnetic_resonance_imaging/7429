zzso with statins is known to zzso zzso brain damage after experimental stroke, and is independent of cholesterol zzso We undertook zzso vs zzso treatment with zzso after focal cerebral zzso in zzso 

Male zzso rats underwent transient zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle was administered zzso zzso were divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso rats were given zzso or vehicle for 7 days before zzso In the zzso rats received zzso or vehicle for 7 days after zzso zzso of zzso volume, as well as neurological and zzso zzso were done zzso and 7 days after zzso 

Each zzso group demonstrated significant reductions in zzso and zzso volumes compared with the zzso group zzso after zzso Seven days after zzso zzso volumes in the zzso group and zzso group (but not the zzso zzso were significantly smaller than in the zzso zzso Only the zzso group had significantly improved neurological scores 7 days after zzso compared with the vehicle zzso zzso and zzso groups had significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso DNA damage, zzso zzso expression of tumor necrosis zzso and zzso damage in the cortical zzso boundary area after 7 days of zzso 

These results suggest that continuous oral administration (avoiding zzso with statins after stroke may reduce the extent of zzso brain damage and improve neurological outcome by zzso zzso stress and inflammatory zzso
