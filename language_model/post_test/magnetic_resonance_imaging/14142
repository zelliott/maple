It has been proposed that object perception can proceed through different routes, which can be situated on a zzso ranging from complete zzso to complete zzso depending on the objects and the task at zzso Although these different routes have been extensively demonstrated on the behavioral level, the corresponding distinction in the underlying neural zzso has not received the same zzso Our goal was to zzso on the behavioral and the zzso level, a process associated with extreme zzso zzso mental zzso and a process associated with extreme zzso zzso the use of zzso diagnostic zzso Two sets of 3-D block figures were created that either differed in zzso zzso versus zzso or in the angles joining the block components zzso versus zzso zzso measures on a zzso judgment task were predicted to be dependent on viewpoint in the rotation condition zzso versus zzso but not in the zzso condition zzso angles versus different zzso Six subjects participated in an zzso experiment while presented with both conditions in alternating zzso Both reaction times and accuracy confirmed the predicted zzso between the two zzso zzso results indicate that all cortical areas activated in the zzso condition were also activated in the rotation zzso zzso areas were more activated than zzso areas in the rotation condition, while this pattern was reversed in the zzso zzso Furthermore, some areas were activated uniquely by the rotation condition, probably reflecting the additional processes apparent in the behavioral response zzso
