zzso between cognitive deficits and brain zzso changes observed in schizophrenia are alternately explained by less gray matter in the brain cerebral cortex, by zzso in neural zzso involving the zzso zzso and by zzso in zzso structures and related neural zzso This work explored a model encompassing all of these possibilities to identify the strongest zzso relationships to cognitive skill in zzso 

Seventy-one patients with schizophrenia and zzso healthy control subjects were characterized by zzso tests covering six functional zzso zzso of zzso brain zzso structures were taken using zzso and fully manual tracing of zzso images, with the full set of measures completed on thirty of the patients and zzso zzso Group differences were zzso A zzso zzso method identified those zzso features, which best explained zzso test scores in the context of a zzso response linear model with zzso 

Patients performed significantly worse on all zzso tests except some regarding executive zzso The most prominent zzso observations were enlarged zzso reduced zzso superior zzso gray matter volumes, and increased zzso gray matter volumes in the zzso The zzso method associated zzso volumes with verbal learning, vigilance, and (to a lesser zzso executive function, while zzso volumes were associated with working zzso zzso regions were associated with vigilance, executive function, and, less zzso zzso zzso zzso volume was strongly associated with zzso speed, zzso and executive zzso Those zzso tests, which were strongly associated to zzso volume, showed only weak association to diagnosis, possibly because zzso volume was regarded a proxy for zzso Diagnosis was strongly associated with the other zzso tests, zzso that the zzso associations for these tasks reflected zzso effects and not merely group zzso zzso zzso effects were rarely zzso indicating that zzso relationships to zzso performance were similar for both patients and zzso 

The association of zzso and zzso structures to verbal learning, vigilance, and working memory supports the importance of neural connectivity to these zzso The finding that a zzso indicator of diagnosis zzso zzso provided more explanatory power than diagnosis itself for zzso speed, zzso and executive function suggests that zzso abnormalities in the disease are more important for zzso than zzso zzso
