This paper uses whole brain functional zzso in zzso normal participants to explore how reading aloud differs from object naming in terms of zzso zzso In the first experiment, we directly compared brain zzso during reading aloud and object zzso This revealed greater zzso for reading in bilateral zzso left zzso superior zzso and zzso zzso In a second experiment, we zzso the zzso system into object recognition and speech production areas by zzso manipulating the presence or absence of objects zzso of objects or their meaningless scrambled zzso with the presence or absence of speech production zzso zzso finger press zzso This demonstrated that the areas associated with speech production zzso naming and zzso saying zzso to meaningless scrambled zzso corresponded exactly to the areas where responses were higher for reading aloud than object naming in zzso zzso zzso the results suggest that, relative to object naming, reading increases the demands on shared speech production zzso At a cognitive level, enhanced zzso for reading in speech production areas may reflect the multiple and competing zzso codes that are generated from the zzso parts of written zzso At a zzso level, it may reflect differences in the speed with which different areas are activated and integrate with one zzso
