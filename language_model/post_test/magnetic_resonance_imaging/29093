The purpose of this study was to evaluate possibilities and technical risks for combining intended electrical stimulation of the cochlear nerve and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso considerations and experiments indicate that zzso can be performed safely during electrical zzso A nerve zzso was developed with minimized length of electrical conductors, current limiting resistance, high inner zzso of a current source, radio frequency zzso and avoidance of zzso zzso This nerve zzso transfers the zzso zzso stimulating current signal via a fiber zzso cable located near the area of zzso There, the optical signal drives an zzso current zzso This zzso was tested with zzso electrical stimulation of the cochlear nerve at the zzso during an zzso zzso No hazardous effects could be zzso The stimulation resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso Compared to the conventional zzso testing this method may allow a more objective examination of cochlear implant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
