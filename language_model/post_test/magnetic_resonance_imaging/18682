CT failed to identify zzso of primary zzso zzso equivalent to 24 patients per 1000 zzso zzso 14 to zzso with mild zzso To detect zzso zzso CT would need to have been performed within about eight zzso Rapid access to zzso clinics with same day CT brain imaging is required to avoid inappropriate secondary zzso Increased public awareness of the need to seek urgent medical attention after stroke should be zzso zzso should be considered in late presenting zzso
