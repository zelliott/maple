A patient with zzso zzso in the right frontal zzso treated with zzso and radiation, had a routine magnetic resonance imaging scan that was suspicious for zzso zzso zzso zzso showed moderately increased focal zzso in same region, compatible with recurrence of zzso however, the zzso was consistent with radiation zzso There are reported cases of zzso on zzso at other sites of the body due to chronic zzso but only one other case has been reported in the zzso zzso must be taken in interpretation of brain tumors on zzso zzso when treatment history includes prior radiation zzso
