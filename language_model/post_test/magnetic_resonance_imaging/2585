Multiple sclerosis zzso is a disease of the white zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is proven to be a sensitive method of monitoring the progression of this disease and of its changes due to treatment zzso zzso of the severity of the disease through zzso of zzso zzso volume via MR imaging is vital for understanding and monitoring the disease and its zzso This paper presents a novel methodology and a system that can be routinely used for zzso and zzso the volume of zzso zzso via zzso fast zzso MR zzso A recently developed concept of fuzzy objects forms the basis of this zzso An operator indicates a few points in the images by pointing to the white matter, the zzso matter, and the zzso fluid zzso Each of these objects is then detected as a fuzzy connected zzso The holes in the union of these objects zzso to potential zzso sites which are zzso to detect each potential zzso as a three-dimensional zzso fuzzy connected zzso These objects are presented to the operator who indicates zzso through the click of a mouse zzso The number and volume of accepted zzso is then zzso and zzso Based on several evaluation studies, we conclude that the methodology is highly reliable and consistent, with a zzso of variation zzso to zzso operator zzso of zzso (based on 20 patient studies, three operators, and two zzso for volume and a mean zzso volume fraction of zzso with a zzso confidence zzso of zzso (based on ten patient zzso
