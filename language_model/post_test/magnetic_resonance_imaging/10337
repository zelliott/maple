The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of zzso size on the positive zzso value zzso of biopsy in zzso breast zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of 666 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso that had zzso zzso zzso examinations were performed using a zzso zzso zzso were measured by the interpreting zzso before zzso zzso rate versus zzso size was zzso 

The median zzso zzso size was 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso zzso of which 80 zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso 66 zzso were invasive cancer, and three zzso were zzso The frequency of zzso increased significantly zzso zzso zzso with zzso size, with zzso found in one zzso of 37 zzso less than 5 zzso 44 zzso of 254 zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso of 151 zzso 10-14 zzso 21 zzso of 74 zzso zzso zzso and 46 zzso of 150 zzso 20 zzso or zzso zzso less than 5 zzso accounted for 37 zzso of 666 zzso that had a biopsy and one zzso zzso of 149 zzso (one zzso Among zzso less than 10 zzso the likelihood of zzso was highest in zzso women zzso zzso and in the extent of disease setting zzso zzso and lowest in zzso women zzso zzso and in the high-risk screening setting zzso zzso 

The zzso of biopsy for zzso identified at breast zzso using a zzso magnet significantly increased with increasing zzso zzso zzso is rarely necessary for zzso smaller than 5 zzso because of their low zzso likelihood of zzso Further work is needed to develop an zzso that uses size in addition to other patient and zzso factors to guide biopsy recommendations for zzso breast zzso
