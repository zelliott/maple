In multiple sclerosis zzso pathological changes have been found both in zzso zzso and normal appearing zzso zzso transfer ratio zzso and zzso relaxation time are abnormal in normal appearing zzso in established zzso This study used these MR techniques in early zzso to study normal appearing zzso and zzso The purpose was to determine whether abnormalities are already zzso in normal appearing zzso in early zzso and if so how they correlate with zzso zzso 

Twenty two patients with early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease duration 2 years, range 7 zzso zzso and 11 zzso controls were zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times were measured in 9 regions of normal appearing white matter zzso and 7 of normal appearing zzso matter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso loads were measured in all zzso 

When all regions were combined, there was a significant difference between patient and control zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso was abnormal in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Global assessment of zzso revealed a significant difference between patients and controls for zzso but not for zzso zzso was significantly abnormal only in frontal zzso There was no significant correlation between zzso zzso or zzso and any of the zzso load zzso 

This study reveals quantitative MR abnormalities in both zzso and zzso in early zzso zzso with more extensive changes in the zzso The lack of correlation between zzso and zzso abnormalities suggests that they have developed by at least partly independent zzso zzso may be more sensitive than zzso in detecting subtle pathological changes in zzso and zzso
