Nine adult rats underwent zzso of the left coronary artery zzso to assess the ability of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to delineate acute zzso zzso zzso effects of the contrast medium were tested in the isolated rat zzso zzso zzso images of the heart at the zzso level were obtained using a 2 zzso zzso A TE of 20 zzso and a zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso 250 zzso were zzso Images were taken prior to injection of 400 zzso of zzso 2 minutes after injection, and then at 15 minute intervals for one zzso The time between zzso zzso and injection of contrast averaged 95 zzso The signal intensity zzso of normal zzso was increased by 125 zzso zzso immediately after injection, and did not significantly vary over one zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased by only 16 zzso zzso immediately after injection, gradually rising to 44 zzso zzso after one zzso Visual discrimination between normal and zzso zzso was obtained throughout the zzso The percent contrast between normal and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso at 2 minutes after injection, gradually decreasing to a final value of zzso zzso zzso No zzso effects were produced in the isolated heart using zzso in the zzso zzso higher than those expected to be produced by the intravenous injection of 400 zzso zzso zzso shows the potential for zzso of the jeopardy area resulting from coronary zzso for at least one hour after injection of the zzso
