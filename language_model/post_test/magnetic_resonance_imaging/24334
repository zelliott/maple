zzso heating is a serious problem in zzso zzso zzso A method is presented for redesigning zzso zzso coils to operate at minimum peak temperature, while maintaining field zzso and zzso zzso To generate these zzso zzso zzso an existing zzso method for simulating the spatial temperature distribution of single layer zzso coils is combined with a zzso zzso routine based on sequential zzso zzso zzso are provided for zzso and zzso zzso coils that show considerable improvements in reducing maximum temperature over existing zzso The winding patterns of the zzso coils were found to be heavily dependent on the assumed zzso material properties and generally display an interesting zzso spreading of zzso in the dense regions of the zzso Small zzso coils were constructed and tested for experimental validation and these demonstrate that with a reasonable estimate of material properties, zzso performance can be improved considerably with negligible change to the field error or standard figures of zzso
