zzso thickness zzso changes possibly contribute to the complex zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso underlying such differences in certain brain regions and their continuation in adulthood are a matter of intense zzso We studied 28 adults with zzso zzso zzso and 28 control subjects matched for age, zzso zzso and zzso A zzso whole brain analysis utilizing zzso was employed to detect CT differences between the two diagnostic groups and to investigate the time course of age-related zzso zzso comparison with control subjects revealed thinner zzso in zzso in the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso of the left zzso Considering the time course of CT development we found clusters around the zzso and zzso in the left and the zzso zzso in the right zzso to be thinner in zzso with comparable age-related slopes in patients and zzso zzso we found clusters around the zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso in the left and the zzso and zzso zzso in the right zzso to be thinner in zzso but with different age-related slopes in patients and zzso In the latter regions CT showed a steady decrease in controls but no analogous thinning in zzso CT analyses contribute in characterizing zzso zzso of zzso zzso CT is present in brain regions involved in social zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrate that zzso brain development leading to such differences is proceeding throughout zzso zzso in prior zzso studies may be induced by the complex time course of cortical zzso
