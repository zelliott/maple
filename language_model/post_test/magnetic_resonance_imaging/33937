The purpose of this study was to test the ability of zzso zzso and rest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to determine regional and global functional zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was reported to provide accurate left zzso ejection fraction zzso using an automated zzso We hypothesized that other various functional data may be obtained using zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso were conducted in 20 patients with coronary artery zzso Regional wall motion zzso and wall zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso visual scoring by each zzso and zzso The left zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso zzso and zzso estimated by zzso and zzso were compared with the results of zzso 

A high degree of agreement in zzso and zzso assessment was observed between each zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso values by zzso and zzso correlated and agreed well with those by zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso of differences zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso of differences zzso zzso The same also zzso to zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso of differences zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso of differences zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso of differences zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by F zzso zzso of differences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by F zzso 

zzso and zzso provide clinically satisfactory various functional zzso These functional data in combination with the zzso information will improve diagnostic and zzso accuracy without an increase in cost or the radiation dose to the zzso
