The magnetic resonance zzso appearance of the cavernous zzso zzso was studied in 10 normal and 23 abnormal zzso vascular and 12 zzso zzso using zzso spin echo images with and without zzso In normal zzso the zzso carotid artery zzso was disclosed as an area of signal void that was not enhanced with zzso Most zzso flow showed low intensity and was markedly enhanced with zzso zzso flow, however, was heterogeneous, which suggested the distribution of flow zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso flow were disclosed as areas of signal void and their relationship was clearly zzso zzso zzso flow appeared as a low intensity area even with zzso In the cavernous zzso zzso and patent zzso flow were zzso but in one case it was impossible to differentiate patent zzso flow from zzso In zzso zzso zzso invasion was suspected by zzso or marked dislocation of the zzso disappearance of zzso flow, and extension of zzso tumors to the zzso wall and extension of zzso tumors to the lateral zzso MR was found to be a promising diagnostic zzso for the evaluation of the zzso
