Using magnetic resonance imaging zzso for real-time guidance during zzso is an active area of research and zzso One aspect of the problem is the influence of the zzso zzso modeled here as an external magnetic field, on the medical linear accelerator zzso zzso The present work characterizes the behavior of two medical zzso electron guns with external magnetic fields for zzso and perpendicular zzso of the zzso with respect to the zzso zzso 

Two electron guns, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are considered as representative models for this zzso zzso was placed on the zzso design approach in which case the zzso scanner and the zzso axes of symmetry coincide and assumes no magnetic shielding of the zzso For the zzso case, the magnetic field from a zzso T open zzso zzso zzso zzso magnet with a 60 zzso gap between its poles was zzso and used in full three zzso zzso space charge simulations, whereas for the perpendicular case the magnetic field was zzso 

For the zzso zzso it is shown that the electron beam is not deflected from the axis of symmetry of the gun and the primary beam current does not zzso even at very high values of the magnetic field, zzso zzso zzso As the field strength increases, the primary beam current has an initial plateau of constant value after which its value decreases to a minimum corresponding to a field strength of approximately zzso zzso After the minimum is reached, the current starts to increase zzso For the case when the beam current zzso is performed at the beam waist position the initial plateau ends at zzso T for zzso zzso and at zzso T for zzso zzso The minimum value of the primary beam current is zzso of the initial value for zzso zzso and zzso of the initial value for zzso zzso The minimum current is reached at zzso and zzso T for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso At zzso T the beam current increases to zzso and zzso from the original value of the current for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, for the case when the electron gun is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the electron beam is deflected from the axis of symmetry even at small values of the magnetic zzso As the strength of the magnetic field increases, so does the beam zzso leading to a sharp decrease of the primary beam current which vanishes at about zzso T for zzso zzso and at zzso T for zzso zzso zzso At zero external field, the beam zzso zzso zzso at beam waist is zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso there are two particular values of the external field where the beam zzso zzso reaches a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaches a minimum of zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaches a minimum of zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso radius dependence on the external field is shown for the zzso zzso for both electron zzso 

zzso space charge simulation of two electron guns, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed for zzso and perpendicular external magnetic zzso A consistent behavior of Pierce guns in external magnetic fields was zzso For the zzso zzso the primary beam current does not zzso but a large reduction of beam current (up to zzso is observed at higher field zzso the beam zzso remains zzso It was shown that for a perpendicular zzso the current vanishes due to beam zzso under the action of the zzso zzso For zzso zzso it was determined that the zzso beam zzso reaches two zzso for relatively high values of the external magnetic zzso
