To evaluate indirect magnetic resonance zzso zzso using zzso injection of conventional zzso contrast zzso and zzso zzso for zzso the primary zzso drainage of zzso zzso 

We performed zzso zzso in 5 healthy volunteers, with injection of zzso and zzso zzso We evaluated the safety of the zzso the patterns of enhancement zzso by injection site and zzso level, the time course of enhancement, the optimal concentration and volume of contrast, and the optimal imaging zzso 

The worst side effects of zzso contrast injection were brief, mild pain and swelling at the injected sites that were zzso zzso resulted in consistent zzso of the primary zzso drainage pattern specific to each injected site, which was zzso on repeated zzso The best enhancement was obtained with injection of small volumes zzso zzso of either agent zzso imaging within zzso zzso of injection, and a three-dimensional fast zzso zzso echo sequence with zzso zzso 

We found zzso zzso to be a safe, convenient imaging method that provides functional information about the zzso drainage of injected zzso zzso to zzso cancer, it has the potential to identify sites at highest risk of zzso zzso spread for zzso or surgical planning, and possibly to zzso zzso
