Spinal zzso was performed in 9 multiple myeloma and 2 solitary zzso using zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with additional zzso injection in 3 zzso zzso features were the zzso 1) round, zzso zzso with low T 1 signal highlighted by zzso and bright T 2 signal were present in 10 of the 11 zzso all zzso zzso seen on plain zzso corresponded to such zzso and biopsy performed in 4 cases showed massive zzso replacement by plasma zzso 2) overall zzso signal was dramatically decreased in 3 patients (2 of whom had a high zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso was present in 4 zzso 4) 25 zzso zzso fractures (10 of whom with a zzso zzso and focal fat deposition were zzso 5) zzso treatment examination seemed zzso of the outcome in the 2 solitary zzso zzso proved to be more sensitive than plain zzso or bone zzso Number and size of focal zzso zzso did not correlate with the low zzso signal zzso Both correlated poorly with overall zzso mass but diffuse abnormalities were associated with rapidly fatal outcome in three zzso These features might reflect qualitative rather than quantitative patterns of the disease zzso or diffuse zzso zzso zzso These findings are in agreement with those of the few previous zzso zzso is valuable for spinal zzso damage zzso It appears less accurate in benign versus zzso zzso zzso fracture determination than it does in bone zzso Its zzso value is still zzso
