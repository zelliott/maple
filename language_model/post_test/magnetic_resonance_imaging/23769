The present study was conducted to validate zzso protein as a marker of brain damage after minor head zzso 

We studied 50 patients with minor head injuries and zzso zzso zzso scores of 13 to 15 in whom zzso zzso scans of the brain revealed no zzso zzso levels of zzso protein were measured at zzso and hourly thereafter until 12 hours after zzso zzso resonance imaging and baseline zzso examinations were performed within 48 hours, and zzso follow-up was conducted at 3 months zzso 

Fourteen patients zzso had zzso serum levels of zzso protein zzso peak value, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein levels were highest immediately after the zzso and they declined each hour zzso At 6 hours zzso the serum level was below the detection limit zzso zzso in five zzso of the patients with initially zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed brain zzso in five patients, four of whom demonstrated zzso levels of zzso protein in zzso The proportion of patients with zzso serum levels was significantly higher when magnetic resonance imaging revealed a brain zzso In patients with zzso serum levels, we observed a trend toward impaired zzso functioning on measures of attention, memory, and information processing zzso 

zzso of zzso protein levels in serum provides a valid measure of the presence and severity of traumatic brain damage if performed within the first hours after minor head zzso
