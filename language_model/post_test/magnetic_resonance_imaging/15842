The aim of this functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was to evaluate negative blood oxygen zzso zzso signals during voluntary tongue zzso zzso zzso zzso regions included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions included the primary zzso area zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and zzso The results were not consistent with previous studies involving unilateral hand and finger movements showing the zzso of zzso cortical areas including the zzso zzso The areas of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso might reflect specific neural networks relating to voluntary tongue zzso
