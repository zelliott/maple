We wanted to improve zzso zzso of early hip pathology invisible on plain zzso 

An MR zzso of the hip with zzso sequences is zzso The standard MR technique is improved by 1) using a small flexible surface zzso to show selectively the hip joint to be zzso 2) application of zzso zzso and 3) by zzso imaging sequences perpendicular to the true plane of the zzso 

By this technique it is possible to achieve an zzso image of each aspect of the zzso zzso zzso of special interest can be defined and their zzso possibly related to zzso of the zzso end of the zzso
