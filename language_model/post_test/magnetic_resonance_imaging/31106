Patients with schizophrenia have smaller zzso volumes and perform zzso on most zzso memory zzso Although these findings are likely zzso the impact of zzso pathology on cognitive performance in schizophrenia remains zzso This study examined this relationship by measuring the volume of the zzso and its zzso during memory task zzso 

Participants included 15 patients with schizophrenia and 16 zzso control zzso zzso volume was determined via three-dimensional zzso analysis of high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso activity was assessed by measuring changes in blood oxygen zzso signal during a recognition memory zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia had smaller zzso volumes zzso and demonstrated poorer performance on the recognition memory task, largely because of a heightened rate of false alarms to novel zzso Both groups showed robust zzso activity to old and new items when compared with a low-level baseline zzso however, direct comparison of zzso activity during recognition task performance revealed that healthy control, but not the zzso subjects showed significant right anterior zzso zzso during the evaluation of novel zzso 

The impaired ability to zzso new items as previously not experienced is associated with decreased recruitment and smaller volume of the zzso in zzso
