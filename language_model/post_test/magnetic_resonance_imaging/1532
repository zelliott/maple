zzso high-grade zzso treatment requires the zzso of zzso and normal brain from zzso perhaps by using potential differences in the absolute diffusion parameters of zzso Our purpose was to determine whether mean zzso zzso and diffusion zzso MR imaging data help in this zzso 

Nine patients with high-grade cerebral zzso underwent zzso structural and diffusion zzso MR imaging before zzso zzso zzso brain, and apparently normal white matter regions were determined on zzso and zzso zzso structural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in each tissue zzso zzso in these values among the tissue types were assessed with a standard analysis of zzso 

zzso was highest in the zzso tumor core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancing tumor core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancing tumor margin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highest in normal brain zzso zzso zzso and lowest in the zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly different in enhancing tumor margins and zzso brain in all zzso zzso was significantly different in only zzso These values were significantly different from those of normal brain in all cases in which they were zzso 

zzso values can be used to differentiate normal white matter, zzso brain, and enhancing tumor zzso zzso zzso data added no benefit to tissue zzso Further studies are required to determine if a zzso value that zzso to the limit of tumor invasion can be zzso
