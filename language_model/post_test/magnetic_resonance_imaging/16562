This work presents a novel method of mapping the zzso response to single stimuli in space and time without prior knowledge of the paradigm zzso paradigm free mapping zzso This method is based on zzso of the zzso response from the zzso time series assuming a linear response and using a zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed by defining a zzso zzso and by controlling for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate zzso The methodology was validated on five subjects who performed zzso and visually cued finger tapping at 7 zzso with moderate zzso zzso 2 zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that detection of zzso zzso events is feasible without a zzso information on the stimulus zzso The proposed method opens up the possibility of designing temporally zzso zzso to study the cortical response to unpredictable mental zzso
