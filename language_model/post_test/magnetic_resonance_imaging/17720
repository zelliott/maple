Recent findings have indicated that patients with schizophrenia have altered zzso zzso but the nature of these network zzso remains zzso 

We applied a network-based approach to investigate the functional connectivity zzso of the zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy controls underwent resting functional magnetic resonance zzso We derived the following 6 major networks by applying group independent component analysis: zzso the zzso network zzso zzso the zzso zzso networks zzso zzso the zzso zzso network zzso zzso the left zzso networks zzso zzso the right zzso network zzso and zzso the motor network zzso We defined 12 regions of interest zzso by selecting the first 2 zzso of each network in the zzso The zzso map of all zzso was calculated for each participant and compared between zzso 

The schizophrenic patients showed a decrease in zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso in all networks except the zzso The zzso decreased between zzso zzso and the frontal zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso increased with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso An increased zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also noted in the zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso of the zzso in the examined patients with schizophrenia was zzso The zzso zzso were the most prominent findings and were common to all zzso networks, whereas the zzso connectivity involved both an increase and decrease in zzso and depended more on the nature of the specific zzso
