The purpose of our study was to evaluate on zzso the occurrence of large zzso zzso zzso in patients with inflammatory zzso 

We zzso reviewed zzso MR images of 128 hands and zzso in 44 patients with clinical presentation of inflammatory zzso Large zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso found on MR images were further evaluated for the presence of a cortical break and zzso zzso These data were correlated with clinical and laboratory findings and the duration of zzso 

We found 26 patients with zzso arthritis, seven with zzso arthritis, two with systemic lupus zzso one with zzso arthritis, one with mixed zzso tissue disorder, one with zzso arthritis, one with inflammatory zzso disease arthritis, and five patients with early zzso inflammatory zzso Twelve patients had 16 large zzso zzso none of which were detected on available zzso zzso of zzso for large zzso was zzso A cortical break with zzso extension of the large zzso was seen in 12 zzso Four zzso were not zzso 

Even large zzso zzso may be zzso on zzso zzso is a superior technique for detecting these zzso in the small zzso of the hand and wrist in inflammatory zzso Although large zzso zzso often communicate with zzso we observed four large purely zzso enhancing zzso without zzso zzso Patients with large zzso have a longer duration of inflammatory zzso
