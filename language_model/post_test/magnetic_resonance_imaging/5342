zzso fixation using minimally invasive zzso techniques around the zzso zzso are well zzso although there are a number of potential hazards and zzso Our study provides an anatomical description of the zzso zzso and its relations to surrounding zzso Twenty magnetic resonance imaging scans of the zzso zzso were analyzed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were taken by zzso on 2 occasions of the distance of anterior structures from the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso The mean dimensions of the zzso zzso at the level of the zzso were 39 zzso zzso and 36 zzso zzso The anterior zzso bundle was found to be a mean of 3 zzso from the anterior zzso zzso with the anterior zzso structures located zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso for the first observer was zzso and for the second observer was zzso with an zzso correlation zzso of zzso This demonstrated excellent zzso and zzso zzso This study presents the first magnetic resonance zzso anatomical description of the zzso zzso It showed that key anatomical structures are in very close proximity to the zzso zzso and this is important to consider when treating fractures in this region with internal zzso
