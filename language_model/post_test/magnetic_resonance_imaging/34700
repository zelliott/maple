To determine the value of inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR sequences in the characterization of a variety of zzso zzso with the focus on zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We used a zzso MR unit to study five zzso seven zzso zzso seven other zzso zzso (three zzso zzso two zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and eight solid zzso (three zzso two zzso one zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso using zzso sequences with variable inversion times zzso Imaging time for each section was 2 seconds for the zzso The zzso zzso values were analyzed zzso 

The zzso zzso values were 1200 to zzso for the zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso 300 and zzso respectively, for the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for the other zzso zzso and 300 to 1500 for the solid zzso There was no overlap of zzso zzso values between the zzso zzso and the zzso the difference was statistically zzso Both patients with zzso zzso had two zzso in which the zzso zzso values were zzso 

zzso sequences provide a rapid and reliable imaging method for zzso among zzso zzso zzso and solid zzso This technique also provides information about the continuity of the zzso zzso in terms of the differences in their zzso zzso zzso For solid zzso masses, the use of zzso helps to differentiate zzso zzso and necrosis from solid zzso
