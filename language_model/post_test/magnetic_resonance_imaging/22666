zzso zzso is a new zzso zzso contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging zzso An zzso liquid zzso method for zzso zzso zzso in human zzso urine and zzso samples is zzso The analysis is based on the zzso zzso separation of zzso zzso from the zzso components of the biological zzso and its detection during zzso by ultraviolet light zzso at 200 zzso The selectivity of the method was zzso The mean absolute recovery during the zzso sample preparation was greater than zzso The precision, expressed as zzso of variation zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and the zzso expressed as mean relative error zzso of the zzso method ranged from zzso to zzso The detection limit in plasma and urine was zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The detection limit in zzso zzso samples was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed in human plasma and urine samples during the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be stable in human plasma and in human urine when stored at about zzso degrees C for up 24 zzso and after three zzso zzso In addition, it was shown to be stable in samples of processed plasma and in diluted urine at about zzso degrees C for 48 zzso and at room temperature for at least 24 zzso As regards the long-term stability of zzso zzso the results of dedicated studies showed that zzso zzso is stable in human plasma samples when stored at zzso degrees C for up to 30 days and at zzso degrees C for up to 90 zzso zzso zzso is stable in samples of human urine when stored at zzso degrees C for up to 30 days, and when stored at zzso degrees C and at zzso degrees C for up to 90 zzso The method has been successfully validated in human zzso urine and zzso and it has been shown to be precise, accurate and zzso
