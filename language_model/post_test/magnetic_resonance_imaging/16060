A new procedure for accurately measuring effective magnetic moments of long zzso is zzso zzso volume, zzso and phase zzso effects are naturally included and overcome in our zzso Images from a typical zzso echo sequence at one single echo time are usually sufficient to zzso the effective magnetic moment of a zzso zzso Only zzso in the neighborhood of the object are zzso Our approach can accurately zzso the magnetic moments and distinguish zzso changes of cross sections between zzso zzso zzso of our procedure are studied through the error propagation zzso Images acquired with different parameters are used to test the zzso of our zzso zzso approaches and their limitations to extract magnet moments of objects with different zzso are also zzso Our method has the potential to be applied to any long object whose cross section is close to a zzso
