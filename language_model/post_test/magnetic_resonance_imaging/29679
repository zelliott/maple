The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in symptomatic patients with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the extent of zzso zzso in coronary artery disease, but its role in zzso zzso has not been zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were performed before and one month after zzso in 24 zzso zzso and location of the induced zzso were related to left zzso zzso mass reduction, zzso release, volume of ethanol zzso zzso zzso tract zzso reduction, and coronary zzso zzso 

One month after zzso regional zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in all zzso Mean zzso size was 20 zzso 9 zzso corresponding to 10 zzso zzso and 31 zzso zzso of total zzso and zzso mass, zzso Total zzso mass decreased from 219 zzso 64 to 205 zzso 64 g zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass from 76 zzso 25 to 68 zzso 22 g zzso zzso zzso Total zzso mass reduction exceeded zzso mass reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso size correlated with peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso volume of ethanol administered zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso total zzso and zzso mass reduction zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso beta zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Seven patients with exclusively zzso zzso zzso had smaller zzso size and less zzso reduction than remaining patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In five of these, zzso was performed zzso in the target zzso 

zzso zzso allowed detailed evaluation of size and location of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso size correlated well with clinical indexes of zzso zzso
