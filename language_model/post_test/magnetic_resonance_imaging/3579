The dynamic properties of the cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso during changes in brain activity remain zzso zzso the spatial and zzso evolution of functional increases in zzso was investigated in the rat zzso zzso during zzso stimulation under a suppressed blood flow response zzso zzso stimulation zzso a fast increase in tissue zzso zzso described by a time constant of zzso second measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the tissue oxygen tension measured using an oxygen zzso and blood zzso measured using optical imaging of intrinsic signal zzso however, these changes were slow with time zzso of zzso and zzso seconds, zzso This slow change in zzso blood zzso partly explains the commonly observed zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso the changes in zzso zzso were similar to the changes in blood zzso Finally, the increases in zzso were well correlated with the evoked zzso zzso zzso These findings show that dynamic zzso calculations made using only blood zzso data zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso do not directly reflect the zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the findings presented can bridge the gap between the changes in cellular zzso rate and blood zzso
