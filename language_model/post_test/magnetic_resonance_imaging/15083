To evaluate characteristic features of zzso ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of sporadic breast cancer in women zzso years and to determine correlations with pathological and biological zzso 

A retrospective review of zzso zzso and biological features of sporadic breast zzso for women under 40 years at our institution between zzso covering 91 zzso zzso was available for 97 zzso ultrasound for 94 and zzso for zzso 

The most common imaging features were masses, nearly all classified zzso 4 or zzso On zzso zzso alone accounted for 31 zzso all zzso There were zzso % zzso B, zzso % zzso A, zzso % zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was correlated with the presence of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso more often had an oval shape and abrupt interface at ultrasound and rim enhancement on zzso zzso features were suspicious for all zzso and rim enhancement of a mass was a significant predictor of zzso zzso zzso 

The imaging characteristics of zzso in patients under 40 years without proven gene zzso do not differ from their older counterparts, but appear correlated to zzso profiles, which have a different distribution in young women compared to the general zzso
