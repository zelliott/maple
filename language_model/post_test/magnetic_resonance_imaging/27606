The aim of this study was to determine whether associations exist between anterior zzso zzso anterior zzso deep bite and zzso of the zzso joint zzso in the vertical dimension, evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso A total of 148 subjects (90 zzso 58 zzso were selected from the zzso zzso zzso study zzso of Health in zzso zzso for this zzso In each person a clinical zzso examination was zzso Four linear zzso and one ratio from zzso scans of the zzso were zzso To estimate the effects of anterior zzso zzso anterior zzso and deep bite on zzso zzso linear zzso was zzso zzso were adjusted for sex, age, school education, and zzso zzso zzso zzso had shorter mean zzso heights zzso on both joint sides zzso In deep bite without zzso contact the zzso process height zzso decreased significantly in left zzso zzso and there was a tendency to a decrease in right zzso zzso The ratio between zzso height and zzso process height zzso was increased on both left zzso and right zzso zzso In conclusion, anterior zzso is connected to a reduced zzso height and deep bite without zzso contact with an increased ratio between zzso height and zzso process zzso Therefore the zzso path in the anterior zzso bite and zzso cases can be interpreted to be reduced and in the deep bite cases without zzso contact to be zzso
