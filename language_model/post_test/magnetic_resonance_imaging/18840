According to manufacturers of both magnetic resonance imaging zzso machines, and zzso neurological pulse generators zzso zzso is zzso for patients with zzso A major argument for this restriction is the risk to induce heat in the leads due to the electromagnetic field, which could be dangerous for the surrounding brain zzso The temperature change on the surface of the case of an zzso zzso zzso Minneapolis, zzso and the lead tip during zzso was zzso An anatomical realistic and a cubic zzso filled with phantom material mimicking human zzso and a typical lead zzso were used to imitate a patient who carries an zzso for deep brain zzso The zzso were performed in a zzso T and a zzso T zzso zzso degrees C temperature increases at the lead tip uncovered the lead tip as the most critical part concerning heating problems in zzso zzso increases in other locations were low compared to the one at the lead zzso The measured temperature increase of zzso degrees C can not be considered as harmful to the zzso zzso with the results of other studies revealed the avoidance of zzso as a practical method to reduce heating during zzso zzso
