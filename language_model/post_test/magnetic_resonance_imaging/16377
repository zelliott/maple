We sought to assess the accuracy of an integrated cardiac magnetic resonance zzso protocol for the diagnosis of relevant coronary artery or bypass graft zzso in patients with suspected coronary artery disease zzso or with previously performed zzso coronary intervention zzso or coronary bypass graft surgery zzso 

zzso is suitable for diagnosing zzso zzso zzso in patients with suspected zzso and has been proven to be a helpful diagnostic tool for decision of further zzso However, little is known about its diagnostic accuracy in patients with known zzso who previously were treated by zzso or zzso 

A total of 477 patients with suspected zzso 236 with previous zzso and 110 after zzso referred for coronary X-ray zzso zzso underwent an integrated zzso examination before zzso zzso zzso was assessed using zzso zzso after zzso stress with zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso using zzso contrast agents zzso zzso Late zzso enhancement zzso was assessed 10 zzso after a second contrast zzso 

zzso demonstrated a relevant coronary vessel zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in 313 zzso patients using quantitative coronary zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso assessment for detecting a relevant coronary zzso in patients with suspected zzso yielded sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso in zzso patients zzso and zzso and in zzso patients zzso and zzso zzso 

A combined zzso protocol for the assessment of zzso zzso and zzso is feasible for the detection of relevant coronary vessel zzso even in patients who previously were treated by zzso or zzso in a routine clinical zzso However, diagnostic accuracy is reduced in patients with zzso This could be due to different flow and zzso zzso Further studies are needed to zzso the clinical protocols especially in zzso zzso
