zzso visual zzso zzso reflect an impairment of the capacity to process visual zzso The question of whether zzso might be zzso according to the nature and distribution of the underlying brain damage is an intriguing one in child zzso 

We studied 22 children born zzso (12 zzso 10 zzso mean age at examination zzso range zzso mean zzso age zzso range zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso normal intelligence zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso mean Performance zzso zzso and normal visual zzso focusing on higher visual zzso Brain magnetic resonance images zzso were zzso to establish the presence of zzso along the primary zzso pathway, in the zzso and zzso zzso 

Most children displayed an uneven cognitive profile, with deficits in visual object recognition, visual imagery, zzso skills, and visual memory, and sparing of visual zzso abilities, zzso intelligence, and face and letter zzso Conventional brain zzso did not document major zzso of zzso and zzso white matter, or cortical zzso of areas involved in visual zzso zzso 

We suggest a widespread involvement of higher visual processing systems, involving both the zzso and zzso streams, in zzso children with zzso zzso The lack of major zzso on conventional zzso does not exclude the possibility of malfunctioning of higher visual processing systems, expressing itself through discrete zzso zzso mechanisms underlying these zzso deficits are zzso
