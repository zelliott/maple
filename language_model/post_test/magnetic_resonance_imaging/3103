The purpose of this study was to compare structural variations of the zzso joint anatomy between symptomatic patients with zzso joint dysfunction and zzso zzso 

There were 74 symptomatic patients with zzso joint dysfunction, 29 zzso volunteers with normal zzso and 6 zzso volunteers with disk displacement with reduction included in this zzso All subjects had bilateral high resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans performed in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso All subjects had right and left full profile zzso one in the zzso zzso position, and one with the zzso edge to zzso 

zzso tests demonstrated no significant angular or linear differences for depth of the zzso zzso angle of the zzso zzso horizontal and vertical overlap of the zzso teeth, and linear zzso zzso 

This study concludes that there are no significant differences in angular and linear zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso volunteers and symptomatic subjects with zzso joint zzso
