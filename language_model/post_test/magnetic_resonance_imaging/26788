To investigate the relationship between zzso zzso in zzso infants seen on magnetic resonance imaging zzso but not on zzso and zzso zzso 

Images from a cohort study of zzso in zzso newborns were reviewed for zzso zzso The children were assessed at a mean age of zzso years with zzso examination and zzso testing using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of Intelligence, Third zzso 

zzso zzso was detected on both zzso and zzso in 3 of the 131 zzso newborns zzso whereas smaller zzso were seen only on zzso in 10 newborns zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso age at birth, zzso zzso and white matter injury, zzso zzso zzso solely by zzso was associated with a zzso increased odds of abnormal zzso examination compared with newborns without zzso zzso zzso data in zzso No association with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of Intelligence, Third Edition score was zzso 

zzso zzso is not uncommon in zzso zzso Although associated with zzso zzso zzso seen only on zzso is associated with much more optimistic outcomes than that visible on zzso
