The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic usefulness of dynamic zzso with determination of the zzso of enhancement rate and the character of tumor enhancement, and to assess both parameters in the differentiation of zzso zzso 

The material consisted of 45 patients (30 zzso 15 zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso was done using an zzso zzso unit, zzso echo techniques, zzso angle 80 zzso The repetition time zzso was zzso zzso the echo time zzso was 2-6 zzso 1 zzso the acquisition time zzso was zzso zzso The zzso of tissue enhancement rate was calculated in the region of interest, and expressed as percent per second zzso The limit value of zzso was zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso were calculated in the differentiation of zzso zzso The method of contrast filling of the tumors was assessed in successive zzso after administration of zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso with determination of the index of tumor enhancement rate is highly sensitive zzso and specific zzso in the differentiation of zzso and benign zzso The usefulness of the assessment of tumor enhancement character was not confirmed, since the sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso Dynamic zzso with determination of zzso and tumor enhancement character is highly sensitive zzso and specific zzso 

Dynamic zzso with determination of zzso and tumor enhancement character is the best method for differential zzso
