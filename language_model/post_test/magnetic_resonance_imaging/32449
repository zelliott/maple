A consecutive series of 143 zzso adult patients with zzso proved World Health Organization grade II zzso was reviewed to assess the zzso value of growth rates of mean tumor diameters on successive magnetic resonance images before zzso There is an inverse correlation between growth rates and survival zzso zzso zzso median survival at zzso years for a growth rate of zzso or zzso median survival zzso years for a growth rate zzso Thus, individual magnetic resonance imaging tumor growth rates should be incorporated in the planning of the initial therapeutic strategy of grade II zzso
