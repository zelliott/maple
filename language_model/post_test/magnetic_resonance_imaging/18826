The aging of the spine has been reported to follow a degenerative cascade described by zzso This cascade does not take into account the zzso zzso zzso recent knowledge of the zzso physiology and zzso of the zzso muscles suggests that they should play a role in the degenerative zzso zzso relates to zzso zzso in a number of zzso Using new needle zzso technique, zzso we may be able to zzso the extent of zzso muscle zzso 

To explore the potential interactions between zzso muscle zzso and the degenerative zzso 

Literature review, zzso of a blinded zzso study and case zzso 

A previously reported group of 35 zzso paid volunteers, ages 18 to 58 zzso Two elderly volunteers with moderate to severe spinal zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso one significantly disabled, one zzso 

zzso zzso testing, including zzso a zzso zzso needle zzso technique for the zzso zzso In the two case reports, magnetic resonance imaging and 15-minute timed zzso 

The 35 volunteers were tested by a blinded zzso using the zzso zzso The two older subjects underwent zzso zzso and extensive zzso evaluations, functional testing, complete history and physical zzso 

The patient with symptomatic zzso had a zzso score of 6 on each side, and the zzso volunteer had a score of zzso In the zzso subject group, zzso evidence for zzso was found in 20 subjects zzso sparsely distributed, but more zzso than zzso zzso Based on conservative estimates of nerve zzso rates, the population averaged a detected zzso zzso event approximately once every 120 zzso 

zzso zzso may be proven to be a better marker than zzso findings for symptomatic spinal zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso occurs frequently in zzso zzso Whether a cause or an effect, zzso zzso might lead to zzso and thus progression along the degenerative zzso
