To study the utility of zzso breast zzso for partial breast zzso zzso patient selection, using multivariable analysis of significant risk factors to create a zzso zzso 

Between 2002 and 2009, zzso women with newly diagnosed breast cancer underwent zzso bilateral breast zzso at Mayo Clinic zzso Of this zzso zzso were zzso deemed eligible for zzso according to the National zzso zzso Breast and zzso Project zzso zzso inclusion criteria using physical examination, zzso and/or zzso zzso resonance images were then reviewed to determine their impact on patient zzso The patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated to determine risk factors for altered zzso eligibility after zzso and to create a zzso zzso 

Of the zzso patients initially eligible for zzso 141 zzso were found ineligible because of zzso proven zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging detected additional zzso breast cancer in 118 zzso Of these, 62 zzso had more extensive disease than originally noted before zzso and 64 zzso had zzso zzso zzso breast cancer was detected in 28 zzso Four characteristics were found to be significantly associated with zzso zzso after zzso on multivariable analysis: zzso status zzso detection by zzso zzso first-degree relative with a history of breast cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors were assigned a score of zzso The risk of altered zzso eligibility from zzso based on number of risk factors was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso bilateral breast zzso altered the zzso recommendations for zzso of zzso Women who may undergo zzso should be considered for breast zzso especially those with zzso zzso or with 2 or more of the following risk factors: zzso detection by zzso and first-degree relative with a history of breast zzso
