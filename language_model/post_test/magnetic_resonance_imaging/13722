The purpose of this study was to develop an zzso technique for quantitative analysis of joint surface size, surface zzso and joint incongruity and to assess its zzso under in zzso imaging zzso The surface areas were determined after zzso reconstruction of the joint by zzso and the incongruity by zzso zzso zzso The precision was tested by analyzing four zzso zzso zzso of human knees in 14 zzso The zzso were shown to produce accurate data in geometric test zzso The zzso precision was zzso zzso for surface area, zzso zzso zzso for the mean principal zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was highest in the zzso joint zzso zzso and lowest in the zzso zzso joint zzso zzso This technique will permit identification of the specific role of surface size, zzso and incongruity as potential risk factors for zzso
