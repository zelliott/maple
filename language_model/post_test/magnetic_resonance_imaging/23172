zzso cardiac output is associated with increased white matter zzso zzso and executive dysfunction in older adults, which may be secondary to relations between systemic and cerebral zzso This study preliminarily describes the regional distribution of cerebral zzso in the context of a normal cerebral zzso zzso and aims to determine if these variables are associated with reduced cardiac zzso zzso participants zzso zzso 8 years old, 38% zzso with cardiovascular risk factors or disease underwent structural zzso acquisition at zzso using a standard imaging protocol that included zzso zzso zzso distribution was examined in common anatomical space using zzso zzso and as a function of normal cerebral zzso patterns by zzso a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data was used to zzso the participants on the basis of low zzso and normal zzso cardiac zzso Global zzso count and volume did not differ between the low and normal cardiac output zzso however, zzso zzso zzso values in regions of zzso were reduced in the low versus normal cardiac output group zzso Our preliminary data suggest that participants with low cardiac output have zzso in regions of relatively reduced zzso while normal cardiac output participants have zzso in regions with relatively higher regional zzso This spatial zzso distribution difference for areas of zzso may occur in the context of reduced systemic zzso which subsequently impacts cerebral zzso and contributes to zzso or clinical zzso zzso
