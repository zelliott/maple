Although obesity is a risk factor for zzso zzso zzso it is unclear whether the components of body zzso such as muscle and fat mass, are major zzso of zzso cartilage properties at the zzso 

The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso and body composition measures, assessed over 10 years, were related to zzso zzso cartilage volume and defects in healthy adults with no clinical knee zzso 

Two hundred and zzso healthy, community-based adults aged zzso years with no clinical history of knee zzso were zzso zzso and body composition zzso mass and fat zzso data were measured at baseline zzso and follow-up zzso zzso cartilage volume and defects were assessed at follow-up zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

After adjustment for potential zzso increased measures of obesity zzso zzso waist zzso and fat zzso at baseline and follow-up were associated with an increased risk for the presence of zzso cartilage defects at follow-up for both men and women (all P zzso or zzso zzso Increased baseline values for these variables tended to be associated with reduced zzso cartilage volume at follow-up for women (all P zzso or zzso zzso but not men (all P zzso or zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated that increased zzso measures of zzso as well as fat mass, are associated with an increased risk for the presence of zzso cartilage defects in both men and zzso Women, but not men, with greater baseline body mass, particularly zzso mass, appear to have an associated reduction in their zzso cartilage zzso zzso targeting a reduction in zzso tissue may help reduce the risk for the onset and progression of zzso zzso particularly in zzso
