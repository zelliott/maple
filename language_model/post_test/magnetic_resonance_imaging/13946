zzso disease zzso is a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disease that is accompanied by zzso movements, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric zzso Although progressive zzso zzso is known to occur, little is known about how the disease affects the cortex, including which cortical regions are affected, how zzso zzso and the relationship of the cortical zzso to clinical zzso The zzso has been difficult to study in neurodegenerative diseases primarily because of its complex folding patterns and regional zzso however, an understanding of how the zzso is affected by the disease may provide important new insights into zzso 

Novel automated surface reconstruction and high-resolution MR images of 11 patients with HD and 13 zzso subjects were used to obtain cortical thickness zzso The same analyses were performed on two zzso brains to validate these zzso 

zzso specific zzso thinning of the cortical ribbon was found in subjects with zzso zzso occurred early, differed among patients in different clinical stages of disease, and appeared to proceed from zzso to anterior cortical regions with disease zzso The zzso region was statistically most zzso zzso performed on MR images of autopsy brains analyzed similarly were within zzso zzso of those obtained using traditional zzso methods and were statistically zzso 

The authors propose that the zzso zzso early in disease and that regionally selective cortical zzso may explain the zzso of clinical expression in zzso These measures might provide a sensitive prospective surrogate marker for clinical trials of zzso zzso
