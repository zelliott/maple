To determine the role of small zzso artery zzso in patients with zzso circulation stroke zzso we evaluated the zzso patterns, collateral features, and stroke mechanisms in zzso patients with zzso 

zzso findings on magnetic resonance zzso imaging were correlated with zzso zzso MR zzso and/or zzso zzso in 18 patients zzso age, zzso years; 9 zzso zzso zzso diameter of zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in 14 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were predominantly observed in the zzso and/or zzso zzso artery zzso zzso All subjects had fetal zzso circulation zzso from the internal carotid artery to the zzso cerebral zzso Sixteen patients zzso had zzso or diffuse VA zzso In 14 patients zzso long zzso artery zzso was prominently zzso In zzso patients, zzso zzso might occur following zzso embolism from the zzso or zzso VA to zzso zzso patterns between subjects with and without VA disease were almost zzso As the degree of VA disease increased, the frequency of zzso prominence showed an increased tendency zzso Relatively small, scattered zzso were observed in patients with zzso than in those with zzso zzso 

zzso does not protect against zzso zzso Regardless of extensive zzso zzso relatively small zzso may be due to previously established zzso from the zzso which could compensate for the defects in the zzso zzso
