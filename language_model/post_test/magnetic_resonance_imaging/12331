Traditional analyses of zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso use little anatomical zzso The registration of the images to a template is based on the individual anatomy and ignores functional zzso subsequently detected zzso are not confined to gray matter zzso In this paper, we propose a statistical model to estimate a zzso zzso from functional and zzso zzso that summarizes both anatomical and functional information and the geometric zzso of the zzso Registration and zzso are performed jointly along the zzso zzso and the functional activity is constrained to the zzso increasing the accuracy of the zzso
