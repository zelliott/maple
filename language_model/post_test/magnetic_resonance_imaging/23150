The in zzso zzso of cultured cells with iron oxide zzso zzso is a frequent practice in biomedical zzso To date, the potential zzso of these particles remains an issue of zzso In the present study, 4 different zzso types zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso very small iron oxide particles zzso are tested on a variety of cell types, being zzso neural zzso cells, zzso rat zzso cells and human blood outgrowth zzso zzso Using different zzso zzso the effect of the zzso on cell zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, zzso viability and cellular zzso is zzso Through a systematic study, the safe zzso for every particle type are determined, showing that zzso can lead up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso are the most toxic particles and only reach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso it is shown that for zzso up to 500 zzso zzso with zzso are required to efficiently zzso in an zzso phantom in contrast to only 50 zzso for zzso and 200 zzso for zzso and zzso These results highlight the importance of in-depth zzso evaluation of cell zzso studies as at zzso zzso some particles appear to be less suitable for the MR zzso of zzso zzso
