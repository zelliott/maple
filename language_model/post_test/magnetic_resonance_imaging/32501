Recent studies have proposed that magnetic resonance zzso zzso relaxation time is associated with loss of zzso The depletion of zzso in the zzso of the zzso disc may be an initiating factor in degenerative disc zzso The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of zzso zzso relaxation time in zzso and zzso discs of healthy volunteers using in zzso MR imaging at 3 zzso 

A zzso zzso spiral sequence was used to zzso zzso relaxation time in zzso with different zzso zzso and in the zzso discs of 11 healthy volunteers zzso zzso years; age zzso years; zzso 5 zzso 6 zzso 

The phantom studies demonstrated the feasibility of using spiral imaging at 3 zzso The in zzso results indicate that the median zzso value of the nucleus zzso zzso is significantly greater zzso than that of the zzso zzso zzso The correlations between the age of the volunteers and zzso relaxation time in the nucleus zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso A trend of decreasing zzso values from zzso to zzso to zzso was zzso 

The results of this study suggest that in zzso zzso zzso is feasible and may potentially be a clinical tool in identifying early degenerative changes in the zzso zzso
