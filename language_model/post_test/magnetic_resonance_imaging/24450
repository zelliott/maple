zzso symptoms zzso emerge zzso zzso in adolescence, before zzso as fully fledged emotional zzso Studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso the onset of emotional zzso We hypothesized that adolescents showing zzso zzso will show zzso in the emotion regulatory zzso network zzso during emotion zzso 

zzso female adolescents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing an zzso zzso zzso Within this sample, 33 zzso displayed emotional symptoms and 25 zzso did zzso Clinical measures, including assessments of mood and anxiety, were administered and participants were allocated to one of two groups based on the presence zzso or absence zzso of zzso zzso Group comparisons were used to identify differential patterns of neural engagement and their relationship to clinical zzso 

Groups displayed zzso differences in zzso activity with increased frontal activity in zzso girls during positive emotion processing and decreased frontal and zzso activity during negative emotion zzso zzso anxiety was the strongest clinical predictor of group membership zzso versus zzso and displayed a significant negative correlation with zzso neural activity during negative emotion zzso In addition, between the groups, the zzso displayed a pattern of reverse zzso with the zzso and zzso that was also significantly correlated with trait zzso 

There is divergence in the pattern of zzso neural processing in adolescent female subjects determined by emotional zzso Future research is needed to corroborate these findings and to underline their implications zzso
