zzso inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso However, there is little clinical evidence in support of this hypothesis in zzso zzso We previously reported that the zzso barrier zzso represented by the zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the relationship between zzso inflammation and the severity of zzso 

We investigated the correlations between the zzso zzso zzso index and the zzso of zzso severity, including Clinical zzso zzso and zzso State zzso and zzso on magnetic resonance imaging in 42 zzso zzso Further, the number of zzso E zzso and the zzso barrier zzso were also examined for the correlation with the zzso zzso 

The zzso index showed a positive correlation with the severity of zzso but not with the other parameters zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso inflammation increases in association with the severity of zzso in zzso
