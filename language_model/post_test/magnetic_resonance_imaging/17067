zzso destiny of targeted zzso in cancer cells within living organisms is still an open matter of zzso By in zzso and ex zzso experiments on zzso mice treated with zzso zzso zzso in which we combined zzso imaging, magnetic relaxation, and zzso electron zzso approaches, we provide evidence that zzso are effectively delivered to the tumor by active zzso These zzso were demonstrated to enable contrast enhancement of the tumor in magnetic resonance zzso In addition, we were able to discriminate between the fate of the organic zzso and the metallic core upon cell zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that hybrid zzso zzso is zzso by the complex formation with zzso zzso leading to a substantial zzso of zzso protein expression on the cell zzso These results provide a direct insight into the zzso of zzso and degradation of targeted hybrid zzso in cancer cells in zzso and suggest a potential application of this zzso zzso in zzso therapy of zzso
