The purpose of this study was to determine the role of plaques zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the descending zzso zzso as an zzso high-risk source for zzso 

In 63 acute stroke patients scheduled for zzso territory and zzso pattern of brain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso was performed to correlate the extent of retrograde zzso blood flow with the distance of complex zzso plaques from the left zzso artery zzso zzso risk from the zzso was present for zzso retrograde flow connecting complex zzso plaques with the zzso zzso zzso pattern of brain zzso in a territory supplied by the left zzso artery, and zzso stroke that could not be explained by other zzso 

33 of 63 patients had complex zzso plaques zzso to zzso zzso zzso Mean retrograde flow in these subjects was zzso zzso In 20 of 63 patients zzso retrograde flow connected complex zzso plaques with the zzso In 4 of these 20 patients zzso with an zzso stroke in the territory of the brain zzso zzso or zzso cerebral artery, zzso could not be explained by other zzso 

zzso zzso retrograde flow originating from complex plaques in the descending zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and constitutes a stroke mechanism that was previously not zzso
