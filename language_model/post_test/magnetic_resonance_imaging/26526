zzso To compare clinical outcome and zzso of zzso cervical zzso between patients managed conservatively and zzso zzso To determine if surgical outcome has improved since the series published from this unit in zzso zzso To examine the role of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of cervical zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso of the cervical spine between 1991 and 1996 were zzso Case records were reviewed zzso 

111 patients with zzso underwent 124 zzso zzso The median age at onset of cervical spine symptoms was 58 years zzso zzso with median disease duration of 16 years zzso zzso 18 zzso required surgery immediately after zzso 93 zzso were managed zzso 9 of whom zzso later required zzso zzso deaths in the conservative group were directly related to cervical zzso Patients requiring surgery were more likely to report zzso zzso zzso and to exhibit zzso zzso zzso gait zzso and reduced zzso zzso findings did not correlate with clinical zzso When compared with the zzso zzso fewer patients had severe zzso zzso grade zzso before surgery zzso versus zzso Early zzso mortality improved from zzso to zzso and surgical complication rate fell from 50% to zzso zzso of patients in the zzso cohort reported zzso improvement in overall zzso 

In this series surgical outcome has zzso The major factor in this more zzso outcome is probably that patients presenting with zzso cervical zzso are now referred for surgery at an earlier stage of zzso Clinical findings correlate poorly with zzso findings, therefore clinical history should remain the key to determining the need for zzso
