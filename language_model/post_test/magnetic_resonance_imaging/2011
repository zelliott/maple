Patients with schizophrenia exhibit abnormalities in zzso corpus zzso area, shape, and/or zzso Our goal was to confirm these findings and to establish the genetic and zzso contributions to altered zzso zzso in zzso zzso between zzso zzso potentially contributing to zzso zzso were assessed as a secondary zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were obtained from zzso of zzso and zzso pairs zzso for schizophrenia and healthy control twins (N zzso 40 zzso Investigators blind to group status segmented the corpus zzso and zzso in native brain volumes aligned using a zzso transformation with no zzso Total and zzso zzso zzso areas and measures indexing vertical zzso of the corpus zzso were used in statistical tests to identify schizophrenia and sex effects and to zzso genetic and zzso influences on zzso zzso mesh modeling methods provided group average and surface zzso maps of the zzso zzso areas did not differ between groups defined by sex or biological zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pronounced in male patients, were confirmed in schizophrenia and observed between zzso but not zzso zzso zzso for zzso Like their affected zzso however, unaffected zzso zzso of the schizophrenia zzso exhibited significant zzso zzso zzso and third zzso zzso were related to zzso zzso zzso clearly support that genetic rather than zzso or shared environmental influences contribute to altered zzso zzso in zzso An upward bowing of the zzso may thus provide an easily identifiable zzso marker to screen individuals possessing a biological vulnerability for zzso
