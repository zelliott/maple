zzso resonance imaging zzso is currently the only zzso method detecting changes of bone zzso While yellow bone zzso produces a high signal intensity, which is similar to subcutaneous fat, any other cellular zzso of the bone zzso causes a decrease of signal intensity because of replacement of zzso fat zzso In this report we describe two patients, who underwent zzso because of clinical symptoms of zzso in order to exclude Perthes zzso Both cases showed decreased signal intensity of the bone zzso particularly of the zzso zzso highly indicative of cellular bone zzso zzso Bone zzso aspiration in these patients showed acute zzso leukemia in one case and zzso zzso by zzso cells respectively in the other zzso Because of its high sensitivity, zzso is also suitable in detecting focal bone zzso zzso For these cases a biopsy of these focal bone zzso zzso can be performed in order to stage the disease properly as in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso presenting with localized disease, however, with focal bone zzso zzso on zzso In addition zzso can also be used to follow up the disease as well as therapy by showing the zzso of these bone zzso zzso
