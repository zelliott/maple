zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a zzso technique used to accurately and zzso measure biological parameters such as left zzso zzso However, some subjects either refuse or are unable to complete testing, and the impact of excluding these missing data from zzso models is zzso 

Multiple zzso was applied to cardiac zzso data that were previously analyzed using a complete case zzso The model variables - 10 traditional cardiovascular risk factors and five zzso variables - were used as a basis for zzso Men and women were zzso zzso The primary focus was assessing the change in the cardiovascular zzso of left zzso geometry and zzso zzso 

Although zzso of participants were missing cardiac zzso data, multiple zzso returned results similar to those of a complete case zzso These results were robust to the point of including additional variables in the zzso analysis above and beyond the model zzso The degree of zzso explained by the models increased marginally but the statistical zzso was altered for only two zzso out of 53 cardiovascular risk factors using multiple zzso 

The results suggest that the cardiac zzso data in the Multi-Ethnic Study of zzso zzso do not zzso change when missing data are handled using multiple zzso Future analyses of cardiac zzso data may consider the complete case approach to be adequate despite the high rate of missing data in this zzso
