The zzso nucleus of the zzso is suspected to have an important role in visual attention, based on its widespread connectivity with the visual zzso and the zzso attention zzso However, at present, there remain many hypotheses on the zzso specific function, with sparse or conflicting evidence for zzso Here we characterize how the human zzso encodes attended and ignored objects when they appear simultaneously and compete for zzso zzso Using zzso pattern analyses on data from two functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments, we show that attention gates both position and orientation information in the zzso attended objects are zzso with high precision, while there is no measurable zzso of ignored zzso These data support a role of the zzso in zzso zzso information from competing stimuli to isolate zzso relevant zzso
