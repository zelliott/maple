To determine which of the quantitative parameters obtained from zzso incoherent motion diffusion weighted imaging zzso is the most significant for the differentiation between pancreatic zzso and zzso chronic zzso 

zzso patients with pancreatic masses were included, 9 proved to have a zzso zzso and 20 had a pancreatic zzso The patients were studied using zzso incoherent motion zzso with 11 zzso and the apparent diffusion zzso zzso the true diffusion constant zzso and the zzso fraction zzso were zzso The diagnostic strength of the parameters was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic zzso 

The zzso in chronic zzso was higher than in pancreatic zzso with significant differences at b zzso 50, 75, 100, zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were found at b zzso 25, 400, zzso and 800 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso fraction f was significantly higher in zzso compared with pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant difference between groups for D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for chronic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for pancreatic zzso P zzso zzso For zzso the highest area under the curve zzso and combined sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso were zzso 

There were significant differences in zzso between chronic zzso and pancreatic zzso Because D is not significantly different between groups, differences in zzso can be attributed mainly to differences in zzso The zzso fraction f proved to be the superior zzso zzso for differentiation of zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso
