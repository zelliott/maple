Advances in cerebral vascular imaging suggest that patients with critical levels of carotid artery zzso zzso zzso who have symptoms can be identified accurately and necessary information about the zzso and zzso circulation obtained before surgery without conventional zzso We have used carotid duplex imaging in combination with magnetic resonance zzso zzso to evaluate 20 patients with symptomatic zzso high-grade carotid zzso 

All patients underwent CT and magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, as well as zzso and conventional zzso of the cerebral zzso zzso resonance zzso were obtained with two-dimensional phase contrast and zzso zzso Phase contrast was used for zzso vascular imaging and for determining qualitative flow zzso and the direction of blood flow in the circle of zzso zzso time of flight was used to assess the carotid zzso 

Twenty patients with symptoms (six with strokes, 11 with transient zzso attacks, and three with zzso zzso had duplex evidence of high-grade carotid zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance brain scans were positive for cerebral zzso in six patients with clinical zzso zzso of zzso with conventional zzso was zzso accurate for high-grade zzso and zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso for zzso zzso was zzso for complete zzso zzso of duplex imaging with conventional zzso demonstrated zzso accuracy for detection of severe zzso or zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso for zzso sensitivity and specificity were zzso for complete zzso 

This study suggests that combined use of zzso and duplex imaging is accurate for detection and evaluation of high-grade carotid zzso in patients with zzso
