A prospective zzso 

To evaluate the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for cervical zzso in preventing zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a common complication of cervical zzso Although the zzso of zzso zzso and preventive measures remain zzso we zzso that zzso zzso is caused by zzso nerve root impairment induced by potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso shifting of the spinal zzso after zzso 

The study included 141 consecutive patients with cervical zzso zzso men and 38 zzso who underwent zzso zzso with zzso bilateral zzso zzso between 2009 and zzso These were designated as the zzso group zzso One hundred zzso consecutive patients zzso men and 41 zzso who underwent zzso zzso without zzso zzso during 2006 to 2008 served as a control zzso This was the zzso group zzso The zzso of zzso zzso operation time, blood loss, and the number of zzso disc levels were zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso was zzso (2 of 141 zzso in the zzso and zzso (9 of 141 zzso in the zzso The mean operation times were 129 and 102 minutes, zzso There were significant differences in the zzso of zzso zzso and operation time (both zzso P zzso zzso There were no significant differences in blood loss or the number of zzso disc levels (both zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso bilateral zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the main zzso of zzso zzso was zzso root zzso However, 2 patients experienced zzso zzso despite undergoing zzso zzso which indicated that other factors including spinal zzso impairment after acute zzso against cervical canal zzso may also be considered as minor zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso was an effective preventive measure against zzso zzso zzso after zzso
