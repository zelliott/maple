Earlier studies have shown a zzso zzso decrease in the volume zzso by the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso diminution of the zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso The aim of this study was to measure this zzso displacement at different zzso levels of the zzso and try to find out were it is as greatest and to calculate regional zzso volume changes as a reference in healthy zzso Eleven healthy subjects were examined by magnetic resonance zzso Images were acquired using an zzso balanced fast field echo pulse zzso The zzso borders of the zzso wall were delineated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Regional changes of the zzso wall were zzso at three different levels zzso mid and zzso by dividing the zzso into zzso The volumes obtained as the differences between the outer volume of the left zzso at zzso and zzso at different slice levels were found to be greatest at the base of the heart and lowest at zzso The relative inward motion, that is the motion in zzso direction of the zzso border of the zzso from zzso to zzso towards the zzso of the zzso was greatest at the base and lowest at the mid level, something that has to be taken into account when measuring the zzso during clinical zzso There was a significant difference in the relative inward motion between the segments at zzso zzso zzso zzso mid zzso zzso zzso and at base level zzso zzso zzso
