Smoking cues trigger craving for cigarettes and zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso also influences smoking zzso In this study, we investigated how nicotine metabolism and genetic variation in zzso influence the neural response to smoking cues in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We hypothesized that individuals with faster rates of nicotine metabolism would have stronger zzso responses to smoking cues because of closer zzso in everyday life between exposure to cigarettes and surges in blood nicotine zzso In contrast, individuals with reduced rates of zzso who have relatively constant nicotine blood levels throughout the day, should be less likely to develop zzso responses to zzso We screened 169 smokers for their rate of nicotine metabolism and zzso zzso and selected 31 smokers with the fastest and zzso rates for zzso matched for daily cigarette zzso We measured their neural response to visual smoking and zzso cues using zzso As predicted, fast zzso by zzso or zzso had significantly greater responses to visual cigarette cues than slow zzso in the amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results support the theory that drug cues are zzso zzso and explain why fast zzso who smoke have lower zzso zzso They also provide insight into how zzso can shape human vulnerability to addiction, and have implications for tailoring smoking zzso programs based on individual zzso
