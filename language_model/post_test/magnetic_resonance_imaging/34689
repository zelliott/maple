Several clinical and zzso investigations support the notion that underlying brain changes may relate to depression in older patients, especially those with a zzso initial zzso However uncertainty still exists about diagnostic and zzso significance of structural brain abnormalities in aged zzso in part because many studies lack zzso and zzso normal comparison zzso 

Brain zzso of elderly zzso (N zzso 30) and normal controls (N zzso zzso was compared by assessing magnetic resonance imaging zzso brain scans with qualitative zzso zzso Ratings included lateral and third zzso enlargement, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso differences between depressed and control groups were not zzso zzso zzso had significantly more left zzso zzso and left zzso zzso than zzso counterparts of similar zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly correlated with cognitive impairment and was not related to physical zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso (N zzso 7) were older and had later age at onset of depression than those without such zzso zzso disease risk factors did not predict zzso zzso 

zzso indicate zzso and lack of zzso of zzso measured structural brain changes in geriatric depression, but suggest that pathology of specific, zzso brain regions may be implicated in some zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso depression raises the possibility that such patients may suffer from zzso zzso Alzheimer's zzso Lack of association between cerebrovascular disease risk factors and brain changes suggests other zzso zzso
