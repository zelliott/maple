The zzso of a zzso stroke remains zzso 

To validate the diagnosis of zzso stroke using stroke identified by magnetic resonance imaging zzso as the zzso 

zzso cohort study of zzso ethnically diverse elderly persons in northern zzso 

zzso quantitative zzso were acquired for zzso participants without zzso zzso and specificity of stroke by self-report were examined using zzso analyses and the zzso zzso zzso relationships between factors potentially influencing the reporting of stroke, including memory performance, cognitive function, and vascular risk factors, were assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso all analyses were zzso zzso by age, sex, ethnic group, and level of zzso 

In analyses of the whole sample, sensitivity of stroke self-report for a diagnosis of stroke on zzso was zzso and specificity was zzso In analyses zzso by median age zzso zzso the zzso between reported stroke and detection of stroke on zzso was significantly better in the younger than the older age group (for all vascular zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso memory, cognitive skills, or language ability and the presence of hypertension or zzso zzso were associated with higher rates of zzso zzso 

Using brain zzso as the standard, specificity and sensitivity of stroke self-report are zzso zzso of self-report is influenced by age, presence of vascular disease, and cognitive zzso In stroke research, sensitive zzso techniques rather than stroke self-report should be used to determine stroke zzso
