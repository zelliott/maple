We analyze the respective roles of zzso and zzso in the assessment of 11 children with zzso and zzso zzso were present in seven patients zzso six were treated with zzso zzso five had intractable zzso Two of the patients with intractable zzso became zzso under zzso Fourteen zzso recordings were performed in eight zzso The abnormal zzso findings included slow waves, focal zzso zzso slow zzso complexes, zzso frontal fast activity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso lack of zzso driving, periodic zzso and extremely large zzso A zzso zzso was found only in zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso only in zzso zzso Lack of zzso driving was found only in zzso zzso All zzso showed diffuse slow waves, and all patients had severe zzso zzso The Deep Gray zzso in zzso studies, thought to predict clinical outcome, was irrelevant given the presence and zzso of the zzso Patients with higher zzso nonetheless, tended to have higher mortality zzso In conclusion, zzso evaluation provides additional functional information to zzso studies in the assessment of neurological outcome in patients with zzso With a more mature and zzso zzso as found in the zzso and zzso types, the possibility of zzso and zzso driving increased, while that of zzso zzso zzso
