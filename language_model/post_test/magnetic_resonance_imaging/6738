To design a zzso double zzso fast zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso by inversion time at slice position zzso technique, to produce zzso vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In this zzso central zzso sampling for each slice is required at inversion time zzso of the blood zzso To fill the entire zzso the peripheral lines are obtained less or greater the zzso and using a rotating slice zzso Blood flow signal suppression was first evaluated using a zzso zzso studies were used to investigate zzso image zzso The final sequence was then applied to the rabbit abdominal zzso zzso at zzso zzso 

In the flow phantom study, artifacts from zzso water were substantially reduced by the zzso zzso residual water spins were zzso by the strong zzso zzso required for peripheral zzso These zzso spins flowed into the slice plane where the center of zzso was being acquired at the zzso of the flowing water zzso zzso zzso MR images were successfully obtained in the rabbit abdomen using the sequence with the zzso zzso by the simulation zzso 

The zzso technique was effective both in zzso double zzso zzso and in blood signal zzso
