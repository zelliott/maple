zzso zzso zzso has been recognized as a common cause of hip pain as well as a cause of hip arthritis, yet despite this, little is known about the zzso of the cam zzso or possible risk factors associated with its zzso 

The purposes of our study were to determine when the cam zzso associated with zzso developed in a zzso cohort study of pediatric patients zzso and zzso closure using zzso and whether increased activity level during the period of zzso closure is associated with an increased likelihood that the cam zzso will zzso 

Alpha angles were measured at the 3 o'clock zzso zzso zzso and 1:30 zzso zzso zzso positions in both hips with a cam zzso defined as an alpha angle zzso zzso at the 3 o'clock zzso zzso volunteers zzso zzso were zzso 23 with open zzso (12 zzso mean age zzso years; 11 zzso age zzso zzso and 21 with closed zzso (five zzso age zzso years; 16 zzso age zzso zzso Daily activity level using the validated zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared for patients in whom cam zzso did and did not zzso 

None of the 23 zzso patients zzso closure had cam zzso whereas three of 21 zzso p zzso zzso all zzso zzso had at least one hip with cam zzso Daily activity level was higher zzso zzso zzso for patients with the cam zzso zzso hours versus zzso zzso Mean alpha angles at the 3 o'clock zzso position were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in the open zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the closed zzso zzso at the 1:30 zzso position, they were zzso zzso zzso zzso in the open zzso group and zzso zzso in the closed zzso zzso 

The fact that cam zzso was present exclusively in the closed zzso group strongly supports its development during the period of zzso closure with increased activity level as a possible risk zzso
