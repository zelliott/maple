Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer mortality in children and remain incurable despite advances in surgery and zzso zzso The failure of zzso zzso to respond to conventional treatment reflects the unique biology of these tumors, linked to a small population of zzso zzso This study describes the characteristics of stem cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso and gives insight into the mechanism of brain zzso 

zzso zzso precursors were identified from primary human zzso cell culture using zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were cultured in zzso in stem cell medium supplemented with growth factors and then the capacity of the surviving zzso precursors to form tumor spheres and to continue to zzso after zzso were zzso 

The tumor cells expressed the cellular markers zzso zzso zzso zzso Oct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also displayed a high zzso potential despite chemotherapy and zzso and also had the ability to form zzso in zzso 

High grade zzso contain zzso zzso which exhibit neural stem cell properties with zzso establishing a novel zzso paradigm in the study of brain zzso and providing a powerful tool to develop zzso therapy for this devastating zzso
