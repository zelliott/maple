Both the spontaneous shrinkage and the disappearance of disc zzso have been confirmed through the use of zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso There is, however, no practical method to predict the likely zzso of the zzso zzso The objective of this study was to predict the spontaneous zzso of disc zzso by zzso and to select the optimum zzso The study involved 65 patients with zzso disc zzso Conservative treatment was carried out in 21 patients, while 44 patients underwent zzso In the zzso patients, an zzso was taken both during the painful period, and shortly after pain zzso zzso shrinkage was evaluated according to the decrease in the calculated volume, in addition to the decrease in zzso area, calculated by zzso In the operated group, zzso zzso enhancement, type of hernia, and invasion of zzso tissue in the zzso specimens were zzso In the 21 zzso patients, the volume zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso 208 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the painful period and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This decrease in volume was statistically zzso There was also a greater decrease in zzso exhibiting positive enhancement by zzso In the operated patients, zzso that penetrated the zzso zzso ligament zzso had high rates of zzso enhancement, and these zzso showed invasion of zzso tissue with marked zzso Positive enhancement by zzso confirms an ongoing zzso zzso zzso zzso can be a good method for the prediction of spontaneous zzso of zzso disc zzso
