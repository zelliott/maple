The zzso barrier and a zzso zzso barrier function together to isolate the brain from circulating drugs, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso barrier is localized to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms regulating drug zzso across the zzso zzso are defined zzso zzso we describe a zzso barrier in human and zzso zzso zzso by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso whose transport is zzso by both zzso and zzso shows a large zzso concentration zzso across intact zzso zzso in humans in zzso In rats, zzso analysis with zzso determined the concentration zzso to be greater than zzso In membrane zzso of isolated native zzso from zzso zzso and human, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are identified zzso Furthermore, the zzso proteins are absent in zzso isolated from their respective zzso and zzso gene knockout zzso As determined by zzso and zzso analysis of native zzso and polarized zzso cell cultures derived from zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso barrier to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an opposing zzso zzso zzso Together, these zzso may coordinate zzso and zzso of natural product zzso and therapeutic drugs, including zzso agents, zzso and zzso zzso zzso into and out of the central nervous zzso
