The zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso is a core structure for the governing of cognitive control, and recent studies have shown that zzso differences in zzso anatomy are associated with corresponding differences in the ability for cognitive zzso However, individuals differ not only in anatomical features of zzso but also exhibit substantial zzso regarding the zzso characteristics of the zzso In this study, we combined magnetic resonance zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso finding that zzso differences of zzso levels in the zzso during zzso predict the strength of the zzso zzso zzso response to a task requiring cognitive zzso This relationship was observed in the zzso cortex, the zzso cortex, the inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso More specifically, individuals with low zzso zzso levels in the zzso showed an increased zzso response when the task demands were high, whereas zzso individuals showed the opposite pattern of an increased zzso response when the task demands were zzso Thus, we show here that individual zzso of zzso levels is directly related to how the brain zzso cognitive zzso
