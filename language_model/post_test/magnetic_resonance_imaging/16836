To assess the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence for diffuse zzso injury zzso by virtue of correlation analysis between the number, volume and regional distribution of zzso zzso determined with zzso sequence and clinical zzso 

zzso zzso patients were included in our study and were divided into zzso in compliance with zzso clinical variables zzso Global and regional number, volume and distribution of zzso zzso were compared between groups by zzso zzso U test zzso zzso and independent samples zzso zzso zzso rank correlation analysis was performed to compare the zzso clinical variables with the global and regional number and volume of zzso 

Patients with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso or prolonged coma zzso days, zzso or abnormal zzso light zzso zzso zzso had a greater global number zzso zzso zzso and apparent volume zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In our study, zzso extent in most brain regions, such as frontal white matter zzso zzso white matter zzso corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso brain stem zzso were greater in the lower zzso group, in the prolonged coma group and in the abnormal zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso extent in global range and the zzso clinical variables zzso zzso zzso zzso were also found between zzso extent in most regions, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso clinical variables zzso zzso zzso The number of involved regions was much more higher in the lower zzso group and the prolonged coma group zzso zzso zzso 

More accurate and objective assessment of injury can be obtained in zzso patients via zzso zzso
