The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors influencing zzso enhancement and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso phase MR zzso 

Patients with chronic liver disease who underwent liver zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in this zzso The degree of zzso enhancement on zzso and zzso delayed phase zzso zzso and 20-minute delayed phase zzso zzso zzso phase images were evaluated with quantitative and visual zzso The zzso of 40 zzso in the zzso zzso group and 38 zzso in the zzso zzso group were graded on a zzso zzso zzso between zzso enhancement indexes and clinical factors zzso body weight, serum zzso zzso model for zzso liver disease score, zzso class, and zzso function zzso and association between the zzso of zzso and clinical factors, zzso diameter, and zzso enhancement indexes were zzso 

In the zzso zzso group, the visual index of zzso enhancement independently correlated with zzso class on both zzso and zzso delayed images zzso zzso zzso and with zzso function stage only on zzso delayed images zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso group, both quantitative and visual indexes of zzso enhancement independently correlated with zzso class zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso independently correlated with zzso class and zzso diameter on zzso delayed zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso and on zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso and significantly correlated with the visual index of zzso enhancement on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso 

Liver enhancement and zzso of zzso are significantly affected by zzso class on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso phase MR zzso
