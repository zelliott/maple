zzso over drug use, enhanced zzso of drug use and decreased zzso of natural zzso are thought to play an important role substance zzso Whether this is also true for pathological gambling is zzso To understand the effects of affective stimuli on response zzso in problem zzso zzso we designed an affective zzso to examine the interaction between response zzso and zzso attribution in 16 zzso and 15 healthy controls zzso affective blocks were presented with Go trials containing neutral, zzso positive or negative affective zzso The zzso trials in these blocks contained neutral zzso Outcomes of interest included percentage of impulsive errors and mean reaction times in the different zzso Brain activity related to zzso trials was assessed to measure response zzso in the various affective conditions and brain activity related to Go trials was assessed to measure zzso zzso made fewer errors during gamble and positive trials than zzso but were slower during all trials zzso Compared to zzso zzso activated the zzso prefrontal cortex, anterior zzso and zzso zzso to a greater extent while viewing gamble zzso The zzso lateral and inferior frontal zzso were more activated in zzso than in zzso while viewing positive and negative zzso During neutral zzso zzso were slower but similar in accuracy to zzso and showed more zzso prefrontal and anterior zzso zzso zzso In contrast, during gamble and positive pictures zzso performed better than zzso and showed lower zzso of the zzso and anterior zzso zzso study shows that zzso stimuli are more salient for zzso than for zzso zzso seem to rely on zzso brain activity to achieve similar performance during neutral response zzso A zzso or positive context appears to facilitate response zzso as indicated by lower brain activity and fewer zzso errors in zzso
