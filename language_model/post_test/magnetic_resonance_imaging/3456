Attention is attracted zzso by physically salient zzso but this effect can be dampened by zzso attention settings, a phenomenon called zzso zzso zzso salient stimuli are also thought to exert a strong zzso influence on attention, especially in anxious individuals, but whether and how zzso attention can zzso bottom-up capture by affective stimuli is currently zzso Here, we paired a novel spatial zzso task with zzso to investigate contingent capture as a function of the affective zzso of bottom-up cues zzso zzso and individual differences in trait zzso In the absence of zzso cues, zzso stimuli zzso zzso targets facilitated attention in zzso participants, regardless of affective zzso However, although zzso participants exhibited similar zzso following neutral zzso cues, this zzso was completely absent following zzso negative zzso zzso zzso these effects were contingent on zzso zzso settings, such that explicit zzso cues presented before the appearance of zzso stimuli removed anxious zzso sensitivity to zzso salient zzso zzso analyses revealed a network of brain regions underlying this zzso in affective contingent capture across individuals, including the zzso face area zzso zzso zzso frontal cortex, and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso frontal zzso and the zzso fully zzso the effects observed in zzso demonstrating a critical role for these frontal regions in zzso zzso zzso and interference resolution processes when engaged by zzso salient zzso
