We sought to compare the efficacy of a zzso zzso zzso system in zzso near the portal vein and the zzso veins in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of healthy zzso near the portal vein and the zzso veins was performed in 10 pigs with a zzso zzso zzso Volumes and diameters of zones of zzso were assessed by magnetic resonance zzso 

Volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and diameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of the zones of zzso near the zzso veins were larger than that near the portal vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Energy deposition needed to zzso liver tissue was higher zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso near the portal vein zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso near the zzso veins zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Higher energy deposition is needed to zzso liver tissue near the portal vein than near the zzso zzso As a result, the zone of zzso is larger near the zzso vein than near the portal zzso
