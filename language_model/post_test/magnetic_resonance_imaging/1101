zzso zzso growth factor zzso expression is zzso in melanoma, and the activity of zzso is zzso in part through the zzso zzso zzso zzso A Phase II study of zzso a preferential inhibitor of zzso was carried out in patients with zzso melanoma to determine clinical response, zzso and changes in tumor vascular zzso 

Patients with documented progressive disease and zzso prior therapy were zzso Central nervous system zzso were allowed if stable off zzso zzso (145 zzso was administered via a central zzso twice weekly for 8 zzso zzso with zzso zzso and a zzso blocker was required because of the zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso was assessed before treatment and during week 8 by dynamic contrast magnetic resonance imaging, and plasma was analyzed for zzso 

Thirty-one patients were zzso zzso had received prior therapy, 21 had visceral zzso and 14 had an elevated zzso zzso Mean absolute zzso counts were decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were increased zzso zzso zzso zzso presumably because of steroid zzso Four vascular adverse events were zzso Of 26 zzso patients, 1 experienced a partial response, 1 had stable disease, and 5 had a mixed zzso Dynamic contrast magnetic resonance imaging in 5 zzso patients showed decreased tumor zzso at week 8 zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso levels were elevated compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso appears to be relatively well tolerated in this zzso Although the modest clinical activity and potential effects on tumor zzso may support additional exploration of zzso as a target in melanoma, effects from steroid zzso limit further investigation of this zzso
