To assess the effect of prescription parameters on the dose received by the spine during zzso zzso 

In a survey, members of the Canadian Association of zzso zzso were asked to define their prescription parameters for zzso zzso The depth of the spinal canal and zzso body at 8 spinal levels was measured in 20 magnetic resonance imaging studies zzso zzso results were applied to the zzso to assess the dose received at zzso The depth of spinal structures assessed at simulation and by diagnostic imaging was zzso 

zzso were most commonly to zzso 3 zzso or 5 zzso using zzso photons delivering zzso zzso in zzso zzso Mean depths from zzso were: zzso spinal canal, zzso zzso anterior spinal canal, zzso zzso and anterior zzso body, zzso zzso Application of the prescription parameters from the survey to these zzso showed a wide range in the dose at depth with variation in zzso zzso measured at simulation correlated well with diagnostic zzso 

The spinal canal and zzso body lie zzso zzso beneath the skin, and the dose received varies by up to 50% with changes in prescription zzso We suggest a suitable prescription point for zzso zzso and a method for determining this at zzso
