The study aims at describing the MR features of zzso in zzso major, investigating the relations between MR findings and zzso disturbances and between zzso and pancreatic zzso Signal intensity ratios of the zzso and liver to right zzso muscle zzso zzso were zzso assessed on abdominal MR imaging studies of 31 zzso patients with zzso major undergoing zzso of zzso zzso and 10 healthy controls, using zzso zzso intermediate in and out of phase - zzso zzso and zzso weighted zzso zzso Using the signal drop of the liver and zzso on opposed phase images, we recorded serum zzso and results of oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso zzso and zzso on at least the zzso sequence were noticed in zzso and zzso patients, respectively, but no correlation between zzso and zzso was zzso Patients with zzso zzso displayed a higher degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal drop of zzso on opposed phase imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty replacement of zzso zzso was neither correlated with zzso disturbances nor serum zzso Iron deposition in the zzso cannot be predicted by the degree of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso replacement of the zzso is common and may be associated with zzso zzso
