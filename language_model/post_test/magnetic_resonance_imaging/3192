The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of zzso US zzso CT, and zzso in detecting deep zzso invasion in zzso zzso 

Twenty-six patients with zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso CT, and zzso The depth of zzso invasion was estimated in each zzso The invasion depth was zzso into zzso and deep and was compared to surgical and zzso zzso 

At zzso examination, the depth of zzso invasion was zzso in 16 patients and deep in zzso The zzso of zzso CT, and zzso in detecting deep zzso invasion were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and accuracy of zzso in detecting deep zzso invasion were significantly higher than those of zzso and CT zzso zzso zzso for both sensitivity and zzso 

We recommend zzso instead of CT or zzso for the evaluation of the depth of zzso invasion in zzso zzso
