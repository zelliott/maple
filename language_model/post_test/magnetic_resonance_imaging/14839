Our study focused on acute zzso zzso shapes to explore the risk factors and clinical significance of zzso shaped zzso zzso 

Based on the shape of their acute zzso zzso patients zzso were classified into the zzso group or zzso zzso The characteristics of the zzso zzso were compared between the regular and irregular groups, between patients with and without neurological zzso and between patients with different modified Rankin scale zzso zzso The risk factors for zzso shaped zzso zzso neurological zzso and high zzso scores were zzso 

Blood pressure zzso zzso was an independent risk factor for zzso shaped zzso zzso zzso size, prevalence of advanced zzso and zzso shaped zzso zzso were independent risk factors for higher zzso zzso 

The zzso shaped zzso zzso were correlated with zzso zzso shaped zzso zzso and zzso may be associated with zzso clinical zzso
