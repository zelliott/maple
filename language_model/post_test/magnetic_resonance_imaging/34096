To test zzso zzso scanning by MR zzso to guide and control zzso zzso zzso of the healthy pig zzso 

After MR zzso planning of the approach, an zzso experimental zzso probe of zzso zzso diameter was introduced through a 5 zzso zzso hole into the right frontal brain of five healthy zzso The zzso cycles were zzso using a zzso zzso echo sequence with zzso zzso scanning in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The high zzso resolution of the chosen sequence permits a continuous representation of the freezing process with good image quality and high contrast between ice and zzso brain zzso Because of the interactive conception of the sequence the layer plane could be chosen as desired during the zzso Ice formation was sharply zzso zzso zzso and was free of zzso Its maximum diameter was 13 zzso 

With use of the novel, zzso zzso zzso echo sequence with zzso zzso zzso guidance of the intervention under zzso conditions with the advantages of zzso is zzso zzso zzso allows a zzso precisely zzso focal tissue zzso
