It is often difficult for the zzso to determine if a given zzso zzso zzso is causing zzso zzso criteria for identifying zzso likely to be symptomatic are zzso Using conventional magnetic resonance zzso imaging along with a specifically designed zzso zzso the authors characterized 24 zzso (19 zzso with respect to diameter and communication with the zzso zzso They found no significant difference in size between symptomatic and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did observe a clear-cut disparity in the context of zzso Five of five zzso zzso were shown to communicate on MR flow studies, while seven of seven symptomatic zzso were not shown to zzso The authors propose that zzso MR imaging is useful in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this information may be of value in zzso these zzso as more or less likely to be zzso
