This study explored the zzso changes and clinical symptoms related to the zzso joint zzso associated with long-term lack of zzso zzso 

The subjects were 20 patients (40 zzso who underwent zzso including the zzso or zzso zzso without zzso reconstruction more than 6 months previous to the zzso The 40 zzso were classified into the following 3 groups: group I: zzso with a major zzso zzso including the zzso body zzso zzso zzso group II: zzso with a minor zzso zzso including only the zzso process or the zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), and group zzso zzso without a zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso were examined with respect to disc position, zzso position, zzso changes, and appearance of joint zzso on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as for the presence of joint or muscle pain and joint zzso 

The rate of anterior disc displacement was zzso in group I, zzso in group II, and zzso in group zzso All zzso in group I were located in the zzso zzso Seven of 10 zzso in group II were zzso zzso out of the zzso zzso However, these zzso were situated in the intermediate zone of the zzso zzso changes was found in 1 joint in group zzso Joint zzso was not observed in group zzso However, joint zzso was detected in the zzso region of the upper joint compartment in 7 of 10 zzso in group H and in 8 of 9 zzso in group zzso In group II, the 7 zzso with joint zzso were the same zzso with zzso zzso zzso Clinical symptoms of zzso pain, zzso noise, or muscular pain were not found in any zzso 

zzso zzso does not affect the relationship between the disc and the zzso or the zzso condition of the zzso The disc without a zzso will become zzso displaced with zzso The zzso not connected to the zzso body often zzso zzso out of the zzso zzso while retaining a normal relationship with the zzso Joint zzso which is detected in zzso zzso is not associated with an inflammatory reaction in the joint zzso
