Linear accelerator based zzso radiation therapy zzso has been used for the treatment of zzso zzso however, little is known concerning the use of this zzso for the treatment of patients with zzso We have zzso studied the short-term outcome of zzso in 12 zzso patients who failed to achieve zzso zzso despite surgery and/or zzso zzso 

We identified all patients who had zzso uncontrolled zzso and were treated with zzso between April 2003 and December zzso All patients were followed zzso based on a zzso protocol that included Goldman visual field examination, zzso of the zzso and zzso hormone testing at 3, 6, 12 months, and then zzso 

A total of 12 patients with zzso were treated with zzso There were 9 females and the median age of the group was 50 zzso The median follow-up was zzso months during which time the mean tumor volume decreased by zzso the median zzso fell from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the median IGF-1 dropped more than half from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four patients achieved normal, while an additional 2 achieved zzso IGF-1 zzso One patient was able to zzso and two were able to reduce their zzso medications while maintaining a normal zzso A new zzso hormonal deficit was found at 24 months in one patient who developed zzso requiring zzso zzso 

Based on our early experience, we believe that zzso should be considered in treating patients with uncontrolled zzso
