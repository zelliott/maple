To investigate the correlation between facial sensory abnormalities and zzso topography in eight patients with lateral zzso zzso zzso 

We reviewed eight sequential cases of zzso admitted to the zzso Division of Hospital zzso zzso Paulo University between July, 2001 and August, 2002 except for one patient who had admitted in 1996 and was still followed in zzso All patients were submitted to conventional brain zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated blindly to clinical features to determine extension of the zzso to presumed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso spinal zzso tracts and spinal zzso zzso 

zzso symptoms or signs were zzso to the zzso zzso in 3 patients, zzso in 4 and bilateral in zzso In all of our cases with exclusive zzso facial sensory symptoms, zzso had zzso extensions that included the zzso zzso In cases with exclusive zzso facial sensory zzso zzso affected lateral and zzso zzso portions, with slight or no zzso zzso The only patient who presented bilateral facial symptoms had an zzso that covered both zzso and zzso in addition to the zzso region of the zzso 

Our results show a correlation between zzso extension of zzso and presence of zzso facial sensory zzso
