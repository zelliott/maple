The performance of zzso MR imaging using two zzso hybrid sequences zzso zzso two zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso and one zzso zzso sequence zzso was compared with a standard conventional zzso zzso sequence in 20 patients with focal liver zzso Liver zzso ratio was highest for the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the highest zzso zzso ratio was obtained by the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highest with the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso With both zzso and zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso more zzso were detected as compared with zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso sequences will eventually replace conventional zzso zzso techniques, due to their zzso to motion artifacts, superior zzso zzso and inherently short acquisition zzso
