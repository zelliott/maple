The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical feasibility and to report on preliminary treatment outcomes of combined zzso zzso using a novel zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso treatment planning in patients with locally advanced cervical zzso 

A total of 22 cervical cancer patients with insufficient response and/or zzso topography after zzso zzso were included in this zzso zzso extent of the disease in these patients was judged to exceed the coverage limit of zzso zzso zzso A modified zzso zzso zzso for guidance of zzso needles zzso was used to perform zzso with zzso treatment zzso Clinical feasibility and preliminary treatment outcomes were zzso 

A total of 44 zzso needle implants were zzso The spatial relations between the zzso + N zzso high-risk clinical target volume, and zzso at risk were visible clearly in all zzso zzso and zzso needle placement could be achieved in the majority of zzso No severe adverse events were caused by the zzso The mean follow-up period was 20 months zzso zzso zzso No zzso to zzso early or persistent late side effects were zzso Complete zzso was achieved in 21 patients zzso One local recurrence was observed within the high-risk clinical target volume area during zzso 

Our preliminary clinical experience indicates that combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso in patients with significant residual disease after zzso therapy extending up to the zzso third of zzso is feasible and allows excellent local control and a low rate of zzso
