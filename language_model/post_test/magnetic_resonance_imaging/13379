The objective of this work is refinement of an MR zzso technique via zzso removal of phase errors which inhibit zzso signal zzso zzso views of the object are obtained using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Complex zzso of data sets is required since a projection zzso pulse is used for zzso signal zzso This renders the difference image susceptible to systematic phase errors which are modeled as a smoothly varying zzso phase zzso The error function is estimated by comparison of heavily spatial filtered renditions of the object acquired without projection zzso in order to minimize influence of zzso The phase correction is then applied to high-resolution data sets collected with projection zzso to enhance flow zzso The technique is demonstrated by improvement of MR zzso of rats acquired on a zzso zzso zzso
