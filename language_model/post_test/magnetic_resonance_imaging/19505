Renal zzso zzso is characteristic of zzso zzso and can be assessed zzso in animals and humans by blood oxygen zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Water zzso has been shown to improve zzso zzso in young human subjects but not in elderly subjects, a difference attributed to a decline in zzso zzso production with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso also increase zzso zzso in experimental animals, by zzso active transport and oxygen consumption in the zzso thick ascending zzso We zzso using zzso zzso this response to zzso in eight younger zzso to 34 zzso and eight elderly zzso to 81 zzso healthy zzso We also attempted to assess the role of zzso in age-related differences, using zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso Renal zzso zzso initially low, increased during zzso zzso in younger zzso In the older population, however, zzso usually zzso little or no change in zzso of the zzso zzso despite zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the action of zzso to improve zzso zzso in younger zzso 

The action of loop zzso to improve zzso zzso apparent in younger subjects, is blunted by normal zzso zzso of zzso synthesis did not counteract the effect of zzso in younger subjects, suggesting that a decline in zzso zzso production with age is not the central cause of this age-related zzso
