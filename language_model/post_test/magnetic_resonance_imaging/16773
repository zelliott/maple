zzso zzso cells zzso are the focus of research in zzso medicine aiming at the regulatory approval of these cells for specific zzso To cope with the regulatory requirements for zzso cell therapy, novel approaches that do not interfere with the natural behavior of the cells are zzso In this context in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of labeled zzso could be an appropriate zzso Cell labeling for zzso with a variety of different iron oxide preparations is frequently zzso However, most publications lack a comprehensive assessment of the zzso of the contrast agent with the functionality of the labeled zzso which is a prerequisite for the zzso of zzso via zzso 

We studied the effects of iron zzso zzso in zzso with flow zzso transmission electron zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso blue zzso zzso proliferation testing, zzso zzso zzso zzso flow chamber zzso testing, zzso tests and differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

It could be demonstrated that zzso show rapid zzso of zzso and long-lasting zzso persistence in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with these particles has no influence on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They show excellent zzso properties in zzso zzso and after subcutaneous zzso in rats over several zzso 

These particles qualify for studying zzso zzso and trafficking via zzso
