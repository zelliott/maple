The external zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in maintaining zzso zzso however, cerebral cortical control of voluntary zzso contraction is not completely zzso Our aims were to determine the cortical areas associated with voluntary zzso contraction and to determine the effect of two levels of zzso contraction effort on brain zzso zzso zzso adults zzso zzso 9 zzso were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect brain zzso Studies were done in two zzso In stage 1 (10 subjects, 5 zzso zzso zzso pressure was monitored from a zzso zzso zzso performed zzso and zzso zzso zzso during two zzso scanning sessions consisting of alternating zzso intervals of sustained contraction and zzso In stage 2 studies, seven subjects (4 zzso performed only maximum effort zzso zzso without a zzso zzso contraction was associated with zzso zzso activity in zzso anterior cingulate, zzso zzso zzso and insular zzso Total cortical activity volume was significantly larger zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso effort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, percent zzso signal change was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso effort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the zzso of insular zzso to be more common in women compared with zzso Other cortical regions showed no such gender zzso zzso activity detected in stage 2 showed similar regions of cortical zzso to those of the stage 1 zzso zzso contraction of the zzso is associated with zzso cerebral cortical zzso The volume and intensity of cerebral cortical zzso is commensurate with the level of zzso zzso
