To examine zzso in patterns of brain zzso seen in normal aging and in mild Alzheimer's disease by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during an zzso zzso zzso 

10 young controls, 10 elderly controls, and seven patients with mild Alzheimer's disease were studied using zzso during a zzso association zzso zzso The zzso paradigm used a block design with three conditions: novel zzso pairs, repeated zzso pairs, and visual zzso 

The young and elderly controls differed primarily in the pattern of zzso seen in prefrontal and zzso zzso elderly controls showed significantly less zzso in both superior and inferior prefrontal zzso but greater zzso in zzso regions than younger controls during the zzso of novel zzso zzso Compared with elderly controls, the zzso patients showed significantly less zzso in the zzso formation but greater zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The pattern of zzso zzso during the zzso of novel associations is zzso altered in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease compared with normal zzso
