zzso studies of subjects who are zzso for Huntington zzso but not yet diagnosed zzso zzso zzso report that the zzso is zzso despite the zzso in zzso and cerebral zzso zzso zzso of zzso volume can mask more zzso but potentially clinically relevant regional changes in volume, zzso or surface zzso The current study addressed this limitation by evaluating cortical zzso of 523 zzso HD zzso Participants included zzso individuals enrolled in the zzso zzso Of these participants, 523 carried the HD gene zzso zzso HD zzso the remaining 170 were non zzso and served as the comparison zzso Based on age and zzso repeat zzso zzso subjects were zzso as zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans were processed using zzso zzso volume, zzso and surface area were not significantly different between the Far from onset group and zzso However, beginning in the Midway to onset group, the zzso showed significant volume zzso affecting most the zzso and superior cerebral zzso This pattern progressed when evaluating the groups further into the disease zzso Areas that remained mostly unaffected included zzso and zzso regions of the frontal and zzso zzso zzso changes were mostly in thinning as surface area did not substantially change in most zzso Early in the course of zzso the zzso shows changes that are manifest as cortical thinning and are most robust in the zzso and superior regions of the zzso
