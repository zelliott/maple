zzso zzso has not tapped zzso full potential because of acoustic scanner noise zzso by the zzso switches of conventional zzso zzso zzso The scanner noise is zzso and auditory zzso is particularly sensitive to zzso zzso Current zzso approaches to avoid zzso interactions are temporally zzso Since the sustained zzso response to zzso sounds decreases with repetition rate and becomes minimal with zzso sounds, we developed an zzso sequence emitting continuous rather than zzso zzso sound by implementing a novel zzso zzso switch zzso Compared to conventional zzso zzso zzso reduced auditory zzso zzso baseline and increased zzso zzso with graded sound zzso short sound events, and sounds as complex as orchestra music with preserved zzso zzso Response in zzso auditory zzso was zzso but not the response to light in visual zzso Finally, zzso mapping using zzso zzso demonstrates that enhanced functional zzso in zzso response translates into improved spatial zzso of specific sound zzso
