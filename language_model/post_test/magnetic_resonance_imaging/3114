The zzso zzso is a benign zzso that has been classically described as an zzso fourth zzso tumor found zzso at autopsy in elderly zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize the differences in CT and MR imaging appearances between zzso of the fourth and lateral zzso both of which were found in symptomatic zzso 

We zzso reviewed 24 zzso proved cases of zzso zzso in 17 male and seven female patients with a mean age of zzso zzso All patients were zzso CT and MR images were used to characterize the size, shape, and location of the zzso the degree of zzso tumor zzso and the density, zzso and enhancement characteristics of the zzso 

zzso of 24 tumors were 3 zzso or more in greatest zzso zzso were zzso and zzso was seen in zzso Fourteen were in the lateral zzso and 10 were in the zzso zzso zzso were present in five (all fourth zzso and absent in 10 (all lateral zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso On 18 zzso CT scans, five of six zzso with zzso enhancement were in the fourth zzso and nine of 12 tumors with minimal or no enhancement were in the lateral zzso Small internal zzso with a signal intensity similar to that of zzso were seen on images of all 10 lateral zzso zzso obtained with both zzso and zzso zzso On 13 zzso zzso images, seven of eight tumors with zzso enhancement were in the fourth zzso and all five with minimal or no enhancement were in the lateral zzso 

zzso zzso were seen in symptomatic middle-aged adults and showed different CT and MR imaging features, depending on their zzso zzso zzso and zzso contrast enhancement were common features of fourth zzso zzso showed a lack of zzso as well as minimal or no contrast enhancement of CT and MR zzso
