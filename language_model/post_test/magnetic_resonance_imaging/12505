zzso from recent zzso studies of zzso processing support the hypothesis that both languages of a zzso are always active and that zzso continually engage in processes of language zzso This view zzso with the convergence hypothesis of zzso language zzso Furthermore, it is hypothesized that when zzso perform a task in one language they need to inhibit their other, zzso zzso and that stronger zzso is required when the task is performed in the weaker language than in the stronger zzso The study of multilingual individuals who acquire zzso resulting from a focal brain zzso offers a unique opportunity to test the convergence hypothesis and the zzso zzso We report on a zzso person with chronic zzso zzso who at the time of testing demonstrated greater impairment in her first acquired language zzso than in her third, later learned language zzso She received treatment in English followed by treatment in zzso An examination of her connected language production revealed improvement in her grammatical skills in each language following intervention in that language, but decreased grammatical accuracy in English following treatment in zzso The increased error rate was evident in structures that are used differently in the two languages zzso auxiliary zzso The results support the prediction that greater zzso is applied to the stronger language than to the weaker language, regardless of their age of zzso We interpret the findings as consistent with convergence theories that zzso overlapping zzso representation and simultaneous zzso of multiple languages and with zzso zzso zzso in zzso
