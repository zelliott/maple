To establish the appearance of the normal zzso on zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Eleven patients underwent MR imaging for suspected zzso (four zzso or zzso zzso zzso abnormalities (but not zzso zzso or zzso growth zzso zzso or zzso zzso fat zzso zzso zzso MR images and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were zzso Two investigators zzso evaluated the images to determine the rate, pattern, and degree of zzso contrast material enhancement with zzso enhancement as a zzso 

The diagnoses were normal zzso (six zzso abnormal zzso position (four zzso and zzso zzso (one zzso The zzso rapidly and intensely enhanced on images acquired immediately after contrast material administration and preceded substantial enhancement of the zzso Immediately zzso images showed closely packed zzso zzso of zzso enhancement in zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhancement in zzso zzso In all cases, zzso enhancement became more homogeneous over zzso The zzso could be readily distinguished from the zzso All zzso were healthy with no evidence of zzso growth zzso 

zzso zzso enhancement is intense on immediately zzso images and precedes substantial zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a zzso pattern of enhancement, while zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso
