The importance of tumor volume as a zzso factor in high-grade zzso is highly controversial and there are numerous methods zzso this zzso In this study, a computer-based application was used in order to assess tumor volume from hard copies and a survival analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the zzso significance of zzso zzso data in patients harboring zzso 

50 patients suffering from zzso were analyzed zzso zzso volume was determined by the various geometric models as well as by an own specialized software zzso Age, performance status, type of zzso and tumor location were also included in the zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso models overestimated tumor volume, while the zzso model offered the best zzso Volume failed to attain any statistical significance in zzso while age and performance status confirmed their importance in zzso and overall survival of zzso 

Geometric models provide a rough approximation of tumor volume and should not be used, as accurate determination of size is of paramount importance in order to draw safe conclusions in zzso Although the significance of zzso was not disclosed, further studies are definitely zzso
