We report a case study on possible zzso in zzso functional connectivity between the auditory network and zzso brain regions in zzso zzso 

Independent component analyses were performed to evaluate coherent spontaneous activity in distributed brain zzso The zzso functional connectivity scores between the right and left auditory networks were zzso zzso comparison of zzso connectivity between zzso patients and controls was made using a zzso zzso 

Four patients (three male, one zzso mean age 45 zzso zzso zzso with chronic zzso zzso to the left ear, and six zzso controls (four male, two zzso mean age 45 zzso zzso zzso participated in this case zzso 

The average zzso functional connectivity zzso score between the left and right auditory cortical regions was significantly lower in zzso patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison between patients and controls showed that increased functional connectivity caused by zzso occurred predominantly in the left zzso and in the zzso prefrontal zzso 

Our pilot study suggested that resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be useful to investigate possible zzso in zzso zzso activity between the auditory and zzso networks in zzso zzso
