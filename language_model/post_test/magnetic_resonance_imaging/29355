zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have long been implicated in the formation of new memories for events, however, it is unclear whether different zzso zzso support different memory zzso Here, we used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine the degree to which two recognition memory zzso and zzso supported by different zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso activity in the zzso zzso selectively predicted zzso recognition, zzso activity in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso selectively predicted zzso zzso these results support the view that different zzso within the zzso memory system implement unique zzso processes that zzso support familiarity and zzso
