Imaging of zzso transferred cells in zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso could provide important information on zzso patterns of zzso zzso in nonhuman zzso models of zzso As a preliminary study to assess the feasibility of visualizing activated zzso T cells by zzso zzso zzso T zzso were labeled in zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso was determined by transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso zzso with zzso did not affect zzso zzso suggesting that cellular zzso of zzso occurred by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso were zzso zzso exclusively in the zzso and did not cause any measurable zzso effects on zzso function, including zzso zzso synthesis of select zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso and zzso to in zzso infection with zzso zzso virus zzso A sensitivity of zzso (1 zzso T cell in 2000 zzso zzso could be achieved using zzso zzso echo zzso Furthermore, under these experimental conditions, the zzso signal did not decrease in zzso zzso zzso T cells over a period of 120 zzso These results indicate that zzso labeling with zzso can be a useful technique for zzso monitoring trafficking patterns of zzso transferred zzso zzso in real-time by zzso in nonhuman zzso models of zzso
