To investigate Blood zzso Level zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso functional zzso zzso in patients with partial zzso 

We studied eight patients who had a diagnosis of partial zzso and active zzso on routine scalp zzso zzso Sessions of continuous zzso were recorded, and spikes zzso after online artifact zzso were used as events in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signal change in response to zzso zzso discharge were assessed and zzso zone zzso was zzso zzso 

Eight patients with partial zzso were recruited (6 zzso 2 zzso mean age zzso mean onset age range zzso Two who underwent zzso were excluded from further analysis: one due to absence of zzso zzso the other due to excessive head zzso Eight sessions of zzso scanning in 6 patients were zzso 6 with zzso and zzso one with zzso only, and one with zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso occurred in 7 sessions, 5 of which were zzso 

zzso activated areas detected by zzso in patients with partial zzso appear to be zzso with zzso areas as defined by zzso zzso zzso In most patients with focal zzso positive zzso responses seem to be mainly in zzso zones and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso to zzso seem less associated with zzso So zzso is a useful tool to study the zzso mechanisms of zzso and may assist in zzso evaluation of zzso
