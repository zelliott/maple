In normal viewing, the visual system effortlessly assigns approximately constant attributes of color and shape to perceived zzso A fundamental component of this process is the compensation for zzso variations and intervening media to recover zzso properties of natural zzso We exploited the phenomenon of transparency perception to explore the cortical regions implicated in such zzso using zzso By manipulating the zzso of local color differences around a region in an image, we zzso with their global zzso integration and thereby modified whether the region appeared transparent or zzso We found the major cortical zzso due to global integration of local color differences to be in the anterior part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by chromatic versus zzso geometric patterns showed no significant differential response related to the zzso of local color zzso The results link the integration of local color differences in the extraction of a transparent layer with sites activated by zzso properties of an zzso
