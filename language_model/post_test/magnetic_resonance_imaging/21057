zzso zzso and clinical evidence underscores the strong and rapid zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso system might thus provide a novel molecular strategy for zzso zzso Since zzso is the most abundant and major zzso neurotransmitter in the brain, zzso changes in zzso signaling are likely to affect zzso zzso information processing and large-scale changes in functional brain connectivity underlying certain symptoms of major depressive zzso Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso the zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as a bilateral zzso zzso prefrontal zzso region showing dramatically increased zzso functional connectivity with large portions of a cognitive control network zzso the default mode network zzso and a zzso affective network zzso zzso zzso and colleagues zzso proposed that reducing increased connectivity of the zzso might play a critical role in reducing depression zzso and thus represent a potential therapy target for affective zzso Here, using a randomized, zzso zzso crossover zzso challenge in healthy subjects we demonstrate that zzso decreases functional connectivity of the zzso to the zzso and to the zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso via its representative zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings in healthy subjects may serve as a model to zzso potential zzso that are addressed by successful treatment of major zzso This notion is further supported by the zzso overlap of our observation of zzso functional network zzso after 24 hours with the peak of efficacy following an intravenous zzso administration in zzso zzso
