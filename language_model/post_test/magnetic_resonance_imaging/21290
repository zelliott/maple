The effect of subject head movement on functional connectivity as measured by zzso zzso oxygen level zzso zzso was zzso movement mainly introduced increases in connectivity into the zzso The effect of movement on connectivity is an important consideration when comparing patients suffering from neurological conditions to healthy controls, since it is well known that patients affected by such conditions are prone to move more in the scanner than healthy zzso A method of motion correction zzso a dual echo zzso sequence is zzso The first echo is acquired soon after the slice zzso zzso zzso when zzso contrast is low and the MR signal is mainly sensitive to movement related effects, while the second echo is acquired at an echo time zzso zzso at which the MR signal is sensitive to both zzso and movement related zzso To correct for additional signal zzso introduced by subject movement, the second echo image is divided by the first echo image at each time point across the length of the zzso This procedure is easy to implement and requires no extra scan zzso This method proved superior to the standard means of correction zzso realignment parameters and their first order derivatives are used as zzso of no interest in a linear zzso zzso
