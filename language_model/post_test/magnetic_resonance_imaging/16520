zzso mapping the layout of cortical areas in humans is a continuing challenge for zzso We present a new method of mapping cortical areas based on zzso content as revealed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The method is zzso across different zzso scanners and pulse zzso We use the ratio of zzso image zzso to eliminate the zzso image intensity bias and enhance the contrast to noise ratio for zzso Data from each subject were mapped to the cortical surface and aligned across individuals using zzso zzso The spatial zzso of the group average zzso map provides an zzso measure of sharp transitions in zzso content across the zzso putative cortical zzso zzso We found excellent agreement between the zzso of the zzso maps and the zzso of published zzso zzso defined cortical areas that were registered to the same zzso zzso For other cortical regions, we used published anatomical and functional information to make putative identifications of dozens of cortical areas or candidate zzso In general, primary and early zzso association zzso are heavily zzso and higher, zzso association zzso are more lightly zzso but there are notable exceptions in the literature that are confirmed by our zzso The overall pattern in the zzso maps also has important correlations with the zzso onset of zzso white matter zzso evolutionary cortical zzso expansion in humans compared with zzso zzso cortical expansion in humans, and maps of zzso density in zzso zzso
