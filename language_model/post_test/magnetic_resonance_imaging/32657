Since the failure of a number of phase III trials of zzso in zzso stroke, the need for smaller phase II studies with zzso surrogates has zzso There is, however, little information available about sample size requirements for such phase II trials and rarely enough patients in single studies to make robust zzso We have formed an international collaborative group to assemble larger zzso and from these have generated sample size tables for zzso zzso expansion as the outcome zzso 

Twelve centers from Australia, Europe, and North America contributed data from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso expansion was defined from initial zzso images and later zzso inversion recover or zzso zzso Sample size estimates were calculated from data on zzso expansion ratios treated as zzso or continuous zzso A zzso approach was used because the distribution of zzso expansion was resistant to all forms of zzso 

As an example, a zzso absolute reduction in zzso expansion ratio zzso or zzso 1), zzso power, and alpha zzso zzso requires 99 patients in each zzso To achieve an equivalent effect size with a continuous approach requires 61 zzso 

These tables will be useful in planning phase II trials of therapy with the use of zzso outcome zzso For positive studies, biologically plausible surrogates such as these may provide a rationale for proceeding to phase III zzso
