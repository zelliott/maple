zzso congestion is an important symptom in many diseases of the upper zzso zzso congestion may also affect personal well-being and quality of zzso Furthermore, as the zzso zzso is the first part of the airways in contact with the environment, objective evaluation of zzso congestion or zzso zzso is zzso zzso evaluation of zzso zzso was described in the last part of the 19th century by zzso zzso of the pressure drop over the zzso cavity at a passive zzso has been described in 1903 by zzso and is one of first descriptions zzso The technique is still in use and computer technology has made the zzso much easier but the method has not yet been accepted for wide clinical zzso 

zzso methods have also been used for evaluation of zzso zzso A qualitative method was the zzso by zzso zzso where external zzso of the zzso side of the zzso cavity is experienced as a change in the timbre of the sound during zzso zzso reflections have been used in zzso investigations especially with regard to search for zzso The use of acoustic reflections from the airways gained special interest in zzso for determining the geometry of the vocal tract shape with regard to speech zzso A method described by zzso Jackson zzso was adopted and for the first time applied to the zzso zzso The method for determining the zzso area as function of distance in the airways by acoustic reflections is impulse or relatively zzso The incident sound zzso noise in the audible frequency range is compared with the response - the reflections from the zzso zzso if the size of the entrance to the airways is known, the size of the reflections may represent changes of the airway size and the time between reflections may give the distance between the changes, dependent on the speed of zzso In this way it is possible to determine the area as function of distance in the zzso The technique has some assumptions and the major effort has been to validate use in the nose and zzso aspects with regard to sound loss in the airways and zzso zzso the acoustic reflection technique - named acoustic zzso - was compared with other methods like zzso CT, and zzso zzso and zzso subjects were also zzso 

zzso zzso showed reasonable correlation with CT in a zzso and in 10 subjects in comparison with zzso for the first 6 zzso of the zzso zzso Models based on zzso zzso of subjects also showed good correlation for the first 6 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cavity and the zzso differences were found mainly due to zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Sound loss due to viscous loss or friction at increasing zzso ratio (the complex geometry in the zzso and loss due to zzso the zzso zzso were also zzso Neither these factors affected the zzso function zzso zzso zzso seems to reflect the zzso function in the nose reasonably zzso In allergic subjects acoustic zzso has been used to evaluate zzso More pronounced spontaneous variation in zzso zzso congestion was found in patients suffering from hay fever compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, a tendency to a more swollen zzso in the allergic subjects compared to the normal state, and increased sensitivity to zzso was zzso This and reduction in swelling of the zzso in allergic subjects during zzso steroid treatment out of the zzso season indicate an ongoing inflammatory process or hypersensitivity in allergic subjects out zzso the zzso zzso During zzso challenge the change in zzso cavity dimension as well as inflammation may affect zzso in hay fever zzso 

zzso zzso has not only been used to examine hay fever patients but in many different aspects of zzso Since the introduction of the acoustic reflection technique in the nose more than papers using the technique have been zzso Most of the papers find the technique valuable for evaluation of zzso zzso Fortunately, some critical papers have drawn attention to some practical aspects of the zzso Standard operating procedures, and zzso checks as well as training operators will enhance the accuracy and zzso of zzso 

A decade after its introduction acoustic zzso is a well-established method for evaluation of zzso zzso but further improvement can be obtained by continued validation and adjustments of the zzso
