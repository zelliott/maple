In zzso the French surgeon, Pierre Paul zzso described two patients who had lost the ability to speak after injury to the zzso inferior frontal zzso of the zzso Since that time, an infinite number of clinical and functional imaging studies have relied on this zzso relationship as their anchor for the zzso of speech zzso Clinical studies of zzso zzso often assume that the deficits in these patients are due entirely to dysfunction in zzso area, thereby zzso all aspects of the disorder to this one brain zzso Moreover, functional imaging studies often rely on zzso in zzso area as zzso that tasks have successfully tapped speech zzso Despite these strong zzso the range of locations ascribed to zzso area varies broadly across zzso In addition, recent findings with zzso patients have suggested that other regions also play a role in speech production, some of which are zzso to the area originally described by zzso on the lateral surface of the zzso Given the historical significance of zzso original patients and the increasing reliance on zzso area as a major speech zzso we thought it important to zzso these brains to determine the precise location of their zzso as well as other possible areas of zzso Here we describe the results of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the preserved brains of zzso two historic zzso We found that both patients' zzso extended significantly into zzso regions of the brain, in addition to the surface zzso observed by zzso zzso also indicate inconsistencies between the area originally identified by zzso and what is now called zzso area, a finding with significant ramifications for both zzso and functional zzso studies of this well-known brain zzso
