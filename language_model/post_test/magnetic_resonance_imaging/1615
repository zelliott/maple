To gain insight into zzso of adult zzso and to uncover inherent obstacles in vascular zzso growth factor zzso therapeutic zzso a transgenic system for conditional switching of zzso expression was zzso The system allows for a zzso induction of zzso specifically in the heart muscle or liver at any selected schedule, thereby zzso embryonic zzso due to zzso zzso of zzso Using this system, we demonstrate a progressive, unlimited zzso of the existing zzso In the absence of spatial cues, however, abnormal vascular trees were produced, a consequence of chaotic connections with the existing network and formation of zzso shaped zzso zzso zzso also caused a massive and highly disruptive zzso zzso premature zzso of the zzso stimulus led to zzso of most acquired vessels, thus challenging the utility of therapeutic approaches relying on short stimulus zzso A critical transition point was defined beyond which remodeled new vessels persisted for months after withdrawing zzso zzso a long-term improvement in organ zzso This novel genetic system thus highlights remaining problems in the zzso of zzso zzso
