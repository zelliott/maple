The aim of this prospective study was to compare the diagnostic value of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of distant zzso and second primary cancer zzso in patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 

A total of 103 patients were zzso All participants underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso The diagnostic capabilities of the two imaging zzso were compared using the area under the zzso zzso zzso and follow-up data were used as the reference zzso 

Of the 103 patients, 18 zzso were found to have either distant zzso or zzso A total of 21 sites were zzso On a zzso analysis, zzso zzso showed a trend toward a higher sensitivity than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The area under the curve zzso for zzso was also higher than for zzso although not significantly so zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso On a zzso analysis, the sensitivity of zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In terms of diagnostic zzso the zzso was higher for zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the regional zzso zzso zzso above the median value zzso zzso was significantly associated with the occurrence of distant zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed a consistent trend toward higher sensitivity and diagnostic capability than zzso zzso for the detection of distant zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso Our data also suggest that zzso assessed by zzso can provide additional information for the prediction of distant zzso
