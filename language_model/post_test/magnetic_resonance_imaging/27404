We mapped brain activity during zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging with simultaneous recording of zzso properties during slow zzso filling and zzso 

We evaluated 12 healthy female volunteers 20 to 68 years zzso Eight subjects could urinate while zzso zzso data were obtained on 6 of these zzso Brain activity was recorded continuously during zzso filling and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso made during the zzso phase were used for the final zzso 

Using group statistics we identified clusters of brain activity in the zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and inferior frontal zzso during zzso At the individual level we also observed zzso in the upper zzso region, zzso and zzso zzso In subjects unable to void brain zzso was documented in the frontal lobe and zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso or anterior zzso zzso In 5 subjects we identified a relevant pattern of brain activity during the terminal portion of the filling phase when the patient reported a strong desire to zzso 

This new protocol allows for the zzso of brain structures that are active during zzso Data suggest that additional validation studies are zzso Future studies will test modifications that include more detailed monitoring of zzso sensation, zzso subjects based on age and zzso and increasing the number of data points by adding subjects and the number of zzso recorded in a single zzso
