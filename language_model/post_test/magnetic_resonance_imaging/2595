The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the zzso compound zzso will zzso the increase in zzso zzso the development of zzso zzso and decrease the zzso volume after zzso zzso 

zzso adult cats were allocated to control zzso zzso 7) and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso middle cerebral artery zzso was performed under zzso zzso fluid zzso by zzso as well as zzso volume measurement by zzso zzso zzso section, with and without zzso agents, was used to determine the value of these potential zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

The control group showed an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso at 30 minutes and a peak zzso zzso in zzso zzso at 1 hour after middle cerebral artery zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso differences between control and zzso groups were seen in the rate of fall of the apparent diffusion zzso at both 1 and 5 zzso A close correlation was seen between the zzso and zzso apparent diffusion zzso maps and the zzso zzso There was a significantly smaller zzso in the zzso group zzso reduction in zzso size compared with the control zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso ranks very highly among the current zzso candidates for clinical trials, and its excellent safety record in both animals and phase II studies in conscious, moderate head injury patients suggests that it will be highly effective in human zzso zzso
