Fast zzso shot zzso imaging enables zzso scans to be acquired in a few zzso However, the diagnostic image quality is severely compromised by the appearance of zzso bands parallel to the frequency zzso zzso We show that the band structure arises from differences in the ability of the phase zzso zzso to spoil zzso zzso that build up between successive repetition zzso A theoretical understanding of the mechanisms involved leads to a comparison between various methods of zzso the unwanted echoes throughout the whole field of zzso zzso zzso whose zzso change zzso with phase zzso step number are treated in zzso The theory predicts that the zzso will rotate and zzso the band structure and these results are confirmed zzso The effect of the zzso at a given location along the zzso is equivalent to the effect on the entire field of view of an zzso phase shift applied to the zzso zzso An appropriate zzso phase shift scheme should therefore provide ideal zzso characteristics for zzso zzso
