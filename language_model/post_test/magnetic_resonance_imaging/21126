Certain motion patterns can cause even simple geometric shapes to be perceived as zzso Viewing such displays evokes strong zzso in zzso cortex, including areas in and near the zzso right) zzso superior zzso zzso zzso These brain regions are sensitive to socially relevant information, but the nature of the social information represented in zzso is zzso For example, previous studies have been unable to explore the perception of shifting intentions beyond zzso This is due in part to the ubiquitous use of complex displays that combine several types of social information, with little ability to control zzso visual zzso Here we address this challenge by manipulating zzso with zzso precision while holding cues to zzso zzso Human subjects were exposed to a zzso zzso display, in which one item (the zzso chased zzso but its goal zzso the zzso frequently switched among other zzso By contrasting this with three other control displays, we find that the zzso changing intentions gave rise to strong selective zzso in the right zzso compared with zzso a wolf that zzso with a single unchanging zzso zzso very similar patterns of motion (and motion zzso that are not perceived as zzso and zzso abrupt zzso and zzso of moving zzso These results demonstrate in an especially well controlled manner that right zzso is involved in social perception beyond physical properties such as motion energy and zzso More importantly, these results demonstrate for the first time that this region represents perceived intentions beyond zzso
