Twelve zzso zzso (3 zzso 3 zzso 6 with unilateral zzso were studied to assess the value of zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the evaluation of partial zzso zzso MR findings were correlated with findings of quantitative zzso zzso and zzso On zzso zzso images, the normal zzso kidney demonstrated good zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Five minutes after administration of zzso there was enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was no longer zzso Enhancement of the urine within the collecting system zzso was also zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated marked thinning of the zzso zzso and decreased signal intensity on zzso zzso and zzso images zzso less than zzso zzso in the zzso collecting system did not differ significantly from urine in controls except in the three animals with urinary tract infection zzso less than zzso Five minutes following injection of zzso there was enhancement of the zzso zzso in all zzso zzso was seen in three pigs and no zzso in zzso Thus, useful information can be obtained in partial zzso obstruction from both zzso and zzso MR images of the zzso
