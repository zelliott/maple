The study investigates the stability of zzso complex in presence of competing metallic zzso zzso zzso and zzso using batch experiments and zzso zzso High performance liquid zzso with zzso detection was used for simultaneous analysis of zzso zzso zzso and free zzso zzso in zzso It was shown that zzso has a strong affinity for zzso and could lead to a complete release of zzso zzso appeared also to compete strongly with zzso for zzso binding since up to zzso of zzso was zzso under iron excess zzso Finally, zinc had a lower influence on zzso zzso only zzso of zzso was released with addition of a zzso excess of zzso During zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso about zzso of zzso and no zzso was observed onto zzso
