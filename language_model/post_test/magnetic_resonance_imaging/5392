The objective of our study was to describe the zzso findings of zzso zzso of the breast and to correlate those findings with the zzso zzso 

From January 2005 to June 2010, MR images of 15 patients (age range, zzso years; mean age, 50 zzso with zzso confirmed zzso zzso of the breast were zzso evaluated according to zzso MR images were reviewed for the zzso enhancement type zzso vs zzso size, shape, margins, contrast enhancement, signal intensity, and zzso curve pattern on a dynamic zzso These MR features were correlated with the zzso zzso 

All 15 tumors were seen as a mass on zzso The median size of the masses was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the most common features were an oval or zzso shape zzso zzso and a circumscribed margin zzso zzso zzso enhancement with enhancing internal zzso was seen in seven masses zzso and rim enhancement was seen in six masses zzso A zzso rim on zzso images was seen in nine tumors zzso zzso zzso the zzso curve showed a rapid initial increase in enhancement and a zzso or plateau pattern on delayed phase imaging in all 15 zzso 

On zzso zzso zzso of the breast appeared as masses with an oval or zzso shape and circumscribed zzso zzso enhancement with or without enhancing internal zzso was frequently seen on contrast zzso
