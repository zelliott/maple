As a high-speed imaging technique based on zzso echoes zzso zzso zzso is insensitive to chemical shift artifacts and magnetic zzso zzso The achievable zzso ratio zzso is limited by the fact that high flip angles of the zzso zzso zzso cause a steep zzso of the zzso echo train and therefore degrade the zzso function of the resulting zzso The present work investigates the use of zzso phase zzso which zzso the flip angle constraint by reducing the number of necessary zzso zzso zzso zzso of the normal human brain at zzso T demonstrates that zzso versions either reduce the measurement time by almost a factor of two without sacrificing the zzso or increase the zzso by about zzso while keeping the measurement time zzso
