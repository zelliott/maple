zzso resonance imaging zzso has been used widely in the diagnosis of acute spinal zzso zzso The association between zzso findings and zzso changes, however, remains zzso Using a rabbit spinal zzso injury model, the authors compared the zzso and zzso abnormalities as they evolved over the first zzso zzso zzso in the gray matter, zzso as a zzso area on zzso views and high-intensity area on zzso views, observed immediately after injury, disappeared within the first zzso zzso appearing 6 hours after the initial injury and seen as a high-intensity zzso zzso image, became zzso 1 week later and gradually decreased zzso Also appearing 1 week later, were zzso changes in the gray matter, corresponding to low signals on zzso studies but high signals on zzso zzso zzso therefore helped differentiate zzso and zzso presumably irreversible zzso from the more zzso findings related to zzso
