Recent anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies show a striking zzso progressive loss of cortical gray matter zzso in patients with zzso schizophrenia zzso which appears greater than that seen for adult zzso However, the diagnostic specificity and the relationship of these changes to drug treatment and cognitive functioning remain zzso We performed a comparative prospective brain zzso study in patients with zzso and pediatric patients with transient psychosis with behavior problems zzso not otherwise zzso zzso considered zzso impaired zzso We hypothesized that cortical zzso loss would occur in patients with zzso but not in adolescents with zzso zzso 

zzso brain zzso was performed at baseline and follow-up in 19 patients in the zzso group zzso zzso age of zzso zzso zzso in 23 patients with zzso matched for age, sex, zzso score, and drug treatment zzso zzso age of zzso zzso zzso and 38 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex zzso zzso age of zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso follow-up was zzso zzso zzso Volumes of the zzso and total and regional zzso were obtained by using automated analysis, and percent change in volume across time was zzso zzso analyses of zzso with post hoc zzso zzso zzso Different comparisons were performed to examine group differences in the percent change in zzso across zzso 

The zzso group had significantly greater total, zzso zzso and zzso zzso loss than did the zzso or healthy control zzso analysis of zzso post hoc P values ranged zzso zzso The zzso and control groups did not differ significantly from each zzso 

The cortical zzso volume loss in zzso appears zzso zzso it was not seen in children and adolescents with zzso zzso Because both patient groups had similar early zzso patterns, cognitive zzso medications, and hospitalizations, this progressive loss appears to be intrinsic to zzso An ongoing zzso process and/or brain response specific to the illness could account for these zzso
