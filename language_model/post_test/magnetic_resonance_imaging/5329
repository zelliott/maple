To perform an in zzso evaluation comparing zzso zzso cartilage in patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso joint and healthy volunteers using quantitative zzso mapping at zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso of Grade II or lower and 9 healthy age matched volunteers were examined at a zzso T whole body MR scanner using a flexible zzso zzso In all investigated persons zzso included zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences for zzso diagnosis and location of anatomical site and quantitative zzso and zzso zzso Region of interest zzso analysis was performed for the cartilage layer above the zzso and for a zzso healthy graded cartilage zzso Mean zzso and zzso values were then statistically zzso 

The cartilage layer of healthy volunteers showed mean zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso of grade I and II zzso mean zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Therefore statistically significantly higher mean zzso and zzso values were found in patients suffering from zzso compared to healthy zzso 

zzso and zzso mapping can help assess the zzso composition of cartilage zzso zzso zzso
