We examined auditory cortical zzso in normal hearing subjects to spectral changes in continuous low and high frequency pure zzso 

zzso zzso were recorded to increments of frequency from continuous 250 or zzso zzso The magnitude of change was random and varied from zzso to 50% above the base zzso 

zzso consisted of zzso zzso and a slow negative wave zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnitude with frequency increments were significantly greater for low compared to high zzso zzso zzso were greater in the right than left zzso for both base zzso The zzso zzso to frequency changes between zzso and 50% was not significantly related to the magnitude of spectral zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by spectral change is more pronounced with low compared to high zzso 

These data provide zzso evidence that central processing of spectral changes in the zzso differs for low and high zzso Some of these differences may be related to both zzso and zzso coding at the auditory zzso Central representation of frequency change may be related to the different zzso windows of integration across zzso
