We employed the results of imaging zzso from pediatric patients who received successful zzso surgery to determine the accuracy of each imaging tool in identifying zzso zones in zzso 

All Engel class I pediatric patients who received zzso surgery between October 2003 and April 2008 were zzso Their pathology, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso results were compared for accuracy in locating the zzso zzso defined as zzso that resulted in seizure zzso after zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso showed zzso in zzso of zzso cases, all of which had precise zzso of zzso In zzso cases, zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso PET showed a zzso rate of zzso and zzso was zzso for zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso was only zzso zzso showed zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso cases, with zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Most zzso lobe cases had zzso zzso and cortical zzso was observed in zzso zzso 

zzso was invariably reliable in all zzso PET results were as reliable in zzso the zzso zzso area, while its efficacy was lower for zzso zzso zzso effectively localized zzso in zzso cases, but its efficacy was lower in zzso zzso In cases of conflicting zzso results, zzso with supplementary data from zzso helped to establish correct decisions in zzso zzso while zzso of zzso and zzso data is advised for zzso zzso
