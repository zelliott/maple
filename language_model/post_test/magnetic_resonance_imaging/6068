It has been suggested that zzso zzso may represent an inflammatory response to a dysfunctional zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether the status of the disc in the zzso joint, as depicted in magnetic resonance zzso images, is zzso of the presence of zzso joint zzso zzso 

The relationship between disc displacement and zzso zzso was analyzed in MR images of 154 zzso in 77 patients complaining for pain and/or dysfunction in the zzso area and referred from medical practitioners to specialist zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify the significant correlation between zzso of joint zzso and disc zzso 

zzso correlation zzso between disc displacement and joint zzso was zzso OR for all type of disc displacement was zzso and the odds that a joint had magnetic resonance imaging findings of zzso was greater for anterior disc displacement without zzso 

The status of the disc could represent a factor involved in the development of zzso joint zzso However, these findings suggest that disc displacement may not be regarded as the dominant factor in defining the occurrence of zzso zzso Certain local or systemic conditions other than the zzso relationship must be zzso
