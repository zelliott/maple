To zzso the major zzso and clinical features of zzso of the zzso vessels and evaluate the potential of imaging techniques on the basis of the findings reported in the literature over the last few zzso 

We evaluated 9 zzso (7 carotid zzso and 2 zzso zzso in 9 patients (5 women and 4 zzso age zzso zzso zzso who came to our attention between September 1999 and June zzso These were all zzso and zzso located in the cervical region and, in two patients, extended zzso The zzso features were assessed in each case by zzso zzso CT, MR or conventional zzso and correlated with clinical, therapeutic and distant progression zzso zzso US of the neck vessels was performed in 4 zzso CT zzso of neck and zzso vessels was performed in 4 patients using a zzso spiral scanner and a single contrast medium zzso injection, following zzso examination of the zzso MR zzso was performed in 6 patients after baseline examination using zzso and/or zzso zzso conventional zzso was performed in 7 zzso Clinical manifestations at onset were peripheral neurological zzso in 5 cases and central zzso zzso in the remaining 4 zzso All patients underwent medical therapy zzso or zzso The follow-up was done by zzso zzso MR and/or MR zzso follow-up conventional zzso at zzso months was also performed in 6 zzso Distant progression was assessed on the basis of the degree of vascular zzso and the residual signs and zzso 

zzso and zzso were diagnostic in all zzso In particular, diagnosis was obtained by zzso in 4 patients and by zzso in 3 zzso Conventional zzso yielded a diagnosis in 2 cases which had previously undergone zzso brain CT or MR without examination of neck vessels zzso zzso US revealed zzso wall and flow zzso in 2 cases, thus requiring further diagnostic zzso In patients with central neurological symptoms at onset the diagnosis was obtained within zzso hours, whereas in patients with initial peripheral neurological symptoms the time to diagnosis was significantly longer (up to 10 zzso due to the poor specificity of the clinical picture and/or failed detection of the warning zzso Medical treatment gave rise to no major zzso Overall, distant progression was good: 6 patients recovered completely and 3 had mild to moderate residual neurological zzso 

zzso of zzso vessels should always be considered as a probable cause of cerebral zzso in adults aged zzso years, particularly in the absence of vascular risk zzso Clinical assessment is fundamental for the diagnosis and zzso Currently, CT and MR imaging techniques providing similar information are reliable diagnostic tools that can rapidly and zzso clarify suspicious clinical zzso Nevertheless, zzso continues to have an important role in the overall evaluation of disease severity in view of the possible zzso or surgical treatment of zzso
