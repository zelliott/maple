zzso zzso include a broad range of anomalies, resulting from the incomplete formation and/or differentiation of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso represents the result of a lateral zzso of the zzso ducts with zzso zzso and it is almost always associated with zzso zzso We report a case of incidental discovery of this anomaly in a 12-year-old girl during a routine zzso zzso A right zzso zzso kidney had been detected in the prenatal and zzso period with no evidence of zzso zzso zzso ultrasound examinations performed regularly had never detected either right zzso tissue or the zzso anomaly before zzso zzso after zzso made zzso anomaly detection zzso zzso resonance imaging performed to evaluate the zzso zzso detected a zzso right zzso We review the present knowledge and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of this anomaly, and we emphasize the use of magnetic resonance imaging not only for the evaluation and zzso of zzso zzso but also for the detection of the persistence of zzso tissue missed with other zzso
