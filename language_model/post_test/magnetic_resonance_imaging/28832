To evaluate the use of magnetic resonance zzso imaging during manual positioning of the hip, or zzso MR imaging, in an zzso zzso to study zzso head zzso zzso zzso and zzso head zzso in zzso zzso 

In 12 children with advanced zzso disease, zzso MR imaging and conventional zzso were compared in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso head zzso Images of the hips in several positions were compared zzso and zzso 

MR zzso correlated well with zzso for overall zzso assessment of severity of disease zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with good zzso agreement zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso MR images demonstrated all cases of hinge abduction shown zzso However, MR imaging failed to depict one case of zzso head zzso MR imaging correlated well with zzso in the objective evaluation of joint fluid and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso MR imaging correlated poorly with zzso in the measurement of zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging with an zzso zzso was comparable to zzso for demonstration of zzso head zzso and zzso of the zzso surfaces of the zzso In the evaluation of zzso it performed less zzso
