The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in zzso volume zzso between zzso and normal controls and determine if zzso is associated with memory function in zzso Left and right zzso and zzso volumes zzso were manually measured and compared between two zzso 

The study consisted of 36 zzso zzso with zzso and 36 zzso and zzso controls zzso age zzso zzso All subjects underwent zzso zzso zzso recalled magnetic resonance imaging and took the Korean California zzso Learning Test and the zzso Complex Figure Test to assess verbal and visual zzso 

The mean zzso was not different between groups zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls, p zzso zzso zzso mean zzso were significantly smaller in zzso (left, zzso in zzso zzso zzso in controls, p zzso zzso right, zzso in zzso zzso zzso in controls, p zzso zzso zzso of zzso differences between groups remained after corrections were made for zzso age, and zzso In zzso bilateral zzso was positively correlated with mean sleep and zzso sleep zzso in Multiple Sleep zzso zzso Absolute memory scores were not different between groups and were not correlated with zzso in zzso 

zzso had smaller bilateral zzso compared to zzso zzso had a significant relationship with sleep and zzso sleep zzso This study provides supportive evidence of the functional and anatomical deficits in zzso zzso areas that are related to the severity of zzso
