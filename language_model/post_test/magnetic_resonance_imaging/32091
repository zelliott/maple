zzso zzso memory is a core deficit in schizophrenia patients, seen to a lesser extent in unaffected biological zzso zzso studies suggest zzso differences and zzso function in prefrontal and zzso regions in schizophrenia patients compared to zzso These deficits are also reflected in the small number of similar investigations in unaffected biological zzso However, it is unclear the extent to which dysfunction is genetically zzso or a feature of the established zzso 

zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to measure brain zzso in 68 biological relatives of schizophrenia patients (of whom 27 experienced transient or isolated psychotic zzso and 21 controls during verbal zzso and zzso 

During word zzso the high-risk group showed a greater response relative to controls in the right inferior frontal zzso During correct recognition zzso to correct zzso the high-risk group showed significantly greater response relative to controls in the right zzso When the high-risk group was split into those with zzso and without zzso psychotic symptoms, the increased response in the right inferior frontal zzso was only seen when the zzso were compared to zzso The greater zzso response was seen when both zzso groups were compared to zzso 

zzso increases in the right inferior frontal zzso and zzso in high-risk subjects compared to controls during a relatively zzso memory task are likely to represent compensation for genetically zzso zzso This is consistent with a zzso shift of the zzso zzso zzso model of cognitive function in zzso
