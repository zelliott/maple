The zzso of adjacent segment problems after zzso fusion has been found to vary, and risk factors for these problems have not been precisely verified, especially based on structural changes determined by magnetic resonance zzso The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to describe the zzso and clinical features of adjacent segment disease zzso after zzso fusion and to determine its risk zzso We assessed the zzso of zzso in patients who underwent zzso or zzso zzso for degenerative conditions between August 1995 and March 2006 with at least a zzso zzso Patients less than 35 years of age at the index spinal fusion, patients with zzso fusion, and patients who had not achieved successful union were zzso Of the zzso patients who underwent zzso 28 zzso needed secondary operations because of zzso and were included in this zzso In order to identify the risk factors, we matched a disease group and a control zzso The disease group consisted of 26 of the 28 patients with zzso excluding the 2 patients for whom we did not have initial zzso zzso Each patient in the disease group was matched by age, sex, fusion level and follow-up period with a control zzso The assumed risk factors included disc and facet zzso instability, zzso zzso zzso and disc zzso The mean age of the 28 patients with zzso requiring surgical treatment was zzso years, which did not differ significantly from that of the population in which zzso did not develop zzso years, p zzso zzso Of the 21 patients who underwent floating fusion, only 1 developed zzso zzso zzso zzso was a significant risk factor zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was much lower than that of zzso zzso zzso facet zzso may be associated with a high risk of adjacent segment problems following zzso fusion zzso
