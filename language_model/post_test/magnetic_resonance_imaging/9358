The grade of zzso differentiation is one of the most important zzso factors in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso and zzso PET reflect zzso features in patients with zzso zzso 

A total of 22 patients with zzso zzso and 9 with zzso zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso PET for zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso Regional values of zzso zzso were evaluated using standardized zzso value zzso and the zzso ratio of zzso to zzso The accuracy for predicting tumor aggressiveness defined as high-risk zzso zzso Federation of zzso and zzso zzso stage zzso zzso or zzso grade zzso zzso low-risk zzso zzso stage zzso zzso and grade 1), and zzso was compared for each PET zzso using zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of zzso findings for clinical staging was also zzso 

Although the zzso for zzso was significantly lower in zzso zzso than in zzso a significant difference between high-risk and low-risk zzso was observed only in zzso for zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly greater zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso than did low-risk zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly higher zzso ratio than zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, the most accurate diagnostic PET zzso for predicting high-risk and low-risk zzso was the zzso zzso The optimal zzso zzso value of zzso determined by zzso analysis, revealed zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was better than the zzso accuracy for zzso The zzso ratio of zzso yielded a correct diagnosis for zzso from zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso reduces zzso dependency with accelerated zzso metabolism as it zzso to a higher stage or zzso zzso and zzso PET studies provide a new index of the zzso ratio, which is considered the most zzso index reflecting tumor zzso This index will be useful for making zzso diagnoses and deciding the appropriate therapeutic strategy for patients with zzso zzso
