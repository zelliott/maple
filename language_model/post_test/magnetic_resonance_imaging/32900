The cornea has been a focus of animal zzso research for decades, but little is known regarding its cortical representation in the human zzso This study attempts to zzso the zzso representation of the cornea to painful stimuli in human primary zzso zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In this case study, a subject was zzso at zzso while bright light was presented in a zzso which either produced pain and blinking (during zzso or blinking alone (after recovery from zzso zzso and blinking produced precisely localized zzso in primary zzso zzso and primary motor zzso These results indicate that noxious stimulation of the cornea can produce zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso This finding opens future avenues of research to evaluate the relationship between zzso pain and central brain mechanisms relating to the development of chronic pain conditions, such as dry zzso zzso
