To study the zzso features of brain tumors occurring in patients with medically intractable zzso 

The clinical, zzso and zzso features of brain tumors occurring in 35 patients with intractable zzso encountered during the period from January, 2005 to April, 2008 in zzso Hospital were zzso zzso 

The mean age of seizure onset and duration of disease were zzso and zzso years, zzso zzso signals were observed in zzso of cases zzso by magnetic resonance zzso The zzso types of brain tumors included zzso zzso WHO grade I and zzso WHO grade zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso WHO grade zzso zzso zzso zzso WHO grade zzso diffuse zzso zzso WHO grade zzso zzso zzso WHO grade zzso zzso zzso zzso WHO grade I) and zzso zzso The 6 remaining cases showed features seen in between zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso Most of these tumors were located in the zzso lobe zzso and associated with focal cortical zzso zzso study showed a remarkable expression of zzso in zzso 

Brain tumors in patients with medically intractable zzso are almost always benign and located in the zzso zzso Most of them represent mixed zzso tumors and some show transitional features zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso The similar zzso pattern and biological behavior of zzso zzso and mixed zzso tumor may suggest a common zzso zzso
