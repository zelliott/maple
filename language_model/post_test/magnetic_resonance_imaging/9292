The zzso A1 zzso gene plays a critical role during development of the zzso in zzso Little is currently known about the relation between this gene and human brain zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been found to be associated with zzso and larger head circumference in zzso zzso Similar effects were revealed also in healthy children but not in adult zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the zzso zzso on the zzso structure of healthy zzso 

Healthy persons from two independent groups underwent zzso high resolution magnetic resonance zzso zzso Group A was made of 80 persons (27 G zzso carriers and 53 zzso and Group B of 72 zzso carriers and 46 zzso zzso zzso mapping 2 zzso were used to perform zzso analysis of the gray matter zzso of the zzso in carriers and zzso zzso threshold was set at zzso with small volume correction using a zzso zzso 

In Group A, G carriers exhibited decreased zzso volume in the superior zzso and anterior lobe of the zzso zzso In Group B, decreased zzso volume were found across the entire left zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may affect zzso development in zzso
