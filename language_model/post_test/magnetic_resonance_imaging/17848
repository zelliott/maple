zzso zzso zzso affects white matter, but zzso matter injuries have also been reported, particularly in the zzso nucleus and the zzso Both structures have been related to working memory zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare behavioral performances and zzso power zzso during a zzso working memory task zzso of toddlers with a history of zzso and healthy zzso 

A zzso comparative study of zzso was conducted in toddlers with a history of zzso and healthy zzso The task responses and the zzso zzso power zzso during a zzso were compared in both zzso The zzso absolute power was analyzed during the following three conditions: zzso attention and zzso zzso The number of correct responses was higher in the healthy group zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The healthy group had absolute power zzso increases zzso zzso zzso during zzso compared to the attention condition in the bilateral frontal and right zzso zzso and zzso regions in zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and in the right zzso zzso and zzso regions in zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso group had absolute power increases zzso zzso zzso in the bilateral zzso left central and zzso regions in zzso that ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and in the bilateral frontal and right zzso regions in zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso toddlers have zzso zzso deficits and a very different pattern of absolute power increases compared to a healthy group of zzso with greater absolute power in the low frequency range and widespread zzso networks in the zzso retention zzso
