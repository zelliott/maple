zzso liver reaction zzso appears on zzso images after zzso zzso body radiation therapy zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso and chronic liver zzso We investigated the threshold dose zzso of zzso and possible factors affecting the TD on zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

In 50 patients who were treated with zzso for small zzso and followed up by zzso for zzso months, zzso seen as a zzso area, was evaluated on the zzso phase of zzso zzso The follow-up zzso with the largest extent of zzso was fused to the planning zzso zzso zzso image, and patients with good image fusion zzso were zzso After zzso the border of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso was used to identify the TD for the zzso Clinical and zzso factors were analyzed for correlation with the zzso 

A total of 45 patients were eligible for analysis with a median image fusion zzso of zzso zzso zzso The median duration between zzso and subsequent zzso phase zzso with the largest extent of zzso was 3 months zzso zzso zzso The median TD for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso score and zzso count were significantly correlated with the zzso On multiple linear zzso analysis, zzso score was the only zzso that predicted zzso Median zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for patients with zzso and zzso disease, zzso 

The TD was significantly correlated with baseline liver zzso We propose 30 zzso for zzso disease and 25 zzso for zzso disease in 5 zzso as zzso for zzso after zzso for patients with zzso and chronic liver zzso Use of these zzso will help to predict potential loss of liver tissue after zzso
