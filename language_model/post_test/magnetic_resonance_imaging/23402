Special processes recruited during the recognition of personally familiar people have been assumed to reflect the rich episodic and semantic information that selectively represents each zzso However, the processes may also include person zzso ones, which may require interpretation in terms beyond the memory zzso To examine this possibility, we assessed decrease in differential zzso during the second presentation of an identical face zzso zzso as an index of person zzso During zzso pictures of personally familiar, famous, and unfamiliar faces were presented to healthy subjects who performed a familiarity zzso Each face was presented once in the first half of the experiment and again in the second zzso The right inferior zzso and left inferior frontal zzso were activated during the recognition of both types of familiar faces initially, and this zzso was suppressed with zzso Among zzso activated regions for personally familiar over famous faces, robust suppression in differential zzso was exhibited in the bilateral zzso and anterior zzso structures, left amygdala, and right zzso zzso all of which are known to process episodic and semantic zzso On the other hand, suppression was minimal in the zzso cingulate, zzso zzso right inferior zzso and zzso regions, some of which were implicated in social zzso and cognitive zzso Thus, the recognition of personally familiar people is characterized not only by zzso representation but also by zzso processes requiring a research framework beyond the memory zzso such as a social zzso zzso
