The present study investigated the functional reorganization of zzso and zzso auditory pathways in zzso zzso zzso reorganization was assessed using functional zzso zzso Imaging zzso and stimulation with complex sounds presented zzso and zzso For zzso intact control subjects, results showed that zzso zzso evoked balanced activity in both zzso while zzso zzso induced strong zzso activity and weak zzso zzso The results obtained from zzso subjects were substantially different from those obtained from control zzso Specifically, activity in the intact zzso showed a significant decrease in response to zzso stimulation but, zzso an increase in response to zzso zzso The present findings suggest that a substantial functional reorganization takes place in the auditory pathways following an early zzso The exact nature of this functional reorganization remains to be zzso
