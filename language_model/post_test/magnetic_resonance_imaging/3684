zzso zzso of the surgical field is one of the most critical challenges for minimally invasive surgery zzso Current zzso zzso systems are zzso However, they can hardly meet the requirements of high resolution and real time zzso zzso of the surgical scene to support the recognition of zzso structures for safe zzso zzso In this paper, we present a new approach for real time zzso zzso of organ zzso based on optical imaging patches with limited zzso and a single zzso scan of magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso zzso The idea for reconstruction is motivated by our empirical observation that the zzso harmonic zzso corresponding to distorted surfaces of a given organ lie in lower zzso zzso in a structured dictionary that can be learned from a set of representative training zzso We provide both theoretical and practical designs for achieving these zzso Specifically, we discuss details about the selection of limited optical views and the registration of partial optical images with a single zzso zzso zzso The design proposed in this paper is evaluated with both finite element modeling data and ex zzso zzso The ex zzso test is conducted on fresh zzso zzso using zzso zzso scans with zzso zzso resolution and a portable laser scanner with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso show that the proposed method achieves a zzso zzso spatial resolution in terms of zzso distance when using only one zzso zzso scan and the optical patch from the zzso view of the zzso The reconstruction frame rate is between 10 zzso and 39 zzso depending on the complexity of the test zzso
