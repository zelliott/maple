zzso human aging is accompanied by progressive brain tissue loss and cognitive zzso however, several factors are thought to influence brain zzso We applied zzso zzso to high-resolution brain zzso scans to determine whether educational level or physical activity was associated with brain tissue volumes in the elderly, particularly in regions susceptible to age-related zzso We mapped the zzso profile of brain volume differences in 226 healthy elderly subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Health zzso zzso zzso maps revealed the zzso profile of brain regions whose volumes were associated with educational level and physical activity (based on zzso energy zzso After controlling for age, sex, and physical activity, higher educational levels were associated with zzso greater tissue volumes, on average, in the zzso lobe gray zzso After controlling for age, sex, and education, greater physical activity was associated with zzso greater average tissue volumes in the white matter of the zzso zzso extending into the zzso zzso Body mass index zzso was highly correlated with both education and physical activity, so we examined zzso as a contributing factor by including physical activity, education, and zzso in the same zzso only zzso effects remained zzso This is one of the largest zzso studies of factors influencing structural brain aging, and zzso may be a key factor explaining the observed relationship between education, physical activity, and brain zzso Independent contributions to brain structure could not be teased apart as all these factors were highly correlated with one zzso
