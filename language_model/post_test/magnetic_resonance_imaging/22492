To investigate the usefulness of early and delayed zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso administration for the detection and characterization of focal zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso males and 14 zzso mean age zzso 61 zzso with a total of 113 zzso zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso were included in this study (15 with zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso 20 with zzso zzso (N zzso zzso five with zzso (N zzso 10), three with zzso zzso N zzso zzso and two with liver zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained before and after zzso administration, with a mean 18-hour delayed zzso A qualitative analysis (including the size and signal intensity zzso and quantitative analysis (including enhancement and zzso zzso ratio zzso were performed on zzso and zzso early and delayed MR zzso 

Compared to zzso early imaging, 17 zzso of 35 zzso showed higher zzso 16 zzso showed no zzso change, and two zzso showed lower zzso on delayed zzso All 63 zzso 10 zzso three zzso and two zzso showed no zzso zzso On delayed imaging, ring enhancement was noted in 53 zzso zzso three zzso zzso and one zzso zzso but was not seen in zzso or zzso Eight zzso zzso also showed ring enhancement on zzso early zzso No newly detected zzso zzso were revealed on zzso delayed MR images compared to zzso early zzso Regarding zzso the zzso showed a significant increase in zzso from zzso early to delayed images after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, none of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a significant increase of zzso from zzso early to delayed zzso 

zzso delayed MR images after zzso administration were helpful in distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso but were not useful for zzso detection and had limited utility for zzso zzso since benign and zzso zzso zzso looked the zzso
