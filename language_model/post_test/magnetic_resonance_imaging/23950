A zzso model of the brain is zzso using a zzso zzso zzso is given to the modeling of the zzso zzso induced by the growth of tumors and its application to the registration of anatomical zzso with images from patients presenting such zzso First, an estimate of the anatomy prior to the tumor growth is obtained through a simulated zzso contraction of the tumor zzso Then a zzso zzso registration to this estimated zzso anatomy is zzso Finally, the deformation from the zzso model is applied to the zzso registered atlas, producing an zzso that has been zzso to fully register to the patient zzso The process of tumor growth is simulated in a zzso zzso zzso which is driven by anatomical features such as boundaries of brain zzso The deformation of the surrounding tissue is estimated using a zzso elastic model of soft tissue under the boundary conditions imposed by the skull, zzso and the zzso and zzso A preliminary two-dimensional zzso zzso is presented in this paper, and tested on both simulated and patient zzso One of the long-term goals of this work is to use anatomical brain zzso to estimate the locations of important brain structures in the brain and to use these estimates in zzso and zzso planning zzso
