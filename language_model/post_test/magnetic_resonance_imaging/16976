Communication signals are important for social interactions and survival and are thought to receive specialized processing in the visual and auditory zzso Whereas the neural processing of faces by face clusters and face cells has been repeatedly studied zzso less is known about the neural representation of voice zzso Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies have localized zzso regions in the zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso but the zzso response cannot directly assess zzso zzso We investigated the responses of zzso in an zzso voice cluster in awake zzso and here we provide the first systematic evidence for voice zzso zzso zzso were identified, in zzso to zzso zzso as zzso responding at least zzso stronger to zzso voices than to zzso sounds or zzso zzso zzso whereas face clusters are thought to contain high proportions of face cells zzso responding broadly to many faces zzso 2, 4, 5, zzso we found that voice clusters contain moderate proportions of voice zzso Furthermore, individual voice cells exhibit high stimulus zzso The results reveal the zzso bases for zzso voice clusters in the zzso brain and highlight potential differences in how the auditory zzso systems generate selective representations of communication zzso
