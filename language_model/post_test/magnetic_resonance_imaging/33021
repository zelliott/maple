zzso zzso stem cells zzso hold great promise for the development of zzso therapies for cardiovascular zzso However, clinical translation will require zzso zzso and validation of zzso zzso zzso 

To successfully derive zzso cells from zzso zzso and demonstrate their potential utility for the treatment of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso cells zzso shared similar zzso and functional properties as zzso cells isolated from the zzso pig zzso To demonstrate their therapeutic potential, zzso were transplanted into mice with zzso zzso Compared with control, animals transplanted with zzso showed significant functional improvement measured by zzso zzso zzso at week zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso fraction at week zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiling showed that zzso released zzso and zzso factors in the zzso zzso which promoted zzso and zzso survival, zzso zzso of zzso factors varied significantly among zzso of transplanted cells, suggesting that transplantation of specific cell populations may result in greater functional zzso 

In zzso this is the first study to successfully differentiate zzso from zzso and demonstrate that transplantation of zzso improved cardiac function after zzso zzso via zzso zzso Further development of these large animal zzso models will yield significant insights into their therapeutic potential and accelerate the clinical translation of zzso zzso zzso
