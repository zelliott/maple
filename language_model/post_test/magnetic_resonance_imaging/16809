To compare the image quality and diagnostic performance of a contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging sequence performed by using an zzso contrast agent zzso zzso with those of a commonly used zzso zzso sequence performed by using an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso contrast agent in patients with zzso heart disease zzso 

The local ethics committee and the United Kingdom zzso and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved this zzso Patient informed consent was zzso zzso patients with zzso were examined by using a zzso MR imaging unit and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used in the same patient on consecutive zzso zzso wall zzso zzso ratios zzso image quality, and diagnostic performance achieved by using the zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso were compared with those achieved by using the zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and with those achieved at respective contrast zzso MR zzso zzso The zzso rank sum test was used to compare zzso zzso zzso tests were used to compare continuous zzso 

Use of the zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso significantly improved vessel wall zzso zzso and image quality zzso zzso zzso for all) for all investigated zzso and zzso structures compared with the zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the respective zzso MR zzso zzso With use of the zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso new, zzso diseases (five zzso of zzso were zzso while other diseases could be excluded (15 zzso of zzso Information available from zzso zzso zzso 23), conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or surgery zzso zzso 1) confirmed all zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso improved image quality and diagnostic performance, allowing a more accurate and complete assessment of cardiovascular anatomy in patients with zzso compared with zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and respective zzso MR zzso zzso
