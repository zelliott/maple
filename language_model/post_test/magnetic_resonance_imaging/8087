zzso comparison of zzso low back pain zzso symptoms and zzso findings on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

To investigate associations of frequency and intensity of zzso and zzso pain with zzso changes in a sample of middle-aged male workers with or without zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso changes are bone zzso zzso visible on zzso and are assumed to be associated with degenerative zzso disc zzso zzso of these so-called zzso changes with clinical symptoms are zzso Furthermore, most of these studies have been performed in selected series of zzso 

A total of zzso middle-aged male workers zzso train engineers and 69 sedentary zzso from northern Finland underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso of zzso zzso zzso were graded for type and extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze associations of pain variables with zzso zzso 

Train engineers had on the average higher zzso pain scores than the sedentary controls, but the prevalence of zzso changes was similar in both occupational zzso Altogether, 178 zzso changes in 128 subjects were recorded: zzso were type I, zzso type II, and zzso both types I and zzso Eighty percent of changes occurred at zzso or zzso zzso changes at zzso showed significant association with pain symptoms with increased frequency of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso episodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with higher zzso visual analog scores during the past week zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso and extensive zzso in particular were closely associated with zzso 

zzso changes at zzso and zzso type I zzso are more likely to be associated with pain symptoms than other types of zzso changes or changes located at other zzso zzso
