A technique for zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso aneurysm of the anterior inferior zzso artery zzso with the zzso arising from the dome of the aneurysm is zzso 

A middle-aged patient was referred for treatment of a zzso zzso aneurysm identified on a CT zzso performed for a zzso zzso which occurred 20 days prior to zzso A diagnostic zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso aneurysm at the zzso origin with the zzso arising from the dome of the aneurysm and also zzso the territory of the zzso inferior zzso zzso The therapeutic procedure involved zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso left in zzso Another zzso was maneuvered into the larger dome of the zzso A zzso was then deployed in the zzso artery, jailing the previous zzso in the zzso zzso zzso detachable coils were deployed in the aneurysm resulting in complete zzso of the aneurysm with preservation of the zzso 

It is important to preserve a normal branch arising from the dome of an aneurysm although it is technically demanding and a relative zzso This case report describes a technique of zzso a zzso aneurysm with a vital branch arising from the dome, with preservation of the branch and complete zzso of the aneurysm using two zzso and a zzso This expands the repertoire of zzso treatment of complex zzso
