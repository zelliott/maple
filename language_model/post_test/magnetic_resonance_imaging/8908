zzso the underlying neural pathways that govern the highly complex zzso action of swallowing is considered crucial in the process of correctly identifying and treating swallowing zzso The aim of the present investigation was to identify the neural zzso of the different components of zzso in healthy young adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Ten right-handed young healthy individuals were scanned in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Participants were visually cued for both a zzso task and for zzso tasks zzso to zzso zzso your zzso and zzso your zzso in a zzso order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methodology was used to address zzso zzso Areas activated during each of the three component tasks enabled a partial differentiation of the neural zzso for various components of the zzso Areas that were more activated during throat clearing than other components included the zzso zzso and small portions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Tongue tapping showed higher zzso in portions of the primary zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Planning did not show any areas that were more activated than in the other component zzso When swallowing was compared with all other tasks, there was significantly more zzso in the zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and all areas of the primary zzso zzso zzso
