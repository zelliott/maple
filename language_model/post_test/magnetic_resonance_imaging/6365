In zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso were obtained by the surface zzso method from rat zzso human glioblastoma, and human zzso zzso zzso in CD Fisher rats and zzso and the effects of chemotherapy, zzso therapy, and zzso zzso as well as zzso were evaluated by zzso observing spectral zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were high and the zzso peak was low compared to those of normal zzso When the zzso agents were given and were effective, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased remarkably within several hours after the zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso were also obtained in some zzso zzso regions was detected by the zzso as image changes which appeared later than those detected by zzso It proved practical to monitor the effect of therapy by employing either zzso or zzso However, the image changes which demonstrated the effect of the therapy used closely resembled those changes which occurred with the onset of necrosis in zzso tissue during zzso zzso Several problems for future application of these techniques to human brain zzso are also zzso
