To compare the performance of zzso zzso electromagnetic zzso and zzso volume coils at zzso under the same geometric zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso coils are modeled with the same zzso The finite difference time domain zzso method is adopted to calculate the electromagnetic fields of the zzso Further, zzso field, specific zzso rate zzso and zzso ratio zzso are calculated for these zzso 

In the unloaded case, within the central zzso plane, the variation of zzso field magnitude over zzso distance is about zzso for the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and 38% for the zzso zzso In the loaded case, the percentages of the samples on the central zzso plane, which have zzso field magnitude within zzso of the average zzso field zzso are about 57% for the zzso zzso for the zzso and 59% for the zzso zzso Average zzso levels are zzso and zzso higher in the zzso than those in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The average relative zzso on the central zzso plane for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coils are 1, zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso has the best unloaded zzso field zzso and the zzso zzso has the best loaded zzso field zzso and the lowest radiation zzso while the zzso zzso is better in zzso and zzso at zzso than the zzso and zzso zzso
