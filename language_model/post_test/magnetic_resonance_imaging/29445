zzso zzso zzso forms part of the acute zzso syndrome presenting zzso and zzso patterns different from those of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the mortality and zzso factors of zzso in the first 3 months of zzso 

zzso consecutive patients diagnosed of zzso (12 type A, 56 type zzso were zzso zzso Ten patients zzso type A, two type zzso were surgically treated for clinical or zzso zzso zzso rate was zzso (six type A and seven type zzso five surgically treated (three type A, two type zzso and eight medically treated (three type A, five type zzso No relationship was observed between clinical variables and zzso zzso zzso diameter was greater in the group of patients who died zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso rate in patients with zzso diameter zzso zzso was 50% zzso zzso zzso bleeding was zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed only a significant relationship between mortality and maximum zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso and ascending zzso involvement zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mortality in the first 3 months of evolution is high zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso and ascending zzso involvement are zzso of early zzso
