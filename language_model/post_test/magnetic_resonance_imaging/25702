zzso MR imaging frequently shows disease activity zzso silent new brain zzso in zzso of patients with multiple sclerosis and therefore is valuable in monitoring the effects of zzso Monitoring of disease activity in patients being treated for zzso multiple sclerosis will increase in importance as new and safe therapies are zzso We studied sequential enhanced MR images of patients with early zzso multiple sclerosis to define the MR features that indicate disease activity in this zzso of patients and to compare MR imaging and clinical findings for this zzso 

Seven patients with zzso zzso multiple sclerosis were examined monthly for 4-12 zzso For each image, a standard repositioning protocol consisting of three images was used to ensure zzso of zzso zzso zzso image planes, planned according to internal zzso A total of 58 zzso zzso and enhanced zzso MR images were zzso 

MR images showed new enhancing zzso in six of the seven zzso On 25 zzso of the 58 enhanced zzso MR images, a total of 50 new enhancing zzso were observed, and on one image a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso images showed corresponding abnormalities for zzso of the new enhancing zzso At zzso most zzso zzso were enhanced on only one zzso zzso were enhanced on more than two consecutive monthly MR zzso zzso percent of the zzso seen on zzso images zzso zzso the resolution of the imaging zzso after a mean follow-up of zzso months, especially zzso that were initially smaller than 5 zzso During the study, only five clinical relapses occurred in three patients (all at times when MR images showed zzso zzso and fixed disability did not zzso On 21 additional occasions, MR images showed new enhancing or zzso zzso in patients who were clinically stable at the time zzso times more clinically silent disease zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso MR imaging is more sensitive than clinical monitoring for detecting new disease activity in patients with zzso multiple sclerosis and that MR imaging might be useful in the evaluation of therapeutic zzso
