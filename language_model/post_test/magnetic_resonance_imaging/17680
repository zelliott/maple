For late zzso enhancement zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso assessment of zzso zzso to guide management and targeting of zzso in zzso zzso zzso an objective, zzso method of identifying zzso zzso is zzso 

To describe an automated method for zzso zzso of zzso that zzso with zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso 

zzso zzso imaging was performed at 2 centers, before and 3 months after pulmonary vein isolation for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A left zzso zzso surface zzso map was constructed by using automated software, expressing intensity as multiples of standard zzso zzso above blood pool zzso zzso patients underwent zzso zzso mapping at the time of pulmonary vein isolation (11 were redo zzso zzso maps and zzso maps were zzso registered to the same magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso levels of 3, 4, and zzso above blood pool mean were associated with progressively lower bipolar zzso compared to the preceding enhancement level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso The proportion of zzso surface area classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso above blood pool zzso on zzso scans was greater in patients with zzso zzso recurrence than those without recurrence zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The LA volume zzso zzso was associated with a significantly greater proportion of LA zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

LA zzso zzso automatically by a simple objective method zzso with zzso zzso zzso Greater zzso zzso is associated with LA zzso and zzso zzso
