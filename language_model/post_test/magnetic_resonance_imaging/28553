zzso zzso magnetic resonance images of zzso zzso zzso have shown zzso and zzso regions in areas of injured zzso The precise mechanisms that lead to these altered enhancement patterns are zzso This study was designed to evaluate possible mechanisms and to relate altered enhancement patterns to zzso zzso and zzso 

Thirteen rabbits underwent in zzso coronary artery zzso and zzso followed by isolated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired continuously during step changes in zzso zzso zzso Regional blood flow was also measured by use of radioactive zzso in all zzso There were marked differences in zzso zzso and zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso minutes, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso minutes, P zzso zzso in normal, zzso zzso and zzso core regions, respectively, resulting in differential enhancement of these zzso zzso flows in the zzso rim and core were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso and correlated well with zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso - zzso P zzso zzso suggesting that these time zzso index the severity of zzso zzso In addition, spatial maps of zzso time zzso were zzso The extent of regions with abnormal time zzso correlated well with zzso zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso y zzso zzso + zzso P zzso zzso 

In zzso magnetic resonance images of zzso zzso rabbit zzso differential image intensity is primarily due to regional differences in contrast agent zzso and zzso time zzso These regional differences in time zzso also indicate the extent and severity of zzso zzso
