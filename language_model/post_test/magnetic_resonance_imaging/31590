To assess the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso benign from zzso breast masses and subsequently to test if specificity could be further improved by scoring of the overall zzso breast zzso 

zzso patients were zzso enrolled in the study and underwent zzso zzso breast zzso MR images were evaluated and classified according to the zzso zzso lexicon zzso zzso size, number of zzso and zzso in the breast were systematically zzso zzso intensity projections zzso were obtained by using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Breast zzso was scored according to the methods from zzso et zzso by measuring the number, diameter, and length of the vessels on the zzso The score ranged from 0 zzso absent or low breast zzso to 3 zzso high breast zzso 

Final analysis of 56 zzso revealed 25 zzso zzso zzso and 31 zzso benign zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso revealed cancer in none zzso of the zzso II zzso in 1 zzso of the zzso III zzso in 5 zzso of the zzso IV zzso and in 19 zzso of the zzso V zzso Based on zzso and kinetic data analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of zzso breast zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for the breast zzso score, specificity significantly zzso zzso zzso increased to zzso zzso without affecting zzso 

zzso accuracy of zzso zzso breast zzso increased significantly when the zzso score was added to the standard zzso and kinetic data analysis, resulting in a specificity of zzso without affecting sensitivity, which remained zzso
