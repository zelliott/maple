Compared to high-impact exercises, zzso impacts from zzso directions have similar ability to thicken vulnerable cortical regions of the zzso zzso Since zzso exercises are mechanically less demanding to the body, this type of exercise can provide a reasonable basis for devising zzso targeted bone training against hip zzso 

Regional cortical thinning at the zzso neck is associated with hip zzso Here, we investigated whether exercises involving zzso impacts, zzso impacts from odd directions, zzso muscle forces, zzso impacts at high repetition rate, or zzso muscle forces at high repetition rate were associated with thicker zzso neck zzso 

Using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned the zzso zzso of 91 female athletes, representing the zzso five zzso and 20 zzso zzso thickness at the inferior, zzso superior, and zzso regions of the zzso neck was zzso zzso differences were analyzed with zzso 

For the inferior cortical zzso only the high-impact group differed significantly zzso zzso p zzso zzso from the reference group, while for the anterior cortex, both the high-impact and zzso groups differed zzso zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso Also, the zzso zzso was approximately zzso thicker zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso in these two zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso similar to high-impact zzso with approximately zzso thicker zzso around the zzso zzso Since zzso exercises are mechanically less demanding to the body than high-impact exercises, it is argued that this type of bone training would offer a feasible basis for targeted zzso prevention of hip zzso
