Cell sheet technology has been widely employed for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso but cell sheet fabrication generally requires the use of zzso zzso Here we developed a method for the preparation of zzso stem cell zzso sheet that zzso the need of zzso zzso This method only required the seeding of rabbit zzso onto zzso plates at an appropriate cell density and culture in appropriate zzso and the cells were able to develop into zzso sheet in 2 zzso The zzso sheet allowed for zzso with the hybrid zzso at efficiencies zzso zzso robust and prolonged zzso zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso The zzso sheet was easily detached by brief (10 zzso zzso and saline zzso while retaining the zzso zzso and desired physical zzso The zzso sheet formation and zzso expression promoted cell survival under zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sheet to rabbit zzso models reduced the zzso size and improved cardiac functions to zzso levels, as judged from the left zzso ejection zzso zzso The zzso zzso sheet also effectively prevented zzso wall zzso suppressed zzso zzso and enhanced blood vessel zzso These data implicated the potential of this method for the preparation of genetically engineered zzso sheet and future zzso zzso
