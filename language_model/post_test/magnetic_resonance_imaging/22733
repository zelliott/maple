zzso modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso has the potential to expand the amount of information extracted and to enhance our understanding of brain systems by predicting brain states, rather than emphasizing the standard spatial zzso Based on the block zzso of zzso Imaging Analysis Contest zzso zzso 3, we demonstrate the potential and pitfalls of zzso modeling in zzso analysis by investigating the performance of five models zzso zzso analysis, zzso regression, linear support zzso machine, zzso zzso zzso and a zzso as a function of zzso steps and feature selection zzso We found that: zzso independent of the model, zzso zzso and feature selection assisted in building a more accurate zzso zzso zzso the linear support zzso machine and zzso zzso often performed better than either of the zzso zzso zzso models in terms of the optimal prediction zzso and zzso the optimal prediction accuracy obtained in a feature space using principal components was typically lower than that obtained in a zzso space, given the same model and same zzso We show that due to the existence of artifacts from different sources, high prediction accuracy alone does not guarantee that a zzso is learning a pattern of brain activity that might be zzso zzso although zzso methods do provide fairly unbiased estimates of true prediction zzso The zzso between the prediction accuracy and the zzso of the spatial pattern should be carefully considered in zzso modeling of zzso We suggest that unless the experimental goal is zzso zzso of new scans on zzso spatial features, prediction alone should not be used as an zzso procedure in zzso data zzso
