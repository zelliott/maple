zzso and bipolar disorder share aspects of zzso and zzso and thus may represent a zzso of zzso Few studies have compared connectivity across the brain in these disorders or investigated their functional zzso 

We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate global and regional connectivity in 32 healthy controls, 19 patients with bipolar disorder, and 18 schizophrenia zzso Patients also received comprehensive zzso and clinical zzso We zzso correlation zzso among zzso regions of interest within the brain, with the primary dependent measure being overall global connectivity strength of each region with every other zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower global connectivity compared with healthy controls, whereas patients with bipolar disorder had global connectivity intermediate to and significantly different from those of patients with schizophrenia and healthy zzso Post hoc analyses revealed that compared with healthy controls, both patient groups had significantly lower connectivity in the zzso zzso and right zzso Patients with schizophrenia also had significantly lower connectivity in the zzso zzso zzso cortex, left zzso nucleus, and left zzso compared with healthy zzso There were no significant differences among the patient groups in any of these zzso Lower global connectivity among all patients was associated with worse zzso and clinical zzso but these effects were not specific to any patient zzso 

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may represent a zzso of global zzso in the brain but that regional functional specificity may not be zzso
