In this study, we introduced a zzso zzso method to establish anatomical correspondence of white matter fiber tracts across subjects and applied this method to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion along the zzso tract zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients without visible brain zzso In this approach, the part of the zzso between the lowest slice of the cerebral zzso and the uppermost slice of the lateral zzso was reconstructed to establish the anatomical correspondence across subjects using diffusion zzso zzso Then it was zzso by zzso its length and dividing equally the zzso length into a certain number of zzso so that the zzso of each segment across subjects along the zzso was zzso zzso diffusion zzso including zzso averaged zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were obtained from each zzso Thus, the distribution maps of these zzso along the zzso were zzso The distribution maps of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso patients were significantly different from those of healthy controls, especially in the lower part of the zzso The differences may be caused by secondary zzso to zzso in the spinal zzso In conclusion, a zzso zzso method is proposed to establish anatomical correspondence for the zzso Compared with existed methods, a major merit of our method is to provide zzso across subjects along the zzso on the basis of diffusion zzso zzso and to make it possible for the quantitative analysis along the fiber zzso This method can also be used to zzso analyze other white matter fiber tracts between two zzso zzso landmarks in many neurological or psychiatric zzso
