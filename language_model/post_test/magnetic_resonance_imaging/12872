The goals were to identify and to zzso causes and growth patterns of acquired (or zzso zzso and to look for hypothesized correlations between causes, growth patterns, and zzso zzso 

Fifty-one children (24 zzso zzso to zzso years of age, with early zzso circumference zzso above and later ones below the second zzso zzso zzso were studied through retrospective note and growth chart review, with formal assessments of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso into 5 groups as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Four patterns of head growth were identified, as zzso type A, initial decrease from the normal range to below the second zzso followed by growth below and parallel to the second zzso type B, continued decrease away from the second zzso type C, decrease below the normal range, with partial later zzso type D, insufficient zzso For 12 children, there were accompanying decreases in weight zzso and for 5 of these in height zzso as zzso zzso with lower head circumference zzso scores at the end of the study also had lower zzso scores for final weight and final zzso There was no correlation between zzso group and growth zzso zzso zzso values were mostly zzso and did not correlate with head circumference zzso score, cause, or zzso 

The zzso of zzso groups and growth patterns should aid clinical zzso Neither cause nor pattern predicted zzso The associations with poor weight gain and body growth deserve further zzso
