The neural basis of motor response zzso has drawn considerable attention in recent imaging zzso Many studies have used the zzso or stop signal task to examine the neural processes underlying motor response zzso In particular, showing greater activity during zzso zzso compared with go trials and during stop success compared with stop error trials, the right inferior prefrontal zzso (IFC) has been suggested by numerous studies as the cortical area zzso response zzso Many of these same studies as well as others have also implicated the zzso motor area zzso in this process, in zzso with a function of the zzso prefrontal zzso in zzso zzso Here we used connectivity analyses to delineate the roles of IFC and zzso during stop signal zzso Specifically, we hypothesized that, as an integral part of the zzso attention system, the IFC responds to a stop signal and zzso the stop process in the zzso the primary site of motor response zzso This hypothesis predicted that zzso and primary motor zzso would show functional interconnectivity via the zzso zzso zzso to mediate response execution or zzso whereas the IFC would influence the zzso zzso zzso via connectivity with zzso The results of zzso causality analyses in 57 participants confirmed this zzso Furthermore, zzso interaction showed that, compared with stop zzso stop successes evoked greater effective connectivity between the IFC and zzso providing additional support for this zzso These new findings provided evidence critically zzso the roles of IFC and zzso during stop signal zzso and have important implications for our understanding of the component processes of zzso zzso
