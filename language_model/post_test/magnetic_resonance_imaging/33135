zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso soluble factors that stimulate the surrounding zzso Such zzso effects might zzso the potential benefits of many stem cell zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso are able to enhance intrinsic cellular plasticity in the adult rat zzso 

zzso bone zzso zzso were labeled with very small zzso iron oxide particles zzso which allowed for zzso graft zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso Moreover, zzso were zzso with zzso zzso to express the green fluorescent protein zzso The effects of bilateral zzso transplantation on zzso cellular plasticity were assessed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso testing was performed to examine the consequences of zzso zzso transplantation on zzso learning and memory, and zzso and zzso zzso 

We found that zzso transplantation of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso despite short-term graft zzso In contrast, systemic administration of the selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso increased cell survival but did not affect cell zzso zzso transplantation of zzso did not impair behavioral functions in rats, but only zzso exerted zzso zzso 

This is the first study to examine the effects of zzso transplantation of zzso zzso on zzso structural plasticity and behavioral functions in rats combined with zzso cell tracking by zzso We found that iron oxide zzso can be used to detect transplanted zzso in the zzso Although graft survival was short, zzso transplantation of zzso resulted in long-term changes in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso can be used to stimulate adult zzso
