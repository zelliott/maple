We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the neural zzso of basic zzso zzso zzso In a simple reaction time task, subjects responded to zzso left and right light flashes with zzso left and right hand zzso Typically, reaction times are faster for zzso responses zzso is, visual stimulus and response hand on the same zzso than for crossed responses zzso is, visual stimulus and response hand on opposite zzso The zzso difference between crossed and zzso responses is called zzso difference zzso and it is typically taken to represent a behavioral estimate of zzso transfer zzso The zzso results obtained in normal right-handers show that the crossed conditions yielded greater activity, compared to the zzso conditions, in bilateral zzso bilateral zzso zzso and right superior zzso zzso These results suggest that multiple transfers between the zzso occur in parallel at the functional levels of zzso integration zzso zzso decision-making zzso and preparation of motor response zzso To test the behavioral significance of these multiple zzso we correlated the individual zzso with the difference in signal intensity between crossed and zzso responses in the zzso zzso zzso and right superior zzso activated zzso The analyses demonstrated a strong correlation between the zzso and signal intensity difference between crossed and zzso responses in the right superior zzso zzso These data suggest a critical role of the superior zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
