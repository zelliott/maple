zzso flow was studied in zzso realistic models of a normal and a moderately zzso zzso diameter zzso human carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso were made using magnetic resonance imaging, from which wall zzso stress zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso in the inflow and zzso regions were also used as boundary conditions for a zzso fluid dynamics zzso zzso Experimental flow patterns and derived zzso zzso were compared zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso In the zzso zzso flow in the bulb region of the zzso carotid zzso was concentrated along the outer wall, with a region of low and zzso flow near the inner zzso In the normal zzso the converse was found, with a low flow region near the outer wall of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso index were also markedly different for the two zzso
