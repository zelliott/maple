zzso field monitoring with zzso zzso has recently been introduced as a means of measuring the actual zzso magnetic field evolution during individual MR zzso zzso zzso zzso as used thus far for this purpose impose significant practical limitations due to zzso zzso interference with the actual MR zzso In this work these limitations are overcome with a zzso zzso monitoring system based on zzso zzso zzso The proposed system is largely autonomous and protected against zzso zzso As a consequence the field zzso can be positioned freely and permit monitoring imaging procedures of arbitrary geometry and zzso The zzso approach is also exploited to simplify probe manufacturing and remove constraints on material zzso zzso zzso permits monitoring imaging scans with nominal resolutions on the order of 400 zzso The added capabilities of the new zzso and system are demonstrated by first in zzso results, obtained with monitored zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso
