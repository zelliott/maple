zzso resonance imaging zzso is very useful zzso to zzso a three-dimensional zzso real structure inside the sample without physical zzso The spatial resolution of the readily available zzso zzso is, however, limited by a few ten to hundreds of zzso due to a technological boundary of generating larger magnetic field zzso and to the zzso inherent to the zzso signal zzso zzso resonance force zzso zzso is new alternative zzso zzso which is anticipated to significantly surpass the conventional zzso in both resolution and zzso We report two imaging experiments on our zzso zzso operated at room temperature and in vacuum approximately zzso One is for approximately 20 zzso zzso membrane labeled entirely by a zzso imaging agent and the other for approximately 15 zzso zzso zzso both are nearly the same size as that of human zzso The reconstructed images at spatial resolution approximately 1 zzso were in satisfactory agreement with the scanning electron microscope zzso The potential capability of visualizing intrinsic zzso in the cell is suggested to investigate zzso process from a microscopic point of zzso
