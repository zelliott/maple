zzso zzso zzso of the zzso duct zzso is known as a zzso zzso of invasive zzso The purpose of this study was for zzso correlation of zzso features of zzso and to correlate the zzso with biological behavior in regard to the zzso duct wall zzso 

A pathologist classified gross zzso of 75 cases (44 men and 31 women, age range, zzso of zzso proven zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were zzso reviewed by two observers independently and classified the gross appearance of zzso tumors into the four zzso 

The pathologist classified zzso appearances of 75 cases of zzso into zzso type in 26, zzso zzso growth in 17, zzso growth in 21, and zzso type in zzso Two observers classified image findings in accordance with zzso zzso in 58 and 57 zzso and zzso among the 75 cases of zzso zzso 18 and 19 of 26 cases of zzso type, 14 and 14 of 17 cases of zzso growth type, 16 and 19 of 21 cases of zzso type, 10 and 5 of 11 cases of zzso type, zzso zzso agreement for zzso of tumor zzso was in the category of good agreement zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso zzso and tendency to invasive zzso 

zzso can be classified zzso into zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso type, but there is no correlation between the types and tendency to invasive zzso
