The human brain possesses a remarkable capacity to interpret and recall novel sounds as spoken zzso These linguistic abilities arise from complex processing spanning a widely distributed cortical network and are characterized by marked individual zzso Recently, graph theoretical analysis has facilitated the exploration of how such aspects of large-scale brain functional organization may zzso cognitive zzso Brain functional networks are known to possess zzso zzso characterized by efficient global and local information transfer, but whether these properties relate to language learning abilities remains zzso Here we applied graph theory to construct large-scale cortical functional networks from cerebral zzso zzso responses acquired during an auditory pitch discrimination task and found that such network properties were associated with zzso future success in learning words of an artificial spoken zzso zzso learners possessed networks with reduced local efficiency but increased global efficiency relative to less successful learners and had a more zzso network zzso zzso successful and less successful learners exhibited differences in these network properties spanning bilateral zzso zzso and right zzso cortex, overlapping a core network of auditory language zzso These results suggest that efficient cortical network organization is associated with zzso learning abilities among healthy, younger zzso
