Over a 12-month period, 28 zzso patients in respiratory failure were supported with zzso membrane zzso zzso and 11 of these underwent successful repair of the right carotid artery zzso Nine of 11 were studied with duplex zzso zzso imaging between 14 and 109 days of age and again at 1 year of zzso A zzso ratio zzso of the peak zzso zzso above the level of the zzso to the peak zzso zzso below the zzso was measured to assess the degree of zzso if any, at the repair zzso zzso flow through the carotid was detected zzso in 8 of 9 zzso and zzso and retrograde flow was documented in 1 zzso zzso ratios ranged from zzso to zzso zzso ratio of 1 is zzso zzso indicates at least a 50% obstruction to zzso Four of 9 patients had ratios greater than zzso and 8 of 9 exhibited some evidence of zzso zzso scans were performed on 8 of 9 infants between 12 and 18 months of zzso All infants examined showed marked improvement in zzso ratio and zzso of the vessel, documenting that initial narrowing of the vessel is zzso No infant had evidence of zzso phenomena to the right side of the brain by magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the common carotid artery zzso is technically feasible without increasing the risk of brain zzso
