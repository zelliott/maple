Identification of high-risk zzso zzso prone to zzso and zzso may greatly decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has recently emerged as one of the most promising techniques for the zzso study of zzso disease, as it can characterize plaque composition and monitor its zzso The development of zzso contrast agents that specifically target components of the zzso plaque may enable zzso detection of high-risk zzso This review discusses the use of high-resolution zzso for plaque detection and characterization and the zzso of zzso zzso using a variety of molecules present in zzso plaques that may serve as targets for specific contrast agents to allow the identification of high-risk zzso zzso zzso Ultimately, such agents may enable treatment of zzso patients prior to zzso progression and occurrence of zzso
