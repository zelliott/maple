The present study examined the zzso of the central nervous system in patients with zzso syndrome zzso related to mechanical zzso The goals were to differentiate between increased pain ratings and zzso related either to peripheral or to central zzso and to correlate with cerebral zzso zzso zzso patients and 17 healthy controls were zzso placing an experimental incision in the right zzso zzso and causing zzso zzso Experimental pain, primary and secondary zzso were assessed during the time course of the experimental pain, and the changes in zzso were correlated to brain zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Patients with zzso experienced the experimental pain during the time course as more painful than healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso While they did not present a different course of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso they did show greater secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso the cerebral pattern corresponding to secondary zzso was zzso The activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso was zzso correlated with secondary zzso in healthy controls zzso zzso in patients, this correlation was disrupted zzso zzso These findings point to an zzso of pain transmission at the central level in zzso zzso loss of zzso and might be related to changes in zzso mechanisms of pain zzso
