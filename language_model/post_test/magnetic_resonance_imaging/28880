zzso studies have revealed an association between word generation and activity in the left inferior frontal zzso zzso that is zzso with item zzso The experiment reported here examined the effects of repeated word generation, under conditions in which completion was either decreased or increased, on activity measured during zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso in left zzso decreased during repetition conditions that reduced competition but increased during repetition conditions that increased zzso this pattern was contrasted to repetition effects observed in other cortical areas, specifically regions of left zzso zzso The increase in left zzso activity, which is not predicted by a simple semantic retrieval account of prefrontal function, is consistent with the hypothesis that left zzso zzso the selection of semantic knowledge among competing zzso
