zzso attenuated inversion recovery pulse sequences with a long echo time zzso have been used to image the brain in one volunteer and four zzso The long inversion time used with this sequence suppresses the signal from zzso and the long TE produces very heavy zzso zzso The marked reduction in flow zzso from zzso and the high zzso weighting enabled anatomical detail to be seen within the brain stem and produced high zzso contrast in areas close to zzso zzso were demonstrated with greater zzso than with conventional zzso sequences in patients with cerebral zzso low grade zzso and zzso
