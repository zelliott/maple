The functional anatomical role of the zzso zzso in zzso coordination is zzso zzso functional zzso zzso at 3 zzso we analyzed brain activity during three different typing zzso The first task consisted of typing with parallel finger movements zzso left to right with four fingers on both zzso The second task was mirror movements zzso little finger to index finger on both zzso and the third task compared a resting condition with right-handed zzso typing zzso little finger to index zzso Task dependent zzso activity in the supplementary motor area zzso and zzso zzso areas was zzso In addition, zzso patterns were present in the zzso zzso during zzso coordination tasks, with greater zzso in the parallel than in the mirror zzso Finally, we also identified activity in the zzso during the tasks described zzso Interestingly, zzso activity was greatest during the period of motor task zzso and activity during this period was greatest in the parallel zzso Our results suggest a critical role of the zzso zzso in the neural control of zzso zzso
