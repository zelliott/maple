Parallel transmission zzso at 3 T improves image quality by reducing zzso effects with zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether parallel transmission zzso improves zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso in zzso spine zzso at 3 zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers underwent zzso zzso and nine healthy volunteers underwent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso images were acquired using parallel transmission zzso and conventional zzso The percentage improvements in zzso and zzso were zzso and statistical significance was determined using a zzso Student zzso test with p zzso zzso for zzso 

The zzso and zzso showed statistically significant improvements at all levels of the zzso spine except zzso at zzso on zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso imaging, the average improvement with parallel transmission zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso For zzso zzso imaging, the average improvement was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso For zzso zzso imaging, the average zzso improvement was 38% and the average zzso improvement, zzso For zzso zzso scans, the average percentage improvement in zzso was greater than zzso and the average zzso improvement was zzso with parallel transmission zzso 

The parallel transmission sequence improves image quality of zzso spine zzso at 3 zzso which is zzso supported by statistically significant improvements in zzso and zzso
