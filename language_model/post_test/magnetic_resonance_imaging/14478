zzso muscle zzso are rare disorders of muscle membrane zzso Their episodic nature may result in diagnostic difficulty and delays in zzso Advances in diagnostic clinical zzso combined with zzso diagnosis have improved diagnostic accuracy and zzso zzso zzso status to identified genetic zzso in muscle channel genes may be complex and functional analysis, including molecular zzso may help with zzso zzso clinical and genetic diagnosis enables genetic zzso advice regarding prognosis and aids treatment zzso 

An approach to accurate and efficient diagnosis is zzso The importance of detailed clinical evaluation including careful history, examination and family history is zzso The role of zzso zzso combined with DNA testing and molecular expression is zzso New potential zzso including muscle zzso using zzso Centre protocols are zzso 

A combined diagnostic approach using careful clinical assessment, zzso zzso and DNA testing will now achieve a clear diagnosis in most patients with muscle zzso An accurate diagnosis enables genetic zzso and provides information regarding prognosis and treatment zzso zzso analysis often identifies new zzso of uncertain zzso In this situation, functional expression studies as part of a diagnostic service will enable determination of zzso status of novel genetic zzso
