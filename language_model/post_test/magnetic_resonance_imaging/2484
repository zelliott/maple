zzso magnetic resonance imaging allows the zzso measurement of regional zzso zzso zzso and helps zzso zzso regions in the left zzso zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential accuracy of zzso zzso regions in the zzso using zzso and zzso data obtained from zzso rotated long axis zzso Nine canine hearts with acute zzso induced by coronary artery zzso were zzso along four long axis planes rotated around the zzso long zzso at end zzso and end zzso Each plane was zzso by four parallel lines perpendicular to the zzso long zzso zzso the zzso and zzso intersection points of the tag lines, 24 zzso zzso were reconstructed for each zzso at end zzso and end zzso zzso surface stretch and zzso zzso zzso were calculated for each zzso The functional data were compared to zzso data obtained from zzso zzso blue zzso of the zzso The ability of each functional index to discriminate between zzso and zzso regions was assessed using the zzso The potential accuracy in zzso zzso was evaluated by studying the corresponding zzso zzso The results demonstrate that adequate discrimination and zzso can be obtained with both functional zzso However, zzso surface stretch is advantageous as it uses only zzso data and can save 50% of the zzso zzso
