The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of zzso density zzso sequences in reducing or even eliminating motion and zzso flow artifacts in knee magnetic resonance imaging zzso Eighty consecutive patients, who had been routinely scanned for knee examination, participated in the zzso The following pairs of sequences with and without zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso zzso fat zzso zzso in 35 patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 19 patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso in 13 patients and zzso zzso zzso zzso in 13 zzso Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed based on the zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso and relative contrast zzso measures of normal zzso zzso The qualitative analysis was performed by experienced zzso Also, the presence of image motion and zzso artifacts was zzso Based on the results of the zzso zzso and zzso for the different sequences and anatomical structures, the zzso sequences were significantly superior in 19 cases, whereas the corresponding conventional sequences were significantly superior in only 6 zzso zzso sequences eliminated motion artifacts in all the zzso However, motion artifacts were shown in zzso six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso conventional zzso In our results, it was found that, in zzso zzso sequences zzso and zzso the differences between the zzso and conventional sequences regarding the elimination of motion and zzso flow artifacts were statistically zzso In all the zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso and zzso were significantly superior to the corresponding conventional sequences regarding the zzso of their image zzso In conclusion, this technique appears to be capable to potentially eliminate motion and zzso flow artifacts in MR zzso
