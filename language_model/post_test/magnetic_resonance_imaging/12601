zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso system to mediate the learning of zzso associations, and these associations often guide everyday actions, but the precise role of these circuits in forming and consolidating rules remains zzso A means to examine zzso zzso circuit contributions to zzso motor learning is to examine these process in a zzso model system, such as Parkinson's disease zzso a zzso zzso disorder characterized by the loss of zzso zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare brain zzso of zzso patients with a group of healthy zzso participants during a zzso zzso learning task that entailed discovering and learning arbitrary associations between a set of six visual stimuli and corresponding spatial locations by moving a zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso would recruit more areas than zzso controls during learning and also show increased zzso in commonly activated regions, probably in the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso perhaps as zzso mechanisms for their disrupted zzso zzso zzso had no effect in acquiring the zzso relationships and zzso zzso in several key frontal cortical and zzso zzso However, we found that zzso modified zzso in other areas, including those in the zzso and zzso and zzso cortex, particularly during initial zzso These results may suggest that the zzso zzso circuits become active more so during the initial formation of zzso zzso
