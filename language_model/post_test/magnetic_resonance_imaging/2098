To explore the potential usefulness of two new magnetic resonance imaging zzso analysis techniques for assessment of progressive cerebral zzso and zzso zzso activity in primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso and thereby assess the relationship between zzso activity and zzso in this patient zzso 

zzso of cerebral zzso and net change in zzso zzso volumes are currently used as surrogate markers of disease progression in multiple sclerosis zzso However, manual zzso of these techniques is time-consuming and the pathological specificity of zzso zzso change is zzso Advances in serial scan registration have facilitated the development of a new, zzso technique to measure cerebral volume zzso zzso Image zzso using zzso of zzso and a technique to measure the total new zzso zzso volume selectively zzso difference zzso 

zzso measures changes in cerebral size based on zzso detection of shifts in edge zzso The zzso difference imaging method measures differences in zzso volumes over time as defined by a zzso outlining zzso The two new methods were validated against the zzso zzso volume zzso technique and a previously described measure of partial brain volume (which uses six slices zzso on the presumed area of greatest change around the lateral zzso All were applied to serially acquired MR images from a cohort of 39 patients with zzso who also underwent scoring on the expanded disability status scale zzso twice, two years zzso 

The two measures reflecting cerebral zzso correlated strongly zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso load zzso using the two techniques correlated very highly zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of the total new zzso zzso volume was from enlargement of zzso zzso and only 9 % from new, zzso zzso No relationship was seen between the traditional measure of net gain in zzso zzso load and either measure of zzso However, the zzso measure of total new zzso load correlated with both measures of zzso zzso technique, zzso zzso zzso zzso six slice measure, r zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no relationship between the zzso measures and changes in the zzso 

Both of the new image analysis techniques appear to be promising as sensitive markers for disease progression in zzso The correlation of total new zzso zzso volume with the progression of cerebral zzso (which is known to be a consequence of zzso loss in progressive zzso compared with a lack of correlation with the traditional net gain in zzso zzso load is interesting and suggests that the total new zzso zzso volume may ultimately be the most useful zzso
