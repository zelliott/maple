zzso based zzso zzso is a useful tool to assess differences in brain zzso between groups of patients and healthy zzso In addition, zzso enables the performance of zzso analyses to determine potential correlations between performance on cognitive tests and variations in local brain zzso Prior zzso studies investigating patients with mild cognitive impairment zzso have revealed different patterns of local brain zzso In order to extend previous findings, we investigated 18 patients with zzso and 18 zzso and zzso healthy zzso All participants underwent extensive zzso testing in addition to undergoing anatomical scanning with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso analysis revealed bilateral decreases in gray matter density in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso Moreover, zzso analyses demonstrated a correlation between immediate verbal recall and gray matter density in the left zzso cortex, while delayed free recall correlated with gray matter density in the left zzso It has been proposed that performance in the immediate recall is supported by the so-called zzso zzso a component of working memory that contributes to the maintenance of integrated memory zzso zzso our results suggest that anatomical regions associated with verbal long-term and verbal working memory are structurally zzso within the left zzso
