Low muscle mass secondary to disease and zzso is an important cause of excess mortality and zzso Many studies include a MR brain scan but no peripheral measure of muscle zzso We developed a technique to measure zzso neck muscle zzso area zzso on zzso MR brain scans enabling brain and muscle size to be measured zzso 

We performed four studies to develop and test: zzso zzso zzso zzso and external zzso We used zzso MR brain imaging from young and older subjects, obtained on different zzso and collected zzso MR zzso 

After developing the technique and demonstrating zzso we tested it for zzso reliability in 40 zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso between zzso were zzso zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso for the combined group zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso The first zzso principal component explained zzso of total neck muscle zzso zzso and correlated positively with both right zzso zzso and left zzso zzso grip zzso The 14 subjects in the zzso study had had two MR brain scans on three different zzso The zzso for between scanner variation for total neck muscle zzso was high at zzso zzso zzso The zzso for within scanner variations were also high, with values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the three zzso The external zzso study found a correlation zzso for total thigh zzso and total neck zzso of zzso 

We present a zzso valid and reliable method for measuring neck muscle zzso on zzso MR brain zzso zzso studies are needed to validate and apply our technique with subjects differing in age, ethnicity and geographical zzso
