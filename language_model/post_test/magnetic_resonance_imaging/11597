zzso is increasingly being used for zzso examination of zzso and for zzso disc disorder analysis, but until now has not been applied to geometric zzso The aim of this study was to develop a new geometric model of zzso discs using zzso and to zzso the migration of the nucleus zone within zzso zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso children zzso angles 22 zzso 7 degrees ) were examined using zzso The protocol consisted of zzso and zzso plane acquisitions of the entire zzso An image processing software allowed the outline detection of the nucleus zone zzso high intensity zzso The zzso bodies were also zzso Using a zzso processor, the nucleus zone migration and a zzso angle were zzso zzso tests showed the zzso of the method zzso zzso zzso zzso zone migration was correlated to the zzso angle zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Our results were in agreement with the zzso when two zzso move zzso the disc, the nucleus moves into the zzso of the zzso But should we talk about the zzso Despite image processing software allowing the highlighting of image features zzso color zzso tables applied to zzso images using zzso intensity zzso it is impossible to differentiate the nucleus from the zzso on zzso weighting images of adolescent zzso This new geometric model of the zzso disc, used for the zzso of the nucleus zone migration, should be of interest for further investigation of zzso parameters of zzso
