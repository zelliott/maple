zzso treatment of zzso tumors such as zzso zzso and zzso region tumors carries a risk of zzso deficits due to possible damage to deep cerebral veins including the internal cerebral zzso It is often difficult to identify whether the vessel encountered during surgery needs to be preserved or not through the small operative zzso zzso zzso evaluation of deep zzso structures is zzso We evaluated the usefulness of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso for this zzso 

First, the ability to detect deep zzso structures was compared with both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients without any damage to deep zzso zzso Images of 7 consecutive patients suffering from zzso zzso who underwent both imaging modes for the identification of lateral zzso arteries were reconstructed for evaluation of the deep cerebral zzso zzso surgery for tumors at the zzso zzso and zzso regions was zzso performed with zzso evaluation of deep zzso system only using zzso zzso 

Information on the deep zzso systems acquired by zzso zzso was as useful as that acquired by zzso Until today, we have treated 8 cases of zzso zzso and zzso region tumors with zzso evaluation of the deep zzso system using zzso zzso without any zzso 

Information on the deep zzso system obtained with zzso zzso aids the surgery of zzso zzso and zzso region zzso As the required sequences of zzso zzso are same as those necessary for the zzso system, and zzso zzso can be achieved without the use of zzso contrast agents, zzso zzso can be an alternative for zzso evaluation of the deep zzso zzso
