zzso MR imaging zzso is a promising but, in some aspects, still debated zzso tool for functional language zzso We developed a clinical zzso overt language design at the zzso level to zzso sensitivity for zzso areas of the zzso To evaluate zzso and sensitivity, we investigated a consecutive series of zzso patients with zzso with minimal zzso brain zzso 

Thirty right-handed patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso and a control group of 23 right-handed healthy subjects participated in the zzso The language design included semantic and zzso zzso tasks and was constructed to represent the most relevant aspects of everyday language zzso It was applied during zzso zzso zzso We performed image zzso and statistical analysis with zzso at a group level, applying widely used statistical zzso The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all participants gave written informed zzso 

Given the strict statistical criteria, the sensitivity for inferior frontal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was improved relative to previous findings in the zzso For both language areas, we found zzso sensitivity in healthy subjects zzso areas, zzso and zzso and zzso sensitivity in patients (when including zzso zzso results demonstrated the capability to detect zzso language zzso in patients, which were more frequent in than those in healthy zzso 

We developed a clinical language zzso design that zzso various relevant aspects of everyday language demands and provides robust zzso of core language zzso
