To zzso the time course of zzso zzso zzso magnitude and spatial zzso using serial magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Forty patients with zzso diagnosis of prostate cancer received an zzso seed implant zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso on Days zzso 0, 14, and zzso zzso of strength zzso were placed in a modified peripheral loading pattern to deliver zzso to the target zzso MR images consisted of zzso thick zzso slices with no zzso The image sets were zzso and zzso to minimize zzso bias, then contoured by a single radiation zzso zzso were zzso about their center of mass to align the prostate long axis with the zzso zzso zzso prostate volumes and dimensions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso directions through the center of mass were zzso 

The average relative zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso on Day 0 and zzso on Day zzso Between Days 0 and 30, the zzso resolved zzso with time on zzso Average relative zzso dimensions on Day 0 in the zzso zzso and zzso directions were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

As measured using zzso the average zzso magnitude for our study population was zzso on Day 0 and resolved zzso with time to zzso on Day zzso The zzso exhibited spatial zzso the prostate expanding on Day 0 by zzso in each of the zzso and zzso directions and by zzso in the zzso zzso
