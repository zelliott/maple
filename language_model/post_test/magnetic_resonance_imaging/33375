zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can zzso detect focal zzso injury within minutes of zzso and zzso zzso can evaluate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can reduce zzso size in stroke zzso We used diffusion and zzso zzso to evaluate the in zzso effects of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a temporary zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso rats underwent zzso zzso of the middle cerebral zzso Fifteen minutes after zzso animals were randomly assigned to treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) or zzso zzso zzso zzso receiving a zzso of zzso zzso at that time and an infusion of zzso zzso for the next 165 zzso The zzso group received a saline zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies by a zzso technique were initiated 30 minutes after zzso and repeated every 30 minutes for the next 3 zzso zzso zzso studies were obtained using zzso imaging after injection of zzso iron oxide zzso immediately before and 15 minutes after withdrawal of the zzso at 3 hours after middle cerebral artery zzso At 24 hours, the animals were clinically evaluated zzso of 0 to 5) and zzso killed, and the brain was stained with zzso zzso to evaluate zzso zzso 

zzso imaging demonstrated markedly reduced zzso zzso area in the zzso zzso group during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 30 minutes after zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso With zzso after 3 hours of temporary zzso diffusion imaging documented an additional zzso reduction of the zzso zzso area in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso area, with no change in the zzso zzso During zzso zzso imaging demonstrated a relative signal intensity decline of zzso zzso zzso in controls and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso indicating better zzso in the latter zzso After removal of the zzso zzso improved in both groups and was not significantly zzso Post zzso zzso volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the controls zzso zzso zzso Clinical outcome at 24 hours was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso of 0 to 5) in the controls zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso zzso reduces early zzso injury as documented by diffusion zzso and improves zzso as documented by zzso zzso and that zzso zzso additional reduction of zzso zzso zzso
