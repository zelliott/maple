This zzso study used a zzso analysis technique to zzso regional brain zzso fluid zzso volumes derived from zzso zzso zzso in 84 healthy men ranging from 21 to 82 years of age and 28 patients meeting Research zzso zzso for alcohol zzso The goals were to replicate an earlier CT study of an independent sample of alcoholic and control subjects zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1988) and to compare CT assessments of brain changes with magnetic resonance imaging zzso assessments made in the same alcoholic patients zzso et zzso zzso Regional brain changes associated with normal aging were derived by zzso analysis, using CT data collected from the healthy control zzso As in the earlier CT study and in the concurrent zzso study, zzso and zzso zzso volumes in alcoholic patients were greater than would be expected for their zzso Furthermore, the present CT study zzso the previous CT and zzso findings of a positive relationship between age and zzso volume enlargement in alcoholic patients over and above the normal age-related increase in zzso volume, suggesting greater vulnerability of the aging brain to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso estimates of zzso and cortical zzso volume revealed high correlations zzso zzso zzso and CT produced similar absolute zzso volumes, while zzso produced larger zzso volume estimates than did zzso The difference in zzso volume estimate may be due to differences between CT and zzso in slice thickness and sensitivity to partial volume zzso
