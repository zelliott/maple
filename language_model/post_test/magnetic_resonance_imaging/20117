To evaluate cerebral abnormalities in childhood idiopathic zzso zzso zzso by means of different magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso were performed in six children with idiopathic zzso zzso and seven zzso 

zzso revealed an increased zzso system in five of six zzso A zzso zzso was found in one patient and a zzso I zzso was found in zzso zzso analysis showed a zzso increase of zzso volume but normal zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso volume was zzso increased compared to zzso zzso zzso volume correlated significantly with skull zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peak ratios in zzso were significantly higher in patients than in zzso zzso zzso peak ratios in zzso were significantly lower in zzso zzso gray matter zzso MRS ratios were zzso zzso flow was increased in zzso possibly related to increased brain zzso 

This study reveals associated zzso anomalies for idiopathic zzso zzso A relative zzso was found, which should not be zzso as true zzso In contrast to zzso zzso MRS showed no severe zzso Total zzso volume is correlated to skull circumference and zzso blood zzso
