To determine whether electric current can be induced in zzso zzso zzso wires and pacing zzso in patients during magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Prospective laboratory zzso 

Postgraduate medical school zzso 

A sheep heart zzso 

zzso 

zzso generated by saline zzso flowing through a magnetic field and distribution of current from a zzso tip within a sheep heart model were measured in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Resistance of zzso formed by pacing zzso a pacing zzso and a zzso wire were measured in saline zzso zzso of rapidly changing magnetic fields and the movement of the beating heart on zzso pacing wires were calculated zzso A flow of 200 zzso of saline zzso induced a current of zzso zzso zzso (at zzso zzso From magnetic resonance images we derived a current density of approximately zzso zzso (at zzso zzso Internal resistance of pacing zzso and zzso wires was zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso The maximum currents calculated (for a higher field strength of zzso zzso in a circuit formed by zzso pacing wires were 80 zzso induced by the beating heart moving the wires through the magnetic field and 46 zzso induced by the rapidly changing magnetic zzso 

Current generated by flow of conducting fluid should be zzso zzso zzso and zzso wires should be safe if well insulated and disconnected from external electric zzso However, current induced in zzso pacing wires may be a zzso and precautions should be zzso External wire tips must be zzso zzso and coiled to lie along the axis of the magnetic zzso zzso is required, and zzso equipment should be zzso
