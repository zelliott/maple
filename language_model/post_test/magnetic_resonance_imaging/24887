zzso zzso zzso may have an unacceptable size for use in anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has been proposed to predict the diameters of hamstring zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso might reliably anticipate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso graft sizes similarly to zzso An zzso evaluation of the hamstring zzso with a higher zzso may improve the accuracy of the zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

A total of 33 patients undergoing zzso reconstruction with a zzso graft and zzso performed at our institution were zzso The zzso area zzso of each zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was calculated preoperatively with US and with zzso under zzso and zzso zzso zzso measurement of the final diameter of the zzso using a zzso zzso block with zzso increments was zzso zzso correlation zzso were calculated to determine the relationship between the final zzso graft diameter of the zzso and the zzso of the ST and zzso measured with US and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso linear zzso was also calculated to attempt to predict the graft diameter based on given zzso 

There were statistically significant correlations between the measured zzso with US and both zzso zzso with the zzso zzso However, zzso under zzso zzso showed a much zzso correlation zzso than zzso under zzso zzso zzso or US zzso Final graft diameters zzso zzso were observed in zzso of patients with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso of patients with a zzso zzso zzso and in zzso of patients with a zzso zzso zzso measured with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso calculation of the zzso of the hamstring zzso with zzso and US can help to reliably estimate zzso zzso In terms of correlation of the zzso with graft diameter, US was comparable to zzso zzso but zzso zzso showed a much greater zzso zzso values of the zzso of the ST and zzso of 25 zzso 17 zzso and 14 zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and US methods, respectively, are needed to reliably predict a zzso graft with a minimum diameter of 8 zzso
