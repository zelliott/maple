For development of zzso chemotherapy, we designed zzso with zzso drug release and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso We prepared zzso zzso by incorporating zzso zzso zzso chains with a lower critical solution temperatures around 40 zzso and zzso zzso zzso lipids having zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso These stable zzso zzso zzso retained zzso in their interior below zzso temperature but released zzso immediately at temperatures greater than 40 zzso They exhibited excellent ability to shorten the zzso zzso relaxation zzso When administered zzso into colon 26 zzso mice, accumulated zzso in tumors increased with time, reaching a constant level 8 h after administration by following zzso zzso signal intensity in zzso zzso size affected the zzso zzso efficiency in zzso zzso of about 100 zzso diameter were accumulated more efficiently than those with about 50 zzso zzso zzso size also affected zzso more efficient zzso occurred in larger zzso zzso growth was strongly suppressed when zzso loaded with zzso were administered zzso into zzso mice and the tumor was heated mildly at 44 zzso for 10 zzso at 8 h after zzso zzso zzso having zzso drug release and zzso functions might zzso personalized chemotherapy, providing efficient zzso zzso
