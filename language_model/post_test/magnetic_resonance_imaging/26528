zzso and zzso zzso are uncommon entities, and diagnosis often is zzso by their similar clinical zzso because characteristic zzso findings are not evident until late in the course of zzso 

To compare the age distribution, clinical manifestations, and zzso findings, especially magnetic resonance imaging zzso in children with zzso or zzso zzso 

A retrospective review of 57 children with a discharge diagnosis of zzso or zzso zzso hospitalized from January 1980 through December zzso 

Fifty patients met inclusion criteria: 36 with zzso and 14 with zzso zzso The mean age at presentation was younger for children with zzso than for those with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso years of zzso and the duration of symptoms longer for children with zzso zzso than for those with zzso zzso vs 22 zzso The initial symptom for both groups of children was refusal to walk, zzso or back pain, but children with zzso more often were zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso than those with zzso zzso patients with zzso had zzso of the zzso 25 zzso had abnormalities that were zzso Ten zzso patients had zzso 9 zzso had abnormalities consistent with this zzso Thirteen children with zzso zzso had zzso of the spine, but in only 7 zzso were these zzso However, 11 had zzso and in each the diagnosis of zzso zzso was zzso 

This comparative study suggests that age and clinical presentation distinguish most patients with zzso from those with zzso zzso Although zzso of the spine usually are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of zzso zzso is the diagnostic study of choice for pediatric patients with suspected zzso zzso
