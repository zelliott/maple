zzso lobe zzso zzso is the most common drug-resistant zzso in zzso As zzso studies have shown widespread structural damage in zzso this condition is often referred to as a system disorder with disrupted structural zzso Studies based on zzso statistical comparisons can only indirectly test such zzso zzso theory provides a new approach to formally analyze large-scale zzso Using zzso analysis of magnetic resonance zzso cortical thickness zzso we investigated the structural basis of the organization of such networks in 122 zzso patients and 47 zzso and zzso healthy zzso Networks in patients and controls were characterized by a short path length between anatomical regions and a high degree of zzso suggestive of a zzso zzso However, compared with controls, patients showed increased path length and zzso altered distribution of network zzso and higher vulnerability to targeted attacks, suggesting a reorganization of cortical thickness correlation zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that network zzso intensify over zzso zzso simulations showed high zzso of network parameters across random zzso indicating that altered network zzso in zzso is a consistent zzso Increased network disruption was associated with zzso zzso seizure outcome, zzso adverse effects of zzso on large-scale network zzso
