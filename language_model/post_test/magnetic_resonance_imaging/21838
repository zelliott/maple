We used a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to zzso the number of viral copies in cells of zzso of eight patients with zzso zzso virus encephalitis zzso The viral load was monitored in serial zzso samples during the course of disease and correlated to clinical symptoms, zzso manifestations, efficacy of zzso treatment, and overall clinical zzso Before treatment, zzso type 1 zzso copies were detected at a mean value of zzso zzso 5 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During therapy, zzso DNA decreased gradually to a mean value of 6 zzso cells zzso 0 to 33 zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso within 6 to 21 days and disappeared or was barely zzso before treatment completion in most zzso The zzso burden in the zzso did not clearly correlate with the severity of clinical signs or the degree of zzso imaging findings and overall zzso zzso of zzso copies allows rapid and reliable monitoring of zzso zzso The absence of a clear correlation between viral load in the zzso and morbidity may suggest a role for indirect mechanisms of brain injury in zzso
