zzso zzso breast zzso have high zzso potential and are often characterized by early systemic zzso Early detection is vital, but there are few comprehensive imaging zzso Here we describe zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso breast zzso investigate the specific features of this zzso and compare the characteristics of zzso breast zzso with those of hormone zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso breast zzso 

From July 2009 to June 2011, zzso and ultrasound findings of 210 patients with zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso reviewed from our institutional zzso zzso zzso was notified in 88 cases and elasticity scores were notified in 49 cases zzso Thirty-five patients underwent zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reviewed according to the Breast zzso and Data System zzso lexicon and zzso 

zzso breast zzso were more likely to show round, oval, or zzso masses with zzso margins on zzso than zzso breast zzso On zzso zzso tumors were more likely than zzso breast zzso to show circumscribed or zzso margins and no zzso acoustic features or zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso exhibited suspicious aspects more often than zzso zzso often with rim zzso zzso of masses were classified zzso zzso 

This study is the first to describe findings on zzso zzso and zzso for zzso breast zzso with a matched zzso control zzso Several distinctive zzso features of these aggressive tumors are identified that can be used for earlier diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately to improve zzso
