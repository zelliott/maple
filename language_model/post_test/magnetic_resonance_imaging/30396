zzso zzso levels are associated with zzso A zzso zzso gene zzso zzso is related to relative zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso zzso is associated with zzso and structural brain zzso 

This study was performed in two prospective zzso cohort studies among zzso The first study included zzso participants who were screened for zzso zzso follow-up zzso zzso The second study included 1011 elderly subjects with an zzso at baseline and zzso The zzso zzso was assessed for association with zzso cognitive function and white matter zzso 

The zzso zzso was associated with a decreased risk of zzso Among zzso participants, zzso had a better performance on zzso speed tests than zzso No differences were found in memory function between zzso In addition, both presence and progression of white matter zzso was lower in zzso No association was found with brain zzso on zzso 

Our findings suggest a protective effect of the zzso zzso on the risk of zzso and white matter zzso
