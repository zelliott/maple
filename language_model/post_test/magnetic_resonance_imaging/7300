The relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to brain structure change throughout the zzso Brain structures have been reported to be highly zzso in middle-aged individuals and younger; however, the influence of genes on brain structure is less studied in older zzso We performed a magnetic resonance imaging study of 236 older zzso with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years, to examine the zzso of 53 brain global and zzso zzso zzso Total brain volume zzso and other zzso measures were moderately to highly zzso in late life, and these genetic influences tended to decrease with age, suggesting a greater influence of environmental factors as age zzso zzso influences were higher in men and on the left zzso compared with the zzso In zzso models, common genetic factors were observed for global and zzso total and gray matter zzso This study examined the genetic contribution to 53 brain global and zzso zzso measures in older twins for the first time, and the influence of age, sex, and zzso on these genetic contributions, which are useful information for a better understanding of the process of brain aging and helping individuals to have a healthy zzso
