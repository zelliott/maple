The objective of the study was to investigate creativity in relation to brain function by assessing creative thinking in various neurological zzso Several measures were employed to assess different zzso of creative thinking in clinical groups with frontal zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso relative to matched healthy control zzso The frontal group was subdivided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were employed to assess the significance levels associated with the effects after accounting for zzso differences between the zzso zzso were only considered noteworthy if they at least suggested the presence of a strong trend and were accompanied by medium to large effect zzso The zzso and zzso groups revealed poorer overall performance with the former demonstrating problems with zzso related measures, whereas the latter were also less zzso at producing original zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and zzso groups demonstrated superior performance in the ability to overcome the constraints imposed by salient semantic zzso when generating creative zzso In zzso the zzso in the findings reveal the selective involvement of different brain regions in diverse aspects of zzso zzso location posed selective limitations on the ability to generate original responses in different zzso but not on the ability to generate relevant responses, which was compromised in most patient zzso The noteworthy findings from this exploratory study of enhanced performance in specific aspects of creative zzso following brain damage are discussed with reference to the generic idea that superior creative ability can result from altered brain zzso
