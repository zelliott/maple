zzso has been linked to zzso maintenance and zzso of alcohol zzso zzso models of anxiety have proposed important roles for zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso interactions in the generation and regulation of anxiety states, zzso 

This study tested the hypotheses that zzso zzso patients would show a disruption of zzso in these circuits as measured by resting state functional zzso 

The study examined recently zzso zzso zzso zzso longer-term zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined in specific zzso where degree of zzso has been found to correlate with state anxiety levels in previous zzso 

zzso patients showed significantly elevated scores on anxiety and depression inventories compared with zzso No significant group differences in zzso were observed between right zzso and right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso between left zzso and left zzso or, after correction for multiple zzso right zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso However, significantly decreased positive zzso was found between left zzso zzso and left anterior zzso in patients relative to zzso 

Both early and longer-term zzso zzso patients showed increased anxiety levels relative to controls and altered resting state zzso in circuits previously linked to state zzso zzso the significant group differences in zzso were in the opposite direction to our predictions based on the zzso These results may point to a lack of zzso of models derived from young healthy homogeneous zzso
