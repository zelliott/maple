Memory for zzso associations is an important type of memory in our daily lives, and often zzso in older zzso Although difficulty retrieving zzso associations is often apparent in the elderly, there is little zzso evidence of age-related decline in this zzso The current zzso study investigated differences in brain zzso between healthy young and older adults during the successful retrieval of people's names zzso and job titles zzso associated with zzso During zzso participants viewed unfamiliar faces, each paired with a job title and zzso During zzso each learned face was presented with two job titles or two names, and participants were required to choose the correct job title or zzso zzso success activity zzso was identified by comparing zzso activity for hits versus misses in N and J, and the zzso in each task were compared between young and older zzso The study yielded three main zzso First, the zzso showed significant zzso in both tasks of N and J, and the activity was greater for young compared to older zzso Second, the left anterior zzso lobe zzso showed greater zzso in N than in J, but there was no age difference in the activity in this zzso Third, functional connectivity between zzso and ATL activities in both retrieval tasks was higher for young than for older zzso Taken together, age-related differences in zzso activities and zzso connectivity could contribute to age-related decline in zzso memory and to complaints of poor retrieval of people's names by older zzso
