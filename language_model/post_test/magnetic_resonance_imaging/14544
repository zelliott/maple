zzso attention and working memory zzso allow for selection and maintenance of relevant sound information in our minds, respectively, thus underlying zzso functioning in everyday acoustic zzso It is still unclear whether these two closely coupled functions are based on a common neural circuit, or whether they involve genuinely distinct zzso with separate zzso zzso In a full zzso functional zzso zzso design, we independently manipulated the levels of zzso zzso load and zzso interference using modified zzso Continuous Performance zzso Although many zzso regions were jointly activated by increases of zzso load and zzso there was a double zzso between prefrontal zzso zzso zzso associated selectively with either auditory attention or zzso Specifically, anterior zzso zzso zzso and the right anterior zzso were selectively activated by increasing zzso load, whereas zzso of middle lateral zzso and inferior frontal zzso (IFC) were associated with interference zzso Meanwhile, a zzso interaction between interference and load was detected in left zzso superior frontal cortex, suggesting that in this area, zzso are not only zzso but reflect a common resource pool recruited by increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppression of zzso zzso auditory zzso zzso and zzso suppression of primary zzso were also found, possibly reflecting zzso of zzso processing of irrelevant stimuli during continuous task zzso Our results suggest a double zzso between auditory attention and working memory in zzso of anterior zzso zzso middle lateral zzso in humans, respectively, in the context of substantially overlapping zzso
