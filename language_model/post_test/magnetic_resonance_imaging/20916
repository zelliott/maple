Very little is known about cortical development in the first years of life, a time of rapid cognitive development and risk for zzso zzso We studied regional cortical and zzso gray matter volume growth in a group of 72 children who underwent magnetic resonance scanning after birth and at ages 1 and 2 years using a novel zzso zzso zzso Overall, cortical gray matter volumes increased substantially zzso in the first year of life and less so in the second year zzso We found marked regional differences in zzso rates, with primary motor and sensory zzso growing slower in the first year of life with association zzso growing more zzso In the second year of life, primary sensory regions continued to grow more slowly, while frontal and zzso regions developed relatively more zzso The zzso grew less than other zzso structures such as the zzso and zzso in the first year of zzso It is likely that these patterns of regional gray matter growth reflect maturation and development of underlying function, as they are consistent with cognitive and functional development in the first years of zzso
