Stroke is a common condition that may lead to various degrees of neurological deficit and long-term zzso It has become increasingly recognized that cortical reorganization of zzso networks plays a significant role in regaining function following a focal brain zzso However, the mechanisms involved in this process are still not fully zzso zzso functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging is a rapidly evolving scanning technique that has the potential to shed light into this zzso zzso A better understanding of the underlying neurological pathways may contribute to the development of targeted treatment that will promote repair and reduce zzso zzso The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date summary of the available scientific data evaluating the clinical application of functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging among stroke zzso
