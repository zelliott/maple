Very few studies have investigated to what extent different zzso of specific zzso share the same underlying functional zzso This study aims to investigate the potential differences in the anatomy and dynamics of the blood oxygen zzso zzso responses associated with zzso and zzso zzso We used an zzso paradigm in 14 zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso and 17 zzso Phobic images successfully induced distress only in zzso zzso Both zzso groups showed a similar pattern of heart rate increase following the presentation of zzso zzso this being different from zzso The presentation of zzso images induced activity within the same brain network in all participants, although the intensity of brain responses was significantly higher in zzso Only zzso zzso showed greater activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso compared with zzso This zzso group also presented a lower activity peak in the left zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso looking at the dynamics of zzso responses, both zzso groups showed a quicker zzso in the right zzso than controls, but only zzso zzso also differed from controls in this zzso within the left zzso Considering these and previous findings, both zzso zzso show very similar responses regarding their immediate reaction to zzso images, but critical differences in their sustained responses to these zzso These results highlight the importance of considering complex mental processes potentially associated with coping and emotion regulation zzso rather than exclusively focusing on primary neural responses to threat, when investigating fear and zzso
