Prospective clinical zzso 

The aim of the study was to investigate cortical zzso after traumatic spinal zzso injury zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso University Hospital, zzso zzso 

We studied six right-handed zzso zzso patients at 1, 3 and 12 months after the injury and 12 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso performed simple zzso cycles of zzso of the right-hand fingers and zzso of the right ankle during zzso The volumes of zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso of gravity zzso and weighted zzso indexes were zzso 

There was no recovery of zzso function in three patients and, according to the American Spinal zzso Association zzso zzso zzso the remaining three zzso A positive correlation between the zzso in the primary motor zzso and the ASIA impairment scale (1 month: zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso was zzso The study also revealed a pattern of cortical zzso that was increased among the patients who recovered (in zzso area 4 zzso zzso zzso BA zzso zzso BA 6, zzso During the hand task there was an expansion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso among the patients who zzso During the hand movement the cortical zzso was less zzso among the patients compared with the controls zzso 

Our study has found broadening of cortical zzso and shift of zzso during the first year after zzso depending on the zzso
