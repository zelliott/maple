The purpose of this study was to zzso the central processing of painful mechanical stimulation to muscle and bone by measuring blood oxygen zzso signal changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Twelve healthy volunteers were zzso Mechanical pressure on muscle and bone were applied at the right lower leg by an zzso zzso were adjusted to cause weak and strong pain sensation at either target site in preliminary zzso Brain zzso in response to mechanical zzso stimulation targeting muscle and bone were measured by zzso and zzso 

zzso mechanical stimulation targeting muscle and bone activated the common areas including bilateral zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso cortex, secondary zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was more activated by strong stimulation than by weak zzso Some areas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more activated by muscle stimulation than by bone zzso 

The zzso and zzso nucleus may have a more significant role in brain processing of muscle pain compared with bone zzso
