To determine zzso whether relative cerebral blood volume zzso zzso can be used to predict clinical response in patients with zzso zzso 

Approval for this retrospective zzso study was obtained from the Institutional Board of Research Associates, with waiver of informed zzso Thirty-five patients zzso male and 12 female zzso median age, 39 years; range, zzso zzso with zzso diagnosed zzso zzso (21 zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso and zzso mixed zzso were examined with dynamic zzso contrast zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso tests were used to compare patients in different response categories zzso response, stable, progressive, zzso with respect to baseline relative zzso zzso survival curves, zzso tests, and zzso survival models were used to characterize and evaluate the association of baseline relative zzso with time to zzso zzso volumes and relative zzso zzso were obtained at initial examination and zzso 

zzso with relative zzso less than zzso had a median time to progression of zzso days zzso 433 zzso zzso and zzso with relative zzso more than zzso had a median time to progression of 245 days zzso zzso Patients who had an adverse event zzso death or zzso had significantly higher zzso zzso zzso relative zzso than did patients without adverse events zzso complete response or stable zzso zzso with low baseline relative zzso had stable tumor volumes at follow-up over time, whereas those with high baseline relative zzso zzso had progressively increasing tumor volumes over zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso zzso MR imaging can help to identify zzso zzso that will progress rapidly and a subset of zzso zzso that have a propensity for zzso zzso
