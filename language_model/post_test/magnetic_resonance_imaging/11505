zzso imaging research has shown abnormal brain zzso in adults with zzso stress disorder zzso when compared with matched control zzso In this article, we present brain imaging findings from a study of children with zzso zzso 

zzso children between the ages of 7 and 14 with a history of trauma and zzso symptoms were assessed with the zzso zzso zzso for Children and zzso zzso The sample underwent magnetic resonance imaging in a zzso T zzso Brain images were analyzed by zzso blind to diagnostic status using zzso methods, and images were compared with zzso and zzso healthy control zzso 

The clinical group demonstrated zzso of frontal lobe asymmetry and smaller total brain and cerebral volumes when compared with the control zzso There were no statistically significant differences in zzso volume between clinical and control zzso 

zzso lobe abnormalities may occur as a result of zzso in children or, zzso be a risk factor for the development of the syndrome in this age zzso The implications of the findings and their consistency with previous research are zzso
