An zzso zzso zzso body zzso for zzso zzso zzso lung imaging at zzso is zzso The zzso is designed to rest on top of the patient support and be used as a temporary insert in a clinical zzso A zzso construction zzso patient access and the zzso design makes zzso use of available bore space to ensure zzso zzso zzso zzso polarized zzso magnetic fields are produced at zzso zzso using a zzso mapping method for the geometrical design, combined with an zzso method to calculate the individual zzso values on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Efficiency and isolation from the system's zzso body zzso are ensured by an integrated zzso zzso The design methodology is readily zzso to other field strengths or zzso zzso over existing zzso coils were found in terms of sensitivity and transmit field zzso an important feature in zzso zzso
