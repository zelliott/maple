The zzso of the left zzso wall is not zzso but demonstrates zzso zzso in zzso blood flow, zzso zzso and contraction and relaxation zzso zzso and colleagues recognized that irreversible injury of the zzso zzso develops as a zzso zzso occurring first in the zzso zzso and with longer periods of zzso the zzso of necrosis moves from the zzso zone across the wall to progressively involve more of the zzso thickness of the zzso wall, ultimately becoming nearly zzso This phenomenon was named the zzso zzso and is the zzso counterpart of the zzso zzso of the metabolism and blood zzso zzso of zzso blood flow is accomplished by changes in zzso vascular resistance and zzso zzso It is more difficult to maintain the zzso in the zzso zzso because contraction is greater, oxygen demand is greater, and zzso pressure is higher in the zzso than in the zzso zzso In the normal zzso contraction is greater in the zzso layer, as is wall stress, accounting for the higher zzso energy zzso zzso with these findings, higher rates of zzso activity and greater oxygen extraction are found in this zzso As a consequence, zzso becomes more severe and zzso cells undergo necrosis first in the zzso Under normal conditions, production and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are more active than in the zzso zzso but decline more easily in the zzso during zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso Lower production of zzso in the zzso might also contribute to the zzso zzso zzso necrosis starts from the zzso but the production of zzso zzso in the zzso is known to increase and compensate for the reduction in zzso zzso production in the zzso Animal experiments have shown that zzso zzso of the zzso half of the zzso wall is double that in the zzso zzso Today, this can be confirmed in humans with the tissue zzso tracking method which is completely zzso Furthermore, the zzso half of the zzso wall is known to compensate for the decreased zzso zzso of the zzso half in the case of zzso injury, which is called vertical compensation and is the mechanical counterpart of the concept of zzso zzso Many new technologies, including the tissue zzso tracking method, magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso contrast zzso will give more accurate information about the zzso zzso of zzso motion and blood flow, and will contribute to early detection and quantitative zzso of zzso and other diseases of which the main zzso is in the zzso
