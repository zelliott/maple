zzso stem cell zzso therapy is actively being pursued in zzso and clinical disease zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso cell tracking promises to zzso current cell transplantation zzso however, it is limited by dilution of contrast agent during cellular zzso transfer of label from dying cells to surrounding zzso host cells, and/or zzso of the zzso Here, we evaluated the zzso of magnetic resonance imaging for long-term tracking of transplanted neural stem cells labeled with zzso iron oxide and zzso with the zzso reporter gene zzso Mouse neural stem cells were transplanted into zzso zzso zzso mice or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals and zzso were monitored over a period of 93 zzso zzso in mice that rejected the cells, the zzso MR signal persisted throughout the entire zzso whereas in the zzso mice, the contrast cleared at a faster zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso and zzso were found surrounding dead cells and zzso zzso iron oxide zzso The present results indicate that live cell proliferation and associated label dilution may dominate contrast clearance as compared with cell death and subsequent transfer and retention of zzso iron oxide within zzso and brain zzso Thus, interpretation of signal changes during long-term MR cell tracking is complex and requires zzso
