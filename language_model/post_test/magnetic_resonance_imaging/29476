We hypothesized that the evolution of cerebral zzso accompanying cerebral zzso is dependent on age and that such differences would be zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Thus we examined in immature and juvenile rats the relationship between zzso changes in zzso and zzso and the zzso in brain water content, as assessed by differences in tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso rats were zzso and subjected to unilateral carotid artery zzso and subsequent exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps were acquired at zzso zzso and then brain water content was measured in sham controls or in zzso animals before, zzso and 1 or 24 h after zzso In sham controls, zzso zzso and zzso density decreased with increasing age, corresponding to an zzso decrease in water zzso In zzso rats, increases in zzso and zzso were observed during and at 1 and 24 h after zzso corresponding to zzso in water zzso In zzso rats, zzso and water content increased during and at 1 and 24 h after zzso whereas zzso was not increased until 24 h after zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso correlated better with total water content than zzso In both immature and older brain, an increase in total brain water develops acutely and persists after an episode of cerebral zzso and zzso imaging detects this change better than zzso zzso changes in zzso are age dependent, reflecting other zzso changes of water in the tissue than water content zzso
