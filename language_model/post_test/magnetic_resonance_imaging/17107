One of the most influential cognitive models of auditory verbal hallucinations zzso suggests that a failure to adequately monitor the production of one's own inner speech leads to verbal thought being misidentified as an alien zzso However, it is unclear whether this theory can explain the zzso complexity of zzso We aimed to assess whether zzso zzso and experiential characteristics may be linked to neural zzso in the inner speech processing zzso 

Twenty-two patients with schizophrenia and zzso underwent a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while performing a zzso stress evaluation task, which has been shown to activate both inner speech production and perception zzso zzso of interest zzso zzso the putative inner speech network were defined using the zzso Automatic zzso zzso zzso were calculated between scores on the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso Second, the zzso zzso and general zzso severity, zzso by the Positive and zzso zzso zzso were correlated with a language zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were associated with reduced zzso activity in bilateral angular zzso anterior zzso zzso left inferior frontal zzso left zzso and left zzso zzso This could potentially be due to a competition for shared neural zzso Reality on the other hand was found to be associated with reduced language zzso 

Strong zzso of the inner speech processing network may contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso However, a relatively increased contribution from right zzso language areas may be responsible for the more complex experiential zzso such as the zzso source or how real zzso zzso
