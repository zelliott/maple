Attention is commonly thought to be manifest through local variations in neural zzso However, what would be the effects of zzso changes in gain? We hypothesized that global fluctuations in gain zzso the breadth of attention and the degree to which processing is focused on aspects of the environment to which one is predisposed to zzso We found that measures of zzso diameter, which are thought to track levels of locus zzso zzso activity and neural gain, were correlated with the degree to which learning was focused on stimulus dimensions that individual human participants were more predisposed to zzso In support of our interpretation of this effect in terms of global changes in gain, we found that the measured zzso and behavioral variables were strongly correlated with global changes in the strength and zzso of functional zzso as zzso fluctuations of gain would zzso
