With the success of early repair, continued functional assessment of repaired zzso heart disease is critical for improved long-term zzso Pulmonary zzso which is one of the main zzso zzso of zzso heart disease involved with the right zzso zzso such as zzso of zzso and zzso of the great zzso results in progressive RV zzso coupled with pulmonary artery zzso obstruction causing elevated RV zzso The appropriate timing of intervention to correct these zzso zzso remains largely zzso In the present study, we evaluated an zzso end point, namely energy transfer ratio zzso ), to assess the degree of RV and PA inefficiency in a group of zzso heart disease patients with abnormal zzso zzso 

Eight patients with abnormal zzso physiology and six controls with normal zzso physiology were investigated using a previously validated technique that couples cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and invasive pressure zzso 

The mean zzso of the patient group zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso despite the fact that the patient group had a significantly higher RV stroke work zzso to body surface area zzso zzso ) than the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ; P zzso 

We determined that the patients had inefficient zzso physiology due to a combination of RV zzso with pulmonary zzso and RV zzso obstruction leading to an elevated zzso zzso Using coupled magnetic resonance imaging and invasive pressure zzso zzso is determined to be a sensitive zzso end point for measuring zzso zzso It may serve as a diagnostic end point to zzso timing of zzso
