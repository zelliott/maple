To identify and zzso structural changes in the maturing brain between childhood and zzso 

Two three-dimensional zzso MR volumes of the brain were acquired from eight subjects, 6 to 7 years zzso The subjects were 9 to 12 years old on the first scan and 15 to 19 years old on the second zzso The MR scans were converted to one zzso zzso volumes, globally aligned with a rigid zzso zzso corrected, and zzso deformation fields between the aligned volumes were zzso zzso for brain regions were automatically warped with the deformation fields and volumes of brain regions zzso Color zzso based on the zzso deformation fields were generated to identify local volume zzso 

Gray matter decreased as much as zzso and white matter increased as much as zzso The biggest gray matter changes were in the head of the zzso areas of the zzso and areas of the zzso Some of the biggest white matter changes were in the zzso minor, zzso major, and internal zzso 

zzso based zzso with serial scans provides a method to study regional structural changes with brain growth and zzso
