We report on the magnetic resonance findings in two patients with zzso zzso secondary to radiation zzso One patient's zzso wall was high in signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso zzso echo and low in signal intensity on zzso zzso spin echo images, findings consistent with zzso zzso in the setting of zzso zzso zzso The second patient's zzso wall had regions that were low in signal intensity on zzso zzso spin echo and high in signal intensity on zzso zzso spin zzso and other regions that were high in signal intensity on zzso fat suppressed spin echo and on zzso zzso spin echo images, findings that were consistent with active bleeding and late zzso zzso zzso Imaging findings correlated with the patients' clinical zzso Our two cases illustrate that magnetic resonance images may demonstrate changes of zzso zzso and may permit determination of disease zzso
