zzso analysis of zzso data requires correct zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso based on outcomes of a zzso analysis may be hindered by zzso of the multiple comparison zzso while selection based on brain anatomy may be biased due to inconsistent zzso zzso To alleviate these problems we propose a method to define functional zzso without the need for a stringent multiple comparison zzso We extend a flexible framework for zzso analysis zzso Region zzso zzso et zzso zzso to connectivity analysis of zzso zzso This method describes an entire zzso data volume by regions of zzso defined by a limited number of zzso Therefore a less stringent multiple comparison procedure is zzso The regions of zzso from this analysis can be directly used to estimate functional zzso zzso show that zzso Region Fitting can recover the connectivity of brain zzso An application to real data of a zzso experiment highlights the advantages of the zzso
