zzso prostate images were obtained with zzso zzso at zzso after performing zzso local transmit zzso zzso zzso zzso to minimize zzso zzso losses resulting from destructive zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed by altering the input phase of individual zzso channels based on relative zzso zzso phase maps rapidly obtained in zzso for each channel of an zzso zzso zzso The relative transmit zzso needed to maximize zzso zzso zzso within a limited region around the prostate greatly differed from those dictated by zzso geometry and were highly zzso A set of transmit zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso provided a gain in transmit efficiency of zzso zzso zzso in the prostate when compared to the standard transmit zzso determined by zzso zzso This increased efficiency resulted in large reductions in required zzso power for a given flip angle in the prostate which, when accounted for in modeling studies, resulted in significant reductions of local specific zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso within the prostate from (24 zzso zzso to (5 zzso zzso This study demonstrates the tremendous impact of fast local zzso zzso phase zzso on zzso magnetic field body zzso
