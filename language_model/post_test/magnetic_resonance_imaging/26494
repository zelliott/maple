To compare the sensitivity and specificity of three magnetic resonance zzso imaging signs for the diagnosis of superior zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study involved 23 consecutive patients with a type 2, 3, or 4 SLAP tear at zzso and 31 zzso control patients with an zzso normal or type 1 SLAP zzso The superior zzso was evaluated on MR images for high signal intensity extending to the zzso surface in the zzso third of the zzso an irregular or zzso curved area of high signal intensity, or two zzso zzso 

The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso high signal intensity for a type 2, 3, or 4 SLAP tear were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for observer 1 and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for observer zzso For zzso curved area of high signal intensity, these values were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso For two zzso lines, these values were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the presence of either zzso or zzso curved high signal intensity, the sensitivity was zzso for both observers, whereas the specificity was zzso for observer 1 and zzso for observer zzso The zzso values for zzso agreement were zzso for zzso high signal intensity and zzso for zzso curved high signal zzso 

zzso curved and zzso high signal zzso are specific signs for distinguishing a SLAP tear from a zzso superior zzso zzso
