The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of zzso findings in a large cohort of patients undergoing magnetic resonance zzso zzso and to zzso the clinical significance of these zzso 

We zzso analyzed zzso zzso performed in zzso patients referred to our zzso department between zzso The reasons for referral were suspected or proven inflammatory zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso further diagnostic zzso for small zzso disease because of zzso abdominal symptoms zzso zzso zzso zzso or suspected small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso findings were reviewed by a zzso and a zzso and were classified as having high, moderate, or low significance for further diagnostic or therapeutic zzso 

The average age of all patients was zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso findings were detected in 600 of zzso patients zzso Of these findings 180 zzso were judged as having a high, 212 zzso a moderate and zzso zzso a low zzso On a per group basis in patients with zzso zzso of the findings were of major clinical significance compared to zzso and zzso in patients with zzso and zzso zzso The most common major findings were zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso tumors, zzso or masses in the zzso and zzso groups zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso reveals a substantial number of zzso findings, supporting the role of a zzso imaging method for the evaluation of the small zzso
