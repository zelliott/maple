The zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a structural neural correlate of familial major depressive disorder, raising the possibility that the structure of this region may act as a zzso marker of depression zzso The aim of the current study was to determine whether children and adolescents with depressive symptoms have lower zzso volume relative to those without symptoms and examine how a positive family history of depression affects this zzso 

One hundred twelve normal healthy children zzso boys, 53 zzso age 7 to 17, without a current diagnosis or history of depression or other psychiatric illness, were recruited from the zzso zzso symptoms were collected using the zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso zzso measures of the zzso were generated using structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso The relationship of depressive symptoms and zzso volume was zzso 

1) The zzso volume was significantly lower in boys with zzso depressive symptoms compared with boys with no depressive symptoms, particularly on the left side zzso zzso F zzso zzso p zzso zzso 2) There was a negative correlation of zzso volume and depressive symptoms in boys, a finding that was more robust in subjects with a positive family history of zzso 3) In girls, there was not a significant association of depressive symptoms and zzso zzso 

These findings lend further support to the notion that zzso structure may act as a zzso marker of vulnerability or trait marker of zzso
