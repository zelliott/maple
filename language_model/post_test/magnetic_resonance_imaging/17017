This paper describes a general kernel zzso approach to predict experimental conditions from activity patterns acquired with functional magnetic resonance image zzso The standard approach is to use zzso that predict conditions from activity zzso Our approach involves training different zzso machines for each experimental condition, so that a predicted zzso profile is zzso for each zzso A decision function is then used to zzso the responses from the testing volumes into the corresponding category, by comparing the predicted zzso profile zzso by each event, against a zzso zzso response zzso This approach zzso the zzso information in the zzso signal and maintains more training samples in order to improve the zzso accuracy over an existing zzso This paper also introduces efficient techniques of zzso zzso which operate directly on kernel zzso for kernel zzso zzso such as the support zzso machine zzso zzso zzso can convert the kernel zzso from each zzso volume directly into the kernel zzso from zzso average of volumes or zzso zzso The proposed method was applied to three different zzso The first one is a zzso experiment with three conditions of image zzso The method outperformed the zzso zzso of three different types of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our method achieved zzso zzso accuracy for six of the subjects and an average of zzso accuracy across all 16 subjects, exceeding the best zzso zzso result, which was zzso accuracy zzso The second zzso is also a zzso experiment with two conditions of visual attention zzso or zzso Our method yielded zzso accuracy and zzso yielded zzso zzso The third zzso is from a fast zzso experiment with two categories of visual zzso Our method achieved zzso zzso compared with zzso using zzso zzso
