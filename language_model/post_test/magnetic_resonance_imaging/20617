The conscious perception of zzso stimuli is thought to be located in the zzso cerebral zzso However, recent human brain imaging investigations in the spinal system report bilateral primary zzso zzso zzso zzso during unilateral noxious stimuli and that this zzso spinal representation may be independent of zzso zzso In the zzso system, there is zzso evidence for an zzso zzso zzso through the zzso to the face zzso However, the organization of the zzso zzso zzso in the human is not zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether noxious stimuli applied to the face are transmitted to the cerebral zzso by bilateral zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to compare zzso and zzso zzso of the thalamus, zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso during muscle and zzso zzso pain and innocuous facial stimulation in healthy human zzso We found that both muscle and zzso noxious zzso from injections of zzso saline into the right zzso or zzso skin, evoked bilateral increases in signal intensity in the region encompassing the zzso zzso zzso as well as the face region of zzso and zzso In contrast, innocuous unilateral brushing of the lower lip evoked a strict zzso zzso zzso zzso but bilateral zzso of zzso and zzso These data indicate that, in contrast to innocuous zzso from the face, noxious information ascends zzso to the face zzso through the zzso zzso in zzso
