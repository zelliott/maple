The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance zzso imaging for indicating the extent of true tissue necrosis of the liver after zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso findings in dog models and an autopsy zzso 

zzso zzso of the liver zzso was performed on three dogs under general zzso MR appearances of the zzso regions on zzso zzso angle shot zzso repetition zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso train zzso 25) and zzso zzso images were compared with zzso zzso An autopsy case with zzso zzso was also enrolled in this zzso 

All zzso regions showed three zones on zzso zzso zzso a central zone with low intensity, a broad zzso middle zone, and a surrounding zzso zzso The central and middle zones corresponded to the degrees of zzso necrosis observed during zzso examination, whereas no viable cells were seen in these zones during the microscopic examination using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The surrounding zzso band corresponded to zzso congestion in the acute phase and to zzso change in the zzso zzso 

MR imaging using the zzso sequence can accurately determine the extent of the zzso area after zzso zzso
