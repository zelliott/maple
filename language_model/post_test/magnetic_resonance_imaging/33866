The precise functional role of the zzso in human episodic memory is an unresolved question though it has recently been suggested that distinct zzso zzso lobe zzso regions are involved in zzso and retrieval operations zzso For example, a recent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso literature has suggested a zzso functional division in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso retrieval zzso However, a review of the combined PET and zzso literature, reported in the present issue, while noting systematic discrepancies between PET and zzso reaches a conclusion that zzso zzso is involved in zzso Here we present zzso data, from a modified artificial grammar learning zzso that examines two questions concerning the functional role of the zzso and related zzso structures in episodic zzso zzso we test a hypothesis that anterior zzso is activated during zzso and that this response is greater for novel zzso zzso we test whether increasing familiarity with stimulus material is associated with a zzso zzso neural zzso Our empirical findings support both hypotheses in that we demonstrate a left anterior zzso response sensitive to zzso demands and a zzso zzso response sensitive to retrieval zzso Furthermore, we show that both anterior and zzso zzso responses are modulated to the degree to which stimuli can be assimilated into a meaningful zzso zzso
