Clinical 3 T zzso systems are rapidly increasing and zzso systems with a zzso field of 7 T or even more have been zzso The zzso power deposition is zzso to the square of the zzso magnetic field strength and is characterized by the specific zzso rate zzso zzso there exist defined safety limits to avoid heating of the zzso Here, we describe a hybrid method to significantly reduce the zzso compared to a zzso zzso zzso 

We investigate the potential benefits of a combined acquisition technique zzso for zzso zzso at 3 and 7 zzso The zzso zzso experiments were performed on volunteers and patients and compared with standard zzso and zzso zzso zzso and solutions regarding zzso weighted zzso imaging are zzso 

We present in zzso images with zzso and zzso density contrast obtained on 3 and 7 T with significant zzso reduction (up to zzso compared with standard zzso Image quality is comparable to zzso but zzso shows fewer artifacts than a zzso zzso 

zzso is a promising candidate for zzso at high fields up to 7 zzso The zzso reduction allows one to shorten the waiting time between two zzso or to image more slices thereby reducing the overall measurement zzso
