The prevalence of obesity is higher in black than in white zzso zzso in energy economy and physical activity may contribute to this zzso 

The objective of this study was to compare zzso energy expenditure and physical activity in black and white women before and after weight zzso 

Participants were 18 white and 14 black women with body mass indexes (in zzso between 27 and zzso zzso without exercise, was used to achieve a weight loss of zzso zzso and a body mass index zzso After 4 zzso of energy balance in overweight and zzso states, body composition was assessed by using a zzso model, sleeping and resting energy expenditures were assessed by using a chamber zzso zzso stress of exercise and exercise economy were measured by using standardized exercise tasks, and daily energy expenditure was assessed by using doubly labeled zzso 

Weight loss averaged zzso zzso Sleeping and resting energy expenditures decreased in proportion to changes in body zzso Weight reduction significantly improved zzso capacity for exercise in both groups of women, making it easier for them to be physically zzso Black women had lower body zzso energy requirements than did white zzso before and after weight zzso sleep zzso lower, zzso zzso P zzso zzso at rest zzso lower, zzso zzso P zzso zzso during exercise zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and as a daily total zzso lower, zzso zzso P zzso zzso By contrast, zzso physical activity was similar between the zzso 

zzso women had zzso rates appropriate for their body zzso Black women had lower resting and zzso energy requirements in both overweight and zzso states than did white women and did not compensate with greater physical activity, potentially zzso them to greater weight zzso
