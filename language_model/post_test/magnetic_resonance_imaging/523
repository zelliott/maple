zzso brain areas and dynamics evolved to organize motor behavior in our three-dimensional environment also support more general human cognitive zzso Yet traditional brain imaging zzso typically allow and record only minimal participant behavior, then reduce the recorded data to single map features of averaged zzso To more fully investigate the complex links between distributed brain dynamics and motivated natural behavior, we propose the development of zzso mobile zzso imaging zzso systems that continuously capture the zzso zzso electrical brain and muscle signals, three-dimensional body movements, audiovisual scene and point of regard, plus new zzso analysis methods to model their zzso The new imaging zzso should allow new insights into how zzso distributed brain dynamics support natural human zzso and zzso
