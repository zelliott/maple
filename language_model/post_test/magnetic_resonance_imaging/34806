Using a zzso zzso model of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso of the liver was assessed at nine different field strengths over a range of zzso to zzso zzso The zzso values increased zzso with field strength, with all specimens having approximately the same zzso zzso The slope of the field increase, termed zzso zzso zzso relaxation enhancement zzso appeared to be zzso to the chemically determined tissue iron content, zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso The correlation between iron content and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was better than the correlation between iron content and zzso values obtained at single field zzso For zzso containing zzso or zzso 2 zzso zzso wet weight, zzso zzso relaxation behavior emerged at higher field strengths, with the short zzso component zzso water) exhibiting a linear dependence of zzso on field, while zzso of the long component zzso water) was nearly zzso After zzso of the zzso all zzso relaxation zzso became zzso including those for high iron content at high field zzso The present data suggest that the use of zzso MR imaging to assess the zzso zzso zzso has potential for specific zzso of zzso tissue iron zzso
