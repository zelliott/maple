zzso zzso are modestly effective in treating patients with Alzheimer's zzso However, there may be important zzso variations ranging from no improvement at all to significant improvement and long periods of zzso zzso zzso is associated with cognitive decline in elderly zzso 

The objective of this study was to investigate whether carotid zzso thickness zzso predicts response to zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso 

A series of 54 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were enrolled zzso in an zzso zzso At zzso all patients were assessed on the following clinical zzso zzso State zzso Clinical zzso Rating, the zzso zzso zzso Blessed zzso zzso zzso Alzheimer's Disease Assessment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso activities scale zzso Assessment for zzso zzso zzso included magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a zzso zzso scan of the carotid arteries to measure the maximum zzso Patients were then commenced on zzso treatment for 6 months, after which scores on the zzso zzso and zzso scales were zzso 

A total of 50 patients completed the zzso Their mean age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso 34 patients were zzso zzso treatment decreased the mean zzso score from zzso to zzso points, but this difference was not statistically significant zzso On the zzso scale, a modest and zzso mean difference of zzso points zzso was zzso A weak zzso zzso zzso but significant correlation between zzso and changes in clinical scale score was found, with low carotid zzso being shown to be a predictor of response on both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these findings were zzso in zzso zzso For men, the correlation was stronger zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Although the magnitude of effect was moderate, carotid zzso could be a significant predictor of clinical response to zzso zzso in patients with Alzheimer's zzso
