Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from significant motor zzso and accompanying cognitive and affective dysfunction due to progressive disturbances of zzso zzso gating zzso Parkinson's disease has a long zzso stage, which indicates a substantial capacity of the human brain to compensate for zzso nerve zzso before clinical manifestation of the zzso zzso studies provide evidence that increased zzso cortical activity can compensate for progressive zzso nerve zzso in carriers of a single zzso zzso or zzso zzso who show a mild but significant reduction of zzso metabolism in the zzso zzso in the complete absence of clinical motor zzso However, it is currently unknown whether similar zzso mechanisms are effective in zzso zzso zzso gating zzso Here, we ask whether zzso zzso zzso carriers show altered patterns of brain activity during processing of facial zzso and whether this might compensate for zzso facial emotion recognition zzso Current theories in social zzso assume that execution and perception of facial gestures are linked by a special class of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso zzso area zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso carriers would show increased activity in this area during processing of affective facial zzso replicating the zzso motor effects that have previously been observed in these zzso Additionally, zzso zzso carriers might show altered activity in other zzso zzso gating zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers and eight matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and a subsequent facial emotion recognition zzso As predicted, zzso zzso carriers showed significantly stronger activity in the right zzso zzso zzso during execution and perception of affective facial gestures than healthy zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso carriers showed a slightly reduced ability to recognize facial emotions that was least severe in individuals who showed the strongest increase of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso carriers showed a significantly weaker than normal increase of activity in the left lateral zzso zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso which was unrelated to facial emotion recognition zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso during processing of affective facial gestures can reduce zzso in facial emotion recognition in zzso zzso zzso zzso A breakdown of this zzso mechanism might lead to the impairment of facial zzso and facial emotion recognition observed in manifest Parkinson's zzso
