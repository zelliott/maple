zzso zzso remains a disabling complication caused by treatment for breast zzso The increased thickness of the zzso layer and the increased volume of the zzso represent the most important contributions to the total swelling of the zzso zzso imaging of the subcutaneous layer results in different patterns of reflected ultrasound waves depending on the zzso zzso that occurred due to impaired zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare these zzso images with those obtained using magnetic resonance imaging to explain the nature of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Patients were recruited from the Breast Clinic at the University Hospital zzso 

Seven women zzso age 60 zzso with unilateral breast cancer who subsequently developed zzso 

The water displacement technique was applied to determine arm volumes, and zzso and magnetic resonance images were used to evaluate changes in tissue zzso 

zzso zzso of the arm zzso affected arm zzso zzso vs unaffected arm zzso zzso showed a significant increase in total arm volume of 703 zzso zzso confidence zzso 324 to zzso zzso Using zzso the thickness of the zzso and subcutaneous layers showed an average increase of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The differences between the affected arm and the unaffected arm for all upper and lower arm zzso zzso zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso were zzso but no significant differences were registered for hand zzso On zzso the zzso showed uniform changes, with a zzso zzso appearance compared with the zzso side due to water zzso Different patterns of structural changes could be zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso due to the diffuse spread of water through the zzso zzso zzso areas surrounded by zzso streaks zzso on magnetic resonance imaging as zzso tissue surrounded by fluid embedded in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso due to the overgrowth of zzso tissue with a minimal amount of zzso 

zzso images can help to determine the likelihood that complex physical therapy will reduce zzso and evaluate treatment results by measuring tissue thickness and evaluating tissue zzso
