It is well known that restrictive lung disease zzso is associated with zzso This study identifies that zzso lung disease zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We searched a local database for patients with zzso who underwent a pulmonary function testing zzso from 2004 to zzso All patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with a Cobb angle of zzso degrees and acceptable and zzso zzso testing were included in the zzso OLD was defined as an forced zzso volume in the first zzso vital capacity ratio below zzso confidence zzso zzso videos and zzso zzso scans or magnetic resonance images were reviewed to identify zzso causes of lower airway zzso 

A total of 18 patients met the criteria for zzso The median age at diagnosis was zzso zzso The median primary Cobb angle was 60 zzso The prevalence of OLD was zzso and zzso was zzso The 6 children with OLD underwent zzso zzso and chest zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging to identify zzso causes of lower airway zzso The 4 children with OLD and zzso major zzso zzso had zzso of the right zzso zzso between the spine zzso and the right pulmonary artery zzso The 2 children with OLD and zzso major zzso zzso had zzso of the left zzso zzso between the spine zzso and the descending zzso zzso or the left atrium zzso 

In our study, the prevalence of OLD in children with zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso which was elevated when compared with the population prevalence of zzso to zzso zzso airway zzso from spine rotation was discovered to be the potential mechanism of zzso 

Level IV, zzso study investigating the effect of a patient characteristic on the outcome of zzso
