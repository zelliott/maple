Near infrared zzso zzso is an increasingly popular technology for studying brain zzso zzso presents several advantages relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso such as measurement of concentration changes in both zzso and zzso zzso finer zzso resolution, and ease of administration, as well as zzso most prominently inferior spatial resolution and decreased zzso ratio zzso While zzso has become the gold standard for in zzso imaging of the human brain, in practice zzso is a more convenient and less expensive technology than zzso It is therefore of interest to many researchers how zzso compares to zzso in studies of brain zzso In the present study we scanned participants with simultaneous zzso and zzso on a battery of cognitive tasks, placing zzso zzso over both frontal and zzso brain zzso We performed detailed comparisons of the signals in both zzso and spatial zzso We found that zzso signals have significantly weaker zzso but are nonetheless often highly correlated with zzso zzso Both zzso and the distance between the scalp and the brain contributed to zzso in the zzso zzso In the spatial domain, we found that a zzso path forming an zzso between the zzso zzso and detector correlated most strongly with the zzso zzso Taken together these findings suggest that, while zzso can be an appropriate substitute for zzso for studying brain activity related to cognitive tasks, care should be taken when designing studies with zzso to ensure that: 1) the spatial resolution is adequate for answering the question of interest and 2) the design accounts for weaker zzso especially in brain regions more zzso from the zzso
