The zzso charged contrast agent zzso distributes zzso to the cartilage fixed charged zzso This enables structural cartilage examinations by zzso zzso In line with the development of a clinically zzso protocol for such zzso this study describes the zzso pattern of zzso distribution in zzso knee cartilage at three different doses in healthy zzso zzso volunteers zzso zzso zzso were examined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation rate zzso were made in zzso central parts of zzso cartilage using sets of five zzso inversion recovery images with different inversion zzso The cartilage was analyzed before and four times zzso zzso after an intravenous injection of zzso at single, zzso and triple zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso body weight, zzso The increase in zzso zzso was zzso zzso at all zzso The highest zzso values were registered at 2 and 3 h zzso suggesting 2 h to be optimal in the clinical zzso The triple dose indicated a subtle zzso difference in men, with higher contrast distribution zzso than zzso zzso suggest that the triple dose is needed to detect minor cartilage zzso zzso
