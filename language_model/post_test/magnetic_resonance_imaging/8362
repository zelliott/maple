Information processing speed is a central concept in cognitive psychology and zzso Previous studies have mostly focused on mean reaction time zzso and largely ignored zzso differences (the standard zzso of the zzso zzso Still, zzso inconsistency across trials has been shown to correlate with age, neurological disorders, intelligence, and performance on cognitive zzso However, zzso has not been correlated with zzso zzso Such knowledge is important to the understanding of the zzso foundation for zzso zzso In the present study, white matter zzso and cortical gray matter zzso volume obtained from the average of two MR scans of 71 healthy participants zzso zzso zzso were correlated with zzso and mean zzso obtained from a zzso visual oddball zzso zzso correlations were hypothesized between zzso and zzso and between mean zzso and cortical zzso zzso These hypotheses were zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso volume was significant also independently of effects of age, zzso and mean zzso while there was a trend towards a significant correlation zzso between cortical zzso volume and mean zzso independently of zzso A path model was constructed, showing that age and zzso gave independent contributions to the zzso in performance intelligence, and that zzso volume predicted performance score through the influence of zzso Further, zzso was a stronger predictor of performance intelligence than mean zzso It is concluded that zzso and mean zzso may have different zzso zzso and that zzso is related to zzso characteristics of the zzso
