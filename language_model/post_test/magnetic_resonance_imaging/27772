Although focal zzso are increasingly recognized to affect multiple and remote neural systems, the underlying zzso pattern and the relationships between zzso spontaneous seizures, global functional zzso and structural integrity remain largely zzso 

Here we zzso serial zzso functional zzso zzso analysis of complex brain networks and diffusion zzso imaging to characterize the evolution of global network zzso functional connectivity and structural changes in the zzso brain in relation to focal zzso in a rat zzso zzso networks exhibited a more regular functional zzso than controls, indicated by a significant increase in shortest path length and zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity in zzso brains zzso while zzso functional connectivity zzso zzso reductions of fractional zzso were found in white matter regions not restricted to the vicinity of the zzso focus, including the corpus zzso 

Our zzso study on the zzso of network dynamics in zzso brains reveals that, despite the locality of the zzso area, zzso brains differ in their global network zzso connectivity and structural integrity from healthy zzso
