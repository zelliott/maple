zzso zzso are often located in the vicinity but not necessarily within the boundaries of zzso brain zzso zzso of these tumors is based on two major zzso first, maximizing tumor removal without provoking new zzso deficits, and second, minimizing zzso seizure zzso zzso source imaging zzso depicts the generators of magnetic fields zzso on individual magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso application areas are zzso located adjacent to or partly within the sensory and motor cortex, or in the depth of the brain, zzso a surgical approach through functionally highly relevant cortical zzso zzso zzso is also zzso for zzso spike zzso recording during zzso zzso 

A patient with a zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso scheduled for zzso and tumor surgery was investigated with zzso The zzso data showed an zzso spike focus outside the tumor zzso The resulting zzso images were integrated into our zzso zzso This procedure allowed for the zzso identification of the sensory and motor cortex, the precise zzso of the zzso spike focus, and careful planning of the surgical zzso In this case, we were able to safely zzso the zzso tumor and the zzso spike focus under general zzso using zzso zzso guidance but no conventional zzso mapping zzso 

zzso source imaging can be a valuable, zzso method for planning and performing tumor zzso in high-risk brain regions, especially if an zzso spike focus has to be localized and included into the zzso zzso
