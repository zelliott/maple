zzso zzso The widespread occurrence of muscular zzso during zzso and its reversal presents an important challenge to rehabilitation zzso We used zzso resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso ankle zzso fractures to zzso changes in zzso and zzso muscle size during zzso and rehabilitation, as well as to evaluate changes in force generating capacity zzso zzso 

zzso participated in a 10 zzso rehabilitation program after 7 zzso of zzso zzso were acquired at zzso 2, and 7 zzso of zzso and at 5 and 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso muscle strength testing was performed at 0, 5, and 10 zzso of zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, the majority of which occurred during the first 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, more than 50% of zzso during rehabilitation occurred within the first 5 zzso of rehabilitation for both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso when compared to the total amount of zzso over 10 zzso of rehabilitation zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso or zzso of the zzso or zzso muscles, despite a rehabilitation emphasis on the zzso Patients had significantly lower zzso specific zzso zzso than healthy, control subjects immediately after cast zzso which did not return to normal after 10 zzso of rehabilitation zzso zzso zzso 

Our investigation of the consequences of limb zzso on rehabilitation outcomes in patients can be applied directly to zzso rehabilitation zzso Although muscle zzso occurred early during rehabilitation, zzso muscle function zzso zzso should remain the focus of rehabilitation programs because although zzso recovered quickly, specific zzso still lagged behind that of control zzso
