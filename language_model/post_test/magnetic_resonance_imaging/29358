zzso surfaces frequently zzso the object of interest yet are easily dealt with by the visual zzso Here, we test whether neural areas known to participate in motion perception and eye movements are regions that also process zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to assess brain zzso while subjects watched a moving ball become zzso Areas activated during zzso motion included the zzso zzso zzso as well as middle zzso zzso regions analogous to monkey zzso A second experiment showed that these results were not due to motor zzso These findings suggest that human cortical regions involved in zzso zzso motion are similar to regions that process real motion and regions responsible for eye zzso The zzso zzso may be involved in predicting the location of an unseen target for future hand or eye zzso
