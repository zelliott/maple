The purpose of this study was to assess the value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to guide zzso of zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso zzso often are associated with zzso zzso zzso can be used to precisely define zzso zzso 

zzso was performed in 29 consecutive patients zzso age 50 zzso 15 zzso with zzso zzso ejection fraction 37 zzso zzso referred for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or premature zzso complexes zzso zzso was extracted from zzso and was then integrated into the zzso zzso zzso data were correlated with respect to the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso was identified by zzso in 14 of 29 zzso Nine of these patients had VT and 5 had zzso In 5 of the patients there was predominantly zzso scar, and mapping and zzso of zzso was effectively performed from the zzso in all 5 zzso In 2 patients zzso was either zzso or zzso with extension to the zzso In both patients with partial zzso zzso extension, the zzso was effective in eliminating some but not all zzso In 2 patients most of the zzso tissue was confined to the zzso mapping identified and eliminated an zzso origin in both zzso No effect on zzso could be achieved in the other 5 patients with predominantly zzso zzso 

zzso in patients without prior zzso can help to identify the zzso zzso zzso it helps to plan an appropriate mapping and zzso zzso
