zzso characterization of different zzso of the liver can be achieved by differences of relaxation time on changing of pulse sequences in magnetic resonance imaging zzso The usefulness of zzso for detection of liver disease is limited when the pathological change is zzso Chemical shift is a fundamental characteristics in nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Chemical shift imaging zzso in zzso is based on the different zzso frequency of zzso in water and zzso and therefore it was able to enhance the effectiveness of zzso For this study, zzso method was used to detect liver zzso and compare its zzso with conventional pulse zzso Forty cases were enrolled for study; they included 5 health volunteers, 15 zzso 1 zzso 5 zzso zzso tumors and 14 fatty zzso In zzso tumors, the zzso number, tumor zzso and zzso contrast in images were read and zzso Signal zzso zzso ratio and zzso ratio were zzso after zzso from stored zzso In fatty zzso the relative change of signal zzso in different areas of the liver in zzso and zzso images were compared with the back muscle and zzso to find where the fatty metamorphosis zzso zzso in spin echo or zzso echo pulse sequences was found to be adequate and valuable for detecting fatty liver, when compared with conventional zzso zzso not only identified the extension of disease itself but also characterized the fatty change in liver zzso Though zzso zzso no further advantages than conventional pulse sequences for detection of zzso tumors, occasionally, when the image quality of the conventional pulse sequences is not satisfactory or zzso in zzso zzso the use of zzso might be zzso
