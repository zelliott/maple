zzso zzso zzso zzso is a term used to describe zzso vascular zzso characterized by massive zzso of one or more zzso zzso these zzso are typically associated with zzso zzso Such zzso can present zzso but their early natural history and anatomy is poorly zzso 

We reviewed five years of autopsy experience and retrieved three primary vascular zzso of the fetal zzso zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso 

Fetal ultrasound and zzso obtained between 19 and 23 weeks zzso age demonstrated in all cases zzso of the zzso zzso In two cases vascular zzso were present in either the zzso zzso zzso (one of three) or the associated zzso zzso (one of zzso All cases were zzso at zzso weeks zzso zzso In one there was imaging and autopsy evidence of zzso of the zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso In two cases, no zzso zzso was identified on initial imaging, but only became evident at zzso One case showed zzso overlap with vein of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso shunt and vein of zzso zzso The other demonstrated a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso of feeding vascular zzso or of the zzso zzso zzso may be zzso The early in zzso zzso trajectory of zzso zzso zzso zzso is poorly defined and deserves further zzso
