To evaluate the agreement between zzso ultrasound zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

From January 2010 to January 2012, 86 consecutive patients with zzso zzso tumors were included in this zzso The mean age of the patients was zzso years zzso zzso zzso The tumors were all zzso zzso on zzso The zzso was defined by the penetration of the zzso zzso a: 0 to 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso Early tumors as zzso zzso 5 zzso and advanced tumors as zzso zzso 5 zzso All patients underwent zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was performed with a zzso T Philips zzso The zzso findings were blinded to the zzso performing the interpretation of the zzso images and measuring the depth of zzso tumor zzso 

zzso found 51 patients to have an early zzso zzso tumors and 35 to have an advanced zzso whereas zzso zzso 48 as early zzso zzso tumors and 38 as advanced zzso No patients with tumors classified as advanced by zzso were found to be early on zzso The zzso value in zzso early versus advanced zzso zzso tumors was zzso zzso zzso zzso We found a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the total zzso between the two zzso The mean zzso tumor outgrowth measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In 19 of the 86 patients the following CT scan or surgery revealed distant zzso of the 51 patients in the ultrasound zzso group three zzso had zzso whereas 16 zzso of 35 in the zzso group zzso distant zzso P zzso zzso The odds ratio of having distant zzso in the ultrasound zzso group compared to the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean zzso ultrasound measured outgrowth was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients without distant zzso while the mean zzso outgrowth was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients with zzso P zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso three zzso of 48 in the zzso zzso group had distant zzso while 16 zzso of the 38 in the zzso zzso group, P zzso zzso The zzso odds ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso measured outgrowth was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients without distant zzso while the mean zzso outgrowth was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients with zzso P zzso zzso 

There is good agreement between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Distant zzso are more frequent in the advanced zzso
