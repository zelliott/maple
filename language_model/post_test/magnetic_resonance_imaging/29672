Changes in zzso indexes during normal aging, including reduced early filling zzso zzso zzso E zzso time zzso zzso late filling zzso and prolonged zzso relaxation time zzso have been attributed to slower left zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso Indeed, this constellation of findings is often referred to as the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso filling is determined by the zzso pressure zzso which depends on both zzso decline and left zzso zzso pressure zzso To assess the relative influence of zzso decline and zzso we studied 122 normal subjects aged zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso decline was assessed by color zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Early zzso zzso was evaluated using pulmonary vein flow zzso zzso pulmonary vein flow zzso zzso color zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso Linear zzso showed the expected reduction of zzso increase in A, and zzso of zzso and zzso with advancing zzso There was no relation of age to parameters reflecting the rate of zzso zzso However, older age was associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased pulmonary vein zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso pulmonary vein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso all suggesting reduced early zzso zzso reduced early filling in older adults may be more closely related to a reduced early zzso zzso than to slower zzso zzso This effect also explains the prolonged zzso We zzso that changes in LA active or passive properties may contribute to development of the abnormal relaxation pattern during the aging zzso
