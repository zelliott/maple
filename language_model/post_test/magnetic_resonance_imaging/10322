A delayed zzso zzso has been observed in patients receiving zzso zzso for childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso may help to distinguish between zzso stroke and zzso zzso Although conventional zzso zzso have been described for this zzso syndrome, zzso data are largely zzso Our objective is to present a retrospective analysis of the zzso findings in four patients who suffered zzso zzso after zzso zzso 

We reviewed the medical records of four patients, who were seen by us between July 2000 and February 2004 for sudden onset of a central neurological syndrome within days of zzso zzso Patients underwent standardized zzso within 48 h of symptom zzso zzso included zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of all patients revealed zzso zzso zzso within the zzso white matter corresponding to areas of restricted zzso diffusion on zzso zzso zzso exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular zzso Complete resolution of symptoms within zzso days was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso findings in this cohort seem to reflect zzso zzso within cerebral white matter suggesting a zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso as the basis for this zzso
