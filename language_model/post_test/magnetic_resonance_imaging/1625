zzso take a long time to respond to the slow visual motion of an zzso It is not known what neural mechanism causes this zzso We measured zzso neural responses to light spot motion onset within a wide speed range zzso degrees zzso and compared these with human reaction times zzso The mean response zzso was zzso related to the speed of motion up to 100 degrees zzso whereas the zzso increased with the zzso The response property at the speed of 500 degrees zzso was different from that at the other zzso The zzso zzso change was observed when the motion duration was 10 zzso or longer in the speed range between 5 and 500 degrees zzso indicating that the response is directly related to the speed zzso The source of the response was estimated to be around the human zzso and was validated by functional magnetic imaging study using the same zzso The results indicate that the speed of motion is zzso in the neural activity of zzso and that it can be detected within 10 zzso of motion zzso zzso to the same motion onset was also zzso related to the speed of motion but the delay could not be explained by the magnetic response zzso zzso Instead, the zzso of zzso was zzso related to the zzso of the magnetic response zzso suggesting that the visual process interacts with other neural processes for decision and motor zzso
