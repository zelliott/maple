We propose a method for retrospective motion correction of zzso data in simultaneous zzso that employs the zzso array as a sensitive motion zzso zzso motion artifacts are used to generate motion zzso describing zzso head movements with zzso zzso zzso These zzso are zzso for zzso motion correction of zzso zzso zzso Performance of the method is demonstrated by correction of zzso data from five patients with major depressive disorder, who exhibited head movements by zzso during a resting zzso zzso The zzso zzso corrected using eight to ten zzso motion zzso show significant improvements in zzso zzso zzso of zzso time series, particularly in the frontal brain regions and near the surface of the zzso The zzso improvements are as high as 50% for large brain areas in zzso analysis and as high as zzso when the results are averaged across the zzso zzso application of the zzso motion correction and zzso noise correction by means of zzso leads to average zzso enhancements as high as zzso for extended brain zzso These zzso improvements are largely preserved after the subsequent zzso volume registration and zzso of zzso motion zzso The proposed zzso method of retrospective zzso motion correction zzso to as zzso can be applied to improve quality of zzso data with severe motion artifacts and to reduce zzso correlations between the zzso and zzso data caused by head zzso It does not require any specialized equipment beyond the standard zzso zzso and can be applied zzso to any existing zzso data zzso
