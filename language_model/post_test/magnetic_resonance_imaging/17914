Children with zzso zzso often present with limitations in using their impaired upper limb which impacts on independence in activities of daily living, zzso participation and quality of zzso Traditional therapy has adopted a zzso training approach zzso and more recently, modified constraint induced movement therapy zzso has emerged as a promising zzso zzso Evidence of enhanced zzso following zzso suggests that the sequential application of zzso followed by zzso training may zzso outcomes zzso zzso It remains unclear whether more intensely delivered group based interventions zzso are superior to distributed models of zzso zzso This study aims to determine the optimal density of upper limb training for children with zzso zzso 

A total of 50 children zzso in each zzso with zzso zzso will be recruited to participate in this zzso comparison zzso Children will be matched in pairs at baseline and randomly allocated to receive an intensive block group hybrid model of combined zzso followed by intensive zzso training delivered in a day camp model zzso total dose 45 hours zzso 10 hours of indirect zzso or a distributed model of standard occupational therapy and zzso care zzso over 12 weeks zzso 45 hours direct and indirect zzso Outcomes will be assessed at 13 weeks after zzso and retention of effects tested at 26 zzso The primary outcomes will be zzso coordination and zzso zzso zzso Secondary outcomes will be participation and quality of zzso Advanced brain imaging will assess zzso changes in response to zzso Analysis will follow standard principles for zzso using zzso comparisons on all participants on an zzso zzso Comparisons will be between treatment groups using generalized linear zzso
