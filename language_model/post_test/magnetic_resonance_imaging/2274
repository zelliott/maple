zzso can demonstrate subtle zzso changes of the right zzso in patients with idiopathic right zzso zzso tract zzso zzso The present study examines the zzso and significance of right zzso zzso abnormalities detected by zzso with respect to the site of successful zzso zzso zzso of the clinical zzso 

The study population comprised 20 patients zzso age, zzso zzso undergoing elimination of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed before zzso to assess RV volumes and function, as well as structural abnormalities of the RV zzso Ten healthy zzso and zzso subjects served as control zzso The successful zzso sites, as documented by zzso of the zzso position, were compared with zzso zzso Patients with zzso showed no difference in respect to RV volumes and ejection zzso compared with control zzso Whereas RV abnormalities were limited to prominent fatty deposits of the right zzso groove extending into the inlet portion of the RV wall in 2 of 10 control subjects, zzso studies demonstrated zzso changes of the RV free wall in 13 zzso of 20 patients with zzso including presence of fatty tissue zzso wall thinning zzso and zzso wall segments zzso Eight of these patients had additional fat deposits, zzso or a zzso aneurysm in the RV zzso zzso corresponding with the zzso site in 6 zzso 

In zzso structural abnormalities of the right zzso can be detected in a substantial number of patients despite normal RV volumes and global zzso zzso abnormalities within the RV zzso tract are significantly associated with the origin of zzso
