Both the frontal eye fields zzso and supplementary eye fields zzso are known to be involved in smooth pursuit eye zzso It has been shown recently that stimulation of the zzso area of the zzso zzso pursuit area zzso in monkey increases the pursuit response to unexpected changes in target motion during zzso In the current study, we applied zzso magnetic stimulation zzso to the zzso and zzso in humans during zzso pursuit to assess its effects on the pursuit response to zzso rather than unexpected, changes in target zzso For the zzso we found that zzso applied immediately before the target reversed direction increased eye zzso in the new direction, whereas zzso applied in zzso immediately before the target began to slow, decreased eye zzso For the zzso zzso applied at target reversal increased eye zzso in the new direction but had no effect on eye zzso when applied at zzso zzso of the control region zzso region of the zzso zzso did not affect eye zzso at either zzso Previous stimulation studies of zzso during pursuit have suggested that this region is involved in controlling the gain of the transformation of visual signals into pursuit motor zzso The current results suggest that the gain of the transformation of zzso signals into motor commands is also controlled by the zzso The effect of stimulation of the zzso is distinct from that of the zzso and suggests that its role in zzso pursuit is primarily at the target direction zzso
