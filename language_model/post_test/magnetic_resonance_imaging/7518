zzso are called decisions under uncertainty when either prior information is incomplete or the outcomes of the decision are zzso zzso in these processes related to decisions under uncertainty have been linked to zzso In patients with zzso the underlying neural networks have only rarely been zzso We aimed to zzso the neural zzso of decision-making and relate them to zzso and zzso parameters in a large sample of patients with schizophrenia and healthy zzso zzso patients and zzso healthy volunteers from six centers had to either indicate via zzso from which of two bottles red or blue balls were drawn zzso under uncertainty zzso or indicate whether eight red balls had been presented zzso zzso while zzso signal was measured with zzso Patients based their decisions on less conclusive evidence and had decreased zzso in the underlying neural network, zzso of zzso and lateral frontal as well as zzso areas, as compared to healthy zzso While current zzso was not correlated with brain zzso positive symptoms led to longer decision zzso in zzso These results suggest that decision-making under uncertainty in schizophrenia is affected by a complex interplay of zzso neural zzso Furthermore, reduced zzso functioning in patients was related to impaired decision-making and task performance was modulated by distinct positive zzso
