Eleven bipolar adolescents with zzso zzso and 15 bipolar adolescents without zzso were recruited to participate in zzso zzso A single-digit continuous performance task zzso with a control task in a zzso zzso zzso comparisons were made using zzso zzso zzso correlations were made between performance and zzso 

Group performance did not significantly differ in percentage correct zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with less zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso 10) and anterior cingulate, and greater zzso in zzso zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with substantial differences in patterns of correlation between performance and zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso in bipolar adolescents is associated with zzso of alternative pathways during performance of a simple attention zzso The pattern of differences suggests that bipolar adolescents with zzso zzso demonstrate decreased zzso of prefrontal regions, compared with bipolar adolescents without zzso and zzso recruit portions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
