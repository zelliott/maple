zzso zzso are complex, three-dimensional communities found nearly everywhere in nature and are also associated with many human zzso zzso zzso information is critical to understand and exploit beneficial zzso as well as combat zzso zzso zzso However, most current techniques used to measure zzso and spatial zzso profiles in these delicate structures are invasive or zzso Here, we describe imaging, transport and zzso measurement methods and their correlation for live, zzso monitoring of zzso zzso This novel combination of zzso is enabled by the use of an integrated nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and zzso laser scanning microscope zzso zzso methods provide zzso structure, zzso zzso and rate data, zzso resolved zzso zzso and water diffusion profiles within the zzso In particular, current zzso zzso methods are applied to detect zzso in zzso zzso volumes within zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and the oral zzso implicated in zzso disease, zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso sample chamber also contains a transparent optical window allowing for the collection of complementary zzso information using a unique, zzso zzso In this example, the entire three-dimensional zzso structure was zzso using magnetic resonance zzso This was then correlated to a fluorescent zzso image by employing a green fluorescent protein reporter construct of zzso zzso zzso techniques such as described here, which enable zzso of dynamic zzso zzso especially in a zzso fashion, are expected to advance our understanding of processes occurring within zzso zzso
