To determine the effects of zzso white matter zzso zzso on cognitive zzso we used zzso tests and zzso to study 150 elderly volunteers free of zzso or general zzso There were 76 zzso individuals without and 74 zzso with zzso The latter subset was older zzso zzso zzso years versus zzso zzso zzso years, p zzso zzso had a higher mean zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a larger zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso with zzso performed worse than their counterparts without such abnormalities on all tests zzso After adjusting for the group differences in age, zzso blood pressure, and zzso size, we noted statistically significant results on form B of the Trail Making Test zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso a complex reaction time task zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the assembly procedure of the Purdue zzso Test zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso correlations did not reveal any relationship between test scores and the zzso assessed total area of zzso Our data suggest that the presence of zzso exerts a subtle effect on zzso performance of normal elderly individuals, which becomes particularly evident on tasks measuring the speed of more complex mental zzso
