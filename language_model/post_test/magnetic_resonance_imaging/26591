zzso and zzso abnormalities in zzso structures have been reported in children with prenatal methamphetamine zzso zzso The current study was designed to zzso functional zzso to the zzso circuit in children with prenatal MA exposure using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Because many women who use MA during pregnancy also use alcohol, a known zzso we examined 50 children (age range zzso 19 with prenatal MA exposure, 15 of whom had zzso prenatal alcohol exposure (the zzso group), 13 with heavy prenatal alcohol but no MA exposure zzso group), and 18 zzso controls zzso zzso We hypothesized that MA exposed children would demonstrate abnormal brain zzso during a zzso working memory zzso zzso zzso As predicted, the zzso group showed less zzso than the zzso group in many brain areas, including the zzso and frontal lobe in the left zzso The zzso group showed less zzso than the zzso group in several regions, including the right zzso We found an inverse correlation between performance and activity in the zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso However, this relationship was significant in the zzso of the zzso group but not the zzso group, and in the zzso of the zzso group but not the zzso zzso These findings suggest that structural damage in the zzso circuit after prenatal MA exposure leads to decreased recruitment of this circuit during a zzso challenge, and raise the possibility that a zzso of zzso networks may occur in children with prenatal MA zzso
