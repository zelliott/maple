The purpose of this study was to investigate the spatial similarity of vocal tract shaping patterns across speakers and the similarity of their acoustic zzso zzso tract area functions for 11 American English zzso were obtained from six speakers, three female and three male, using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Each speaker's set of area functions was then zzso into mean area zzso and representative modes zzso using principal components analysis zzso Three modes accounted for more than zzso of the zzso in the original data sets for each zzso The general shapes of the first two modes were found to be highly correlated across all six zzso To demonstrate the acoustic effects of each mode, both in isolation and combined, a mapping between the mode zzso zzso and zzso zzso pairs was generated for each zzso The zzso were unique for all six speakers in terms of the exact shape of the zzso zzso vowel space, but the general effect of the modes was the same in each zzso The results support the idea that the modes provide a common system for zzso a unique underlying neutral vocal tract zzso
