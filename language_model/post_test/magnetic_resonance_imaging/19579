To evaluate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance zzso imaging to guide and monitor zzso therapeutic zzso 

zzso therapeutic procedures were performed with MR imaging guidance in eight dogs by using a zzso MR unit with zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso were surgically created in four zzso The ability to zzso track, and position zzso guide zzso and zzso detachable coils was zzso zzso were first positioned with zzso zzso Tracking and depiction were achieved with MR imaging by using commercially available zzso filled with a zzso zzso solution and a fast, zzso zzso zzso zzso sampling zzso 

When either a zzso or the zzso space between a zzso and a guide wire was filled with a solution of zzso zzso zzso movement was always zzso In the animals with zzso it was possible to depict movement of a zzso into and out of the zzso This was achieved by zzso reconstructed images obtained during zzso movement onto a previously acquired MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detachable coils were successfully positioned and zzso zzso obliteration was monitored with the acquisition of new road map zzso 

The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MR imaging to guide zzso therapeutic zzso
