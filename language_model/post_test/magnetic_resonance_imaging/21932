To assess the reliability and zzso of functional MR imaging and magnetic source imaging for mapping the zzso zzso 

Parallel studies were performed in eight volunteer subjects in whom both zzso were measured with the use of painless tactile stimulation of the tip of each index zzso zzso source imaging was performed using a zzso zzso evoked magnetic fields were analyzed using the zzso zzso representation to ascertain the zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was performed on a zzso MR zzso zzso of images during periods of rest and zzso were acquired using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso in which signal intensity correlated with the stimulus zzso A subsequent requirement for spatial connectivity of zzso was imposed to reduce the random occurrence of zzso satisfying the correlation zzso 

Using zzso and spatial statistical criteria for zzso we found that functional MR imaging showed zzso in 1 of 16 zzso In three cases, this was accompanied by activity either zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso source imaging showed zzso zzso location in all 16 zzso Where successful zzso was achieved with both methods, the separation between sources appeared to be between 1 and 4 zzso zzso MR imaging zzso tended to lie more zzso than the magnetic source imaging zzso Performance of a simple motor task, rather than use of zzso zzso resulted in a cortical signal change zzso with a similar functional MR imaging approach in all cases, suggesting the more robust nature of this zzso 

zzso mapping of the zzso zzso can be achieved with functional MR imaging or magnetic source zzso zzso MR imaging yields more zzso locations and fails to show zzso more zzso If zzso signal propagation pathways are of interest, the zzso resolution of functional MR imaging alone may be zzso A combination of magnetic source imaging and functional MR imaging may allow improved sensitivity, fewer zzso results, and high spatial and zzso zzso
