Duplex zzso collecting systems are common zzso anomalies of the upper urinary zzso In most cases they are incidental findings and not associated with additional zzso They zzso however, higher zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most comprehensive zzso and functional evaluation of duplex systems can be achieved using magnetic resonance zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso allows better separation of the zzso zzso thus more accurate calculation of the differential zzso functions compared with zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso is the study of choice when upper urinary tract anatomy is complex or when functional evaluation is zzso
