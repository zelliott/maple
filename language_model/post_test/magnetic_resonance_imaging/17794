zzso can develop at any age for reasons that remain poorly zzso The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a family history of zzso zzso on the zzso and recurrence of zzso 

This retrospective study was conducted in zzso central hospital, zzso Saudi Arabia between January and June zzso The medical records of zzso patients were analyzed to test the impact of zzso on the risk factors, zzso and diagnosis of zzso determined by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso was seen in 140 patients zzso symptomatic in 152 zzso and zzso in 128 patients zzso zzso was seen in 113 patients zzso which was associated with younger at the disease onset (15 years vs 20 years, zzso zzso zzso was seen more in patients with zzso zzso vs zzso p value zzso and generalized zzso zzso or zzso were also seen more in patients with zzso zzso vs zzso p value zzso zzso zzso was also seen more in patients with zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso were the best predictor for the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more than idiopathic zzso or younger age at zzso zzso 

zzso has a significant impact on zzso its zzso and the zzso findings, and may zzso the presence of a genetic zzso which could be related to a high zzso of zzso seen in our zzso zzso zzso zzso were the best predictor for zzso which may suggest the presence of familial zzso
