Previous studies have demonstrated zzso zzso in response to fearful faces even if presented below the threshold of conscious visual zzso It has also been proposed that zzso regions are selectively sensitive to low spatial frequency zzso zzso However, chronic zzso may reduce zzso zzso in panic disorder zzso Our aim was to establish whether the zzso is engaged by masked and zzso fearful faces in zzso as compared to healthy zzso zzso faces were used as the mask zzso Thirteen zzso patients zzso zzso six zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and 15 healthy volunteers zzso zzso eight zzso mean zzso zzso zzso underwent two passive viewing tasks during a zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso as zzso 1) presentation of faces with fearful versus neutral expressions zzso using a backward masking procedure and 2) presentation of the same faces whose spatial frequency contents had been manipulated by zzso zzso Level of awareness was confirmed by a forced choice zzso zzso Whereas controls showed bilateral zzso to fearful masked faces versus neutral faces, patients failed to show zzso within the zzso zzso stimuli did not elicit zzso response in either group, contrary to the view that zzso information plays a crucial role in the processing of facial expressions in the zzso zzso suggest zzso zzso responses to potentially threatening visual stimuli in zzso zzso
