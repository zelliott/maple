The place of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the monitoring of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso is not codified except during the diagnostic zzso Several studies in the literature have shown that zzso load measured on an zzso done at the beginning of the disease or its increase during the first years had a zzso value, although moderate, on the occurrence of long-term disability as measured by the zzso Early worsening of brain zzso during the early stages of the disease is zzso of worsening cognitive impairment in the following zzso zzso an zzso is not required when setting up a zzso zzso therapy zzso such as an zzso treatment but it is useful because it can be used as a reference scan in case of treatment zzso The indications of zzso zzso whether prescribed in zzso patients with an active disease or after failure of a zzso zzso are based on combined criteria incorporating zzso data acquired in the previous 3 months compared with a recent zzso Thus the practical criteria for failure of zzso zzso are partly based on zzso During zzso therapy, identification of disease activity on an zzso conducted 1 year after the start of the treatment can predict treatment failure in combination with clinical criteria, such as relapses occurring during the first zzso Finally, zzso is essential to the safety monitoring of patients on zzso to detect progressive zzso zzso zzso In patients at high risk for zzso tested positive for zzso virus zzso and having received zzso for more than 2 years, it could be proposed to do a short zzso with zzso and diffusion weighted imaging sequences every 3 months to detect zzso zzso
