This review aims to present and interpret evidence that methamphetamine dependence is associated with disorder of brain function that is required for zzso control of zzso 

Presented here are findings from brain imaging studies of human research participants with histories of chronic methamphetamine abuse in the context of functional consequences and implications for treatment of their dependence on zzso 

Brain imaging studies have revealed differences in the brains of research participants who have used methamphetamine chronically and then zzso from taking the drug, compared with healthy control zzso These abnormalities are prominent in cortical and zzso systems, and include deficits in markers of zzso and zzso neurotransmitter systems, differences in zzso metabolism and deficits in gray zzso These abnormalities accompany cognitive deficits, including evidence of impaired zzso zzso 

zzso deficits in zzso methamphetamine abusers can affect a wide range of functions that can be important for success in maintaining drug zzso These include but are not limited to zzso of responses to environmental stimuli as well as internal triggers that can lead to craving and zzso Potential therapies may combine behavioral approaches with medications that can improve cognitive zzso
