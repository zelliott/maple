A new pulse zzso dubbed FAIR zzso separate zzso measurement zzso in which a zzso zzso recovery acquisition is added in addition to the standard FAIR zzso alternating inversion zzso zzso was developed for quantitative zzso imaging and zzso zzso The technique allows for clean separation between and thus simultaneous assessment of zzso and zzso effects, whereas quantitative cerebral blood flow zzso and tissue zzso values are monitored zzso Online zzso maps were obtained using the zzso technique and the measured zzso values were consistent with the zzso zzso maps obtained from using the FAIR technique in combination with a separate sequence for zzso zzso Finger tapping zzso studies were carried out to demonstrate the zzso of the zzso technique in a typical zzso setting for zzso zzso The relative zzso and zzso changes induced by zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the relative oxygen consumption rate change was zzso zzso zzso The results from correlation of the zzso maps with the zzso images on a zzso basis show that the mean zzso value of the zzso zzso zzso is close to the zzso of gray matter while the mean zzso value of the zzso zzso zzso is close to the zzso range of blood and zzso zzso
