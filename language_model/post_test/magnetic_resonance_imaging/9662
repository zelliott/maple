It is well known that most zzso stimulate the zzso system but the time course of the brain regions activated by these chemical zzso remains poorly zzso especially regarding the zzso zzso This functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study compares brain zzso resulting from the contrast between two zzso conditions (one zzso odor and one relatively pure zzso zzso according to the duration of the stimulation zzso one zzso or three or six successive zzso The results show striking differences in the main brain regions activated according to these zzso The zzso nucleus and the zzso zzso are only involved in zzso zzso and the zzso insular zzso and zzso zzso zzso are only activated by long duration zzso Different regions of the zzso zzso and zzso lobe are activated depending on the duration but mainly during zzso zzso These results expand on the findings of previous studies and contribute to the description of zzso networks in zzso zzso
