Because eye movements are a fundamental tool for spatial zzso we hypothesized that the neural bases of these movements in humans should be under right cerebral dominance, as already described for spatial zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 27 right-handed participants who zzso central fixation with either large or small visually guided zzso zzso equally performed in both zzso zzso functional asymmetry was analyzed to identify whether brain regions showing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anatomical asymmetry was also estimated to assess its influence on the zzso functional zzso Right zzso zzso of a zzso system were observed in the lateral frontal eye fields zzso the anterior part of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso third of the superior zzso zzso zzso the zzso junction zzso zzso the middle zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso zzso The present rightward functional zzso were not related to differences in gray matter zzso zzso positions between right and left zzso in the zzso zzso superior zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso zzso were explained for almost zzso of the zzso by a difference in the position of the right and left zzso zzso Left zzso zzso of a zzso motor system were observed in the zzso zzso and in the motor strip eye field along the zzso zzso They were not explained by zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso motor asymmetry is part of a general dominance of the left motor zzso in zzso which must include an effect of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that, although bilateral by nature, the brain network involved in the execution of zzso irrespective of their direction, presented specific right and left zzso that were not related to anatomical differences in zzso zzso
