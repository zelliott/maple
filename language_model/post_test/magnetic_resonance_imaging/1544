zzso zzso fast zzso MR imaging provides excellent depiction of the zzso and zzso segments of the zzso and facial zzso zzso or reduction in caliber of the cochlear nerve zzso has been described in association with zzso zzso hearing loss zzso zzso of cochlear nerve integrity may be important for diagnosis and management of zzso 

We zzso reviewed high-resolution zzso fast zzso MR images of 22 patients examined for zzso who had zzso of the cochlear zzso Images were evaluated for the presence and comparative size of the component nerves zzso zzso superior zzso and inferior zzso zzso relative size of the internal auditory canal zzso and any associated inner ear zzso The clinical history, results of the clinical examination, and zzso findings were reviewed for each zzso 

zzso of the cochlear nerve was observed in 12 patients with zzso zzso and in 10 patients with acquired zzso zzso of the zzso was observed in association with zzso zzso of the cochlear nerve in 11 of 12 zzso zzso of the cochlear nerve was observed in association with acoustic zzso in two cases and with acquired labyrinthine abnormalities in seven zzso zzso of the zzso was not observed in association with acquired zzso 

zzso of the cochlear nerve can be shown by high-resolution zzso fast zzso MR zzso zzso may be observed in association with zzso or acquired zzso and may be important in the assessment of patients for cochlear zzso zzso of the zzso is an indicator of zzso cochlear nerve zzso
