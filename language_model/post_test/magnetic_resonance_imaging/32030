The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes between magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods in permanent prostate zzso 

Between October 2004 and March 2006, a total of 52 consecutive patients with prostate cancer were treated by zzso and zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso The accuracy and zzso were zzso compared between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso related parameters as recommended by the American zzso zzso 

The prostate volume was zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso without statistical zzso The prostate zzso was zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the difference was statistically significant zzso The prostate zzso was zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the difference was statistically significant zzso 

Our current results suggested that, as with fusion images, MR images allowed accurate zzso of the zzso but they tended to overestimate the analysis of zzso zzso in comparison to zzso fusion zzso Although this zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was acceptable and zzso in comparison to zzso zzso because the difference between zzso and zzso zzso results was smaller than that between zzso and zzso zzso results as previously zzso
