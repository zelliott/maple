zzso fatigue syndrome is diagnosed by a set of clinical criteria and therefore is probably zzso Earlier reports tested the hypothesis that the syndrome had a neurological zzso by doing studies of cerebral blood flow zzso but with zzso zzso One possible reason for the zzso was that relative zzso was zzso We found reduced zzso in an earlier study of absolute zzso using zzso The purpose of this study was to use a second method of assessing zzso and to look within the study group for zzso of zzso 

Eleven zzso patients and 10 age matched healthy controls underwent zzso using zzso spin labeling to determine their regional and global absolute zzso A template was constructed based on the control data, and individual patient montages were compared on a case by case basis to determine if differences in regions of interest zzso 

The patients as a group had significantly lower global zzso than the zzso The reduction in zzso occurred across nearly every region zzso Nine of the 11 patients showed these reductions compared to the average control data, while two patients showed actual increases relative to the zzso 

The data extend our earlier observation that zzso patients as a group have broad decreases in zzso compared to healthy zzso However, as expected, the effect was not homogeneous in that 2 of the 11 patients studied showed actual increases in zzso relative to zzso
