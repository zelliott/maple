Observing and learning actions and behaviors from others, a mechanism crucial for survival and social interaction, engages the mirror zzso zzso To determine whether vision is a necessary prerequisite for the human mirror system to develop and function, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity in zzso blind individuals during the auditory presentation of zzso actions or environmental sounds, and the motor pantomime of manipulation tasks, with that in sighted volunteers, who additionally performed a visual action recognition zzso zzso blind individuals activated a zzso cortical network in response to zzso presented actions that overlapped both with mirror system areas found in sighted subjects in response to visually and zzso presented zzso and with the brain response zzso by motor pantomime of the same zzso Furthermore, the mirror system zzso showed a significantly greater response to motor familiar than to unfamiliar action sounds in both sighted and blind zzso Thus, the mirror system in humans can develop in the absence of zzso The results in blind individuals demonstrate that the sound of an action engages the mirror system for action zzso that have not been learned through the visual zzso and that this activity is not zzso by visual zzso These findings indicate that the mirror system is based on zzso sensory representations of actions and, zzso that these abstract representations allow individuals with no visual experience to interact effectively with zzso
