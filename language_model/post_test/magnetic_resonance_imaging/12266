A zzso zzso contrast agents zzso has been developed using zzso zzso zzso The zzso with pH sensitivity were zzso based on zzso zzso block zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso have a zzso shape with a uniform size of zzso zzso at zzso pH zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso environment zzso zzso the zzso were zzso due to the zzso of the zzso groups of zzso blocks, causing them to break apart into positively charged zzso zzso As a result, the zzso exhibit highly effective zzso MR contrast enhancement in the tumor region, which enabled the detection of small tumors of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso T within a few zzso
