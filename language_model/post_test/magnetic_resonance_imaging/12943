zzso zzso represents a rare zzso tumor that is typically difficult to distinguish from zzso based on clinical presentation and zzso zzso These inherently aggressive zzso have been observed to occur in numerous zzso zzso however, isolated involvement of the zzso is essentially zzso The authors present a case of a young lady with presumed right acoustic zzso which proved to be zzso on zzso The case is zzso and a review of the literature pertaining to the diagnosis, optimal management, and follow-up for these zzso is zzso 

A 37-year-old Asian woman presented with a zzso history of right ear and zzso zzso as well as zzso hearing loss involving the right zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of a zzso enhancing zzso zzso in the right zzso zzso suggestive of an acoustic zzso The zzso proved to be an zzso zzso on zzso zzso Review of the zzso literature yielded only one prior detailed account of zzso confined to the zzso The patient underwent right zzso zzso for gross total zzso of the mass, followed by zzso zzso several weeks zzso 

Given the fundamentally different treatment approach for zzso over other more common zzso tumors, it is imperative that the treating surgeon consider this rare diagnosis when evaluating patients with zzso localized to this zzso Specifically, gross total zzso followed by zzso zzso provides patients with the highest probability for zzso survival, based on current evidence in the zzso zzso
