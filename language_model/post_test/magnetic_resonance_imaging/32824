Memory deficits are highly prevalent in multiple sclerosis zzso As the zzso is crucial to memory processing, a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso task was used to investigate changes in zzso function in zzso patients with and without cognitive zzso Fifty patients with zzso zzso cognitively preserved zzso and 16 cognitively impaired zzso and 30 healthy controls completed an episodic memory zzso task zzso and zzso that was used to specifically activate the zzso During zzso of correctly remembered items, increased brain zzso was seen in the zzso areas zzso and in the left anterior zzso zzso in the zzso patients compared to the controls zzso Z zzso zzso P zzso zzso No brain areas showed less zzso In zzso patients the right zzso areas and the prefrontal zzso showed less brain zzso compared to controls zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the left zzso showed increased zzso in zzso patients when compared to controls zzso Z zzso zzso P zzso zzso No significant differences were found on structural zzso measures between the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest the presence of functional adaptation in the memory network before cognitive decline becomes evident in zzso as displayed by the increased brain zzso in the zzso memory system in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso patients showed less zzso in the zzso network during correct zzso These findings are important for future cognitive therapeutic studies, since cognitive intervention might be most effective before cognitive impairment is present and when zzso changes of the brain are most zzso
