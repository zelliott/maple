High mobility group zzso zzso plays an important role in triggering inflammatory responses in many types of zzso In this study, we examined the involvement of zzso in traumatic brain injury zzso and evaluated the ability of zzso administered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso brain zzso 

zzso brain injury was induced in rats or mice by fluid zzso zzso zzso or control zzso was administered zzso after zzso 

zzso zzso remarkably inhibited fluid zzso brain zzso in rats, as detected by zzso magnetic resonance zzso this was associated with zzso of zzso zzso protection of zzso barrier zzso integrity, suppression of inflammatory zzso zzso and improvement of motor zzso In contrast, intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso produced the opposite zzso zzso using zzso for advanced zzso end product zzso , zzso zzso zzso , and zzso mice suggested the involvement of zzso as the zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso may provide a novel and effective therapy for zzso by protecting against zzso disruption and reducing the inflammatory responses induced by zzso
