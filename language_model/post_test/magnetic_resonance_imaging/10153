Since genetically modified mice have become more common in biomedical research as models of human disease, a need has also grown for efficient and quantitative methods to assess mouse zzso One powerful means of zzso is characterization of anatomy in zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso requires zzso of structures in zzso zzso of complex shape differences between mouse zzso and detection of subtle or diffuse abnormalities during zzso survey zzso These aims can be achieved with imaging techniques adapted from clinical zzso such as magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso These imaging technologies provide an excellent zzso method for zzso of anatomy in live individuals or zzso The computer-based analysis of these images then allows thorough anatomical zzso We present an automated method for analyzing zzso data zzso This method uses image registration to identify corresponding anatomy between control and zzso zzso zzso and zzso shape differences are used to map regions of significantly differing zzso These regions are highlighted and represented zzso by zzso and volume zzso This methodology is demonstrated for a partially characterized mouse zzso generated by zzso zzso that is a putative model of the human syndrome zzso zzso caused by point zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso
