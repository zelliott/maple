Human zzso experiments typically zzso zzso zzso zzso by contrasting responses to stationary and moving zzso It has long been suspected that zzso located on the lateral surface at the zzso zzso boundary, contains several distinct visual field zzso although only one coarse map has been zzso Using a novel functional zzso zzso method we identified two zzso and zzso measured population receptive field zzso sizes within these zzso The angular representation of the first map, zzso has a lower vertical zzso on its zzso side at the boundary with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The angular representation continues through horizontal to the upper vertical zzso at the boundary with the second map, zzso The zzso angle map reverses from upper to lower visual field at increasingly anterior zzso The TO maps share a parallel zzso map in which zzso is represented in the zzso zzso both maps have an expanded zzso zzso There is a progressive increase in the zzso size from zzso to zzso and zzso with the largest zzso sizes in zzso Further, within each map the zzso size increases as a function of zzso The visual field coverage of both maps extends into the zzso visual field, with larger sensitivity to peripheral zzso stimuli in zzso than that in zzso The TO maps provide a functional zzso of human zzso zzso that enables a more complete characterization of processing in human zzso zzso
