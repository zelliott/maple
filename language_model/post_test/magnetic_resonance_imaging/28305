Basic zzso growth factor zzso has documented zzso zzso This study was performed to evaluate the effects of zzso on zzso size when administered 30 minutes after induction of focal cerebral zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used during the drug zzso 

We blindly zzso 20 zzso rats to receive either drug zzso zzso 10) or vehicle zzso zzso zzso The animals underwent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso was initiated 30 minutes after induction of zzso and repeated frequently for zzso zzso Drug zzso zzso per zzso or vehicle zzso infusion began 30 minutes after zzso zzso and continued for 3 zzso zzso images were made at 25, 90, and 150 minutes after zzso zzso The animals were killed after 24 hours of permanent zzso zzso and brains were stained with zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso corrected zzso volume zzso in the zzso group was significantly smaller than that in controls zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso imaging showed essentially equal zzso volumes 3 hours after zzso zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso 65 zzso in zzso At 4 hours, zzso zzso size was zzso zzso zzso zzso in treated animals and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging did not show a change of cerebral zzso within zzso brain regions in the zzso group during the zzso No behavioral or zzso side effects were zzso 

zzso is a safe and effective treatment for focal cerebral zzso in zzso We observed a modest delayed difference of zzso zzso size in zzso with diffusion zzso The zzso zzso findings suggest a potential delayed therapeutic effect of zzso and the zzso imaging findings imply that the effect is not due to increased blood flow to the zzso zzso
