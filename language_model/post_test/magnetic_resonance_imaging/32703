zzso zzso transfer zzso imaging has been applied to zzso assess brain pathology in several diseases, especially multiple sclerosis zzso To date, however, because of the high power deposition associated with the use of short, rapidly repeating zzso zzso clinical application has been limited to lower field zzso The zzso ratio zzso of zzso is zzso and this method would greatly benefit from the use of higher magnetic fields and zzso zzso zzso However, power deposition is zzso to the square of the magnetic field and scales with zzso size, and zzso experiments are already close to the zzso limit at zzso even when smaller transmit coils are used instead of the body zzso Here we show that these seemingly great obstacles can be ameliorated by the increased zzso of tissue water at higher field, which allows for longer maintenance of sufficiently high zzso levels while using a reduced duty zzso This enables a fast zzso zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition with excellent anatomical zzso of gray matter zzso and white matter zzso structures, and even zzso The method is demonstrated in nine normal volunteers and five patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the results show a clear zzso of zzso zzso
