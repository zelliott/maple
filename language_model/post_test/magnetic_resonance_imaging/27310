The overall volume of the brain has been found to be under relatively strong genetic control, but the relative strength of genetic and environmental factors on zzso variations in regional cortical thickness in adolescence is still not well zzso Here, we analyzed structural zzso data from 108 14-year-old healthy twins (54 zzso zzso to determine the relative contributions of genes and the environment toward regional variations in gray matter thickness across the zzso After zzso cortical thickness values at a high spatial resolution, an zzso structural equation model that divides the variations into additive genetic zzso shared zzso and unique zzso environmental components was zzso There was considerable regional zzso in the magnitude of genetic influences on cortical thickness after controlling for zzso zzso with genetic contributions of greater than zzso were observed in the prefrontal cortex, predominantly in the bilateral zzso and zzso superior frontal zzso No region showed prominent shared environmental zzso but unique environmental influences of over zzso were found in zzso association zzso The genetic zzso for cortical thickness in adolescents in prefrontal regions overlapped with previous findings in zzso However, the unique environmental effects observed in zzso zzso association zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso regions, and neighboring secondary association zzso suggest that these regional variations are more shaped by experience and could form targets for early interventions in youth with behavioral zzso
