zzso tip zzso is of high importance in magnetic resonance imaging zzso guided zzso procedures, for example for taking zzso from suspicious zzso in the liver or zzso The exact position of the needle tip is often obscured by image artifacts arising from the magnetic properties of the zzso The authors investigated two special biopsy needle tip designs using zzso zzso For common zzso MR zzso the needle tip can be identified in the MR image by several zzso dark spots arranged along a straight zzso A dotted instead of a solid line allows for an improved control of the movement of the needle, not only if the needle is zzso toward the imaging plane, but also if the needle leaves an empty canal with signal zzso which cannot be distinguished from the needle material zzso With the proposed design the position of the needle tip can be estimated with a precision of approximately 1 zzso using conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso as used for zzso zzso Furthermore, the size of the biopsy probe can be estimated from the zzso In using needles with a properly designed tip zzso taking zzso under MR control is beginning to be greatly zzso The approach to design artifacts using zzso material in combination with zzso material zzso the way toward new instruments and zzso suitably tailored to the needs of the zzso zzso
