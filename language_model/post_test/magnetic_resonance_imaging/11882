To describe a modified surgical approach for patients who maintain hearing function with jugular zzso tumors that extend to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 

A retrospective review of 6 patients with jugular zzso tumors that were zzso by a combined zzso and zzso zzso 

A combined zzso and zzso approach is characterized as zzso 1) There is no zzso of ear structures except the zzso zzso zzso the zzso is zzso zzso while preserving the zzso wall and skin of the ear zzso 2) After superficial zzso a limited length of nerve zzso from the zzso vertical segment is zzso to divisions of the zzso zzso 3) The tumor is removed along with the internal jugular vein and zzso zzso then the extended zzso mass is zzso through an additional zzso zzso 

Five of the 6 patients had complete removal of all gross zzso There were no major complications or zzso The zzso levels of hearing were preserved in 5 of the 6 zzso zzso facial function in the immediate zzso period was noted in 4 of the 6 zzso zzso paralysis of 2 patients recovered zzso 

We propose that a combined zzso and zzso approach to the jugular zzso can provide sufficient exposure to zzso most zzso tumors, and it could be the initial treatment of choice for patients with remnant zzso
