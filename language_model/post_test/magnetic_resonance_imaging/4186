Data acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging are often contaminated by head zzso As a result, optimal information regarding zzso (or zzso signal changes cannot be zzso zzso registration methods, including intensity correlation or minimum intensity zzso techniques, are widely used to register two or more zzso It is shown here that zzso registration cannot accurately register two or more images in the presence of local intensity changes arising from functional magnetic zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we present a zzso technique that can be used not only for a more robust zzso but also to help differentiate between zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso obtained using both phantom and human brain images demonstrate advantages of this technique compared with a conventional intensity registration zzso
