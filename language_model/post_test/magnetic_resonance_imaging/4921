zzso data suggest a link between the spontaneous production of thoughts during zzso rest and slow fluctuations of activity in the default mode network zzso a set of brain regions with high zzso metabolism and a major neural hub in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulation of zzso are core cognitive components of most zzso practices and to study their impact on zzso activity, we collected functional zzso zzso data from a cohort of experienced Zen zzso and zzso controls engaging in a basic zzso zzso We observed a significant group difference in the zzso of the zzso zzso signal from the zzso suggesting that the relative zzso of states of elevated zzso activity was lower in zzso zzso the same zzso was significantly correlated with performance on a rapid visual information processing zzso test for sustained attention conducted outside the zzso Finally, a functional connectivity analysis with the zzso seed revealed a significant association of zzso performance with the degree of zzso correlation between zzso and the right zzso junction zzso a region strongly implicated in zzso zzso of zzso Together, these findings suggest that the zzso zzso signal zzso and the zzso relationship of zzso and zzso activities reflect the dynamic tension between zzso zzso and directed attention, and may represent a useful zzso for studying individual differences in zzso abilities and the impairment of the latter in specific clinical zzso
