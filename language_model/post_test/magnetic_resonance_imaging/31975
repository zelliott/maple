zzso zzso is most commonly used to study the local changes in blood flow that accompanies zzso zzso In this work we introduce a new approach towards acquiring and analyzing zzso data that instead provides the potential to study the initial oxygen consumption in the brain that accompanies zzso As the oxygen consumption is closer in timing to the underlying zzso activity than the subsequent blood flow, this approach promises to provide more precise information about the location and timing of zzso Our approach is based on using a new single shot zzso zzso imaging sequence which samples a small central region of zzso zzso every zzso thereby giving a low spatial resolution snapshot of the brain with extremely high zzso zzso zzso and simple rules for implementing the trajectory are zzso together with a straightforward reconstruction zzso Using our approach allows us to effectively study the behavior of the brain in the time immediately following zzso through the initial negative zzso response, and we discuss new techniques for detecting the presence of the negative response across the zzso The feasibility and efficiency of the approach is confirmed using data from a zzso task and an zzso zzso The results of these experiments provide a proof of concept of our methodology, and indicate that rapid imaging of the initial negative zzso response can serve an important role in studying zzso tasks involving rapid mental processing in more than one zzso
