To investigate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to zzso the carotid vessel wall using a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was compared with a zzso zzso Images from volunteers were evaluated for artifacts, wall zzso and wall signal zzso Signal intensity and zzso of zzso were zzso zzso diameter and vessel area were zzso 

zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso imaging resulted in good zzso between blood and vessel zzso Most volunteers had a zzso vessel wall with a zzso inner zzso zzso showed both homogeneous zzso and zzso zzso which consisted of a main zzso part with zzso spots and/or intermediate zzso zzso zzso and area zzso were performed zzso 

High resolution zzso of carotid zzso is feasible with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso
