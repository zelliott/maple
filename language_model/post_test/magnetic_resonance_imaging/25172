The cortical circuits zzso neural processing of human language are localized to the inferior frontal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso language dominance has been related to anatomical asymmetry of zzso area and the zzso zzso The evolutionary history of these zzso patterns, however, remains zzso Although testing of hypotheses about the evolution of language areas requires comparison to zzso regions in the brains of our closest living relatives, the great apes, to date little is known about normal zzso variation of these regions in this zzso Here we focus on zzso area 44 in African great apes zzso zzso and zzso zzso This area zzso to the zzso zzso of the inferior frontal zzso zzso and has been shown to exhibit both gross and zzso zzso in zzso We calculated zzso of zzso variations and mapped the distribution of zzso area 44 to determine whether its boundaries occurred at consistent zzso zzso A considerable amount of variation was found in the distribution of the inferior frontal zzso among great zzso zzso The inferior zzso zzso in particular was often zzso which made it impossible to determine the zzso boundary of the zzso zzso In addition, the distribution of zzso area 44 showed very little correspondence to surface zzso We conclude that gross zzso patterns do not offer substantive landmarks for the measurement of zzso area 44 in great zzso Whether or not zzso area zzso of great apes exhibits zzso asymmetry can only be resolved through further analyses of zzso zzso
