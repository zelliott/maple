Disorders related to social functioning including zzso and schizophrenia differ drastically in zzso and severity between males and zzso Little is known about the neural systems underlying these zzso differences in risk and zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task involving the visual perception of zzso displays of coherent and scrambled biological motion, we discovered sex differences in the development of neural systems for basic social zzso In adults, we identified enhanced activity during coherent biological motion perception in females relative to males in a network of brain regions previously implicated in social perception including amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These sex differences were less pronounced in our sample of school-age zzso We zzso that the robust neural zzso supporting social perception in zzso which zzso from males beginning in childhood, may zzso sex differences in disorders related to social zzso
