Clinical features, brain magnetic resonance imaging findings and zzso scores of 11 patients with neurodegenerative central nervous system zzso cell zzso were analyzed in zzso All patients initially had zzso zzso cell zzso 8 at 1-2 years of age and 3 at a later zzso zzso central nervous system zzso cell zzso disease developed after a median time zzso of zzso years from initial zzso With a median follow-up of zzso years, 6 patients showed progression of disease with an zzso score zzso This study demonstrates the importance of early detection of neurodegenerative central nervous system zzso cell zzso by brain magnetic resonance imaging, particularly in the follow-up of patients who developed zzso zzso cell zzso in early zzso
