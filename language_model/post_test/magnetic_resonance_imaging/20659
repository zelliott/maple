Although hearing has been described for many underwater species, there is much debate regarding if and how zzso detect zzso Here we zzso the acoustic sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso acoustic and zzso acceleration zzso Sound field pressure and particle motion components were measured from 30 to 10,000 zzso and acceleration stimuli were measured from 20 to 1000 zzso zzso were determined using auditory evoked zzso zzso with zzso placed near the zzso zzso zzso were generated by both stimuli and consisted of two wave zzso zzso rapid zzso waves, and zzso zzso zzso waves, similar to some fish zzso zzso were obtained between 30 and 500 zzso with lowest thresholds between 100 and 200 zzso At the best zzso zzso zzso were often zzso zzso zzso zzso were extinguished at all zzso if zzso water temperatures were less than zzso zzso zzso were zzso or zzso recording zzso were placed in locations other than near the zzso Both the zzso response characteristics and the range of responses suggest that zzso detect sound similarly to most fish, with the zzso acting as an zzso through which zzso detect the particle motion component of a sound zzso The zzso and frequency range indicate that zzso probably detect acoustic particle motion stimuli from both predators and prey as well as zzso environmental sound signatures that may aid zzso
