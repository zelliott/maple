The objective of this study was to determine the value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging and to clarify the characteristics of each image among three-dimensional zzso echo zzso two-dimensional spin echo zzso and inversion recovery zzso sequences used as zzso zzso images for zzso zzso treatment planning of zzso zzso 

Pulse sequences of zzso and zzso zzso recalled acquisition in the steady state zzso using zzso at zzso T and zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 3 T after injection of contrast material were acquired for 14 small zzso zzso As quantitative methods, zzso ratios zzso and zzso ratios zzso were evaluated using a zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference in zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso was superior to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso provided significantly better zzso than zzso between tumor and normal zzso 

Three zzso was found to be superior to zzso T in distinguishing tumors from the normal zzso zzso zzso dose planning will zzso each advantage of zzso zzso allows high-resolution acquisition and zzso and zzso can offer better tissue zzso
