Heart failure remains a major cause of mortality in zzso zzso The possible role of cardiac zzso in zzso major in the genesis of heart failure is not zzso It is also unclear whether cardiac zzso might arise as a result of heart zzso 

We studied 45 patients with zzso major who had a wide range of current cardiac iron loading and included patients with prior and current heart zzso zzso iron was measured using zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso and following this, late zzso enhancement zzso was used to determine the presence of zzso zzso zzso 

The median zzso zzso in all patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fibrosis was detected in only one patient, whose zzso zzso was zzso zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso No zzso was identified in 5 patients with a history of heart failure with full recovery, in 3 patients with current left zzso dysfunction undergoing treatment, or in 18 patients with zzso iron loading with zzso zzso 20 zzso at the time of zzso 

This study shows that zzso zzso zzso is uncommon in zzso major across a broad spectrum of zzso iron zzso zzso there was no zzso zzso in patients with current or prior heart failure, or in patients with zzso iron loading without heart zzso Therefore if zzso zzso indeed contributes to zzso dysfunction in zzso our data combined with the knowledge that the zzso dysfunction of iron overload can be zzso indicates that any such zzso would need to be both microscopic and zzso
