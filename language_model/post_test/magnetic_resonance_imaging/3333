zzso prediction of clinical changes of mild cognitive impairment zzso patients, including both qualitative change zzso conversion to Alzheimer's disease zzso and quantitative change zzso cognitive zzso at future time points, is important for early diagnosis of zzso and for monitoring the disease zzso In this paper, we propose to predict future clinical changes of zzso patients by using both baseline and zzso zzso zzso To do this, we first develop a zzso feature selection method to jointly select brain regions across multiple time points for each zzso Specifically, for each time point, we train a sparse linear zzso model by using the imaging data and the corresponding clinical scores, with an extra zzso zzso to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across multiple time points together and to allow for selection of brain regions based on the strength of multiple time points zzso Then, to further reflect the zzso changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of zzso features from the original baseline and zzso zzso Finally, we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different zzso for prediction by using our previously proposed zzso zzso We validate our method on 88 zzso zzso subjects, with both zzso and zzso data and the corresponding clinical scores zzso zzso and zzso at 5 different time zzso We first predict the clinical scores zzso and zzso at zzso by using the zzso data at previous time points, and then predict the conversion of zzso to zzso by using the zzso data at time points which are at least zzso ahead of the zzso The results on both sets of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance in predicting future clinical changes of zzso patients than the conventional zzso
