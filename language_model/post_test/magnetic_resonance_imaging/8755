To determine whether smoking is related to change in zzso and zzso cartilage, and the development or persistence of bone zzso zzso zzso over 2 years in a cohort of middle-aged zzso 

Two hundred and zzso adult subjects recruited from the Melbourne Collaborative zzso Study underwent an zzso of their dominant knee at baseline and approximately 2 years zzso zzso volume and zzso were determined for both time zzso At zzso subjects also completed a questionnaire about current and past cigarette zzso 

Being a zzso zzso or zzso was associated with increased annual loss of zzso but not lateral or zzso cartilage volume zzso difference zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso lateral difference zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A relationship between increasing zzso smoked and increased zzso cartilage volume loss was also observed zzso zzso zzso zzso people who had a zzso at zzso zzso present in zzso zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso times more likely to persist over 2 years than those present in zzso zzso In addition, the relationship between smoking and increased zzso cartilage loss for subjects with a zzso present at baseline was partially zzso by the persistence of the zzso over 2 zzso 

This study contributes to the evidence of a zzso effect of smoking on joint zzso Furthermore, it provides a possible mechanism that the association smoking shares with increased cartilage loss may be zzso via smoking zzso the ability for zzso to zzso
