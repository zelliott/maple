Here we report a case of primary central nervous system zzso zzso with cortical zzso zzso The present case showed an acute onset of focal zzso signs and bilateral cortical zzso surrounded by peripheral white matter zzso on magnetic resonance zzso A part of the left frontal cortical zzso was zzso on zzso images and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso images, suggesting zzso zzso zzso The patient was initially diagnosed with multiple zzso zzso but a biopsy zzso revealed diffuse large zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the tumor cell zzso and membrane stained positively for zzso zzso growth factor zzso The present case zzso the danger of making a specific zzso diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings alone and that zzso examination following brain biopsy is necessary for a correct zzso zzso zzso growth factor expression might be associated with the zzso zzso
