Network analysis of functional brain imaging data is an innovative approach to study circuit abnormalities in neurodegenerative zzso In Parkinson's disease, spatial zzso analysis of zzso zzso images has identified specific regional patterns associated with motor and cognitive zzso With functional imaging, these zzso networks have recently been used to measure zzso progression and to evaluate novel treatment zzso Network analysis is also being used to characterize specific functional zzso for zzso disease and Alzheimer's zzso These networks have been particularly helpful in uncovering zzso mechanisms in genetically zzso zzso zzso developments in network applications are likely to enhance the role of functional imaging in the investigation of neurodegenerative zzso
