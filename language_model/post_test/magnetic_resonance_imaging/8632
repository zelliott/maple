In this paper, we present an evaluation study of a set of registration strategies for the alignment of sequences of zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance breast zzso The accuracy of the optimal registration strategies was determined on unseen zzso The evaluation is based on the simulation of physically plausible breast zzso using finite element methods and on zzso image pairs without visually zzso motion zzso The zzso of the finite element model was chosen according to its ability to predict in zzso breast zzso for two zzso We zzso transformations for ten patients with 12 simulated zzso zzso These zzso were applied to the zzso image to model patient motion occurring between zzso and zzso image zzso The original zzso images were registered to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso The performance of several registration zzso zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso for five of the ten zzso The images were most accurately aligned with zzso zzso zzso registration employing 40 or 20 zzso control point zzso When tested on the remaining five patients the optimal zzso reduced the average mean registration error from zzso to zzso zzso for the whole breast tissue and from zzso to zzso zzso for the enhancing zzso These results were obtained on average within 26 zzso zzso for 40 zzso zzso control point zzso The visual appearance of the difference images from 30 patients was significantly improved after 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso registration in comparison to no registration or rigid zzso No substantial volume changes within the region of the enhancing zzso were introduced by this zzso zzso
