zzso facial zzso in dogs is conventionally diagnosed by exclusion of structural and zzso causes of a single zzso zzso To investigate the reliability and zzso of zzso for supporting a diagnosis of facial zzso in dogs, we examined MR images of the zzso from 20 dogs with presumed idiopathic facial zzso and 20 control zzso Two different types of zzso sequence were zzso zzso zzso zzso examination zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso Three independent observers, blinded to the case details, were presented with zzso images in a random order, and were required to indicate the presence of zzso of the facial nerve following intravenous contrast zzso The zzso nerve was also zzso and the whole process was repeated for conventional zzso zzso zzso Following contrast administration, the sensitivity of zzso for detecting facial nerve abnormalities ranged from 86 per cent to 96 per zzso and the specificity from 87 per cent to 92 per zzso conventional zzso images yielded a sensitivity of only 39 per cent - 65 per zzso and a specificity of 94 per cent - 96 per zzso zzso was not a sensitive detector of zzso nerve abnormalities in 14 dogs with concurrent zzso zzso This study shows that zzso is a robust technique for confirming presumed idiopathic facial zzso in dogs, and suggests an inflammatory component to this condition in a high proportion of zzso
