One important issue in zzso research on language is how the brain processes and represents zzso zzso Past studies with various zzso reveal that the left inferior prefrontal and zzso zzso regions play a crucial role in semantic zzso Those studies, however, typically zzso words having a precise and dominant meaning as stimuli and have not manipulated zzso zzso a key feature of human language, as an experimental zzso Here, we used a word generation paradigm to examine whether zzso networks for meaning are modulated by zzso zzso We found that, compared with zzso precise words, zzso ambiguous words were zzso by strong brain zzso in the left zzso frontal areas, the anterior cingulate, and the right inferior zzso zzso zzso precise words, instead, were associated with the left inferior prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that semantic analysis of written words is a dynamic process involving coordination of widely distributed neural zzso which are weighted by semantic zzso
