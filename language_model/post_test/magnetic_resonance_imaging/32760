Human cardiac zzso cells zzso are a promising cell source for zzso repair after zzso zzso zzso of their full therapeutic potential may require stable genetic modification of the cells ex zzso Safe genetic engineering of stem cells, using facile methods for zzso integration of zzso into known zzso zzso would significantly enhance the overall safety and efficacy of cellular therapy in a variety of clinical zzso 

We used the zzso zzso zzso to achieve targeted integration of a triple fusion reporter gene into a known zzso context in zzso and human zzso zzso zzso expression of the reporter gene from its unique zzso integration site resulted in no discernible zzso instability or adverse changes in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were unchanged in their differentiation zzso cellular zzso rate, and global gene expression profile when compared with zzso control zzso zzso of the triple fusion reporter gene enabled zzso assessment of cell fate in zzso and in zzso using zzso zzso zzso imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso transplantation of genetically modified zzso resulted in significant improvement in zzso function 2 weeks after cell delivery, as assessed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also demonstrated the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of genetically zzso differentiated human zzso cells, which enhanced hind limb zzso zzso at day 7 and 14 after zzso on laser zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso modification system is a safe, efficient tool to enable zzso integration of reporter zzso in zzso and differentiated cell zzso
