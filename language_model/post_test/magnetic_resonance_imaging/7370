The brain mechanisms by which sensory cues become transformed into expectations of impending events are a critical component of cognitive tuning of sensory zzso However, distinctions among the zzso processing of zzso activity itself versus those mechanisms supporting the contextual meaning imparted to the cue remain zzso Do sensory cues with equal meaning engage similar patterns of brain zzso even if they are delivered in separate zzso To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging of an expectation paradigm in which cues were delivered with visual or innocuous zzso zzso zzso were designed to be highly meaningful because they predicted the delivery of high and low painful zzso As expected, the cues themselves activated zzso sensory zzso This cue zzso zzso was transformed into a pattern of activity reflecting cue zzso zzso signaling high pain produced greater activity in the left zzso prefrontal zzso and anterior zzso zzso Such activity is consistent with the graded zzso of the magnitude of expected zzso In contrast, cues signaling low pain produced greater activity in the right zzso zzso This zzso may reflect processes directing spatial attention to the zzso body region in order to more accurately evaluate the relatively weak, low pain zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that cues arising from different sensory zzso ultimately engage common brain mechanisms that reflect the meaning of the zzso This zzso activity is presumably critical for preparing sensory systems to zzso process zzso zzso
