To characterize artifacts and imaging problems in the presence of zzso grounding pads for zzso zzso therapy as well as potential heating problems due to induction of zzso currents in the zzso Strategies for avoidance of those problems are zzso 

zzso principles of interactions between grounding pads and MR imaging are zzso zzso zzso zzso orientation in relation to the magnetic field, shape of the grounding pad, sequence type zzso versus zzso zzso and magnetic field strength zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso were varied in systematic phantom zzso zzso effects due to induced zzso currents were estimated theoretically and measured by infrared imaging in an adapted zzso 

MR imaging artifacts are markedly dependent on the orientation and geometrical shape of the grounding zzso Visible signal extinction artifacts were more pronounced using zzso techniques than in zzso echo images and increased for higher field zzso zzso incisions in the grounding pad reduced zzso currents markedly and minimized image zzso zzso problems due to induced zzso currents by the zzso transmitted for MR imaging were excluded by phantom zzso 

zzso positioning of the grounding pads and adaptation of their geometry provide clearly reduced artifacts in MR zzso
