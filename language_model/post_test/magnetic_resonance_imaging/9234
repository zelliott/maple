To assess the prevalence and attributes of zzso language zzso zzso in patients with left zzso zzso lobe zzso associated with zzso sclerosis zzso 

We recruited consecutive patients with left zzso who had undergone zzso surgery and had zzso proven zzso Based on the Wada test, language zzso was classified into typical zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso We assessed the attributes of patients with ALL using zzso and zzso zzso 

Of 124 patients with left zzso 23 zzso had zzso ALL occurred more frequently in patients with severe initial zzso injury zzso early onset of zzso and a short zzso period between zzso and onset of habitual zzso ALL was more common in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on electroencephalogram zzso and zzso changes on magnetic resonance imaging zzso On zzso zzso the age at onset of habitual zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso abnormalities independently predicted zzso The likelihood of ALL was very low ( approximately zzso when all of these four risk factors were zzso whereas it was very high zzso if any three or all four of them were zzso 

ALL occurs in one-fifth of patients with left zzso ALL is more frequent in those with structural or functional zzso involvement and early onset of zzso interrupting the development of normal language zzso Because ALL is uncommon in those with zzso restricted to the zzso the zzso itself may have only a limited role in determining language zzso
