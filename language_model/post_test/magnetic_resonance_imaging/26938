zzso life expectancy zzso the better understanding of the zzso zzso of age-related cognitive zzso The majority of research examining zzso relationships in aging focuses on the role of age-related changes to zzso matter zzso In the current study, we examined the relationship between age-related changes in white matter and language zzso More specifically, we concentrated on zzso failures, which increase with zzso 

We used zzso zzso zzso (a technique used to image, in zzso the diffusion of water molecules in brain zzso to relate white matter integrity to measures of successful and unsuccessful picture zzso zzso zzso images were used to calculate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be a measure of white matter zzso zzso images were related to measures of successful picture naming and to word finding failures using zzso linear zzso zzso zzso naming rates correlated positively with white matter integrity across a broad range of regions implicated in language zzso However, word finding failure rates correlated zzso with a more restricted region in the zzso aspect of superior zzso zzso 

The use of zzso provides evidence for the relationship between age-related white matter changes in specific language regions and word finding failures in old zzso
