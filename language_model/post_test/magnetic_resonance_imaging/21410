zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso disorder leading to zzso and rapid zzso zzso As therapeutic options evolve, it seems essential to understand and zzso progression of the natural zzso The aim of this study was to assess cerebral zzso changes in children with zzso in comparison to normal controls and in relation to disease zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso and 42 typically developing children in the same age range zzso zzso were analyzed in a zzso zzso Patients underwent detailed zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso zzso gray matter zzso and white matter zzso volumes were assessed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was automatically zzso in zzso images of the patients, and analyzed in relation to the clinical zzso 

zzso volumes of patients did not differ from controls, although their growth zzso were slightly zzso zzso volumes of patients, however, were on average zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso below those of normally developing zzso The zzso load zzso for total zzso zzso increased with disease duration zzso zzso zzso and motor deterioration zzso zzso zzso 

zzso volume in patients with zzso is reduced when compared with healthy controls, already at young zzso This supports the notion that, beside zzso zzso dysfunction caused by zzso storage plays an additional role in the disease zzso The zzso load may be a useful zzso imaging marker for disease progression and may serve as reference for therapeutic zzso
