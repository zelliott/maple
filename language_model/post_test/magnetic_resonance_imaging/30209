Besides visual input and zzso zzso zzso input from muscle zzso receptors of the neck region contributes to the perception of zzso zzso Using zzso we performed a neck muscle zzso paradigm in humans in order to detect brain areas involved in processing changes of the head position in relation to the rest of the zzso We identified a network of primary and secondary cortical zzso zzso regions that presumably receive direct zzso zzso input such as areas zzso 2, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso motor and zzso areas, and the frontal eye field zzso zzso of the former reflect early stages of zzso processing, nevertheless these areas contain zzso subdivisions such as area zzso which also receives zzso zzso Together with area zzso and the zzso field in area 2 zzso area zzso constitutes the inner zzso circuit, an interconnected cortical triangle of zzso areas that project to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to be involved in zzso zzso With respect to possible analogies in the zzso we speculate that the zzso we observed in the zzso is closely related to the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso
