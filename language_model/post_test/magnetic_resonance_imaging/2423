The aim of this study was to develop methods of zzso optical zzso on zzso scans for monitoring zzso laser zzso zzso were performed on a zzso zzso zzso scanner at zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso diameter used for delivering laser energy were coated with iron particles from a zzso contrast zzso MR images of the zzso were acquired using zzso echo sequences zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and assessed for zzso zzso zzso zzso could be resolved as lines 2 zzso 1 zzso wide using the zzso echo zzso zzso zzso were invisible on the sequences used for in zzso therapy monitoring due to partial volume zzso It is concluded that optical zzso zzso by zzso may be improved by coating with zzso zzso zzso requires further assessment, but direct coating appears to be a promising method for zzso zzso in zzso laser zzso
