To evaluate the characteristics of MR imaging of zzso zzso using measurement of apparent diffusion zzso zzso value of zzso zzso on diffusion weighted zzso 

MR diffusion weighted images were obtained in patients with 97 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso tumors, 28 zzso 26 zzso zzso values were evaluated with different zzso The zzso ratio of zzso was zzso 

Average zzso values of zzso zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cavernous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio of zzso was significantly different between primary zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso 

zzso study in zzso zzso using zzso values and the zzso ratio of zzso would improve the accuracy in diagnosing zzso zzso
