We undertook this study to use MR imaging to determine the frequency of injury to the zzso ligament complex of the zzso spine in patients who have undergone acute zzso zzso 

zzso patients with varying severity of zzso trauma were examined zzso The majority of injuries were related to motor vehicle zzso The second most common cause was zzso Patients were examined with plain zzso and MR zzso In addition to conventional MR imaging sequences consisting of zzso and fast zzso zzso zzso and zzso images, a zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso The findings were correlated with surgery in six cases and with follow-up clinical examination that included physical examination and conventional zzso and lateral zzso 

zzso ligament complex injury was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso of all zzso Such injury was most common in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with dislocation fracture zzso zzso zzso Of the patients with dislocation zzso all had zzso ligament complex zzso Of the 24 patients with burst fractures, zzso ligament complex tear occurred in zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 23 patients with zzso fractures, zzso zzso zzso 6) had zzso ligament complex zzso zzso to the zzso ligaments occurred with decreasing frequency in patients with injury to the zzso zzso zzso ligaments, zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso findings correlated with MR imaging in all six patients who underwent zzso 

zzso to the zzso ligament complex, which is often encountered in patients with burst and zzso fractures, can be reliably revealed by MR zzso
