To examine whether clinically benign multiple sclerosis patients zzso show similar losses of their global zzso zzso zzso marker relative to more clinically disabled patients of similar disease zzso 

The zzso zzso concentration zzso was acquired with zzso zzso zzso MR zzso zzso brain zzso volume zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso in: zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso years disease zzso median Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso score of zzso zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso years disease zzso median zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 healthy zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (both zzso but the difference between the patients' groups was not zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exceeded the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which were also not different from one another zzso zzso patients' zzso zzso load, zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also not different zzso 

zzso zzso normal controls from zzso patients but does not distinguish zzso from more disabled zzso patients of similar disease zzso Nevertheless, all zzso patients who remain zzso for zzso years suffered zzso loss similar to the average zzso zzso population at fourfold shorter disease duration suggesting relative global zzso sparing or zzso of the zzso zzso
