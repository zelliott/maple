zzso of the zzso zzso nerve were made using high-resolution zzso zzso in 10 adults with zzso dominant zzso zzso Comparisons were made with previous studies of 10 normal adult zzso The zzso diameters of the zzso nerve and the zzso zzso space were measured and a ratio of there diameters at zzso mid and zzso positions along the zzso nerve was zzso We found a statistically significant difference in the mean zzso zzso sheath ratio between the control group and patients with zzso dominant zzso zzso At zzso mid and zzso locations along the zzso nerve it is significantly smaller in patients with zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the loss of zzso cells, previously documented in dominant zzso zzso is associated with a significant loss of zzso nerve tissue and thinning of the nerve along its zzso
