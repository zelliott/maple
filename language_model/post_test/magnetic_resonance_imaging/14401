Sixty patients with primary bone zzso were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso T with both conventional zzso zzso and short inversion time inversion recovery zzso zzso The results have been reviewed in order to evaluate the accuracy of STIR and conventional zzso sequences in the detection of zzso the definition of zzso extent and zzso zzso The zzso zzso extent has been compared with zzso of surgical specimens in 24 zzso The role of the STIR sequence in detection of zzso in the zzso follow-up was also zzso The STIR zzso designed to suppress signal from fat, also enhances the signal from tissue with long zzso and zzso relaxation times, such as zzso and inflammatory zzso The STIR sequence with zzso of zzso zzso in all cases suppressed the high signal from fatty bone zzso giving a clear depiction of zzso extent, in both its zzso and zzso zzso and is superior to conventional zzso zzso The high sensitivity zzso of our zzso of this technique is zzso by its lack of zzso on STIR sequences both zzso and zzso zzso give an increase of signal intensity, limiting assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso only present in our series in zzso zzso may however be differentiated on the basis of the zzso of the abnormal areas, and by comparing STIR images with short repetition zzso time sequence zzso
