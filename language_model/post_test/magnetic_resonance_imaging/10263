zzso with small deletions of zzso 21 provide important models for understanding the role of zzso genes in brain zzso To identify zzso 21 genes responsible for defects of the central nervous system, we determined the deleted regions and brain zzso in three unrelated individuals with overlapping partial deletions of zzso zzso 

Fluorescent in zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were used to define the zzso structure and structural brain abnormalities present in these three zzso 

The regions of zzso 21 found to be deleted in these individuals were as zzso case 1: zzso to the zzso case zzso zzso to the zzso and case zzso zzso to zzso The abnormalities of brain structure shared by all included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso and white matter, zzso zzso and enlarged zzso zzso The clinical features in common included mental zzso zzso facial zzso and zzso zzso in one zzso 

From analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso data from these three individuals, combined with those from previously reported cases, we zzso that deletion of an zzso region in zzso band zzso zzso is associated with cortical zzso We propose that one or more zzso genes in this region contributes to cortical development and that deletion of zzso should be considered in the diagnosis of mentally retarded patients with facial zzso and cerebral zzso
