Advances in magnetic resonance zzso imaging and three-dimensional zzso modeling software provide the tools necessary to create zzso interactive zzso resources that can assist in the interpretation of MR images of zzso and learning the structure and function of limb zzso Modeling provides advantages over dissection or consultation of print zzso because of the associated speed, flexibility, zzso nature, and elimination of superimposed zzso and zzso Our goals were to create a diagnostic zzso of pelvic limb muscles that will facilitate interpretation of MR images of patients with muscle injury and to create a zzso model of the canine pelvic limb zzso to facilitate zzso zzso To create these resources, we used structural zzso of MR images, a process that groups image zzso into zzso meaningful zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso MR zzso of the canine pelvic limb zzso that was created by manually zzso clinically analogous MR zzso Higher resolution zzso MR and zzso zzso zzso data were segmented into separately labeled volumes of data and then transformed into a multilayered zzso computer zzso The zzso Model serves as a resource for students of gross zzso encouraging zzso learning with its highly interactive and selective display zzso For zzso the zzso Model also serves to bridge the gap between zzso and zzso zzso displaying both formats zzso or even superimposed over each zzso Both projects are hosted on an zzso zzso zzso
