zzso of the potential of various MR techniques to differentiate zzso wall layers verified by zzso zzso 

6 zzso specimens of pigs were examined in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso fat suppressed zzso SE, and inversion recovery zzso The MR images were obtained before and after zzso the specimens in zzso zzso of the thickness of zzso wall layers were performed on both sets of MR images as well as on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images showed three layers of different signal zzso one zzso band of very high zzso one inner band of low and one outer band of intermediate signal corresponding zzso zzso zzso and two different muscle zzso zzso recovery technique provided similar findings but were able to avoid zzso zzso After 24 hours in zzso the signal intensity relation of the two muscle layers was zzso The thickness of total zzso wall was not reduced zzso zzso the thickness of urinary zzso wall, zzso zzso and evaluation of MR images correlated zzso 

MR imaging enables the differentiation of three zzso wall zzso zzso recovery technique achieved the best image quality by avoiding chemical shift zzso
