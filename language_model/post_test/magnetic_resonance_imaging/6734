To examine the feasibility of using product acquisition software on a zzso human zzso system to acquire high-resolution structural brain images in the zzso 

Three sets of dual zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images covering the entire rat brain were collected and averaged in 66 zzso The images had sufficient zzso ratio zzso and resolution for visual identification and manual outlining of exemplary structures, including the lateral zzso and zzso and zzso portions of the zzso Further, the data were adequate for zzso automated zzso permitting zzso of the zzso zzso The images compared favorably with those collected on a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso of manual zzso scoring were greater than zzso and manual zzso automated correlations were zzso The zzso of lateral zzso size across animals was substantially higher than that of the zzso 

The large zzso of some brain structures that can exist across even a highly selected strain of rats can readily be detected with the use of human zzso systems for the study of small zzso
