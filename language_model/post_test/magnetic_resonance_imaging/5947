To determine if a new zzso zzso process for zzso studies was associated with a change in emergency department zzso CT and zzso zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective study set in an urban zzso teaching zzso zzso included all zzso zzso patients who had either a CT or zzso during a control or zzso zzso The study group consisted of those patients whose insurance required zzso The control group consisted of those patients for whom zzso was not zzso We used a multiple zzso with zzso error adjusting for seasonal and monthly variation to obtain the rates of change of CT and zzso usage over time for the control and zzso zzso 

The control period consisted of zzso zzso visits over 54 weeks not resulting in hospital zzso The zzso period contained zzso patients over 64 zzso The baseline ordering of CT and zzso was not significantly different between the zzso After controlling for seasonal and monthly variation, our results demonstrated that while both insurance groups demonstrated an increase in use of CT and zzso from the control to zzso zzso there is a statistically significant increase only in the rate of zzso zzso in the study group during the zzso zzso 

A telephone zzso process for zzso studies produced a statistically significant change in the rate of ordering zzso studies, but not CT, in the study zzso We conclude that this zzso process may have resulted in additional zzso visits for zzso MR zzso
