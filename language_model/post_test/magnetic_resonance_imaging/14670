zzso resonance imaging zzso is considered to be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears in patients with severe zzso zzso who are indicated for total shoulder zzso zzso We determined the sensitivity, zzso and positive zzso value of zzso in diagnosing rotator cuff tears in such zzso 

zzso reports of 100 patients who had completed a shoulder zzso prior to zzso were reviewed to determine the zzso interpretation of the zzso including the diagnosis, presence of a zzso cuff zzso and the presence of zzso and/or fatty zzso within the rotator cuff muscle zzso zzso reports were used as a gold standard to determine whether a zzso rotator cuff tear was zzso 

zzso zzso reports noted 33 of the 100 patients as having a zzso rotator cuff zzso 17 of which had multiple zzso zzso 2 of the 33 patients with full tears on zzso were found to have zzso tears at zzso The sensitivity, zzso and positive zzso value for zzso detection of zzso tears were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with a zzso rate of zzso and an accuracy of zzso 

The study suggests that although zzso is highly sensitive, it has a low positive zzso value and moderately low specificity and accuracy in detecting zzso rotator cuff tears in patients with severe zzso zzso
