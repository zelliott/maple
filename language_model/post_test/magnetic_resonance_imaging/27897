zzso therapy is being studied as an zzso therapy for zzso zzso zzso efficacy is based on zzso zzso zzso and the ability to deliver adequate light doses to an appropriate treatment volume at the optimal zzso Our laboratory has developed an zzso zzso zzso protocol to study the treatment variables leading to zzso zzso therapy for zzso zzso Fifteen patients with zzso zzso zzso tumors underwent 16 treatments in the zzso phase of the project in which light treatment volume was progressively zzso Group I zzso zzso 4) received zzso zzso zzso only, Group II zzso zzso 3) received limited zzso zzso and Group III zzso zzso 9) received multiple zzso zzso Between 3 and 18 zzso fiber zzso were placed through zzso zzso tumor access zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso treatment planning provided zzso zzso tumor volumes, treatment volumes, and zzso accuracy for tumor volume zzso and zzso light fiber zzso zzso observations include: 1) treatment failures occur outside of the effective light treatment zzso 2) effective light volumes can be expanded safely with multiple zzso implanted zzso light zzso and 3) optimal treatment involves individualized tailoring of light dose volume and zzso This protocol allows standardized scientific study of the variables affecting the application of zzso therapy for zzso zzso
