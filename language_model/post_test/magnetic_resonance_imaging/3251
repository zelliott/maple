Dynamic magnetic resonance zzso imaging for zzso zzso is usually performed in zzso zzso zzso method which used zzso zzso imaging with zzso spin echo zzso zzso However, on MR images using zzso zzso method, the zzso of small zzso between slices may zzso zzso the aim of our study is to investigate the influence that imaging parameters give to zzso image with zzso zzso zzso zzso method, and to examine the use of zzso zzso zzso method as the detection of zzso zzso We can plan the zzso of imaging time by zzso repetition time zzso because the contrast to noise ratio zzso in the zzso zzso zzso method was superior enough than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, low zzso flip angle induced the decrease of zzso but it has the effect which decreases zzso zzso Dynamic MR imaging which used zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso method is feasible by utilizing the reduction of zzso and low zzso flip angle, as well as the combination of parallel imaging and zzso zzso
