Our goal was to compare dual echo fast zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with conventional zzso zzso zzso In phase 1 of the study, zzso and zzso dual echo MR studies of 33 patients with zzso zzso and 26 normal controls were separately interpreted by three zzso blinded to clinical history to ascertain differences in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso images were read zzso in random order, with at least a 3 week zzso between zzso In phase 2 of the study, zzso and zzso sequences were compared side by side by three zzso independently to evaluate zzso zzso and artifacts and to determine whether zzso would be an acceptable replacement for zzso zzso zzso detection was equivalent in 111 of 117 interpretations zzso The zzso and zzso sequences were equivalent in detecting zzso abnormalities zzso zzso mass effect, zzso and zzso and in characterizing zzso size, margins, and signal zzso zzso zzso white matter zzso were detected more often with zzso while zzso artifacts were less conspicuous on zzso zzso zzso zzso soft tissue and zzso changes, and zzso therapy changes were detected equally well on both zzso In phase 2 of the study, zzso zzso and presence of artifacts were felt to be equivalent with the two zzso The zzso sequences can serve as a zzso feasible alternative to conventional zzso sequences for zzso tumor zzso
