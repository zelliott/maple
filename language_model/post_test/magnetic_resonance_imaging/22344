To describe the characteristics of a previously overlooked devastating zzso zzso that presents as intractable bilateral zzso zzso starting with prolonged status zzso zzso in normally developing zzso zzso 

zzso study over 7 years of all normally developing children admitted in our institution for a prolonged zzso following zzso zzso illness with at least one seizure recorded on zzso 

Fourteen children were included at a median age of zzso years zzso zzso follow-up of 4 years zzso zzso zzso lasted zzso days zzso zzso zzso cell count was normal in five cases and moderately increased in the zzso During SE, zzso were recorded in 11 patients and involved zzso zzso in 7; the other 4 patients exhibited zzso clinical features with secondary zzso zzso zzso followed zzso in all cases without any zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded in 10 patients and involved zzso regions in 8, frontal regions in 2; 3 others had zzso zzso zzso zzso was bilateral in 10 zzso zzso showed bilateral zzso zzso and/or zzso in 10 cases zzso to the zzso in zzso All children had major cognitive zzso When feasible (six zzso detailed neuropsychology suggested zzso zzso 

Among so called zzso matter encephalitis patients, we identified a recognizable pattern we propose to call zzso zzso zzso in zzso Children zzso that begins with prolonged zzso triggered by fever of unknown cause, and persists as intractable zzso zzso with severe cognitive zzso
