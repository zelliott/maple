zzso based zzso zzso is widely used to find regions of consistent zzso across zzso studies that have been selected for their functional relevance to a given zzso Only reported coordinates zzso and a model of their spatial uncertainty, are used in the zzso zzso are clusters of zzso where multiple studies have reported in the same spatial region, indicating functional zzso There are several published methods that perform the analysis in a zzso manner, resulting in around zzso statistical tests, and considerable emphasis placed on controlling the risk of type 1 statistical zzso Here we address this issue by dramatically reducing the number of tests, and by introducing a new false discovery rate zzso the false cluster discovery rate zzso zzso is particularly zzso and relevant to the results of zzso controlling the type 1 error by limiting the proportion of clusters that are expected under the zzso zzso We also introduce a data diagnostic scheme to help ensure quality of the analysis, and demonstrate its use in the example zzso We show that we control the false clusters better than the widely used zzso method by performing zzso experiments, and that our zzso scheme results in more complete reporting of structures relevant to the functional zzso
