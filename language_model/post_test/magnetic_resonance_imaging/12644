The locus zzso zzso is a zzso structure that has widespread cortical and zzso projections to zzso states of zzso Our understanding of the zzso role in both normal attention and clinical populations affected by disrupted attention would be advanced by having in zzso functional and structural markers of the human zzso Evidence for zzso zzso can be difficult to interpret because of uncertainty about whether zzso activity can be accurately localized to the zzso High resolution zzso spin echo zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used in this study to characterize the location and distribution probability of the zzso across 44 adults ranging in age from 19 to 79 zzso zzso a zzso zzso template, the individual zzso were aligned into standard space, while preserving variations in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso signal was observed in the zzso zzso that was strongly correlated with the position and concentration of zzso cells previously reported in a study of zzso brains zzso The elevated zzso signal was used to produce a zzso map of the zzso in standard Montreal Neurological Institute zzso coordinate zzso This map can be used to test hypotheses about the zzso in human structural and functional imaging zzso Such efforts will contribute to our understanding of attention systems in normal and clinical zzso
