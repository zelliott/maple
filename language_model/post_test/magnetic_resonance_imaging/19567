To evaluate the visibility of the main portal vein zzso and its tributaries in healthy subjects at zzso three-dimensional zzso contrast zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and to determine whether this technique provides useful information in the evaluation of patients with zzso 

zzso patients zzso control subjects, 35 patients with zzso underwent imaging with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In the 37 subjects in the control group, the zzso was zzso in zzso zzso vein zzso in zzso superior zzso vein zzso in zzso inferior zzso vein zzso in zzso zzso superior zzso vein zzso in zzso zzso trunk zzso in zzso right zzso vein zzso in zzso right zzso zzso in zzso anterior superior zzso zzso in zzso middle zzso vein zzso in 29; and first zzso vein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso ratings of 2 or zzso was achieved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the control zzso Mean diameters of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly larger in the zzso group than in the control group zzso zzso P zzso P zzso and P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso MR imaging can facilitate precise zzso of the zzso and its zzso zzso of the tributaries may be a zzso secondary finding that is suggestive of zzso
