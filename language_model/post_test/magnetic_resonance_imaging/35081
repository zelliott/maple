zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso is presumed to be a symmetrical zzso Using zzso zzso strain, we sought to determine whether zzso deformation was also symmetrical, as suggested by zzso High zzso zzso relative wall thickness in zzso zzso zzso allows preserved zzso excursion despite depressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an adverse zzso zzso but whether this is related to global or regional zzso depression is zzso We zzso compared zzso derived from linear zzso dimensions with MR zzso in zzso and zzso locations in 27 subjects with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso Reduction in zzso zzso Although zzso mass was higher in patients than in normal control subjects zzso versus zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso stress zzso versus zzso zzso did not differ between zzso However, mean zzso was decreased in patients versus normal control subjects zzso versus zzso as was echo zzso zzso versus zzso both zzso For patients versus normal control subjects, zzso zzso was not different zzso versus zzso whereas zzso was markedly depressed zzso versus zzso zzso Although global zzso by zzso or zzso is depressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue tagging demonstrates substantial regional zzso zzso zzso with most severely depressed strain patterns in the zzso Although zzso wall zzso principal strain was zzso related to radius of zzso zzso strain was not, suggesting that factors other than zzso are responsible for pronounced zzso strain zzso in concentric zzso
