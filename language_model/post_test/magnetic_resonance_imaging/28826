To zzso the relative contributions of spin density and zzso effects zzso zzso on zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of acute and zzso cerebral zzso 

In 30 patients, zzso imaging was performed within the first 7 days after onset of cerebral zzso Estimates of zzso spin density, and apparent diffusion zzso zzso in the region of stroke and zzso normal brain were zzso by means of standard zzso techniques after zzso conventional MR imaging and zzso zzso zzso imaging with a maximum b value of 1,000 zzso zzso signal intensity zzso enhancement ratios resulting from independent changes in zzso spin density, and zzso were then calculated for the zzso zzso 

The overall zzso of cerebral zzso on zzso images was significantly higher than that of normal brain throughout the 1st week after stroke zzso relative zzso enhancement ratio, zzso P zzso zzso During the first 2 days after stroke, decreased zzso within the stroke region made the dominant contribution to increased zzso on zzso zzso By day 3, increased zzso values in the stroke region became equally important, and, from days zzso the contribution to zzso from zzso effects became zzso A slight increase of spin density in the stroke region made a relatively small and constant contribution to zzso zzso over the 1st zzso 

The increased zzso of zzso cerebral zzso on zzso images reflects not only a zzso of zzso but a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
