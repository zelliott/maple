This functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated the relationship between the neural zzso of zzso memory zzso zzso integrity, and memory performance in older zzso zzso older and 18 young subjects were scanned while making zzso judgments on word zzso zzso zzso of successful zzso zzso memory zzso were identified by contrasting the activity zzso by study pairs that were correctly identified as having been studied together with the activity zzso by pairs wrongly judged to have come from different study zzso zzso memory effects common to the 2 age groups were identified in several regions, including left inferior frontal zzso and bilateral zzso zzso effects zzso activity for forgotten than for remembered zzso in default network regions in young subjects were reversed in the older group, and the amount of reversal correlated zzso with memory zzso Additionally, older subjects' subsequent memory effects in right frontal zzso correlated positively with anterior zzso integrity and zzso with memory zzso It is suggested that recruitment of right frontal zzso during verbal memory zzso may reflect the engagement of processes that compensate only partially for age-related neural zzso
