Several critical zzso structures and pathways for memory performance are located in the third zzso zzso This led us to predict that verbal memory abilities would be more impaired in children treated for third zzso tumors compared to those treated for zzso zzso zzso data was obtained from 24 pediatric patients with third zzso region tumors and 18 pediatric patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor involvement and zzso severity zzso Evans zzso on zzso scans and zzso zzso to the time of the zzso evaluation were zzso The potential confounds of zzso severity, seizure medication, age, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy were zzso zzso zzso was comparable between tumor groups and in the Average zzso The third zzso region group performed significantly worse on list learning and delayed list recall compared to the zzso zzso Their mean performance was in the clinically impaired range on both zzso The third zzso region tumor group performed better than the zzso tumor group on zzso zzso a basic repetition, attention span zzso These findings support the hypothesis that pediatric patients with third zzso region brain tumors are more likely to be impaired on verbal recall tasks compared to pediatric patients with zzso brain zzso In contrast, patients who were treated for zzso tumors were more impaired on the basic repetition, attention span task compared to patients who were treated for third zzso zzso Future studies should examine the specific zzso structures and pathways that are damaged and may influence differential cognitive zzso in zzso
