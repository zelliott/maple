The effect of word frequency on semantic processing was characterized by studying two groups of right-handed participants using zzso zzso were presented in blocks of either high frequency or low frequency word triplets where a sample word appeared above a pair of test zzso One group zzso zzso 8) made semantic judgments by selecting the word from the test pair that was more closely associated with the zzso zzso triplets were designed such that zzso between sample and zzso items was zzso The other group zzso zzso 8) read the words silently without making any semantic decision and pressed a button on completing the reading of each zzso zzso judgments while no less accurate, were associated with greater left prefrontal zzso signal change when they involved low frequency words, whereas there was no reliable effect of word frequency in the reading zzso These findings suggest that retrieval effort zzso left prefrontal activity when deliberate access to zzso is zzso
