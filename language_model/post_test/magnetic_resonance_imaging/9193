zzso has been reported to exert beneficial effects in patients regarding the treatment of zzso Human functional zzso technology can study the intact human brain to zzso its functional zzso and the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso Blood flow measurement using functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso has revealed that analgesia is related to decreased neural activities in zzso brain regions, such as the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso including zzso gray zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso system and its zzso of zzso receptors are thought to mediate the observed effects of zzso The zzso zzso zzso PET studies show that the zzso effects are accompanied by reduction in zzso of zzso neural transmission in zzso brain regions, including zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso thalamus, amygdala, nucleus zzso zzso and zzso Further PET studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso including zzso are related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release induced by zzso analgesia is related to expectation of zzso These data indicate that the aforementioned brain regions and zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso systems contribute to zzso zzso
