To develop an automated planning method to obtain double zzso slices for clinically relevant diagnoses of zzso zzso 

Thirty healthy volunteers, 18 patients with cervical spine zzso zzso and 15 patients with zzso spine zzso zzso were included in this zzso The planning method requires no interaction and is calculated online on the MR scanner after two zzso acquisitions (a MR zzso and standard zzso zzso zzso The planning of the subsequent double zzso slice packets is calculated zzso The results from the volunteers were evaluated visually by an operating zzso The results obtained in a clinical trial from interactive planning by an operating technician and from automated planning were zzso 

Visual assessment of the planned slices in the zzso images of all subjects confirmed the accuracy and zzso of the method for both zzso The differences in positions and zzso between zzso and automatically planned zzso series were within the range of zzso zzso 

he new approach can be used to automatically plan double zzso MR images for examination of zzso zzso with high reliability and zzso The major advantage is that simultaneous planning in the zzso and zzso zzso can be performed without any additional zzso Another advantage is that standardized zzso of the nerve roots in the center of the image can be zzso
