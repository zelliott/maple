The zzso organization of the zzso barrel zzso in layer IV of rat primary zzso zzso zzso is a good model for studying neural function and zzso The goal of this study was to test the feasibility of functional zzso zzso to map the zzso zzso representations in the zzso of the rat and its plasticity after zzso zzso Three zzso zzso imaging with 300 zzso zzso resolution at zzso T was used to achieve high zzso ratios and zzso layer zzso By alternating electrical stimulation of the 2nd zzso and 4th zzso digits, functional zzso in layer IV of the barrel zzso could be distinguished using a differential zzso Furthermore, 2 and a half months after the zzso of the 3rd zzso in baby rats, the overlapping area between zzso and zzso representations was zzso This indicates that the zzso barrel zzso previously associated with the zzso zzso is now associated with the representation of nearby digits, which is consistent with studies using zzso and zzso zzso zzso
