The significance of the position of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso remains a controversial zzso 

This study evaluated the relationship between zzso position and disk zzso 

zzso zzso volunteers and 130 symptomatic patients underwent linear zzso and bilateral zzso joint magnetic resonance zzso 

There was a higher prevalence of zzso zzso in symptomatic patients with disk displacement compared with zzso volunteers zzso zzso zzso positioned zzso identified zzso with disk displacement with reduction, disk displacement without reduction, or a symptomatic normal joint with a sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso positioned zzso identified zzso with disk displacement with reduction, disk displacement without reduction, or a symptomatic normal joint with a specificity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There were more zzso zzso in symptomatic subjects with disk zzso but the reliability of a zzso zzso to predict the presence or absence of disk displacement was zzso
