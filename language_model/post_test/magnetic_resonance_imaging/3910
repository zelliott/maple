To clarify the diagnostic importance of zzso areas of increased signal intensity that surround liver tumors on zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

In five patients with zzso tumors, zzso MR images that demonstrated zzso areas of increased signal intensity in the liver were zzso findings were compared with those at surgical and zzso zzso 

MR images showed localized zzso zzso duct zzso lateral (three zzso and zzso zzso zzso to liver tumors within the zzso zzso At zzso examination, zzso tumor growth was seen in local zzso ducts in the same areas in five patients, and zzso deposits were seen in the zzso of zzso zzso in three zzso 

On zzso images, zzso areas of increased signal intensity associated with liver tumors indicate zzso tumor extension in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is possibly caused by zzso deposits in zzso zzso
