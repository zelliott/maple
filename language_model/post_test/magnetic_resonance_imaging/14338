Exercise selectively increases the signal zzso zzso of active muscles in zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso If these zzso increases are graded with exercise intensity, the identification of muscle recruitment patterns may be possible using MR zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of force generation during exercise on muscle zzso zzso Also, we examined the effects of zzso fluid volume zzso expansion on muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso images were collected before and after exercise on eight volunteers in a zzso GE magnet using a standard spin echo zzso Exercise consisted of three consecutive bouts of ankle zzso against graded zzso Three subjects also underwent brief bouts of lower leg zzso zzso zzso zzso during and in addition to the exercise zzso zzso values for the zzso significantly increased after zzso Greater mean force produced during exercise caused greater increases in zzso after exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso Exercise and zzso zzso caused equivalent increases in muscle zzso zzso These equivalent increases in zzso were not accompanied by equivalent increases in muscle zzso zzso zzso alone caused less than a zzso increase in zzso while exercise caused a zzso to zzso zzso zzso a direct relationship between increases in zzso and in zzso after exercise was not zzso zzso zzso during exercise, however, did significantly augment the increase in zzso and zzso of the anterior compartment zzso zzso enhancement among muscles after exercise in zzso MR images is dependent on generated force during zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
