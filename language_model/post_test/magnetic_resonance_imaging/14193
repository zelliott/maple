Recent studies comparing zzso anatomy of the zzso joint zzso to its MR appearance have shown that the assessment of disk displacement is inaccurate when based on the zzso plane zzso This article describes the MR appearance of the normal and abnormal zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso plane and compares these findings with their zzso zzso Twenty-two zzso from zzso frozen zzso were embedded in zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging was zzso specimens were then cut in the same plane as the zzso zzso zzso position by zzso was normal in 14 cases and abnormal in eight zzso zzso MR images alone correctly depicted the zzso disk position in 17 cases zzso (13 normal, four zzso zzso zzso images were necessary for diagnosing anterior displacement in two cases zzso MR was inaccurate in three cases zzso of severe degenerative joint zzso Bone condition was correctly diagnosed on the basis of zzso images alone in all zzso Our study shows that zzso MR imaging alone of the zzso in zzso accurately shows disk position in zzso of zzso zzso zzso images were of benefit in the diagnosis of an additional zzso with anterior zzso zzso position was assessed zzso in either plane in patients with severe degenerative joint zzso For a full MR assessment of the zzso for disk position and bone condition, we recommend imaging in both zzso and zzso zzso
