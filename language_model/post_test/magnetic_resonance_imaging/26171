zzso MR imaging studies of the brain should be interpreted in the context of their zzso We assessed the zzso of visual zzso measured by functional MR imaging and analyzed the effect of image transformation to standard zzso 

Seven healthy volunteers were studied twice with zzso functional MR imaging at zzso T during visual zzso The studies were separated by an zzso of 2 to 7 zzso zzso images were analyzed after spatial zzso to the space described by zzso and zzso and/or after zzso of the images of the second study with the images of the first zzso The number of active zzso for each study was determined at three zzso In addition, the change in the center of the mass of zzso the mean change in signal intensity, and the mean zzso value within the activated area were zzso These zzso indexes were calculated for the zzso zzso and zzso data for each zzso 

Variations in visual zzso were observed between the two studies in the same individual as well as across zzso There was no evidence of an effect from image transformation on zzso on any of the zzso 

Our findings show that the zzso of zzso in functional MR imaging may be much more variable across subjects than suggested in previous zzso The use of different types of image transformation zzso spatial zzso does not significantly affect the zzso of visual zzso
