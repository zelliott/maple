zzso magnetic resonance can detect zzso zzso using zzso zzso relaxation time zzso sequences but quantitative data are lacking in patients evaluated early after acute zzso zzso 

To assess the spatial distribution of zzso in patients with recent acute zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso age zzso zzso with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso inferior, zzso were evaluated zzso zzso was determined using a series of zzso zzso segmented zzso zzso echo zzso zzso was defined as the association of early zzso and delayed enhancement in an zzso region after a zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was present in 13 zzso patients and absent in 11 zzso zzso Mean zzso was increased in the zzso region zzso zzso compared with in the remote zzso zzso zzso zzso and in control subjects zzso zzso zzso but also in the remote zzso compared with control subjects zzso In patients with zzso zzso was further increased within the zzso zzso compared with in patients without zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Peak zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso and was higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso than in patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso in both zzso and remote zzso and was influenced by the occurrence of zzso
