zzso signals zzso activity throughout a widespread network in both of the brain zzso the zzso as well as the zzso side of the brain relative to the zzso zzso To analyze the zzso zzso brain areas that are engaged during limb zzso we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 12 healthy subjects during electrical median nerve stimulation using both a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso Data were analyzed through the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Beyond the well-known positive blood zzso zzso zzso responses, negative zzso of the zzso response were found consistently in several zzso brain areas, including the primary zzso cortex, the supplementary motor area, the zzso the zzso part of the zzso zzso cortex, and the zzso zzso Compared to their positive counterparts, the negative zzso responses showed a different time course, with an onset time delay of zzso s and a peak delay of zzso zzso This characteristic delay was observed in all investigated areas and verified by a second zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a systematic difference for brain areas involved in the processing of zzso zzso These findings may indicate that the zzso basis of these zzso differs from that of the positive zzso zzso zzso an altered model for the negative zzso response may be beneficial to further zzso zzso zzso
