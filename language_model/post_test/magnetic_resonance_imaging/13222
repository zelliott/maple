To describe the natural history of zzso bone zzso zzso zzso in a sample of subjects with knee zzso zzso or at risk of developing zzso Additionally, to examine the association of change in zzso from baseline to zzso follow-up with the risk of cartilage loss in the same zzso at zzso 

zzso T zzso was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size and cartilage status were scored in the same zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso were zzso based on comparison of baseline and follow-up zzso zzso A zzso zzso model was used to assess the association of change in zzso status with cartilage loss over 30 months using stable zzso as the reference zzso 

395 knees were zzso zzso of prevalent zzso changed in size; 50% showed either zzso or resolution at zzso The adjusted odds ratios zzso confidence zzso of cartilage loss in the same zzso at follow-up for the different groups were zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for resolving zzso zzso zzso to zzso for progressing zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso with no zzso at baseline and follow-up and zzso zzso to zzso for newly developing zzso zzso size at baseline was associated with risk of subsequent cartilage zzso 

The majority of pre-existing zzso decreased in size at zzso zzso of zzso was associated with a decreased risk of cartilage loss, while progressing and new zzso showed a high risk of cartilage loss in the same zzso
