A zzso review of 78 consecutive patients with degenerative zzso zzso zzso 

To assess the correlation between rotary zzso and neural canal dimensions using zzso indexes and to establish a zzso system of lateral zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a three-dimensional zzso often associated with spinal zzso although the association is not well zzso 

A total of 78 consecutive patients zzso age, 69 zzso with de zzso degenerative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso average curve, 25 zzso were studied with plain zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso included lateral translation, zzso zzso Cobb angle, and zzso rotation zzso grade zzso zzso zzso of zzso included zzso zzso zzso area and zzso diameter, minimum zzso zzso and zzso zzso area zzso zzso and zzso zzso were conducted twice on each zzso level zzso zzso and the average was zzso 

zzso translation 5 zzso or less zzso I) was associated with zzso change 0 zzso or I zzso lateral translation 6-10 zzso zzso zzso was coupled with zzso change 0 zzso or I zzso and lateral zzso more than 11 zzso zzso zzso was associated with I zzso or II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation tended to be at either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Increased lateral translation was associated with increased zzso rotation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso was associated with decreased zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso area zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cobb angles were associated with greater zzso zzso area in the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso there was no significant correlation zzso zzso zzso between indexes of rotary zzso and zzso area or zzso zzso zzso zzso area and zzso height were significantly larger in the zzso than in the zzso of the zzso zzso 

In degenerative zzso curves, lateral translation is associated with zzso Increased rotary zzso does not lead to decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso correlated to the zzso zzso zzso diameter and zzso zzso With increased zzso Cobb angle, zzso zzso area zzso in the zzso and does not decrease in the zzso zzso of zzso rotation alone does not appear to be associated with reduced neural canal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disc bulging, and zzso overgrowth are more likely to contribute to zzso irrespective of zzso
