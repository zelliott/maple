Despite numerous zzso and functional imaging studies, the exact correlation between cortical language areas and zzso of the linguistic system has not been zzso Here, we used functional zzso to identify cortical areas specifically involved in zzso zzso An experimental design contrasted sentences containing grammatical errors with sentences containing spelling zzso The zzso sentences produced more zzso in cortical language areas than did the sentences with spelling zzso and the difference in zzso was significantly greater in zzso area than in zzso area or in the angular zzso zzso The present findings provide direct evidence of a zzso specialization for zzso area and establish the existence of distinct zzso for our knowledge of zzso
