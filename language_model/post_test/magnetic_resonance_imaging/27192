Selective zzso zzso yields zzso of patients with medically zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso and seems to be equally effective compared to the more extended zzso lobe zzso The zzso of the entire zzso zzso zzso is of crucial importance to warrant complete seizure control for those zzso Thus, evidence of residual zzso could be a predictor of a potentially successful zzso in patients with zzso zzso after zzso We performed an analysis of zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients who underwent a zzso after an unsuccessful zzso zzso to assess the presence of residual zzso before zzso and to determine whether certain anatomical zzso may dispose patients to incomplete zzso of zzso 

Ten patients who underwent zzso after zzso for the recurrence of medically zzso zzso were zzso zzso after zzso was assessed for the presence of residual zzso using zzso and inversion recovery sequences zzso to the main axis of the zzso The results were compared with a control group of ten patients who became zzso after zzso In the nine patients of the study group, the zzso anatomy of the zzso zzso lobe was zzso outlined and zzso on zzso scans performed before zzso to zzso the zzso boundaries of the zzso 

zzso zzso was found in nine of ten patients and was absent in the control zzso After zzso zzso follow-up of zzso zzso eight out of ten patients were completely zzso In seven out of nine patients, a zzso course of the lateral zzso boundaries of the zzso was zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso verified residual zzso structures in the majority of patients who became zzso after zzso Certain zzso zzso patterns might dispose for a higher risk of incomplete zzso of the zzso The study confirms that zzso is an effective treatment zzso for patients with zzso zzso after zzso zzso
