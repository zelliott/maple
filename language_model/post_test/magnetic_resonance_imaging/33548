In this study, we report the synthesis and the evaluation as zzso contrast agent of a new compound zzso fatty acid, zzso where a zzso radical zzso zzso is linked to a fatty acid zzso zzso acids were selected as zzso because they present a high affinity for the liver, their efficient cellular zzso being the result of a specific interaction with a zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso acid binding zzso The zzso of zzso acid is inhibited after the injection of 1 zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso recognizes the same zzso zzso as the natural fatty zzso The higher zzso zzso of zzso in zzso solutions, compared with zzso was explained by the zzso of the zzso radical in the zzso MR imaging was performed using zzso images on mice in order to compare the contrast effect obtained after the injection of 1 zzso of zzso The % signal enhancement in the liver 5 zzso after intravenous injection was 49 zzso 4 and 14 zzso 5 for zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowed a better zzso of some zzso tumors zzso zzso due to its preferential zzso by the zzso zzso
