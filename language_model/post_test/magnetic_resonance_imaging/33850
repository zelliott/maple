To ascertain the value of magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the differential diagnosis between zzso zzso and essential zzso zzso 38 patients were zzso 20 patients had zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso one zzso and 18 zzso Mean age was zzso years zzso zzso for patients with zzso and zzso years zzso zzso for zzso zzso MR imaging was performed in the zzso zzso in all cases, and also in both zzso in 2 5 of the zzso In most zzso cases the MR signal of the zzso zzso was not zzso whereas it was markedly reduced in zzso zzso With regard to zzso zzso it was usually fatty in zzso with an absent to moderate degree of zzso seen in the 14 cases zzso contrasting with the marked degree of zzso noted in zzso patients with zzso zzso An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the zzso signal and the degree of zzso zzso These differences were due to the fact that in zzso the bone zzso zzso tissue is zzso zzso whereas in zzso it is usually markedly decreased or zzso The above results indicate that MR imaging is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of zzso and zzso with the usefulness of this technique increasing when zzso and zzso bone zzso studies are zzso
