zzso surgery was performed in 11 patients over 70 years of age affected by various zzso types of zzso zzso and zzso ranging from Hardy Grade I through zzso Special care was dedicated to the zzso treatment, in particular to water and zzso balances, and to the immediate treatment of any pathological variation of these zzso 

We had no mortality and no zzso zzso zzso All the patients recovered well from the operation with an average hospital stay of 20 zzso The tumor removal was complete in six cases and partial in the remaining zzso With an average follow-up of 2 years, we did observe only one case of symptomatic recurrence of the zzso 

zzso surgery in the elderly is feasible and quite safe in the hands of an experienced team, if special care is devoted to the zzso selection of patients and to the zzso treatment of fluid and zzso zzso
