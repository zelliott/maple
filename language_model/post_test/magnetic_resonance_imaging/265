To display the detail functional anatomy of zzso motor nerves in the zzso cavernous zzso and zzso by high-resolution zzso 

Twenty normal subjects between 24 and 38 years of age, mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging of the zzso motor nerves at the zzso was performed in zzso zzso thickness image planes using zzso zzso nerves in the cavernous zzso was zzso with a head zzso the zzso was obtained in zzso zzso nerves to zzso muscles zzso in the orbits were zzso with zzso zzso planes using surface zzso and within zzso zzso thick zzso A human orbit was zzso embedding and serially zzso at zzso zzso of thickness for HE zzso which would be used to distinguish motor nerves to the zzso 

zzso nerves zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso segment were well zzso in all normal zzso zzso nerves zzso were depicted zzso zzso could be demonstrated consistently in the cavernous zzso because of their small diameter, zzso and zzso not always zzso The larger inferior division of zzso and branches to the target zzso and zzso were demonstrated well in all zzso The superior division of zzso was demonstrated zzso zzso was showed zzso 

zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso could precisely show the zzso motor nerves, as well as the relationships with adjacent structures in the zzso The inferior division of zzso and the zzso could be well depicted in the zzso But of the small sizes and complicated neighboring structures in the orbit, the superior division of the zzso and the zzso could not be demonstrated zzso The capabilities of zzso can be fully used only with thorough knowledge of the complicated zzso relationships in the corresponding zzso
