The zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso involvement could improve the treatment strategy for patients with zzso zzso However, the anatomical definition of the zzso remains controversial and consequently the zzso of its analysis by zzso imaging zzso is still zzso The aims of this study were to define the zzso zzso and to assess whether it could be evaluated accurately by zzso Total zzso zzso was performed in 37 patients with zzso zzso The zzso was zzso for anatomical analysis, which was performed before and after fixation in zzso The zzso thickness was measured zzso zzso and zzso zzso involvement was defined by the shortest distance from the zzso part of the zzso to the lateral zzso zzso The anatomical measures were compared to those evaluated by zzso zzso In middle zzso the anatomical analysis showed that the zzso zzso thickness was 60 and 20 zzso zzso and zzso zzso In low zzso the zzso was very thin and its zzso thickness was less than 10 zzso zzso and zzso in all zzso The zzso involvement was less than 2 zzso in zzso of zzso In terms of zzso involvement, there was good agreement between anatomical analysis and zzso for middle zzso In contrast, the agreement was fair for low zzso This anatomical analysis could explain the poor performance of zzso in the zzso of zzso involvement in low zzso
