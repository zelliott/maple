A method is presented to zzso values of geometric mean time zzso that uses only a few data points zzso in the zzso of time (or zzso in time and weighted by zzso and a few elementary operations for the zzso The method has been tested on a large number of synthetic relaxation data and on actual zzso relaxation zzso in porous samples, using as few as four points (including the two points needed to zzso the relaxation for zzso from zzso to zzso on each relaxation zzso This zzso of the zzso rate very adequately matches the synthetic data and the results of zzso inversion of many (or only a zzso data points from zzso zzso When many zzso are needed in short times, as for zzso zzso in magnetic resonance imaging zzso or for zzso zzso in nuclear zzso logging zzso of zzso a very quickly zzso estimate of zzso should be zzso
