The oxygen extraction fraction of the brain reports on the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption and can be used to assess zzso in zzso zzso This is relevant clinically as well as for zzso blood oxygen zzso functional zzso zzso zzso extraction fraction is reflected in the zzso difference in oxygen zzso fraction zzso - zzso ), which can be determined from zzso zzso values when zzso zzso is zzso A pulse sequence is presented that allows rapid measurement zzso zzso of blood zzso s in the internal jugular zzso The technique combines zzso and blood inflow to attain high zzso ratio in blood and minimal contamination from zzso The sequence is zzso to zzso using a zzso zzso zzso preparation directly after slice zzso Fast scanning zzso repetition time of about 2 zzso is possible by using a zzso zzso directly after acquisition to rapidly achieve zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso (for 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso for normal volunteers was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso curve relating zzso to blood zzso was established using a blood zzso zzso Using this zzso a zzso oxygen extraction fraction of zzso zzso zzso was determined zzso zzso zzso in excellent agreement with literature zzso
