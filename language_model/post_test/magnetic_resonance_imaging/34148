zzso imaging in zzso zzso stroke has been revolutionized by the introduction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso CT, however, is still needed to exclude zzso zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of a zzso zzso zzso zzso stroke protocol in the qualitative and quantitative assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We investigated 9 patients with zzso zzso with CT followed immediately by a standardized zzso stroke protocol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The time zzso between zzso and symptom onset ranged from 3 hours to 5 hours 45 zzso We analyzed and compared the size of the zzso on CT and all zzso images by semiautomatic zzso 

zzso was zzso identified on the basis of all zzso zzso With increasing zzso effect zzso the zzso appearing as an area of zzso with central signal loss, became zzso most zzso Regarding zzso zzso overestimated zzso and mean difference, zzso zzso final zzso and zzso correlated best zzso and mean difference, zzso zzso final zzso zzso with zzso size on zzso 

zzso stroke zzso is as reliable as CT in the assessment of zzso zzso zzso additional CT is no longer necessary to rule out zzso in zzso zzso The use of zzso alone in the diagnostic zzso of a zzso stroke patient saves time and costs while rendering all the critical information needed to initiate an optimal zzso
