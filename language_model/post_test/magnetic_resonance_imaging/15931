The structure and metabolism of the zzso zzso brain, an advanced model for zzso diseases and their treatment response, is often studied zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Due to the shorter zzso relaxation time zzso at the higher magnetic fields these studies favor, the echo times used in zzso zzso subject the zzso to unknown zzso zzso decreasing the accuracy of zzso which is key for zzso and zzso zzso To establish the zzso zzso zzso zzso values, we mapped them for the three main zzso zzso at 3 T in four healthy zzso zzso and tested the hypotheses that their mean values are similar zzso among zzso and zzso to zzso regions in the human zzso This was done with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso spatial resolution over a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso ( approximately zzso of the zzso brain in a zzso protocol that zzso zzso precision per unit zzso The estimated zzso in several gray and white matter regions are all within zzso of those reported in the human brain zzso zzso standard error of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso 177 zzso 3, and zzso zzso 264 zzso 9 zzso with no statistically significant gray versus white matter zzso
