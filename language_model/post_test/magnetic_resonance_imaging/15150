Half the patients who survive zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso continue to have ST zzso zzso 6 months after the zzso The mechanism for this and its clinical significance are zzso There are data to suggest that larger zzso are more likely to have persistent changes in the ST zzso This study is designed to test this association further using a novel means of assessing the presence and magnitude of zzso zzso using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso Delayed imaging by zzso after injection of zzso is commonly used to detect zzso zzso through the appearance of delayed contrast zzso zzso patients referred for zzso viability imaging were zzso The volume of zzso as a percentage of anterior wall volume was zzso and the 26 patients with zzso involving zzso of the anterior wall were selected for zzso All had an zzso recorded within 15 days of zzso and none had an intervening cardiac zzso zzso unaware of zzso findings independently measured zzso zzso Nine patients had zzso zzso zzso and 17 did zzso Mean anterior zzso volume in the group without zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the anterior wall volume compared with zzso zzso zzso in the group with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The larger the zzso scar, the more likely zzso was to be zzso Only 1 of 10 patients zzso with zzso in the anterior wall zzso had such an zzso compared with 3 of 9 zzso with zzso size of zzso to zzso and 5 of 7 zzso with scars zzso In conclusion, persistent anterior zzso is associated with the size of zzso zzso detected using zzso
