The aim of the study was to evaluate zzso function in patients with zzso zzso using zzso flow zzso before and after zzso 

zzso flow zzso were performed at the zzso valves in nine patients with zzso zzso The resulting flow zzso were zzso For assessment of zzso function the zzso of the E and A waves were measured and the E to A wave ratios zzso zzso of zzso flow, indicating zzso dysfunction, was zzso 

The zzso at the zzso valves prior to zzso revealed zzso dysfunction grade I in two patients, grade II in three patients, and grade III in three zzso zzso flow was detected in two zzso At the zzso valves zzso dysfunction grade I was present in two patients, grade II in four patients, and grade III in three zzso Improvement of zzso function after zzso was documented in five patients at the zzso valve and in two patients at the zzso zzso 

zzso flow zzso are feasible and a valuable tool for assessment of zzso function in patients with zzso zzso prior to and after zzso
