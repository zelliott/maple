Recent theoretical models based on cellular processes in zzso structures show that persistent zzso zzso in the absence of stimulus input is important for zzso The goal of this study was to examine in humans how sustained activity in the zzso zzso may zzso long-term zzso as well as active maintenance of novel zzso The relationship between long-term zzso and active maintenance of novel information during brief memory delays was studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in humans performing a delayed zzso zzso task and a zzso subsequent recognition memory task of items encountered during zzso task zzso Multiple zzso analyses revealed zzso activity in zzso structures associated with the active maintenance of zzso visual information during a brief memory zzso In addition to a role in active zzso we found that the subsequent memory for the sample stimuli as measured by the zzso subsequent recognition memory task correlated with activity in the zzso zzso during the delay zzso The results provide direct evidence that zzso mechanisms are engaged during brief memory delays when novel information is actively zzso The relationship between active maintenance during the delay period and long-term subsequent memory is consistent with current theoretical models and experimental data that suggest that long-term zzso is enhanced by sustained zzso zzso
