To evaluate potential zzso afforded by prior transient zzso attack zzso on functional and survival outcomes after zzso zzso 

All cases of zzso zzso strokes, diagnosed between 1985 and 2008, were identified from the Dijon Stroke zzso Patients were zzso in three groups according to the time zzso between prior zzso and stroke zzso weeks, zzso 4 weeks, no zzso or the duration of zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso no zzso Outcomes were severe functional handicap zzso to walk, bedridden or zzso at hospital discharge or at zzso consultation, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed by stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso linear mixed models and Cox zzso hazard models with a sandwich zzso zzso accounting for the treatment zzso as a random effect were used for zzso zzso 

Among the zzso patients with zzso zzso stroke, zzso had had a zzso zzso zzso weeks and 97 a zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso Patients with zzso had better ambulatory status zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and better survival at 1 month zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and at 1 year zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso than those with no zzso zzso zzso zzso weeks and zzso duration zzso 30 zzso also significantly improved the outcomes in overall, zzso and zzso zzso 

Recent zzso zzso was associated with better functional outcome and lower zzso and zzso mortality after stroke, suggesting a zzso zzso
