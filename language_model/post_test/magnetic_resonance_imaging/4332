Patients with pure zzso cortical zzso zzso present isolated zzso signs, whereas patients with sporadic zzso zzso zzso present various combinations of zzso and zzso zzso However, the differential diagnosis between these two forms of zzso zzso is often a challenge for the zzso zzso any test helping in this differential diagnosis might have a potential clinical zzso In this study, our goal was to investigate the adaptation to increased inertia in patients with zzso exhibiting combined zzso and zzso signs, during the performance of fast wrist zzso We found that these patients exhibited a zzso which remained unchanged after addition of inertia, because they were unable to increase neither their zzso activity zzso force), nor their zzso activity zzso zzso This contrasts with our previous findings in patients with zzso In these latter, the zzso worsened when the zzso load of the hand increased because those patients were able to increase their zzso activity, but not their zzso zzso The adaptation to inertia might thus help to differentiate zzso and zzso
