The purpose of this article is to describe an automated technique that creates a zzso wax model of the zzso ear using a rapid zzso technique, which allows precise positioning and adaptation to the deficient side of the zzso 

zzso resonance images zzso are taken of the face and then digitized and zzso into a zzso zzso The image of the normal ear is zzso zzso and positioned onto the image of the zzso side of the zzso The digitized data, when used in conjunction with zzso produces a zzso zzso model zzso A model wax ear is created by pouring molten wax into a silicone mold of the zzso model zzso 

A model wax ear of identical dimensions, shape, and internal zzso as the zzso normal ear is zzso The technique allows the zzso of the model wax ear to be precisely positioned against the surface contours of the zzso side of the face in 1 zzso 

The use of zzso from zzso scan data is a suitable technique for producing a model wax ear that fits the zzso side of the zzso The zzso computer image of the face may also be used to plan the position zzso and zzso of the zzso
