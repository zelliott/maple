The adoption into the UK of children who have been reared in severely deprived conditions provides an opportunity to study possible association between very early negative experiences and subsequent brain zzso This zzso study was a pilot for a planned larger study zzso the effects of early deprivation on later brain zzso We used magnetic resonance imaging zzso to measure the sizes of three key brain regions hypothesized to be sensitive to early adverse zzso Our sample was a group of zzso adolescents (N zzso zzso who had experienced severe early institutional deprivation in Romania and a group of zzso controls (N zzso zzso The total zzso and white matter volumes were significantly smaller in the zzso group compared with a group of zzso zzso UK zzso After correcting for difference in brain volume, the zzso group had greater zzso volumes, especially on the right, but no differences were observed in zzso volume or corpus zzso zzso zzso The left zzso volume was also related to the time spent in institutions, with those experiencing longer periods of deprivation having a smaller left zzso zzso These pilot findings highlight the need for future studies to confirm the sensitivity of the zzso to early zzso
