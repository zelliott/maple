New mixed zzso were obtained by zzso of two zzso zzso The first zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and spaced from the zzso zzso by five units of zzso zzso The second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso complexes, contains two zzso zzso zzso bound through a zzso zzso to different zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Mixed zzso have been obtained and structurally characterized by small angle zzso scattering zzso techniques and for their zzso zzso According to a decrease of negative charges in the zzso zzso a total or a partial zzso transition is observed by passing from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The thicknesses of the zzso are substantially constant, around 50 zzso in the analyzed zzso Moreover, the mixed zzso in which a small amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso do not differ significantly from the respective zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso of zzso zzso at 340 zzso indicates low mobility of water molecules at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of mixed zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (at 20 zzso and zzso zzso The decrease in the zzso values can be ascribed to the increase in zzso zzso 205 and 750 zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso exposed on mixed zzso surface gives the entire zzso a potential binding selectivity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso and these systems could act as zzso zzso contrast zzso
