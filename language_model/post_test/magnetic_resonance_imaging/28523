An image processing technique is presented for finding and zzso the zzso of zzso markers zzso attached to the human head in zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso image zzso The zzso can be used as control points for image zzso The technique, which is fast, zzso and zzso has two major zzso First, it searches the entire image volume to find one zzso inside each zzso zzso We call this zzso a zzso zzso and we call the object a candidate zzso Second, it zzso the zzso in a region surrounding the candidate zzso as marker or zzso zzso using zzso rules and zzso an zzso zzso for each true zzso We call this final zzso the zzso point of the zzso The technique was developed on 42 scans of six zzso CT and six MR scans per zzso There are four markers attached to each patient for a total of zzso marker zzso For the CT images the false marker rate was zzso For MR the false marker rate was zzso zzso out of 144 zzso To evaluate the accuracy of the zzso points, zzso registration was performed after correcting the MR images for geometrical zzso The zzso registration accuracy averaged zzso zzso and was better than zzso zzso for each of the zzso image zzso
