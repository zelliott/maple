zzso has historically provided zzso zzso of tears of the zzso zzso zzso fraying and underlying cartilage abnormalities can often mimic tears of the zzso on conventional zzso Administration of zzso zzso enhances the zzso appearance of the zzso to improve detection of zzso zzso This study examined the improved diagnostic sensitivity of MR zzso compared with conventional zzso and the importance of zzso the study to a small field of zzso 

Fifty-one hips were zzso in 48 zzso Fourteen hips underwent conventional zzso with a large field of view zzso zzso Seven hips underwent conventional zzso with a small field of view zzso zzso Thirty hips underwent MR zzso with a small field of view zzso zzso zzso tears were diagnosed when contrast material was identified within the zzso or between the zzso and the zzso when a displaced zzso was noted, or when a zzso zzso was zzso All study results were compared with findings at the time of hip zzso 

Conventional zzso with a large field of view was zzso sensitive in detecting zzso tears compared with findings at the time of zzso zzso sensitivity was improved to zzso with a small field of zzso MR zzso with a small field of view was zzso sensitive in detecting zzso zzso 

A combination of MR zzso and a small field of view is more sensitive in detecting zzso abnormalities than is conventional zzso with either a large or a small field of zzso
