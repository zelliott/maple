Conventional zzso was compared with a new type of MR technique using a zzso zzso fast imaging with steady zzso zzso sequence for diagnosis of the zzso root zzso zzso 80 patients with zzso disease in the zzso spine were examined with a zzso zzso MR system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A strongly zzso zzso zzso sequence was applied in the zzso zzso To obtain fat suppression, a zzso zzso zzso was applied prior to the imaging zzso The acquired zzso data set was evaluated using a maximum intensity projection zzso zzso The measurement time was 7 zzso 47 zzso zzso resonance zzso has significant advantages over conventional zzso particularly in cases of extreme spinal canal zzso Compared with the conventional method, this new MR technique shows comparable sensitivity in the zzso of the spinal nerve roots in the zzso zzso
