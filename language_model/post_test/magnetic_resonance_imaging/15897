Although it is accepted that linear zzso causality can reveal effective connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso the issue of detecting zzso connectivity has zzso not been zzso In this paper, we address kernel zzso causality zzso to describe effective connectivity in simulation studies and real zzso data of a motor imagery zzso Based on the theory of zzso kernel zzso spaces, zzso performs linear zzso causality in the feature space of suitable kernel functions, assuming an arbitrary degree of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso captures effective zzso not revealed by the linear zzso In addition, effective connectivity networks between the supplementary motor area zzso as the seed and other brain areas are obtained from zzso
