zzso zzso zzso is a zzso focal zzso of unknown zzso characterized by zzso spasms in the zzso muscles during zzso Our aim was to identify zzso functional brain zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso groups showed increased zzso extent in the primary zzso cortex, zzso and superior zzso zzso during symptomatic and zzso tasks and decreased zzso extent in the zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso during zzso zzso Increased zzso intensity in zzso patients was found only in the primary zzso zzso during symptomatic voice production, which showed a tendency for correlation with zzso zzso Both zzso groups had lower correlation of zzso zzso between the primary motor and sensory zzso and additional correlations between the zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso during symptomatic and zzso zzso Compared with zzso patients, zzso patients had larger zzso extent in the primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso during symptomatic task and in the inferior zzso zzso and zzso during symptomatic and zzso voice zzso The primary zzso zzso shows consistent abnormalities in zzso extent, intensity, correlation with other brain regions, and symptom severity in zzso patients and, therefore, may be involved in the zzso of zzso
