This study was designed to determine brain activity in the zzso particular the zzso function of the zzso zzso area zzso We zzso changed the body temperature in rats within the zzso range zzso degrees zzso and monitored changes in blood zzso zzso zzso MR zzso To explore PO activity we had to deal with general signal changes caused by zzso zzso in the affinity of oxygen for zzso which contributes to zzso contrast because it is partly sensitive to the amount of zzso zzso in the zzso To reduce these overall zzso effects, we corrected the zzso data using zzso correction zzso The results showed activity of the PO during body warming from 38 degrees C to 39 degrees C, supported by an increased zzso signal after zzso This is the first zzso study on the autonomous nervous system in which zzso activity zzso by changes in the internal environment zzso zzso was zzso In this study we also demonstrate 1) that any zzso study of zzso small animals should guard against background zzso signal zzso since animals are vulnerable to body temperature zzso and 2) the existence of a link between PO activity and the zzso opening of the zzso zzso in a parallel study on the rat tail, a peripheral zzso zzso
