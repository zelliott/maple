zzso recognition zzso zzso is part of the innate immune system and binds to zzso a component of bacterial cell walls that has been found in human zzso zzso zzso exposure to bacterial zzso may cause or exacerbate the inflammatory response to zzso deposition within zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso is associated with zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso was measured in zzso subjects in the Dallas Heart zzso a zzso population sample age zzso including 50% African-Americans and zzso zzso zzso artery calcium zzso was measured by electron beam zzso zzso zzso abdominal zzso wall thickness zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso and abdominal zzso plaque burden zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso increasing levels of zzso were associated with all major cardiovascular risk factors, with inflammatory markers such as zzso zzso and with zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso In multivariable models adjusted for traditional risk factors, zzso remained significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Further adjustment for novel zzso associated with zzso and zzso attenuated the association with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

In this first reported clinical study of zzso in humans, zzso levels were independently associated with zzso zzso that represent different vascular beds and stages of zzso
