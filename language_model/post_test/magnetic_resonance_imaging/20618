zzso analgesia zzso refers to a reduced pain response after stress exposure, which is zzso by descending zzso circuits and may be an indicator of adequate centrally zzso pain zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain mechanisms of zzso in 21 healthy zzso Using a block design series of mildly painful pressure stimuli were applied to the left zzso phalanx of the second zzso during functional magnetic resonance zzso Mental zzso combined with increasing levels of noise was used as a zzso zzso ratings, changes in blood pressure and heart rate confirmed the zzso of the stress zzso zzso pain thresholds and pain tolerance were significantly higher and zzso pain and zzso ratings were significantly lower compared to zzso zzso zzso led to an increase of the zzso zzso response in the primary zzso cortex, zzso in the anterior zzso and secondary zzso zzso The increase in pain tolerance correlated significantly with zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso and pain zzso with zzso in the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso seems to activate similar brain networks as zzso analgesia or analgesia zzso by diffuse noxious zzso controls and involved zzso affective and cognitive zzso zzso
