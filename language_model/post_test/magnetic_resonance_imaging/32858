zzso is a primary brain disorder or a result of peripheral zzso inducing brain zzso with underlying mechanisms that partially overlap with other painful zzso Although there are zzso variations, zzso studies propose neural correlations to clinical findings of abnormal pain zzso in zzso Growing zzso of specific differences of brain zzso in resting states and zzso conditions confirm clinical zzso and impaired zzso descending systems, and also demonstrate zzso influences on painful experiences, leading to zzso zzso zzso data of neural zzso abnormalities parallel structural findings of gray matter zzso zzso of intrinsic connectivity networks, and variations in zzso levels along multiple zzso Data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso imaging, default mode network analysis, and zzso enable the understanding of zzso zzso and favor the future establishment of more tailored zzso
