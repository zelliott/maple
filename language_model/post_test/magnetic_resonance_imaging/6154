Image functional modeling zzso has been introduced as a method to simultaneously zzso imaging and mechanical data with zzso models to determine the degree and location of airway zzso in zzso Using lung imaging provided by zzso zzso zzso we advanced our zzso method to require matching not only to ventilation zzso location but to specific ventilation throughout the zzso Imaging and mechanical data were acquired for four healthy and four zzso subjects zzso and zzso zzso After zzso we first identified zzso airways leading exclusively to ventilation defects and highly zzso zzso zzso patterns were then found for the remaining airways to match mechanical zzso zzso images were predicted for each pattern, and visual and statistical comparisons were done with measured zzso zzso showed that matching of ventilation defects requires severe zzso of small zzso The mean zzso of such airways leading to the ventilation defects needed to be zzso rather than fully zzso Also, central airway zzso alone could not account for dysfunction seen in zzso so small airways must be zzso
