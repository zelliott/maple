We describe a case in which jugular zzso bulb oxygen zzso zzso monitoring proved useful during the surgical zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of large zzso zzso may be followed by normal zzso pressure breakthrough with brain zzso zzso and subsequent problems in achieving zzso zzso monitoring during zzso zzso by zzso zzso has been shown to help in deciding whether zzso is sufficient to avoid such zzso zzso but its use during surgical zzso has not been zzso In the case discussed, zzso monitoring enabled assessment of the risk of zzso zzso preoperatively and permitted the degree and zzso of surgical zzso zzso to be followed zzso During the normal zzso pressure breakthrough bleeding which followed complete zzso zzso zzso monitoring helped with safe management of the controlled zzso that finally permitted zzso to be zzso
