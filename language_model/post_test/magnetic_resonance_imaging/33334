zzso zzso is a new zzso diagnosis that refers to an anterior zzso injury caused by the zzso zzso Currently, there are no zzso criteria to establish the diagnosis of zzso zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether there are imaging criteria that would identify zzso zzso on zzso MR zzso 

This study compared the zzso MR zzso of 23 patients who had zzso zzso diagnosed at hip zzso with the zzso of 24 patients who did not have zzso zzso found at hip zzso All of the zzso were performed by a single orthopedic hip zzso In all cases of zzso there was an isolated injury to the zzso at the zzso zzso All were treated by zzso zzso zzso performed at the zzso zzso The MR examinations of the 47 patients were evaluated independently by two musculoskeletal zzso who were blinded to the zzso The following characteristics of the zzso zzso at the level of the anterior zzso were zzso lateral zzso increased signal intensity zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the deep margin of the zzso tendon, zzso within the zzso zzso or capsule at the zzso position, presence of a zzso tear at the zzso position, dimensions of the zzso tendon, and location of zzso zzso as it passed the zzso zzso analysis was performed using the zzso zzso test, Fisher exact test, and Cohen zzso zzso for p less than zzso were considered zzso 

zzso women zzso age, 35 zzso and four men zzso age, 36 zzso had central zzso zzso Sixteen women zzso age, 38 zzso and eight men zzso age, 35 zzso did not have central zzso zzso zzso For the zzso and zzso groups, lateral dip of the zzso zzso was seen in 15 of 23 zzso and 17 of 24 zzso for reader 1 and 18 of 23 zzso and 11 of 24 zzso for reader 2, respectively zzso and zzso zzso There was no difference between the groups for increased zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively), irregular deep margin of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), thickness of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso or capsule zzso zzso and zzso zzso Reader 1 found 20 of 23 and reader 2 18 of 23 zzso tears at the zzso position in the zzso zzso group, with 13 of 24 and 10 of 24 in the zzso zzso group respectively zzso and zzso zzso The combined zzso zzso zzso for both readers was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in women and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in men in the zzso zzso group zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for women and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for men in the zzso zzso group zzso The zzso zzso most commonly crossed the zzso at the zzso position in both groups zzso 

An zzso zzso tear at the zzso position should suggest the diagnosis of zzso zzso
