The aim of the present study was to identify brain regions associated with vigilance in zzso and zzso zzso patients by means of zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso 16 drug-free zzso and 16 normal controls were included in the baseline zzso zzso patients participated in a zzso zzso crossover study receiving a three-week fixed zzso of zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso and zzso zzso comprised zzso the Multiple Sleep zzso Test zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained before and after three zzso zzso zzso overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant zzso differences in the resting zzso but not in the zzso recordings zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a decrease in zzso and beta 1-3 power in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the right zzso slightly more involved in this vigilance zzso zzso 400 zzso as compared with zzso induced changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences zzso zzso with a preponderance in the left zzso This increase in vigilance resulted in an improvement in the zzso and the zzso zzso provided evidence of a functional deterioration of the zzso network of the zzso vigilance system in zzso and a therapeutic effect of zzso on the left hemisphere, which is less affected by the zzso
