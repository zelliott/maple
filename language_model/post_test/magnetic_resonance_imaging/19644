The use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso methods for the direct detection of zzso currents is a topic of intense zzso Much experimental work has been carried out with the express aim of establishing detection thresholds and sensitivity to flowing zzso However, in most of these experiments, magnetic zzso enhancement was zzso In this work, we present results that show the influence of a zzso zzso on the detection threshold and zzso For this purpose, a novel zzso consisting of a zzso cylinder with two wires of different materials connected in series, was zzso zzso MR images were acquired from a single slice using a zzso echo zzso imaging zzso zzso The data show that the time course of the detected MR signal magnitude zzso very well with the zzso of the input zzso The effect of the zzso zzso arising from the two different wires was examined by comparing the zzso of the MR signals at different zzso zzso Our results indicate the zzso zzso MR signal enhancement arising from the magnetic zzso effect influences the detection sensitivity of weak zzso zzso the detection threshold and sensitivity are zzso zzso zzso zzso A electric current detection in a phantom is possible on a zzso MR scanner in the presence of zzso zzso
