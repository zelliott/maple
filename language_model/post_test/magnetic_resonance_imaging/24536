The objective of this study was to analyze regional variations of magnetic resonance zzso relaxation times zzso and zzso in hip joint cartilage of healthy volunteers and subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative images of the hip zzso of 12 healthy volunteers and 9 zzso patients were obtained using a zzso MR zzso Both zzso and zzso cartilage layers in each joint were zzso segmented on zzso zzso high-resolution zzso zzso echo zzso zzso These segmented regions of interest zzso were automatically divided zzso into twelve equal zzso zzso zzso based on the fitted center of the zzso zzso The mean value of zzso was calculated in each zzso after zzso the divided cartilage contours on the MR relaxation zzso maps to zzso the relaxation zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times of the zzso cartilage were significantly higher in zzso subjects compared to healthy controls zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in controls for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls for zzso zzso zzso analysis showed significantly different zzso and zzso relaxation times in the zzso region zzso of the hip joint cartilage between subjects with zzso and healthy subjects, suggesting possible regional differences in cartilage zzso composition between these two zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis showed that zzso analysis in zzso cartilage was more sensitive in discriminating zzso joint cartilage from that of healthy zzso than global analysis of the whole region zzso area under the curve zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for whole zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for whole zzso The results of this study demonstrated regional variations in hip cartilage composition using MR relaxation times zzso and zzso and suggested that analysis based on local regions was more sensitive than global measures in subjects with and without zzso
