zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso in zzso zzso zzso despite normal zzso coronary zzso results in zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the relative contribution of zzso zzso forces to zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso patients with symptomatic zzso and normal coronary arteries and 10 zzso healthy volunteers were studied with PET to zzso resting and zzso zzso at a zzso and zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso was performed to determine left zzso zzso mass index zzso and volumes, zzso to assess zzso zzso time, heart zzso to measure zzso zzso tract zzso zzso and zzso pressures, and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso marker of zzso wall zzso zzso zzso was blunted in zzso zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In contrast to controls zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso not zzso the zzso zzso ratio decreased significantly in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This pattern was similar for zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso zzso left zzso volume index, and zzso (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, however, revealed that only zzso and zzso were independently related to zzso zzso with greater impact at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more severely impaired at the zzso level in zzso zzso The level of impairment is related to markers of increased zzso zzso loading conditions and zzso zzso These observations suggest that, in addition to reduced zzso density caused by zzso zzso zzso forces contribute to zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso
