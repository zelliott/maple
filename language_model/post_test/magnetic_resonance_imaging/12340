zzso DNA zzso disorders have emerged as major causes of inherited zzso zzso Despite being well recognized for more than 2 decades, the clinical presentation continues to zzso The zzso zzso is partly zzso to different percentage levels of zzso zzso zzso in different zzso but the factors influencing this are poorly zzso 

This case report describes zzso male twins with zzso zzso zzso and zzso intractable zzso zzso The assessment of respiratory chain zzso activities in the muscle from 1 twin revealed a severe and isolated zzso involving zzso complex zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was present at very high levels of zzso in muscle zzso and lower levels in blood zzso urinary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Of particular interest, his identical twin was found to harbor very similar levels of the zzso zzso in his blood, zzso zzso zzso and hair zzso DNA samples, while the presence of low levels in the mother's zzso confirmed maternal zzso 

It was shown that zzso can also cause the unusual combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to intractable zzso zzso zzso levels in different zzso in both siblings support a nuclear genetic mechanism controlling the tissue segregation of zzso zzso
