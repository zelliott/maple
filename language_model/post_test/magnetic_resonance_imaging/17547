Monitoring the visual outcome of our actions is critical to our zzso zzso To investigate the neural basis of monitoring visual change produced by zzso we examined the zzso relationship between manual depression of a button and visual feedback on zzso of the zzso Six zzso normal subjects participated in 3 experiments zzso delayed, and visual zzso zzso resonance zzso images of their brains were acquired during the experiments using a scanner operating at zzso In the zzso experiment, subjects pressed a button at zzso intervals and received zzso visual stimuli in zzso In the delayed experiment, visual stimuli were presented with a delay after subjects pressed a button at zzso zzso In the control experiment zzso zzso subjects did not press the zzso but viewed visual stimuli generated by a computer at random zzso In the zzso experiment, zzso in the zzso and right zzso lobe was stronger than in the delayed experiment, whereas zzso in the primary visual zzso was weaker than in the delayed and visual zzso These results suggest that visual outcomes produced zzso with action are processed in the zzso and the zzso area for the organization of optimal motor behavior, rather than in the primary visual area that is known to process the visual properties of external zzso The zzso signal related to zzso contingency may zzso the cortical processing of visual input that is zzso with zzso
