This article details preliminary studies undertaken to integrate the most relevant zzso across multiple disciplines in an effort to construct a highly realistic zzso simulator based on a distributed computer zzso zzso based on modified zzso modeling zzso incorporating finite element analysis are zzso as are current and projected efforts directed toward the zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso 

zzso data derived from zzso magnetic resonance imaging sequences are used to construct a zzso model of the surgical region of zzso zzso resonance images of the brain may be zzso with those obtained from magnetic resonance zzso magnetic resonance zzso and diffusion zzso imaging to formulate models of varying zzso zzso 

The majority of the zzso burden is encountered in the zzso reduction of the zzso model and allows realization of the required threshold rates for the accurate and realistic representation of real-time visual zzso 

zzso zzso procedures offer an ideal testing site for the development of a totally immersive virtual reality surgical simulator when compared with the simulations required in other surgical zzso The material properties of the brain as well as the typically small volumes of tissue exposed in the surgical field, coupled with techniques and strategies to minimize zzso demands, provide unique opportunities for the development of such a zzso zzso of real-time zzso and visual feedback is approached here and likely will be accomplished zzso
