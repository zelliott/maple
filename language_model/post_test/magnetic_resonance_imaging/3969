The purpose of this study was to evaluate different magnetic resonance imaging zzso pulse sequences in the detection of artificial cartilage zzso in small zzso using an animal zzso A total of 32 artificial cartilage zzso were created in the knee zzso of 20 zzso Twenty zzso were produced 4 weeks and 12 zzso 1 h before the zzso examination, performed in an zzso zzso at zzso zzso All zzso were examined with five imaging zzso zzso a conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso time zzso 600 zzso echo time zzso 15 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso 2000 zzso TE 85 zzso zzso a two-dimensional zzso zzso echo zzso zzso 440 zzso TE 10 zzso flip angle 60 zzso and zzso two three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso TE 7 zzso flip angle 40 degrees, with fat suppression zzso and zzso 30 zzso TE 9 zzso flip angle 40 zzso Two examinations had to be excluded because of insufficient image quality and the remaining examinations were analyzed by two experienced zzso The zzso images were correlated with the zzso findings and anatomical structures were scored according to a zzso zzso zzso comparison of the pathological and zzso findings showed that 19 of the 30 artificially induced cartilage zzso were detected with the zzso zzso zzso 13 with the zzso zzso 11 with the zzso zzso 3 with the zzso zzso and 2 with the zzso zzso The highest percentage of artificial cartilage zzso was demonstrated using a zzso zzso zzso However, the analysis of cartilage defects in small zzso with zzso sequences as well as clinical routine hardware and software had zzso Therefore a pilot study was performed analyzing newly developed high resolution zzso zzso GE images obtained from 5 rabbit knees with 10 cartilage zzso at zzso zzso Two sequences were used with zzso and zzso zzso slice zzso a zzso of 256 zzso 256 and 512 zzso 256 and a field of view of 12 zzso 6 and 8 zzso 6 zzso In this small subset detection rates were substantially higher than in the 30 rabbit knees examined zzso
