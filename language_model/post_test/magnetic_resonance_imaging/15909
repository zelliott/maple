To investigate gray matter concentration changes in the brains of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patient with zzso and 29 age and zzso normal subjects zzso age, 31 years old) underwent zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso to a standard zzso template and subdivided into gray matter, white matter, and zzso fluid zzso These segmented images were then smoothed using a zzso full zzso at half maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso protocol was used to analyze brain tissue zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso A one-way analysis of zzso was applied to the concentration analysis of gray matter zzso 

zzso with zzso showed reduced gray matter concentration in bilateral zzso left zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso bilateral short insular zzso bilateral superior frontal zzso and right superior zzso and left inferior zzso zzso compared to normal subjects zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, small volume correction revealed gray matter concentration reduction in bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso discovery rate corrected p zzso zzso 

Gray matter concentration reductions were observed in brain regions related to excessive daytime zzso zzso attention, and memory in zzso with zzso
