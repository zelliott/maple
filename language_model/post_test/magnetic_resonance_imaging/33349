In this study, we investigate a new approach for examining the separation of the brain into zzso networks zzso on a group level using zzso parameters zzso of zzso fluctuation zzso fractional zzso zzso the zzso zzso and signal standard zzso zzso independent component analysis is used to reveal zzso patterns of the relevant zzso parameters (not the time series) across subjects that are shown to be related to known, standard zzso As part of the analysis, zzso state parameters are also investigated, such as mean of the blood oxygen zzso time series and gray matter volume from anatomical zzso We zzso that meaningful zzso will primarily be zzso by analysis of the zzso functional connectivity zzso parameters and not by zzso zzso First, this shows the presence of a common influence underlying individual zzso networks revealed through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Second, this suggests that the zzso and zzso networks have zzso zzso Several of the components determined from zzso parameters in this manner correlate strongly with known zzso functional zzso and we term these zzso zzso zzso
