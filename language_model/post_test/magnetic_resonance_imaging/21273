Major zzso Disorder zzso is associated with impaired processing and regulation of zzso A vast body of research has zzso the altered neural processes that occur in response to emotional zzso while little is known about anticipatory zzso Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate neural zzso during the presentation and anticipation of negative zzso Furthermore, we examined the effects of an zzso zzso treatment with zzso We matched 12 zzso zzso patients and 12 healthy control participants to perform a task involving affective zzso The design of our zzso task consisted of presenting positive, negative, and neutral pictures from the International zzso Picture System zzso across two runs and under opposite zzso For the zzso condition, the pictures were cued by a word indicating their emotional zzso whereas the zzso condition had a combination of random letters zzso the emotion zzso zzso patients displayed greater zzso zzso when anticipating negative pictures and greater prefrontal zzso when confronted with them without the anticipatory zzso After zzso treatment, both zzso and prefrontal zzso decreased significantly in the treated zzso patients relative to zzso These findings show that the neural mechanisms of emotion anticipation and processing are altered in patients with zzso and that these zzso are able to zzso after treatment with an zzso
