Recently, in a zzso and a subsequent structural MR study, a significantly increased zzso index zzso was demonstrated in the frontal lobe in individuals with zzso To examine whether frontal lobe zzso is zzso and whether this might be a suitable zzso in the search for the genetic basis of zzso the frontal as well as zzso zzso were determined in zzso scans of families affected with zzso 

In the zzso scans of 48 subjects suffering from zzso in 82 of their first-degree relatives and in 41 control subjects, the zzso was determined in three sections anterior to the zzso of the corpus zzso and three sections zzso to the zzso thus allowing for a selective determination of this measure in the frontal as well as the zzso zzso zzso and inner contours zzso the zzso was determined in each section by manual zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso with factors diagnostic group and intervening factors from preliminary zzso 

The zzso but not zzso zzso was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients as well as unaffected relatives compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no overall difference between affected and unaffected family zzso On the left side however, there was a significant interaction between diagnostic group and genetic loading zzso zzso 101, zzso significantly higher zzso was found in affected compared with unaffected family members only in zzso and not zzso zzso 

These results support our primary finding of zzso in the frontal lobe in schizophrenic zzso Compared to the zzso zzso zzso seems to affect the frontal lobe selectively and serves as a suitable zzso possibly even an zzso zzso
