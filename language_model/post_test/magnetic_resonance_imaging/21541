We have developed a zzso zzso zzso arm suitable for zzso zzso and surgical zzso The system comprises a zzso zzso mechanism and a three-dimensional (3 zzso zzso for zzso zzso Five zzso of our zzso arm are equipped with electromagnetic zzso and the arms are provided with zzso weights to ensure safe, smooth zzso zzso zzso procedures were carried out with a laser beam guide mounted at the tip of the zzso zzso We have used this system in 22 cases to zzso zzso or zzso zzso There were 12 cases of zzso 5 cases of deep seated benign zzso 3 cases of multiple zzso zzso and 2 cases of zzso lobe zzso zzso enhanced CT images indicated total or zzso zzso in all zzso We also have used this system to determine the approach for clipping of a zzso cerebral artery aneurysm in 2 zzso The error of mechanical accuracy of the system was less than 1 zzso We believe that this system will prove useful in zzso zzso zzso
