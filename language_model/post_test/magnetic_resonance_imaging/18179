To compare different zzso sequences for the detection of zzso and the evaluation of response to chemotherapy in patients with diffuse large zzso zzso zzso 18 patients with zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso scanning prior to and 1 week after zzso The zzso sequences included zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with and without fat suppression, and a zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso with two b values zzso and 800 zzso Conventional zzso sequence comparisons were performed using the contrast ratio between tumor and normal zzso body instead of signal zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso of the tumor was measured directly on the zzso zzso zzso The tumor volume was used as a reference for the evaluation of chemotherapy zzso The mean tumor volume was 374 zzso at zzso and decreased by zzso 1 week after chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso image with fat suppression showed a significantly higher contrast ratio compared with images from all other conventional zzso zzso both before and after treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso The contrast ratio of the zzso zzso image with fat suppression decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso and that of the zzso zzso zzso image increased significantly zzso zzso zzso after zzso However, there was no correlation between the change in contrast ratio and tumor zzso The mean zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso it increased by zzso after chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso and the change in zzso value correlated with the change in tumor volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The baseline zzso value also correlated zzso with the percentage change in zzso after treatment zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, this study indicates that zzso imaging with fat suppression is the best conventional sequence for the detection of zzso and evaluation of the efficacy of chemotherapy in zzso zzso with zzso mapping is an imaging zzso with both diagnostic and zzso value that could complement conventional zzso
