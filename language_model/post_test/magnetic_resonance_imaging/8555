We zzso the torn rotator cuff zzso to the zzso cuff zzso site if it was zzso The purpose was to correlate the amount of zzso zzso of the cuff with shoulder zzso We evaluated 63 shoulders in which repaired cuffs were followed with magnetic resonance imaging at a mean follow-up of 8 zzso The amount of zzso zzso of the cuff zzso was determined by use of a zzso zzso zzso view, which passed through the center of the zzso head, and was defined as the zzso angle (where N indicates the new cuff zzso point, C indicates the center of the zzso head, and A indicates the zzso cuff zzso zzso zzso the more zzso the cuff zzso was zzso the greater the zzso zzso Neither the Japanese zzso Association shoulder score nor zzso strength of forward zzso was correlated with the zzso zzso The zzso angle was significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with the active forward zzso angle, which dramatically decreased at 30 degrees of the zzso angle, approximately 13 zzso from the original cuff zzso point, assuming a zzso head radius of 25 zzso
