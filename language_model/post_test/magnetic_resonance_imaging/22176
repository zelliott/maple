BACKGROUND AND zzso In order to evaluate cerebral blood flow changes associated with fetal zzso zzso ultrasound and zzso examinations were carried out in four zzso with this zzso 

Increased resistance zzso of the blood flow profile of the middle cerebral artery were detected in three of the zzso two of them presenting retrograde zzso zzso zzso became zzso in one case within four weeks, changing on the zzso side to an increased zzso flow zzso 

Increased zzso pressure can cause these flow changes, but cerebral blood flow zzso need not be completely ruined in this zzso
