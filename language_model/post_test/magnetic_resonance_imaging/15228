zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso in thalamus, zzso (including zzso zzso and inferior zzso results in serious disabilities, has an zzso of zzso zzso is zzso with zzso and occurs most commonly with zzso Despite decades of study, whether alcohol exposure zzso the zzso or zzso its resolution remains zzso To examine patterns of brain damage and recovery resulting from zzso deprivation with and without alcohol exposure, we conducted in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso at 3 T in zzso zzso rats, which had voluntarily consumed large amounts of alcohol before zzso zzso A total of 18 adult male P rats zzso zzso received a zzso diet for 2 weeks: 10 (five zzso received zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight (four zzso received zzso zzso zzso Neurological signs developed by day zzso zzso were scanned before zzso depletion and 18 and 35 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso MRS zzso zzso with water reference were collected in a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was corrected for zzso tissue zzso zzso identified significant enlargement of zzso zzso and increase in signal zzso in thalamus, inferior zzso and zzso zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso groups from zzso zzso followed by significant zzso from zzso 2-3 in zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso analysis revealed additional zzso signal clusters in the zzso and zzso zzso and enlargement of the fourth zzso MRS showed a significant decline and then partial recovery in zzso zzso a marker of zzso integrity, in zzso compared with zzso rats, with no change detected in zzso zzso or zzso zzso rats with prior alcohol exposure exhibited attenuated recovery in the zzso and arrested growth of the corpus zzso further, two of the five zzso zzso rats died zzso zzso and zzso changes with zzso manipulation zzso with human zzso signs of zzso The enduring zzso and zzso abnormalities involving critical zzso of zzso circuit carry liabilities for development of zzso and incomplete recovery from other cognitive and motor functions zzso by the affected neural zzso
