zzso abilities deteriorate early in patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso and their residual language is zzso by strong zzso effects such as the age of acquisition of words and their zzso The anatomical bases of this early semantic degradation have not been fully zzso To clarify which neural structures, when zzso alter zzso function in patients with very mild zzso this study correlated the zzso attributes of words produced in a semantic zzso task with zzso matter density values from zzso zzso scans of mild zzso zzso The zzso analyses showed a significant correlation between the zzso attributes zzso residual linguistic production in early zzso patients and the integrity of regions of the zzso zzso zzso especially in areas of the zzso and zzso zzso This correlation was present in both zzso There were no correlations within these structures with scores on zzso tests not involving semantic or episodic zzso The results have implications for the role of zzso zzso structures in episodic and semantic retrieval and argue against a zzso function of these structures in respect of episodic and semantic memory zzso This evidence suggests that zzso regions within the zzso complex engage in processes of zzso and retrieval for both semantic and episodic zzso
