To try to determine the cause of zzso of zzso MR images that occurred on and after day 7 following transient cerebral zzso dynamic changes in zzso images and zzso of rats subjected to 20 zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso images showed no remarkable zzso on days 1 and 3, although high signal intensity in the zzso region, in which the zzso value was significantly lower than the values on days 1 and 3, was observed on day zzso High signal intensity in zzso images indicates low zzso zzso zzso observation revealed zzso of zzso in the zzso region on day 7 by zzso zzso There was a tight correlation between zzso values and number of zzso zzso zzso had stout processes and zzso cell bodies on day 7, resembling zzso zzso Sudan black B zzso showed the presence of many fatty droplets in the zzso region on day zzso Furthermore, double zzso with zzso and Sudan black B revealed the presence of fatty droplets in bodies of zzso cells on day zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso images on day 7 following transient zzso and zzso indicates zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso images seem to represent the progression of zzso tissue injury after transient zzso and zzso
