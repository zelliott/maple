To investigate the role of a patient zzso zzso in the zzso of multiple brain zzso acquired by sport divers in the absence of reported zzso zzso 

Prospective double blind cohort zzso 

zzso clubs around zzso and departments of zzso and zzso 

87 sport divers with a minimum of 160 scuba zzso zzso with self contained underwater breathing zzso 

zzso of multiple brain zzso zzso by zzso magnetic resonance imaging and presence and size of patent zzso zzso as documented by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

25 subjects were found to have a zzso zzso 13 with a patent zzso zzso of high zzso zzso A total of 41 brain zzso were detected in 11 zzso There were seven brain zzso in seven divers without a zzso shunt and 34 zzso in four divers with a zzso zzso Multiple brain zzso occurred exclusively in three divers with a large patent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Multiple brain zzso in sport divers were associated with presence of a large patent zzso zzso This association suggests paradoxical gas embolism as the pathological zzso A patent zzso zzso of high zzso relevance seems to be an important risk factor for developing multiple brain zzso in sport zzso
