zzso is the imaging technique that is best suited to evaluating the response to zzso chemotherapy for locally advanced breast zzso We aimed to a) zzso the response in the molecular zzso b) describe the zzso and dynamic variation, and c) determine whether the molecular zzso changes after zzso 

This is a retrospective study of 75 zzso in 69 patients who underwent zzso both before and after zzso zzso The response to treatment was classified as a) complete response, b) major partial response, c) minor partial response, or zzso no zzso We zzso the response in each molecular zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso and triple zzso The zzso changes were classified as a) concentric reduction, b) zzso c) zzso enhancement, or zzso zzso The dynamic changes affected the maximum intensity peak and the zzso zzso 

In the 4 molecular zzso the 4 types of response were zzso The response was good in zzso of the triple negative zzso in zzso of the zzso B zzso in zzso of the zzso A zzso and in zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso change was concentric reduction zzso The zzso dynamic change was a decrease in the maximum intensity peak zzso in zzso and type I or II zzso were seen in zzso 

The triple negative zzso responded best to zzso zzso The most common changes were concentric reduction and a decrease in the maximum intensity peak, with fewer zzso zzso We observed a change in the molecular zzso between the zzso at diagnosis and the final study in zzso of zzso
