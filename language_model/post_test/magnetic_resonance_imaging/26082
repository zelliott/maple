The zzso optical signal zzso has been recently proposed as a method for studying zzso the time course of activity in localized cortical areas zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1998, zzso zzso zzso 5: zzso Previous data have shown that zzso has very good zzso resolution and can provide detailed surface activity zzso In the present study we investigated whether the depth of the active area can also be zzso Nine subjects were run in a study in which the zzso of the visual stimuli was zzso and zzso was recorded from zzso zzso areas using multiple zzso zzso Seven of the same subjects were also run through a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study using the same zzso The zzso data indicated that the depth from the head surface to the cortical area activated increased systematically with the zzso of the visual zzso The zzso recording indicated a response with a zzso of zzso zzso from zzso This response varied systematically with zzso so that the greater the zzso of the zzso the longer the zzso distance (and thus the zzso at which the zzso effect was zzso The depth of the brain area generating the zzso effect was estimated using a simple zzso derived from phantom studies on homogeneous zzso The average depth estimates for each zzso condition obtained with zzso corresponded with those obtained with zzso with discrepancies of less than 1 zzso These data demonstrate that multiple zzso distances can be used to estimate the depth of the cortical areas responsible for the zzso zzso
