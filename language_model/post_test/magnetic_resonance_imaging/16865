New research criteria for zzso vascular zzso zzso have been suggested to define a more homogeneous zzso of vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease zzso but it also occurs in other zzso disorders including vascular zzso So far, it is unknown to which extent zzso zzso is present in zzso 

From a larger consecutive referral population in a memory clinic, 11 patients fulfilling the research criteria for zzso were carefully matched with comparison groups of healthy controls and patients with zzso To estimate the extent of zzso zzso in zzso both zzso zzso and visual rating of zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso were zzso 

In zzso significant zzso zzso zzso The extent was intermediate between controls and patients with zzso both on zzso zzso and visual zzso zzso At the same level of global zzso zzso volumes were reduced by zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso relative to zzso 

Patient groups with zzso and zzso as identified by current research criteria appear to overlap considerably with regard to the feature of zzso zzso While contamination with zzso is a likely cause, other mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso also deserve zzso The findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials of zzso
