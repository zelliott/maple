To investigate the zzso changes in zzso of spinal zzso circuits below the level of zzso from spinal shock to zzso in patients with spinal zzso injury zzso 

More than 6 months after an acute zzso clinical follow-up examinations were paralleled by zzso recordings with zzso nerve stimulation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

During spinal zzso the loss of zzso tap zzso and zzso muscle tone were associated with low persistence of zzso and loss of zzso zzso whereas zzso were already zzso During the transition to zzso the reappearance of zzso tap zzso and muscle tone and the occurrence of spasms was associated with the recovery of zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso ratio remained about stable over zzso At later stages (2 to 6 months after zzso when clinical signs of zzso became established, the zzso measures showed little zzso In zzso patients, in contrast to zzso patients, zzso and zzso zzso zzso even zzso 

The late decrease in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients suggests a secondary zzso of zzso circuits and of zzso The divergent course of clinical signs of zzso and their probable zzso zzso indicates the occurrence of zzso changes contributing to zzso
