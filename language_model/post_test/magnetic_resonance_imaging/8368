What are the basic visual cues that determine our preference towards mundane everyday objects? We previously showed that a highly potent cue is the nature of the zzso zzso people generally like objects with a curved zzso compared with objects that have pointed features and a zzso zzso This bias is hypothesized here to stem from an implicit perception of potential threat conveyed by sharp zzso Using human zzso to test this hypothesis, we report that the amygdala, a brain structure that is involved in fear processing and has been shown to exhibit zzso level that is zzso to zzso in general, is significantly more active for everyday sharp objects zzso a sofa with sharp zzso compared with their curved zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that a preference bias towards a visual object can be induced by low-level zzso properties, independent of semantic meaning, via visual elements that on some level could be associated with zzso We further present behavioral results that provide initial support for the link between the sharpness of the zzso and threat zzso Our brains might be organized to extract these basic zzso elements rapidly for zzso an early warning signal in the presence of potential zzso
