zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been shown to be effective in detailing regions of cerebral zzso in which water zzso translations or motions have been zzso The corresponding zzso patterns, however, have not been zzso Further, the zzso of normal and zzso zzso and the changes due to mild insults are also not zzso This study describes high-speed zzso techniques and observations found in the early detection of regional cerebral zzso in the zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso was used with middle cerebral artery balloon zzso to induce transient zzso and zzso 

zzso diffusion fell within minutes after middle cerebral artery zzso and correlated with zzso or total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be changed in zzso and normal zzso 

zzso of early zzso events is dramatically improved when the motions of water zzso zzso delivery of water zzso and response to zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso All can be accomplished with high-speed zzso techniques described zzso
