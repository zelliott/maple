zzso zzso zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso are both disorders in which early pathology affects the zzso lobe yet they produce distinct syndromes of zzso memory zzso of established semantic knowledge with relatively preserved episodic memory in the former and the converse in the zzso Groups with mild zzso and mild zzso who showed a double zzso in these two aspects of zzso memory were zzso zzso group's episodic memory and the zzso group's semantic knowledge each being comparable to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging were used to map deficits in regional cerebral zzso rate and zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso memory impairment in zzso was associated with dysfunction of an integrated network zzso zzso zzso zzso bodies, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso memory impairment in zzso was associated with bilateral zzso zzso lobe zzso The zzso group had comparable zzso zzso and zzso to that found in zzso but the remainder of their zzso network was preserved suggesting that the latter explains their ability to acquire new episodic zzso The results challenge the view that zzso in early zzso can be explained by the degree of zzso damage alone while showing that semantic impairment can occur with damage restricted to the zzso zzso zzso
