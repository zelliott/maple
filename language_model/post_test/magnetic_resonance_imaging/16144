zzso of the bone zzso on zzso sequences can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging zzso during childhood, even in the absence of bone zzso They can be related to zzso zzso normal and abnormal bone zzso We sought to investigate whether zzso intensity of the bone zzso on zzso of the wrist is zzso and to evaluate if this signal follows a consistent age-related zzso 

Thirty-one wrist zzso T MR images of children zzso zzso without suspected bone pathology were evaluated for zzso of zzso bone zzso seen on zzso zzso sequences using a scale of zzso zzso of frequency, location and intensity of these zzso with age was zzso zzso were analyzed for distribution in single bones and in the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of zzso bones were zzso zzso out of zzso (21 out of 31 zzso showed zzso bone zzso seen on zzso zzso The distribution was: radius in 19, zzso in 19, first zzso base in 11, zzso in 9, zzso in 6, zzso in 6, and fifth zzso base in zzso The involvement of the first and second zzso rows and the zzso bases was almost similar (13, 12, and 12 zzso In the zzso zzso the intensity was similar to or higher than that in the wrist zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased with age zzso at 7-9 and zzso at zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso bone zzso seen on zzso sequences can be seen on zzso of the wrist during childhood even without apparent zzso It shows a consistent pattern with zzso frequency and intensity decrease and there is zzso zzso This may be a normal finding that may represent normal bone zzso or decreasing zzso zzso and should not be confused with pathological bone zzso zzso
