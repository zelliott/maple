The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of the zzso features on the recurrence time and zzso and to emphasize the analyses of mortality risks in zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso features on prognosis were studied for follow-up period of 45 months, from November 1999 to August 2003, on a total of 79 patients' 41 cases of total zzso and 38 cases of zzso zzso diagnosed to have zzso zzso subsequent to zzso 

The cases of gross total zzso had zzso times as high survival rate as those in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso The comparison of the cases in the groups in relation to their ages revealed that mortality rate rose zzso times zzso zzso zzso in the age group of 60 years and above, and zzso times in the age group of zzso zzso When cases without necrosis were compared with the group containing necrosis of grade 1, 2, 3, it was observed that the probability of mortality increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso times zzso zzso zzso in the case of necrosis of grade 2 and 3, respectively by means of Cox zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso seems to be an important clinical marker of the zzso
