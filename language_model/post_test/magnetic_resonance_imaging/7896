Most zzso develop zzso zzso during zzso and many have zzso zzso between zzso zzso pain zzso via the descending pain system may contribute to this zzso and zzso The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso gray zzso and nucleus zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity zzso with other pain processing zzso 

Ten minutes zzso zzso data were collected from 38 adult zzso and 20 zzso zzso analyses compared zzso zzso with zzso and with zzso in zzso with severe zzso zzso zzso to zzso with no zzso zzso zzso zzso between the strength of functional connections that differed between severely zzso and zzso zzso with zzso severity were determined for all zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso was compared with zzso in zzso 

zzso with severe zzso had stronger zzso and zzso zzso to other zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions that participate in zzso pain processing, as well as to frontal and zzso regions implicated in higher order pain zzso Evidence that these zzso differences were specific for zzso zzso 1) strong correlations between some zzso strengths and zzso severity among all zzso and 2) absence of overlap when comparing zzso differences in severely zzso vs zzso zzso with those in all zzso vs zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso descending zzso pain regions with other zzso and higher order zzso regions is associated with zzso zzso
