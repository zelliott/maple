zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso activity in healthy zzso Increased responses to negative stimuli in carriers of low zzso zzso have been proposed to contribute to the zzso of zzso We sought to investigate the effects of zzso as well as diagnosis in patients with zzso 

zzso with zzso depression zzso and matched healthy controls zzso participated in a zzso task of implicit processing of sad facial zzso zzso of zzso (short zzso and long zzso zzso and zzso (including zzso zzso single zzso zzso models of zzso zzso on zzso activity and connectivity were zzso 

zzso effects were observed of both zzso and diagnosis on zzso zzso Increased zzso activity was associated with zzso zzso in low zzso zzso carriers as well as with a diagnosis of zzso The connectivity analysis revealed a main effect of zzso with reduced connectivity to the zzso region of the anterior zzso in carriers of the low zzso zzso There was also a main effect of diagnosis with reduced connectivity to the zzso region of the anterior zzso and to the zzso prefrontal zzso in zzso There were no interaction effects between zzso and diagnosis in zzso activity or zzso 

zzso independent effects of zzso and diagnosis on zzso zzso were zzso The effects of zzso and diagnosis on zzso connectivity showed a regional zzso suggesting that zzso zzso bias zzso connectivity while the development of depression involves more extensive neural zzso These findings point to the potential of connectivity maps as a diagnostic zzso for zzso
