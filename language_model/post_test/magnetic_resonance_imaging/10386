The motivation for cartilage repair is the preservation of adequate joint zzso Repairing joint surface zzso and providing balanced load bearing are crucial for zzso zzso can contribute to this goal by describing number, depth, size, and distribution of cartilage zzso throughout the different joint zzso Essential to such a contribution are adequate spatial resolution at a reasonable zzso together with good contrast between both cartilage and the zzso bone as well as the joint zzso For zzso zzso this is achieved using zzso between 30 and 50 zzso zzso accuracy is optimal when a zzso is depicted in more than one zzso Short zzso high zzso and the appropriate orientation of the frequency zzso direction contribute to minimizing metal zzso Besides internal zzso of the zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso sequences sensitively depict bone zzso zzso such as signal zzso and joint zzso both contributing to highlight even subtle cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso GE sequences profit from their high spatial resolution to appreciate gradual erosion of the zzso In zzso the interface to the surrounding bone, the integrity of the zzso cartilage, and associated zzso are used to determine zzso The presence of two or more findings increases diagnostic zzso zzso is associated with the size of the affected zzso
