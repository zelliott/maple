We aimed to zzso assess the role of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the evaluation of zzso factors for breast conservative surgery during zzso zzso 

zzso patients were evaluated before the first treatment cycle, after the second cycle, and upon the completion of zzso chemotherapy according to largest tumor diameter, tumor volume, zzso enhancement, and tumor zzso zzso The patients were divided into zzso zzso complete and near complete zzso and zzso Each zzso was re-evaluated according to zzso criteria for identification of candidates for breast conservative zzso 

In zzso zzso the zzso size upon the completion of zzso chemotherapy was significantly smaller compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as was the volume zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The measured zzso size did not differ from the zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and had a high correlation zzso In responders, the following parameters were significantly different before and after zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso volume zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso concentric regression, plateau and continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the sensitivity of zzso and the accuracy of zzso to identify candidates for breast conservative zzso 

zzso zzso zzso parameters may contribute to the multidisciplinary decision when considering the selection of candidates for breast conservative zzso
