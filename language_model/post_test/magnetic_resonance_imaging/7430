In this work, zzso zzso zzso capable of emitting near infrared zzso zzso and generating zzso under an external magnetic field were prepared by combination of zzso reaction and zzso zzso generated by electron transfer for atom transfer radical zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso iron as the catalyst on the surface of zzso iron oxide zzso zzso The zzso zzso was prepared through zzso zzso and zzso bearing zzso dye was also zzso afterwards they were integrated together by zzso zzso The different stages of surface modification were approved by employing different characterization techniques such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the properties of the final zzso were thoroughly zzso Their suitability as dual model imaging agents for magnetic resonance zzso and zzso imaging was investigated, indicating them to be a competitive candidate for imaging contrast zzso
