zzso MR imaging has been used to study patterns of zzso zzso that distinguish zzso from normal memory loss in the elderly zzso Our objective was to assess whether zzso zzso confounds zzso of zzso zzso in subjects with mild cognitive impairment zzso 

Twenty subjects with zzso and 20 elderly control subjects with zzso normal memory were studied at zzso during a zzso paradigm designed to activate the zzso zzso zzso was measured using 2 separate zzso applying a zzso region of interest zzso in standardized template space and applying a manually drawn zzso in native subject zzso zzso correlation zzso were calculated to compare zzso relationships between zzso volume and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso was performed to assess group differences in zzso zzso during zzso and zzso Age and zzso volume were included as zzso as was a term for the interaction between zzso volume and zzso 

When zzso zzso was measured by the zzso method, the correlation zzso in the right zzso of subjects with zzso but not control subjects during retrieval differed significantly from zzso There was a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction in the zzso zzso No significant correlations or interactions were demonstrated when zzso was measured in native subject space with manually drawn zzso 

Our findings suggest a potential zzso relationship between zzso volume and zzso for subjects with zzso in zzso zzso zzso measures of zzso zzso that do not adequately account for zzso zzso should be used with caution in patients with zzso
