We used emotional expectancy to study zzso zzso in the processing of emotional zzso During functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso volunteers saw emotional and neutral expectancy cues signaling the subsequent presentation of corresponding emotional or neutral pictorial zzso As a control, emotional and neutral pictures were presented without preceding expectancy zzso resulting in a 2 zzso 2 zzso design with the factors zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant positive interaction effect between these factors in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso In all these regions, expectancy zzso the neural response to emotional but not to neutral zzso Time course analysis of raw data suggests that this zzso zzso was not preceded by baseline increases in zzso and zzso during the period of emotional zzso In a zzso session, the paradigm was presented for a second time to allow emotional intensity zzso Again, a significant interaction between expectancy and emotion was observed, with intensity ratings specifically enhanced in emotional photographs preceded by zzso There was a positive correlation between intensity ratings and blood zzso zzso zzso signals in the left zzso We conclude that specific components of the emotion network show enhanced zzso in response to emotional stimuli when these are preceded by zzso This enhancement effect is not present in neutral pictures and might parallel zzso zzso feeling zzso
