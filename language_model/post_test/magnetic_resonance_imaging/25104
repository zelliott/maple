It is a retrospective study of the zzso features of 30 cases of cortical zzso All patients were evaluated by zzso and brain zzso using zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences with zzso zzso 

zzso patients were referred to the neurology department because of zzso zzso and one patient for mental zzso Our patients were distributed in 4 groups: diffuse forms represented by zzso (4 zzso zzso (one zzso and zzso zzso (5 zzso local bilateral forms represented by bilateral zzso (11 zzso unilateral forms represented by zzso (one zzso and focal cortical forms found in eight zzso
