To compare the sensitivity of fast spin echo zzso and of fast fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso zzso in detecting spinal zzso zzso in multiple zzso 

With a zzso zzso machine and a zzso receiver zzso zzso images (with two different zzso zzso and fast zzso images of the spinal zzso were obtained from 13 patients with multiple zzso 

Twenty three zzso (10 zzso 12 zzso and one zzso were found in seven patients zzso using zzso with the larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cervical and 10 zzso were detected in the same seven patients using zzso with smaller zzso zzso Nine zzso (five cervical and four zzso were found using fast zzso in six patients zzso All the zzso found using fast zzso were detected using the other two techniques and all the zzso detected by zzso with smaller zzso size were detected using zzso and greater zzso zzso 

Fast zzso sequences detect substantially fewer zzso zzso in patients with multiple zzso
