Smaller zzso volumes have been consistently observed in pediatric bipolar disorder subjects compared to healthy control zzso Whether smaller zzso volume is a consequence or zzso of the first episode of mania is not zzso Additionally, smaller volume has not been localized to specific zzso zzso 

We compared surface zzso maps of the zzso between 22 youths at high risk for bipolar disorder, 26 youths meeting full diagnostic criteria for pediatric familial bipolar disorder, and 24 healthy control subjects matched for age, zzso and intelligence zzso zzso were manually delineated on three-dimensional zzso zzso echo images by a blinded zzso using established tracing zzso zzso surface mesh modeling zzso supported by zzso statistics were used to identify regional surface differences between the zzso 

When compared to high-risk subjects and controls, youth with bipolar disorder showed surface zzso in specific zzso zzso suggesting smaller volume of the zzso zzso The high-risk subjects did not differ from controls in any zzso 

These findings support previous reports of smaller zzso volume in pediatric bipolar disorder and map the location of zzso to specific zzso zzso These zzso have been associated with fear conditioning and zzso zzso The absence of zzso size abnormalities in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder suggests that reductions might occur after the onset of zzso
