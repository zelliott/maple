To investigate the reliability and clinical value of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso in minimally invasive neurosurgery and protection of brain zzso We demonstrate the correlation between the zzso zzso distance and occurrence of new zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used for minimally invasive neurosurgery in 20 patients with zzso zzso located in or near eloquent brain zzso During standardized zzso for hand, foot, and tongue movement, language and visual zzso zzso imaging zzso blood oxygen level dependent sequences were acquired by zzso Medical Systems Trio zzso T and processed with zzso zzso was performed with zzso zzso 

zzso data was integrated into zzso successfully in all cases, functional zzso with integration of zzso allowed easy and precise identification of the eloquent brain areas and zzso except for 1 case for brain shift because of tumor stroke just before the zzso The zzso of the tumor was corrected by zzso zzso Gross total zzso was achieved in 18 patients, 2 patients had a zzso zzso Neurological deterioration was seen in 4 patients, tumors all located in eloquent brain areas, 2 patients were recovered in 3 months the morbidity was zzso The distance of a zzso to zzso zzso was more than 10 zzso in 14 zzso The functional maps were located in left zzso 9, 46, 17, 18 and 19 areas in 11 cases when the patients reading and understanding the Chinese zzso 

zzso zzso with integration of zzso allows precise identification of the eloquent brain areas protects the brain function and decreases the morbidity especially for Chinese patients because of our special functional area of zzso Our data suggest that the distance of a zzso to zzso zzso was more than 10 zzso complete zzso can be achieved zzso
