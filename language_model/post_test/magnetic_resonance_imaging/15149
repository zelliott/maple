This study evaluated whether zzso zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso could predict the zzso significance of zzso coronary artery zzso as defined by zzso determined fractional flow reserve at coronary zzso In 19 patients with known coronary artery disease zzso the zzso relevance of 22 zzso zzso zzso severity 73 zzso zzso was determined using fractional flow reserve zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with a territorial index of zzso zzso reserve zzso derived from zzso In addition, 9 zzso patients with low prevalence of risk factors and without zzso at zzso served as a control zzso A zzso of zzso for zzso separated zzso relevant from zzso zzso with a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso The area under the zzso characteristic curve was zzso In the patient group, territories supplied by arteries without significant zzso zzso showed a lower zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso may be useful for assessment of the zzso relevance of zzso zzso zzso
