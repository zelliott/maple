zzso or zzso zzso is a technique for mapping temperature differences in the region of interest zzso using the baseline phase estimated by zzso the field in the surrounding region for zzso zzso and zzso the estimated baseline from the measured zzso In the present work a self-reference technique based on complex field zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was proposed and zzso zzso simulations with a zzso phase distribution demonstrated that the zzso radius had to be zzso times the standard zzso zzso of the zzso function in order to keep the error below zzso of the peak phase zzso The area ratio between the zzso and the zzso had to be larger than zzso to maintain the error zzso Based on the simulations, and phantom and volunteer experiments, the zzso method with independently zzso zzso orders for the two spatial dimensions was compared with the zzso method using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso method appeared to be useful when phase zzso was not zzso Otherwise, the zzso method yielded equivalent results with less zzso zzso
