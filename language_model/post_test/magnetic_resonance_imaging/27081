Blood pressure zzso is recognized as a major risk factor for white matter zzso zzso but zzso data are scarce, and there is insufficient evidence for the benefit of zzso therapy on zzso zzso We studied the relationship between zzso change and zzso volume progression over time in a sample of zzso elderly individuals who had 2 cerebral magnetic resonance imaging examinations 4 years zzso We also examined the impact of zzso treatment on zzso zzso 

zzso were participants from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso a prospective zzso cohort of elderly zzso 65 years of zzso zzso volumes and their progression were estimated with the use of a fully automatic zzso We performed zzso models first to assess the association between zzso change and zzso progression and second to estimate the relation between zzso treatment and zzso load zzso zzso and change in zzso were significant zzso of higher zzso progression over time after controlling for potential zzso Among subjects with high zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso at baseline not treated by zzso medication, zzso treatment started within 2 years was related to a smaller increase in zzso volume at a zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso than no zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso on multivariable zzso 

Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that hypertension is a strong predictor of zzso and that adequate treatment may reduce the course of zzso zzso Because zzso are linked to both zzso and stroke risks, these results could have implications for future preventive zzso
