zzso surface motion zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso heavily zzso image of two different zzso of zzso fluid zzso zzso which enables the assessment of the dynamics of brain surface zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this imaging method for providing zzso information about zzso between zzso and the brain zzso 

zzso cases with surgically zzso zzso in whom zzso was zzso obtained were zzso zzso consisted of two sets of zzso zzso heavily zzso fast spin echo zzso Images of the zzso phase and the zzso phase were zzso and zzso was performed with zzso motion zzso We analyzed the presence of zzso texture surrounding the tumor and judged the degree of motion zzso as zzso zzso or zzso The correlation between zzso and surgical findings was zzso For cases with partial zzso agreements in the locations of the zzso were also zzso 

On zzso zzso no motion zzso was seen in eight cases, partial in six cases, and total in four zzso These zzso predictions about zzso and surgical findings agreed in 13 cases zzso The locations of zzso agreed in five of six cases with partial zzso 

In the current study, zzso could predict brain and zzso zzso correctly in zzso of cases, and zzso location could also be zzso This imaging method appears to provide zzso information about zzso zzso
