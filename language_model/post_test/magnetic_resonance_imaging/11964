A zzso zzso zzso echo pulse sequence for nuclear magnetic resonance zzso is zzso It employs zzso zzso slices to acquire data efficiently on zzso which favor zzso acquisition over sequential acquisition for zzso zzso It is useful on any zzso when the effective zzso is extended to enhance the sensitivity to slow zzso The technique was applied to the region from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of three normal zzso The right and left common zzso arteries and zzso the separation of the external and internal zzso zzso and secondary branches were clearly zzso
