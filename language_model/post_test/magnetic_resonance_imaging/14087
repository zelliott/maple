zzso of zzso zzso parameters of the zzso spine in patients with zzso syndromes zzso to determine the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso 

In 20 healthy normal persons and 28 zzso patients a dynamic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso spine was zzso After the initial zzso 24 of the 28 zzso patients received an zzso therapy with zzso With an average of zzso months after the beginning of therapy a zzso examination in 9 of these patients was zzso The zzso and zzso constant were calculated and a statistical comparison of these values between healthy persons and zzso patients as well as a correlation with the clinical course was zzso 

Compared with the normal controls the zzso patients showed a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 7 of 9 zzso patients undergoing zzso therapy a reduction of the zzso and exchange rate constant values was evident in the zzso follow-up zzso zzso these patients showed a therapy response with complete or partial disease zzso 

In zzso patients significantly higher zzso parameters can be demonstrated than in normal zzso Under zzso treatment these values decrease in case of a response to zzso Thus, zzso seems suitable for the evaluation of zzso therapy zzso
