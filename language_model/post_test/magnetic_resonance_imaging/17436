To define the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of zzso displacement of the zzso zzso 

The MR examinations of the knee performed between December 2002 and April 2004 on zzso patients zzso age 32 zzso with knee trauma and subsequently subjected to zzso were zzso reviewed to assess the presence of zzso zzso tear and zzso displacement of the zzso free zzso The MR examinations were performed using a zzso zzso T MR unit with a zzso zzso dedicated for the zzso The MR images were acquired with zzso zzso and GE zzso sequences in the zzso zzso and zzso planes with 3 zzso thickness and 1 zzso zzso The images were independently reviewed by two authors blinded to the zzso zzso In case of zzso a third author, unaware of the zzso findings, gave his zzso 

On MR images a zzso zzso tear was identified in zzso zzso In 6 out of 54 patients, an zzso zzso zzso displacement of the zzso zzso with associated inflammatory zzso reaction around the zzso was zzso In one case an associated inflammatory zzso reaction with zzso around the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso collateral ligament was zzso All cases were confirmed by zzso and no statistical differences between the two authors were zzso 

MR allows the detection of the zzso zzso zzso displacement and a more correct planning of zzso with a strong reduction of repeat zzso
