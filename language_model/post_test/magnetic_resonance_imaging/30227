The objective was to zzso record the CT and zzso features and healing patterns of zzso incomplete stress fractures of the zzso zzso 

The CT scans of 156 adolescents referred with suspected zzso zzso stress fractures were zzso Patients with incomplete zzso 2) zzso fractures were included in the zzso zzso were assessed on CT according to zzso level, location of cortical involvement and direction of fracture zzso zzso was also performed in 72 of the 156 zzso zzso images of incomplete fractures were assessed for the presence of zzso zzso and cortical zzso zzso healing patterns were zzso on follow-up CT zzso 

Twenty-five incomplete fractures were identified in 23 patients on zzso All fractures involved the inferior or zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso percent of incomplete fractures demonstrated either complete or partial healing on follow-up zzso Two zzso cases progressed to complete zzso Thirteen incomplete fractures in 11 patients confirmed on CT also had zzso and zzso demonstrated zzso in the zzso Ten out of thirteen fractures zzso showed a break in the zzso zzso with intact zzso cortex, which correlated with the CT zzso zzso incorrectly graded one case as a complete zzso 3) zzso and 2 cases as zzso 1) stress zzso Six fractures had follow-up zzso zzso showed partial or complete cortical healing, and the same number showed persistent zzso zzso 

zzso fracture of the zzso zzso represents a stage of the evolution of a complete stress zzso The direction of fracture propagation is consistent, and complete healing can be achieved in most cases with appropriate clinical zzso CT best demonstrates fracture size and extent, and is the most appropriate zzso for zzso zzso is limited in its ability to fully depict the cortical integrity of incomplete fractures of the zzso but the presence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso sequences is a useful means of detecting acute zzso
