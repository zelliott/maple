Many methods for mapping zzso zzso regions by functional analysis have been zzso However, the complicated relationship between zzso function and zzso and the inherent limitations of the imaging techniques used, have led to a generally low mapping zzso We show zzso that highly accurate mapping can be obtained by combining zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso three-dimensional zzso analysis, and artificial neural zzso Nine canine hearts with acute zzso were studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in each heart and reconstructed in 3-D at end zzso zzso and end zzso zzso The zzso were arranged in three slices approximately 1 zzso thick and covered most of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso area strain were calculated for each zzso zzso a zzso zzso analysis, the percent zzso in each zzso was estimated using zzso blue zzso the PM analysis served as a zzso zzso An artificial neural network zzso designed to estimate the percent zzso in each zzso from the functional indexes, was then zzso The ANN zzso the zzso relationship in 192 zzso taken from eight of the hearts and was asked to estimate the percent zzso in the 24 zzso of the ninth zzso The process was repeated nine times, each time using a different heart as test zzso The average accuracy of zzso zzso the accuracy with which the ANN has mapped the normal and zzso zzso using the functional zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso This accuracy was superior to the accuracy obtained by optimal zzso of the same zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso zzso
