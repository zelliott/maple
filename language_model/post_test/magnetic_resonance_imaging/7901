Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso has targeted several zzso zzso including the zzso nucleus zzso and the nucleus zzso While the most appropriate target is still being looked for, little attention has been given to the side of the zzso zzso in relationship to zzso 

We report 2 patients diagnosed with zzso one having symmetry obsessions and the other one with zzso obsessive zzso They were implanted zzso with deep zzso located at both zzso and zzso zzso The effectiveness of the stimulation was tested for every possible paired combination of zzso guided by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso 

In both cases, the combination of zzso which best relieved the zzso symptoms was both the left zzso and left zzso In case 1, the zzso zzso score was 33, and 1 month after stimulation it was zzso In case 2, the zzso scores were 33 and 3, respectively, with the patient being free of zzso 

Some reports suggest that zzso stimulation or stimulation of only the right side zzso zzso zzso However, anatomical and functional studies are not conclusive as to which side is most affected in zzso zzso each zzso patient has an individualized optimal side to zzso
