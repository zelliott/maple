To assess the possibility of zzso between completely zzso zzso and ordinary zzso by using zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso employing very small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in comparison with zzso dynamic zzso 

The subjects were 25 patients with 52 zzso confirmed zzso zzso All zzso were divided into two zzso zzso (5 completely zzso zzso and 47 ordinary zzso For each zzso the enhancement index zzso at zzso dynamic zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso were obtained and then zzso 

The zzso at second and third dynamic zzso clearly differentiated the two types of zzso without overlap of zzso zzso also clearly differentiated the two types of zzso without overlap of zzso Moreover, there were significant positive correlations between zzso and zzso at all dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Not only zzso dynamic zzso but also zzso with very small zzso could be useful for zzso completely zzso zzso from ordinary zzso
