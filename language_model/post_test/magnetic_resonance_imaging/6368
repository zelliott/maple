The cerebral energy metabolism and brain zzso were investigated in three experimental cerebral zzso models using zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso in the same subject zzso These zzso were performed also in experimental brain zzso models and the findings were compared with each zzso zzso showed an zzso pattern in all of the cerebral zzso models, that is, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso peak increased and shifted to a higher resonant zzso However, zzso did not show any remarkable change in the brain zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso clearly demonstrated brain zzso in the brain zzso zzso In the cerebral zzso models, zzso findings differed depending upon the type of model, namely the most marked brain zzso was detected in the unilateral middle cerebral zzso zzso model and no marked change was detected in the temporary four vessel zzso zzso It was thought that this difference depended on the severity of the zzso zzso zzso the fundamental zzso problem of cerebral zzso was the energy metabolism zzso with the brain zzso being associated with this zzso but occurring zzso However, in the brain zzso model the main pathological change was the increase in tissue zzso
