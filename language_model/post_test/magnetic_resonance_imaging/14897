The zzso of important sounds is often hampered due to the presence of other masking zzso The present study investigates if a correlate of the zzso of a tone masked by noise is found in late auditory evoked zzso measured from human zzso The zzso of the target sound at a fixed physical intensity is varied by introducing auditory cues of zzso zzso target signal phase disparity and zzso coherent zzso level fluctuations in different frequency zzso In agreement with previous studies, zzso experiments showed that both stimulus zzso result in a masking release zzso zzso masking level difference; zzso zzso masking zzso compared to a condition where those cues are not zzso Late auditory evoked zzso zzso zzso were recorded for the stimuli at a constant zzso level, but different signal levels within the same set of listeners who participated in the zzso zzso The data indicate differences in zzso and zzso between stimuli with and without zzso phase zzso However, differences for stimuli with and without coherent zzso zzso were only found for zzso zzso only zzso is sensitive to the increase in zzso irrespective of the cue that caused the masking zzso The zzso of zzso is consistent with the zzso finding of an addition of the masking releases when both cues are zzso Even though it cannot be concluded where along the auditory zzso the zzso is represented, the zzso component of auditory evoked zzso is a candidate for an objective measure of zzso in the human auditory zzso
