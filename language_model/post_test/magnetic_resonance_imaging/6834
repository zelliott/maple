To zzso determine a zzso zzso for calculating relative lung volume in fetuses with normal lungs and of a wide range of zzso ages by using proved independent variables and to zzso investigate the use of this zzso in fetuses with pulmonary zzso 

Total lung volume zzso was measured by using zzso on zzso rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement magnetic resonance zzso images obtained in 91 fetuses with zzso zzso normal chests and 28 fetuses with zzso pulmonary zzso All fetuses were aged between 18 and 38 weeks zzso Analysis of zzso was used to identify parameters that were not different between the fetuses with zzso normal and those with zzso abnormal chests, and these variables were used to construct an zzso for calculating predicted lung zzso The relative lung zzso is, the observed lung volume expressed as a percentage of the predicted lung zzso then calculated in fetuses with pulmonary zzso 

There was no significant difference in mean maternal or zzso age between the two fetus zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to generate the following equation for predicting fetal lung volume on the basis of independent zzso indexes, with a correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso with zzso and liver volume zzso in zzso and zzso diameter zzso and zzso length zzso in zzso In the fetuses with normal chests, relative lung volume varied between 51% and zzso In the fetuses with pulmonary zzso relative lung volume varied between zzso and zzso 

The predicted lung volume in fetuses of a wide range of zzso ages can be calculated with a high degree of zzso enabling prenatal MR imaging lung zzso in which relative lung volume is used to zzso fetal pulmonary zzso
