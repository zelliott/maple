It has been established that the zzso zzso zzso including the zzso is crucial for zzso zzso The aim of the current functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study was to investigate whether the zzso is zzso activated for associations between items processed in the same zzso region zzso as compared with associations between items processed in different zzso regions zzso Here, we show that the zzso is significantly more active for zzso associations compared with zzso zzso Thus, the zzso is important for zzso zzso and zzso shows greater zzso when the stimuli to be associated come from different stimulus zzso
