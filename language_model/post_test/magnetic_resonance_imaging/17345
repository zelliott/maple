Nine patients with zzso were treated with locally injected zzso and followed zzso We performed an ultrasound study in all cases to delineate the size, location, nature, and number of compartments of the zzso prior to the zzso Under ultrasound guidance, the content of the zzso cavity was zzso and 1 - 3 zzso zzso were zzso The patients were revisited zzso No attempt at zzso was made as long as the mass continued to decrease in zzso 

Patients consisted of 4 boys and 5 girls aged between 14 days and 6 zzso The zzso of the mass was cervical in 6, zzso zzso and zzso in 1, zzso in 1 and zzso and zzso in zzso In six children, the mass disappeared totally after a single zzso In one patient a second injection was needed, and surgical zzso was performed in two patients with residual solid zzso No complication related to zzso was zzso 

Local application of zzso in children with zzso is a simple, safe, and effective zzso In the majority of cases, total healing may be achieved with a single zzso
