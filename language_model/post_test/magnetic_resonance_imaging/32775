It is well known that emotion can modify the experience of zzso However, it is unclear how an emotional state and its zzso neural activity affects activity in brain regions responsive to pain, thus altering the experience of pain zzso In this study, we examined the effect of sad mood on perception of painful stimuli and used functional zzso zzso to identify neural activity changes in 15 participants who, in separate trials, zzso received painful electric zzso zzso experienced a sad zzso and zzso received electric shocks as they were experiencing a sad zzso zzso mood was induced using a previously validated paradigm using sad zzso As predicted, participants rated pain as more intense when they were experiencing a sad mood zzso sad zzso than when they were viewing neutral pictures, even though the intensity of the painful stimulation was identical under both zzso Analysis of zzso data showed that when pain was delivered while participants were feeling sad, neural zzso was significantly greater in some areas known to process pain information as well as some that are believed to primarily process zzso The zzso areas included the secondary zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso regions included the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that increased zzso in the zzso is part of a zzso system of pain zzso that includes the anterior zzso cortex, amygdala, and zzso zzso
