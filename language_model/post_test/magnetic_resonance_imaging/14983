zzso zzso properties of brain connectivity networks have emerged as important features of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate how the zzso zzso to graph measures of functional integration and functional segregation brain networks are disrupted in zzso zzso resting state and auditory oddball discrimination zzso zzso data of healthy controls zzso and schizophrenia patients zzso were zzso into zzso independent components zzso by group independent component analysis zzso Then, weighted positive and negative functional integration zzso zzso and functional segregation zzso zzso brain networks were built in each zzso zzso connectivity strength, zzso zzso and global efficiency of all brain networks were statistically compared between groups zzso and zzso in each state and between states zzso and zzso within zzso We found that graph measures of negative functional integration brain network and several positive functional segregation brain networks were altered in schizophrenia during zzso zzso The metrics of positive functional integration brain network and one positive functional segregation brain network were higher during the resting state than during the zzso task only in zzso These findings imply that zzso characteristics of both functional integration and functional segregation brain networks are impaired in schizophrenia which provides new insight into the altered brain performance in this brain zzso
