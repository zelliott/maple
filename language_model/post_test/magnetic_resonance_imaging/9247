To describe a method of airway infantile zzso staging using standardized assessment of airway zzso and zzso location and volume, as determined with zzso and CT zzso 

Case series with chart zzso 

zzso pediatric hospital, zzso 

zzso included airway zzso patients evaluated at a zzso pediatric zzso Data collected were age at first symptoms, diagnostic zzso percent airway compromise, and estimated zzso zzso Data were analyzed with descriptive and Fisher exact zzso 

Twelve patients were identified and seven had complete data zzso Mean age at first symptoms was zzso months zzso zzso months, range zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso CT zzso and/or zzso Mean zzso airway narrowing was estimated at zzso percent zzso zzso range zzso Total zzso volume was less in patients with isolated zzso zzso zzso compared with airway zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stages were stage one (5 of 12; zzso stage two (6 of 12; zzso and stage three (1 of 12; zzso 

This method of airway zzso staging may be zzso to treatment planning and used to measure treatment zzso
