In order to assess the sound level experienced by the fetal ear during zzso magnetic resonance imaging, a fluid filled stomach was used as an experimental model of the zzso zzso A better than 30 zzso zzso in intensity was recorded across the frequency band of interest for all patient zzso This was enough to reduce acoustic sound pressure from a level close to the instantaneous damage threshold zzso zzso to an acceptable level zzso 90 zzso zzso mechanical zzso through the patient table was also shown to increase zzso sound pressure levels by as much as 10 zzso Much higher peak pressures could be obtained by tapping of abdomen with the zzso
