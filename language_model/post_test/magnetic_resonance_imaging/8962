Despite numerous studies, the role of patent zzso zzso zzso as a risk factor for stroke due to paradoxical embolism is still zzso On the assumption that specific zzso patterns, in particular multiple acute zzso zzso on zzso magnetic resonance imaging, indicate a zzso origin, we compared the zzso findings in stroke patients with zzso shunt zzso and those zzso 

The records of zzso patients with diagnosis of cerebral zzso were zzso For detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in all zzso An zzso scan of the brain was performed in all zzso zzso vascular territories were divided into anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, zzso artery system including zzso cerebral artery, brain stem and zzso stroke, and strokes occurring in more than one zzso 

We did not find a specific difference in zzso zzso patterns in patients with zzso compared with patients without zzso In particular, 23 of 165 patients zzso with zzso showed multiple zzso zzso on zzso in comparison with 45 of 321 patients zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings also applied for the zzso of zzso strokes with and without zzso 

We found no association between an zzso zzso pattern that is considered as being typical for stroke due to cardiac embolism and the existence of zzso zzso our findings do not provide any support for the common theory of paradoxical embolism as a major cause of stroke in zzso zzso
