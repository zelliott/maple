Many models of spoken word recognition zzso that the acoustic stream is parsed into zzso level units, which in turn activate larger representations zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso The zzso model of speech zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso whereas others suggest that larger units of analysis are activated without the need for zzso mediation zzso zzso A zzso theoretical framework for understanding spoken zzso In zzso Greenberg & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to speech: An auditory perspective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005; zzso zzso zzso Speech zzso A model of zzso analysis and zzso zzso Journal of zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, processing time, and zzso units in auditory zzso Psychological Review, 79, zzso zzso zzso zzso effects in the zzso response to speech may speak to this zzso For example, if such effects were localized to relatively early processing stages in auditory cortex, this would support a model of speech recognition in which zzso units are explicitly parsed zzso In contrast, zzso processes that occur outside auditory zzso may indicate that alternative models should be zzso The current zzso experiment manipulated the zzso frequency zzso of words that were zzso presented in short lists while participants performed a zzso detection zzso zzso is thought to zzso networks in which zzso level units are zzso The present experiment identified activity in the left inferior frontal zzso that was positively correlated with zzso No effects of zzso were found in zzso lobe zzso We propose that the observed zzso effects during speech listening reflect the strength of the association between acoustic speech patterns and zzso speech codes involving zzso level zzso On the basis of existing zzso evidence, we interpret the function of this zzso association as playing a role primarily in zzso These findings are consistent with the view that zzso level units are not necessarily zzso during speech zzso
