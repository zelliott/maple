Both zzso and zzso have developed rapidly in the past few zzso Recently the two methods have been combined in a new technique called genetic zzso 

To provide an overview of the backgrounds and the possibilities of genetic zzso 

In this review we first discuss genetic and zzso research methods that are currently in use and then discuss their synergistic zzso Finally we zzso two recent cases in which genetic zzso was used to study an zzso vulnerability to affective and psychotic zzso results zzso are very promising, particularly with regard to research into vulnerability to psychiatric zzso It is expected that the use of genetic zzso procedures will zzso zzso and zzso methods are often zzso complex, which means they cannot be easily zzso by the general zzso
