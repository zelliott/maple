The present study aimed to examine and compare memory processing in patients with unilateral zzso lobe zzso zzso before and after surgery using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso zzso patients with unilateral zzso zzso left, eight right) and eight healthy controls were zzso They performed a complex visual zzso task during zzso to measure memory zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Their memory performance was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso After unilateral zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso or zzso the same zzso paradigm and zzso tests were administered to the patient zzso 

zzso patients demonstrated a decline in verbal memory after left zzso lobe zzso Their zzso verbal and visual memory performance was positively associated with zzso functional zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso memory performance of zzso patients was positively associated with zzso functional zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso to their respective side of zzso 

zzso memory performance was significantly associated with functional zzso zzso to the side of zzso in patients with unilateral zzso and the function of the zzso zzso zzso lobe might play an important role in supporting memory performance after zzso lobe zzso
