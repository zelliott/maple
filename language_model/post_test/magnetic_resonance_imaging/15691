To assess the feasibility of dynamic zzso zzso for evaluating changes in the zzso angle and movements of the zzso zzso zzso during resting and straining states in pediatric patients presenting with zzso 

Six pediatric patients zzso years old) with chronic zzso and zzso evidence of zzso were assessed by dynamic zzso zzso Changes in the zzso angle, the degree of zzso zzso and the thickness and length of the zzso muscles were measured during rest and zzso The findings were compared with those obtained in six zzso and zzso zzso 

The children with zzso had a smaller zzso angle during zzso and the angle decreased from rest to zzso The zzso also became paradoxically shortened and thickened during straining in the zzso zzso There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of the change of degree of the zzso angle, and the thickness and length of the zzso muscle during zzso 

Fast dynamic zzso is feasible for evaluating zzso movement in pediatric zzso zzso results suggest that children with zzso have a smaller zzso angle and a different zzso zzso compared to zzso
