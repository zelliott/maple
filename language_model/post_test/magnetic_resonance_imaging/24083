To determine the relative utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging with zzso zzso in the zzso staging of zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we compared the three zzso individual performance with surgical zzso zzso In contrast to prior studies, zzso was not zzso 

The zzso were evaluated using PET and CT in 64 zzso zzso zzso was performed in 9 of these zzso zzso with a PET standard zzso value greater than or equal to zzso or greater than 1 zzso in the short axis by CT or lack of zzso signal change were considered positive for zzso zzso All zzso were sampled and subjected to standard zzso zzso zzso CT, and zzso scans were interpreted blinded to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy for each scan type to appropriately stage zzso was determined using zzso results as the zzso 

Thirty patients had stage I disease, 8 stage II, 9 stage zzso 7 stage zzso and 10 stage zzso zzso zzso were zzso Sixteen patients had zzso zzso zzso Compared to the pathological results, zzso CT, and zzso had a sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso PET and zzso were statistically more accurate than CT zzso In cases where PET and CT did not identify zzso involvement with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso 

PET and zzso are statistically more accurate than zzso However, the differences are small and may not be clinically zzso No technique was sensitive or specific enough to change the current recommendation to perform zzso for zzso staging in zzso
