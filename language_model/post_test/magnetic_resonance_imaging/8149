The zzso of molecules into zzso is studied for its potential in delivering a high dose of zzso drugs to a zzso while minimizing side zzso Most systems either release their content in a zzso manner or under specific environmental conditions such as temperature or zzso We have zzso a novel class of zzso zzso zzso that can zzso zzso a zzso compound and subsequently release it upon zzso of zzso zzso Here, we describe an in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso that can evaluate the state of incorporation of a small zzso contrast zzso Our results indicate that the contrast agent alone can diffuse through a zzso but that the same agent incorporated into zzso zzso After exposure to zzso light, the zzso released the contrast agent, which could then diffuse through the zzso
