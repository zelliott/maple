In zzso subjects, resting energy expenditure zzso can be accurately calculated from organ and tissue masses applying constant zzso zzso zzso This approach allows a precise correction for zzso variation in zzso explained by body zzso Since a decrease in organ zzso rate with increasing organ mass has been deduced from zzso comparison including human studies, the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso calculation remains to be proved over a wider range of zzso mass zzso 

In a zzso study on 57 healthy adults (35 females and 22 zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso 25 intermediate weight and 18 zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso were used to assess the masses of brain, internal zzso skeletal muscle zzso bone and zzso zzso zzso was measured by indirect zzso zzso and calculated from detailed organ size determination by zzso and zzso zzso or in a simplified approach exclusively from zzso zzso 

We found a high agreement between zzso and zzso over the whole range of zzso zzso zzso zzso prediction errors were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in intermediate weight, zzso and obese subjects, respectively zzso zzso zzso on zzso resulted in a significant positive intercept of zzso zzso that could be reduced to zzso zzso by adjusting zzso for the proportion of zzso zzso In a multiple zzso analysis, zzso and liver mass explained zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso prediction showed a good agreement with measured values zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso difference zzso 

zzso analysis of metabolically active components of zzso allows zzso prediction over a wide range of zzso The data provide indirect evidence for a view that, for practical purposes within humans, the specific zzso rate is constant with increasing organ zzso zzso of zzso on zzso was partly explained by zzso zzso A simplified zzso prediction zzso from regional zzso zzso has to be validated in future zzso
