This study zzso conflicting zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso reports of increased or unaffected zzso compounds zzso in human brain in response to a single dose of 50 zzso zzso zzso 

The present work was based on a well-established strategy for quantitative zzso MRS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso automated spectral zzso that allows the determination of cerebral zzso zzso rather than zzso resonance intensity zzso Moreover, the investigations were extended to a possible long-term effect of oral zzso by monitoring the continuous zzso of 2 zzso 16 g of zzso per day for 4 zzso Six young healthy volunteers participated in each study and zzso zzso were determined in standardized locations in gray matter, white matter, zzso and zzso 

Neither for short-term nor for long-term administration of zzso do the data reveal statistically significant zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso total zzso compounds zzso zzso total zzso and zzso zzso zzso in any of the investigated brain zzso 

Previous reports of increased zzso are not zzso
