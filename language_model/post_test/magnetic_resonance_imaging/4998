This report is a zzso of the human muscle architecture literature that analyzes the number of muscles, number of subjects, and muscle fiber length zzso of variation zzso by body zzso 

Muscle fiber length data are used to make recommendations for zzso architectural study sample zzso 

An average of 9 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso muscles and an average of 9 zzso 5 subjects were reported in the 26 studies zzso Across all studies, average fiber length zzso was highly variable zzso zzso zzso This shows that sample sizes required to achieve adequate power varies by anatomical zzso 

Studies involving muscle architecture should consider regional zzso and effect size and determine sample size zzso
