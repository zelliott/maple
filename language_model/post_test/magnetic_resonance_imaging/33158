To test for potential changes in zzso cognitive processes related to the exposure to a high zzso magnetic zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers participated in two experimental sessions inside a 3 zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso During one session the magnetic field was zzso zzso The tasks consisted of six well-established zzso probing a variety of cognitive zzso zzso times zzso and zzso zzso were recorded for statistical zzso 

The overall performance was very similar in both zzso Strong zzso effects (all P zzso zzso were consistent with previously published zzso zzso comparisons of zzso effects between the two sessions zzso field on or zzso remained zzso for all zzso zzso all P zzso zzso zzso all P zzso zzso no corrections for multiple zzso 

The results did not indicate any apparent safety concerns with respect to cognitive performance in a zzso magnetic field of a typical zzso zzso In addition, comparisons of cognitive effects from testing situations with and without exposure to high zzso magnetic fields can be considered zzso
