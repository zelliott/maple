The ability to initiate and sustain trust is critical to health and zzso zzso to trust is in part determined by the reputation of the putative trustee, gained via direct interactions or indirectly through word of zzso Few studies have examined how the reputation of others is zzso in the brain during trust zzso Here we use an zzso functional zzso zzso design to examine what neural signals zzso to zzso manipulated reputations acquired in direct interactions during trust zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso would signal differential reputations during zzso zzso healthy adults underwent zzso scanning while completing an zzso Trust Game as zzso with three zzso trustee partners who had different tendencies to zzso zzso likelihood of rewarding the zzso which were learned over multiple exchanges with real-time zzso We show that the zzso (both left and right) signals reputation during trust decisions, such that zzso is more active to partners with two types of zzso reputations, either indifferent partners (who zzso 50% of the zzso or unfair partners (who zzso zzso of the time), than to those with zzso reputations (who zzso zzso of the zzso Further, individual differences in zzso activity related to biases in trusting behavior in the most uncertain situation, zzso when facing an indifferent zzso We also report on other areas that were activated by reputation at p zzso zzso whole brain zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso is involved in signaling and zzso reputations gained through experience into trust decisions, demonstrating a neural basis for this key social zzso
