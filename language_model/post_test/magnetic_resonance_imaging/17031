A known contributor to adults' superior memory performance compared to children is their differential reliance on an existing knowledge zzso Compared to those of adults, children's semantic networks are less accessible and less established, a difference that is also thought to contribute to children's relative resistance to zzso related false zzso Using the zzso zzso - the memory advantage of zzso we manipulated the zzso stimuli in the present experiment such that the use of the knowledge base at zzso was more - or less - accessible in both children and zzso While being zzso 15 children zzso zzso and 18 young adults saw printed zzso combinations and were asked to indicate whether each combination existed in zzso A subsequent recognition test was administered outside of the zzso zzso although overall memory was higher in the adult group compared to the children, both age groups showed the zzso effect to the same zzso A comparison of the neural zzso supporting the zzso effect between adults and children revealed that whereas adults recruited regions primarily associated with zzso processing zzso the left zzso and zzso and zzso zzso children recruited regions earlier in the processing stream zzso the right zzso zzso This evidence supports the hypothesis that early in development, episodic zzso depends more on zzso systems, whereas zzso frontal control and zzso structures become more prominent in the zzso process with zzso This zzso switch contributes to adults' superior memory performance but may render adults more vulnerable to committing zzso based zzso
