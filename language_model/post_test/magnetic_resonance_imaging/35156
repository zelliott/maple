Composite zzso zzso cartilage zzso zzso are effective zzso materials in zzso and zzso reconstruction following tumor zzso 

Between 1985 and 2005, we used zzso for the reconstruction of defects following zzso of zzso tumors with zzso extension (20 zzso zzso zzso tumors (2 zzso invasive zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso tumors (3 zzso and esophagus zzso with zzso invasion (1 zzso in total of 30 zzso
