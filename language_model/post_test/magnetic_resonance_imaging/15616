An accurate and reliable method for measuring fetal lung volumes would be helpful in predicting the outcome in cases with suspected impaired lung zzso Recent studies show that it is possible to obtain fetal lung volume zzso with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the agreement of lung volumes measured with zzso zzso and zzso in uncomplicated zzso 

This was a prospective study in which zzso and zzso zzso examinations were conducted on the same day to measure the fetal lung volumes of 10 women with uncomplicated zzso zzso correlation was used to evaluate the agreement between fetal lung volume zzso obtained by zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso plot was zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the right lung was zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the left lung was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso limits of agreement between the methods were for the right lung zzso to zzso and for the left lung zzso to zzso 

There is good agreement between lung volumes measured by zzso and those measured by zzso zzso
