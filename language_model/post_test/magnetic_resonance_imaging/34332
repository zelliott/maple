zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed for the zzso of zzso zzso tumors responsible for zzso zzso However, in most cases reported, the tumors were also visible using conventional zzso zzso the usefulness of zzso in zzso truly zzso zzso zzso tumors remains zzso We report the results of zzso in 12 patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and in whom the source of zzso was zzso at presentation despite carefully performed conventional zzso The diagnosis of zzso was made by identification of an zzso tumor during follow-up in 5 patients or given a zzso zzso ratio of zzso or less during zzso zzso sampling combined with zzso injection and a negative zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso was performed 19 times in the 12 patients during initial zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso was performed in 7 of zzso Conventional imaging was performed within a month of zzso allowing comparison of the two approaches for the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, the response of plasma zzso after a single injection of 200 zzso zzso was studied in 6 zzso Five patients had negative zzso and conventional imaging zzso The source of zzso zzso remains zzso despite zzso months of follow-up in four of these, whereas a zzso zzso zzso zzso with liver zzso was found at zzso in one patient, 14 months after zzso zzso was positive in 4 of 12 zzso It was zzso in 1 patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso months after zzso zzso identified liver zzso that was also visible using zzso in one patient, but the primary tumor remains zzso zzso identified a zzso pancreatic tumor that became zzso using zzso zzso zzso scanning 9 months later, in 1 zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso of 10 zzso previously ignored by zzso in another patient, whereas no tumor was zzso within the zzso zzso zzso had little influence on therapeutic options in these 2 patients, in whom no final diagnosis could be zzso zzso of zzso during the follow-up of patients with previously negative zzso was zzso Conventional imaging was positive in 6 of 12 zzso In the 2 patients with pancreatic tumor and isolated zzso zzso zzso conventional imaging studies were interpreted as positive only after the results of zzso One patient had liver zzso that was also visible using zzso zzso CT scanning zzso zzso zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in diameter in 3 patients after zzso months of zzso whereas zzso was zzso There was no evident relationship between the zzso status zzso or zzso and the results of zzso The in zzso response of plasma cortisol to zzso correlated to the results of zzso in 4 of 6 zzso In conclusion, both imaging procedures had a low diagnostic yield in this zzso However, the sensitivity of zzso for the detection of zzso zzso was lower than that of zzso CT zzso We therefore advocate the use of conventional imaging, including zzso CT scanning of the chest, analyzed by experienced zzso as the zzso investigation in patients with zzso zzso zzso should not be repeated during the follow-up in patients with a previously negative zzso
