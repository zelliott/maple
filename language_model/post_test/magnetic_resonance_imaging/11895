Because zzso are zzso tumors, the Mac zzso response criteria, usually used for solid and zzso tumors, seem not to be zzso To precise more relevant zzso criteria, the zzso response of zzso to zzso chemotherapy was evaluated on zzso zzso sequences zzso 

25 patients with zzso grade A or B were zzso zzso They were treated with up to six cycles of zzso standard zzso zzso size was calculated before and at the end of the treatment, on zzso zzso by two zzso zzso reconstruction zzso 1) and zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso were defined according to new criteria on zzso zzso 

According to these criteria and with the method 1, 7 of 25 patients zzso had a partial response to the zzso 14 patients zzso had stabilized disease, and 4 patients zzso had progressive zzso With the method 2, 6 had partial response zzso 18 had stabilized disease zzso and 1 had progressive zzso 

Response rate to zzso chemotherapy in this study was lower than response observed in the zzso Because of the zzso feature of zzso we think that the zzso response of these tumors should be evaluated on zzso zzso The two methods of tumor size zzso used in this study were almost zzso Then, the zzso zzso area zzso more practical, could be zzso
