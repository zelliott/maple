Motion of an object is thought to be perceived independently of the zzso surface zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso observations have suggested that motion of zzso called zzso zzso may be processed by a separate system from zzso or zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso responses during passive viewing, zzso zzso and zzso motion after-effects zzso of these stimuli were measured in seven zzso visual areas (labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso area zzso zzso In all visual areas, responses were zzso similar to motion of zzso and zzso zzso These results differ from a prior investigation, because here the zzso responses were zzso Directing attention towards and away from the motion zzso equivalent response zzso for the two zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in perception of the two stimuli were observed and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes, but did not reveal the processing zzso In fact, no visual area was found to respond selectively to the motion of zzso zzso suggesting that motion perception arises from a unified motion detection zzso
