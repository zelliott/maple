In the zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso era, the need for zzso to perform zzso zzso accurately has been zzso We zzso compared zzso coordinates for zzso zzso with the final zzso coordinates that were determined by zzso and zzso recording in 74 zzso performed from 1984 to zzso The median three-dimensional distance between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The techniques correlated least along the Y axis zzso zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso zzso along the X axis was most consistent zzso zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso Since 1990, the zzso coordinates have been generated by a zzso zzso imaging technique zzso A comparison of zzso performed with and without the zzso revealed a significant improvement in the correlation of zzso and zzso coordinates when the zzso was zzso The greatest improvement was noted along the Y axis where the median absolute difference was reduced from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The result was a statistically significant reduction in the median three-dimensional distance from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The authors conclude that zzso can be safely and effectively performed without zzso when the zzso is employed and supported by zzso zzso
