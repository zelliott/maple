Using spin zzso xenon zzso we investigate the impact of the local molecular environment on zzso zzso zzso We label zzso guest atoms that are temporarily bound to zzso hosts using the zzso zzso By varying the length of the zzso pulse and utilizing an inverse zzso transform we can determine zzso times for the noble gas in different local zzso in this case zzso possessing different zzso We extend this technique to magnetic resonance imaging, mapping the spatial distribution of the different zzso Such zzso measured in zzso of 200 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso with time zzso of zzso zzso zzso s and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both environments simultaneously yielded a zzso zzso This approach may give further insights into zzso transfer dynamics of zzso bound zzso with applications extending into biomedical zzso
