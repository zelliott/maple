Severe zzso zzso zzso with preserved left zzso zzso function may be associated with a long zzso period and unpredictable course on medical zzso Since zzso wall stress is closely related to both zzso cardiac zzso and ultimately to zzso zzso a more accurate description of regional wall stress may improve our ability to appropriately manage these zzso The objective of this study was to define differences in instantaneous global and regional three-dimensional zzso maximum principal stress zzso between normal patients and patients with zzso both before and after zzso valve replacement zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and finite element analysis zzso 

zzso resonance imaging was performed on 20 normal volunteers and 14 patients with moderate to severe zzso with normal zzso function zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso element analysis was zzso to estimate global and regional zzso 

Both global zzso zzso zzso and regional zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso were significantly higher in the zzso zzso patients when compared with their zzso values and normal zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than the normal controls zzso zzso zzso 

zzso regional and global zzso zzso wall stress can be determined by zzso and finite element zzso zzso of zzso in patients with chronic zzso were elevated prior to zzso and zzso after zzso This method may have considerable potential as a zzso clinically zzso index of regional zzso geometry and function that may help with the serial evaluation of patients with zzso
