To determine the characteristics and the clinical significance of focal slow activity and its association with focal zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso 

We analyzed the zzso zzso of 141 patients who had zzso lobe zzso for intractable focal zzso and correlated the findings with zzso changes and zzso The zzso changes were zzso into zzso zzso zzso tumors, and zzso zzso 

zzso slow activity was found in zzso of the patients, and it was mainly zzso of delta frequency and irregular zzso None of its zzso including quantity and zzso to eye zzso was zzso zzso It was highly zzso with zzso zzso zzso without any difference across the three groups, but provided additional information in 19 zzso patients who had no zzso zzso The effect of sleep also was similar in all three groups and included transition of slow waves into zzso zzso slow activity to the side of the operation was significantly associated with favorable outcome only in the group with zzso pathology zzso zzso zzso regardless of the presence, zzso or topography of zzso 

Our findings suggest that in patients with zzso whose brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso is either normal or suggestive of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slow activity has a zzso value similar to that of zzso zzso Its association with a favorable outcome in patients with zzso pathology also suggests that candidates with zzso zzso delta and normal zzso should not be barred from further zzso zzso
