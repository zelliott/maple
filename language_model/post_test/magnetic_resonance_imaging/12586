The zzso Model draws on the framework of zzso zzso to bring together zzso and behavioral concepts of emotion, thinking and feeling and their zzso The key organizing principle is the drive to zzso danger and maximize zzso that determines what is significant to us at each point in zzso zzso of zzso zzso reflect the tendency to perceive danger rather than reward related information, and this bias influences emotion, thinking and feeling zzso Here, we examined a self-report measure of zzso zzso in relation to its impact on brain and body zzso of emotion zzso The contributions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and early life stress to both zzso bias and these zzso were also zzso Data were zzso in collaboration with the Brain Resource International Database zzso which provides standardized data across these zzso of zzso From an initial sample of zzso nonclinical subjects from the zzso subjects scoring one standard zzso below zzso and above zzso the mean on the measure of zzso bias were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups for analysis, zzso These subjects had been zzso for zzso Short zzso versus zzso zzso status, and completed the early life stress scale, and recording of startle responses and heart rate for conscious and zzso fear zzso A matched subset zzso of zzso subjects completed functional zzso with the same facial emotion zzso The zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso group was distinguished by both zzso and brain function zzso higher startle zzso higher heart rate for conscious and zzso fear conditions, and heightened zzso in neural zzso for both fear zzso zzso of heightened zzso included zzso and bilateral amygdala, anterior zzso and zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso for conscious fear, and zzso and zzso amygdala, anterior zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso Short zzso zzso zzso zzso a similar pattern of zzso and neural zzso For those with the zzso Short zzso the addition of early life stress contributed to enhanced zzso bias, and to further effects on heart rate and neural zzso for zzso fear in zzso These findings suggest that traits of zzso bias impact zzso zzso zzso of fear zzso Both genetic variation and life zzso contribute to the impact of zzso zzso Given that zzso bias is a feature of conditions such as depression and associated biological zzso the findings have implications for translation into clinical decision zzso
