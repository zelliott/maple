To evaluate a new zzso zzso particles of iron oxide zzso compound, zzso as a marker of zzso activity in zzso plaques and to compare it to zzso 

Ten mature zzso zzso zzso female Watanabe rabbits served as the animal model for zzso four zzso female New Zealand White zzso rabbits were the control zzso Five zzso and two zzso received a single intravenous injection zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso and were subjected to daily MR examinations on a zzso whole body scanner for the next five zzso Development of signal intensity changes and zzso effects was zzso zzso analysis was based on a zzso zzso test by using a P value at the zzso significance zzso On day 5, the rabbits were sacrificed and the zzso was referred to zzso distribution of iron particles in the vessel wall was zzso 

zzso was feasible in all zzso Three days after injection of zzso the highest zzso signal intensity zzso were observed in the zzso zzso the highest zzso were five days after injection in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso effects presented as homogeneous dark lines parallel to the zzso wall after zzso and spotted areas void of signal after zzso None of these findings were observed in the zzso control zzso 

zzso and zzso at a respective dose of 250 zzso appear well suited for zzso plaque detection with zzso in experimental zzso zzso warrants further analysis in zzso
