This study sought to compare the direct cost of medical care and clinical events during the first year after patients with intermediate risk acute chest pain were zzso to stress cardiac magnetic resonance zzso observation unit zzso testing versus zzso zzso 

In a recent study, zzso to zzso reduced median index hospitalization cost compared with the cost of zzso care in patients presenting to the emergency department with intermediate risk acute chest zzso 

Emergency department patients with intermediate risk chest pain were zzso to zzso zzso care, cardiac zzso stress zzso or zzso care zzso care per admitting zzso This analysis reports the direct cost of zzso care and clinical outcomes zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular zzso during the first year of follow-up subsequent to zzso zzso with health economics literature, provider cost was calculated from zzso relative value units using the Medicare conversion zzso facility charges were converted to cost using zzso zzso zzso Linear models were used to compare cost zzso among study zzso 

We included 109 zzso subjects in this analysis zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso The median age was 56 years; baseline characteristics were similar in both zzso At 1 year, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso care participants experienced a major cardiac event zzso zzso zzso with 1 patient in each group experiencing a cardiac event after zzso zzso zzso costs were significantly lower for participants zzso to zzso than for participants receiving zzso care zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso including the index visit zzso zzso zzso and $29 zzso $152 following discharge zzso zzso zzso During the year following zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso care participants experienced a major cardiac event zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso strategy reduces zzso costs of medical care during the index visit and over the first year subsequent to zzso without an observed increase in major cardiac zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso Use in Emergency Department zzso Patients With zzso zzso zzso
