Recent studies have shown that selective zzso but not zzso zzso zzso occurs from clinical onset to conversion to clinically zzso zzso Our aim was to investigate the difference in the extent of zzso and cortical zzso in a large sample of patients with zzso and early zzso and to explore the relationship between zzso and cortical zzso and other MR imaging and clinical zzso 

Two hundred twelve patients with zzso recruited at the first clinical event zzso age, zzso years; median zzso zzso median disease zzso 3 zzso and 177 patients with early zzso zzso age, zzso years; median zzso zzso median disease zzso 47 zzso were zzso on a zzso scanner by using a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data for zzso structures were obtained by using zzso FIRST, while zzso zzso white matter, zzso and lateral zzso volumes were estimated by using zzso zzso Comparisons between the groups were adjusted for age and zzso 

Patients with early zzso showed significantly lower zzso but not cortical volumes compared with patients with zzso The most apparent zzso differences were evident in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso with a median zzso zzso volume zzso zzso showed lower total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes and higher lateral zzso volume zzso zzso zzso than those with a median zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso volume showed the most consistent relationship with MR imaging outcomes zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso but not zzso zzso develops during the first 4 years of the zzso zzso zzso is relevant for disease progression from the earliest clinical zzso
