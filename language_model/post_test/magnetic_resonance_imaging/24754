Brain changes associated with the loss of a sensory zzso such as vision and audition have previously been zzso Here, we examined the effect of loss of zzso touch and zzso on cortical thickness and functional zzso We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging and zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging scans on a 60-year-old female who at age 31 suffered a selective loss of zzso zzso primary zzso and, therefore, relies mainly on her intact zzso senses zzso pain, itch, and zzso zzso and vision to negotiate her zzso The patient showed widespread cortical thinning compared with 12 zzso female zzso In contrast, her right anterior zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that her right anterior zzso had increased connectivity to bilateral zzso zzso A separate independent component analysis revealed the increased connectivity between the zzso and visual zzso in the zzso As the zzso is an important processing area for temperature and zzso tactile information, the increased zzso and zzso functional connectivity could be related to the patient's use of zzso zzso touch and temperature information in conjunction with visual information to navigate her zzso zzso thus, demonstrated plasticity in networks involving the insular zzso following zzso of zzso zzso zzso
