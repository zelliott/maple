The aim of this study was to construct a model of changes in zzso volume that occur throughout childhood from the age of 1 month to 15 years, which could be used for comparative studies of disease states affecting zzso zzso 

Using the procedure of zzso on magnetic resonance images obtained in 67 healthy children, zzso volume was measured and plotted against zzso During the first few months of life left zzso volume is on average 15 zzso in male and 13 zzso in female zzso these volumes increase to 26 zzso and 24 zzso respectively, by the time the child reaches 15 years of zzso During the first few months of life right zzso volume is on average 16 zzso in male and 13 zzso in female zzso these volumes increase to 27 zzso and 25 zzso respectively, by the time the child is 15 years zzso This represents an overall increase in zzso volume by a factor of zzso in boys and zzso in zzso By the time the child has reached 5 years of age, the zzso volume for both right and left sides has reached on average zzso of the volume seen at 15 years in both zzso The differences between the two sides are not statistically significant for either zzso The change in zzso volume that is associated with age in general displays a linear zzso Throughout childhood, zzso volumes are larger in boys than in girls, but share a similar growth zzso The difference between the two sexes tends toward statistical significance during the first 5 years of life zzso orbit p zzso zzso right orbit p zzso zzso 

During early childhood, zzso volume increases in a linear fashion, achieving a significant proportion of its final growth by the time the child is 5 years zzso
