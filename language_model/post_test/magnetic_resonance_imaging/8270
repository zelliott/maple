zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been proposed as therapy to lower plasma zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may, however, explain some of the responses zzso Patients with Nelson's syndrome have persistently high levels of zzso and may be a better model for examining new therapies to elevated zzso zzso 

The objective of the study was to assess whether high-dose zzso therapy reduces circulating zzso levels in Nelson's syndrome, a model of zzso zzso for which no established medical therapy zzso 

The design was an zzso zzso zzso study over 14 zzso 

The study was conducted at a university teaching zzso 

Six patients with Nelson's syndrome participated in the zzso 

Patients were assessed at zzso 0, 4, 8, and 12 zzso zzso 12 zzso was administered between 0 and 8 zzso zzso zzso was assessed in pathological zzso 

Plasma zzso was measured before zzso zzso and 120 zzso after morning dosing with zzso zzso 

One female withdrew prior to zzso therapy for personal zzso There was no evidence that zzso levels changed over time zzso zzso zzso The average zzso level was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for patients before the HC dose and 432 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso after the HC zzso zzso zzso was positive in three zzso tumors zzso 

zzso 12 zzso did not change circulating zzso over time, despite zzso zzso expression in the tumor zzso However, this does not zzso the possibility that other patients may respond or that higher doses of zzso or more potent zzso might prove useful zzso
