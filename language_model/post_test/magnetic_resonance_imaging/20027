To zzso evaluate the safety and effectiveness of zzso alcohol zzso zzso in patients undergoing zzso artery zzso zzso to treat zzso zzso tumors and to compare the long-term changes in zzso quality of life zzso after zzso with the changes seen after zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with zzso zzso were enrolled into this zzso study, with 77 patients undergoing zzso with zzso and 69 patients undergoing zzso zzso follow-up was completed for the zzso whereas zzso follow-up was completed for the zzso zzso Outcomes were assessed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and based on adverse event zzso time to return to normal activity, and changes in tumor symptom scores, zzso scores, and zzso bleeding zzso For the zzso zzso changes in total zzso volume and dominant tumor size on magnetic resonance zzso imaging were zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso of patients experienced a reduction of zzso symptoms zzso zzso points from baseline zzso at 6 months, with zzso of patients in the zzso group experiencing similar zzso Median zzso questionnaire scores at 6 months were found to be significantly higher in patients treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso with sustained improvement seen at 12 and 24 zzso Both procedures resulted in significant reductions in zzso zzso bleeding scores, with sustained improvement in the zzso cohort at 12 and 24 zzso MR imaging at 6 months revealed significant zzso and tumor volume reductions after zzso zzso zzso zzso At least one adverse event occurred in zzso of patients in the zzso group, compared with zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso performed with zzso zzso was associated with greater sustained improvements in symptom severity and zzso zzso and with fewer complications compared with zzso zzso MR imaging data demonstrated significant reductions in zzso and tumor volumes, although the degree of tissue zzso after zzso was not assessed with contrast zzso MR zzso
