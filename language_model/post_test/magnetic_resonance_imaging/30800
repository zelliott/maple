There are few articles in the literature concerning anterior zzso in the surgical management of spinal tuberculosis in the zzso zzso So we report here 23 cases of active zzso spinal tuberculosis treated by zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso to verify the importance of early reconstruction of spinal stability and to evaluate the results of zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso in the surgical management of the zzso stage of zzso spinal zzso zzso patients, including two children (9 and 15 years old, zzso and 21 adults with zzso spinal tuberculosis were treated zzso zzso to zzso spinal segments were affected, and zzso showed evident collapse of the zzso because of zzso destruction and zzso zzso Neurological deficits were found in 15 zzso Before surgery, patients received standard zzso chemotherapy for 2 to 3 zzso Under general zzso zzso the patients were placed in right recumbent positions, and a zzso lateral zzso or zzso approach was chosen according to the tuberculosis zzso zzso After exposure, the zzso zzso region, including the collapsed zzso and zzso zzso disc, was almost completely zzso in order to release the zzso spinal zzso Then, zzso zzso rib or zzso graft was harvested to complete zzso fusion, and an anterior zzso zzso system was used to reconstruct the stability of the affected zzso zzso chemotherapy was continued for at least 9 months, and the patients were supported with zzso zzso for 6 months after zzso All patients were followed up for an average of 2 zzso All 23 cases were healed without chronic zzso formation or any recurrence of tuberculosis during the follow-up zzso Spinal fusion occurred at a mean of zzso months after zzso Of all patients with neurological deficits, 14 patients showed obvious zzso only one patient with Frankel C zzso remained zzso but none of the patients got zzso During the follow-up period, a mean of 18 degrees of zzso correction was achieved after surgery in the adult zzso zzso progressive zzso because of this procedure fusion occurred zzso in a 9-year-old child after 2 1/2 years; another 15-year-old child did not demonstrate this zzso Except for the early loosening of one screw in two cases (which did not affect the reconstruction of spinal zzso no other complications associated with this procedure were found during zzso Early reconstruction of spinal stability plays an important role in the surgical management of spinal zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso in the surgical management of the zzso stage of spinal tuberculosis show more advantages in selected patients, but supplementary zzso fusion should be considered to prevent zzso zzso when this procedure is performed in zzso
