zzso studies have found that the zzso gene zzso zzso influences the risk for zzso but the underlying biological mechanisms of the association are still zzso Investigation of the effects of genetic zzso in this gene on brain function could provide more information about its role in the zzso 

The present study examined the effects of a functional zzso at zzso gene promoter zzso zzso on brain zzso of working memory performance in zzso Forty-eight schizophrenia patients and 46 control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the zzso zzso 

In the pooled sample, genetic zzso at this locus was associated with differential brain zzso in a bilateral frontal region including the zzso prefrontal zzso There was also a significant diagnosis zzso zzso interaction effect in an overlapping frontal zzso the zzso zzso did not affect zzso in the control subjects in this area, but the schizophrenia patients who were T carriers showed significantly higher zzso than the zzso zzso 

The findings support a role for zzso zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso dysfunction classically associated with zzso
