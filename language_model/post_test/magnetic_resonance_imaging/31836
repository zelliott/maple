The aim of this study was to assess whether the in zzso specific force and architectural characteristics of the lateral zzso zzso muscle of early zzso boys zzso zzso 11, age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stage 2) differed from those of adult men zzso zzso 12, age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso lower in the boys zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso compared with the adults zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso determined in zzso using zzso and zzso was zzso smaller in the boys zzso zzso zzso No difference was found in zzso angle, or in the ratio of zzso length zzso to muscle length between the boys and zzso Moment arm length was zzso smaller in the boys zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessed using surface zzso on the zzso was not different between the boys and men zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso force zzso to zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso in the boys than in the men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This finding could not be explained by differences in moment arm zzso muscle zzso or architecture, and other factors, such as zzso characteristics and/or changes in moment arm length with contraction, may be held zzso These observations warrant further zzso
