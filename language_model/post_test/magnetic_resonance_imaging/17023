To evaluate the cerebral zzso using blood zzso level dependent functional zzso during zzso inhalation with zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease and zzso mild cognitive zzso 

Thirty nine subjects were included to be investigated using blood zzso level dependent zzso functional zzso at zzso during a zzso zzso inhalation zzso with a high concentration zzso under zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso was measured using zzso zzso spin zzso Image analyses were conducted using zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and corrected for partial volume zzso 

Among selected participants, 12 subjects were excluded because of incomplete zzso leaving for analysis 27 subjects without significant zzso diagnosed for Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and matched controls zzso No adverse reaction related to the zzso challenge was zzso zzso inhalation induced a zzso signal increase, zzso in the gray zzso In patients, signal changes corrected for gray matter partial volume were decreased zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease, zzso in patients with mild cognitive zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were diffuse but seemed zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease was not significantly different from patients with mild cognitive impairment and zzso Among clinical and biological zzso no effect of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso values were correlated with cognitive performances and zzso zzso Among age and zzso zzso mean zzso was the best predictor of the zzso status zzso 

This zzso functional zzso study on zzso challenge shows impaired cerebral zzso in patients with Alzheimer's disease and zzso mild cognitive impairment at the individual zzso These preliminary findings using a new zzso approach may help to better characterize patients with cognitive disorders in clinical practice and further investigate zzso zzso
