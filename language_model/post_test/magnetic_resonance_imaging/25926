zzso resonance imaging is an extremely sensitive technique for evaluation of bone zzso changes at an early stage of avascular necrosis zzso of the zzso We therefore examined 11 painful hips whose clinical symptoms led us to suspect idiopathic zzso The zzso of all of these either were normal or demonstrated a minimal decrease in zzso zzso resonance demonstrated diffuse signal loss of the bone zzso at short zzso images of the zzso head in all hips, with various extensions in the head, neck, and zzso zzso These regions turned zzso to zzso on long zzso images compatible with bone zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities characteristic for AVN were not seen in any of the zzso zzso studies performed in six cases were zzso All patients underwent core zzso zzso zzso bone zzso pressure measurement and zzso zzso were positive in five cases when zzso zzso available in eight cases confirmed the presence of zzso Furthermore, the bone changes corresponded to those of early zzso zzso examinations after core zzso with MR showed normal signal intensity in all zzso zzso resonance represents a viable diagnostic tool for zzso and can monitor the therapeutic success of core zzso Whether zzso of the zzso head constitutes a distinct transient syndrome or represents an early form of AVN is controversial at zzso Our findings support those who believe that zzso may represent an initial stage of idiopathic zzso
