The present study examined the relationship between multiple blood pressure zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso in a sample of 39 older adults with cardiovascular disease zzso zzso zzso was measured using an automated monitor every 10 zzso for 2 zzso zzso were zzso on zzso images and separate zzso were generated for zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso zzso zzso was related to zzso and total zzso A function of zzso zzso zzso and average zzso pressure showed the strongest zzso including significant correlation to zzso zzso and total zzso No zzso index was related to zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses showed only the function of zzso zzso zzso and average zzso pressure predicted total zzso whereas as age, zzso conditions and zzso factors did zzso These findings demonstrate zzso zzso is an important contributor to zzso in older adults with zzso and suggests it may have differential relationships to zzso in different brain zzso Additional studies are needed to examine the role of zzso systems in the development of zzso particularly those using zzso measures of zzso
