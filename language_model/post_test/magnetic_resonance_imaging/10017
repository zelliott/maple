To characterize the clinical value of an zzso task zzso the zzso in controls and patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso 

A fearful face zzso paradigm using video sequences was developed and investigated in 17 patients with zzso (12 had zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso and 17 healthy control zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso 12 of the control zzso In addition, zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso Walking Task within the same session in all patients and in nine of the control zzso 

A fearful face paradigm led to significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso was bilateral in control subjects and clearly zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found in three zzso zzso A combination of results from both zzso zzso improved the zzso of the side of seizure onset in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso evoked by an animated fearful face paradigm is strong, zzso and specific in individual zzso The combination of the fearful face paradigm and zzso zzso Walking Task provides a more reliable zzso mapping of zzso zzso lobe zzso
