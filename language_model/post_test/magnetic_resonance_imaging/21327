The lateral frontal zzso zzso is thought to represent contextual and zzso information that allows zzso behavior according to zzso Recent progress has suggested that the representations of the zzso vary along its zzso axis with more abstract, higher level representations associated with zzso areas of the zzso and more concrete, lower level representations associated with zzso areas of the zzso Here, we investigated this zzso zzso responded to stimuli based upon a zzso series of contextual cues stored in working memory zzso while being scanned with zzso Higher level context cues zzso an abstract rule set while lower level context cues provided more concrete zzso Using zzso pattern analysis zzso we found varying forms of representation along the zzso axis of the zzso depending on the type of information stored in zzso zzso areas of frontal zzso in the lateral zzso zzso zzso represented the higher level context, but not more concrete information, and only when more concrete information was zzso zzso areas in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and inferior frontal junction zzso represented more concrete rules, but only when the forthcoming response could not be zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary motor zzso zzso represented contextual and response information when the forthcoming response could be anticipated on the basis of zzso zzso these data indicate that representations dedicated to higher levels of abstraction become less discriminating when more concrete information becomes zzso These patterns are consistent with zzso abstraction proposals of the zzso
