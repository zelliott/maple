Left zzso zzso zzso describes deep zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso is seen both as a primary zzso and as a secondary finding in other syndromes affecting the zzso such as zzso zzso The objective of this study is to define the prevalence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso population and characterize its relationship to global zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance zzso was used to assess zzso zzso and function in 151 zzso zzso with ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso primary zzso zzso and normal controls zzso The zzso to zzso zzso ratio was measured in each of the 16 standard zzso zzso zzso was defined as a zzso zzso zzso for any zzso 

zzso criteria were met by zzso zzso patients zzso of zzso 11 had an zzso zzso of zzso and 16 had an zzso zzso of zzso The median maximum zzso ratio was zzso for zzso with zzso zzso for zzso with zzso zzso for the normal subjects, and zzso for primary zzso zzso zzso data for 78 of the zzso boys demonstrated a mean rate of change in zzso ratio per year of zzso 

The high prevalence of zzso in zzso is associated with decreased zzso zzso function that develops over time and may represent muscular zzso versus zzso zzso
