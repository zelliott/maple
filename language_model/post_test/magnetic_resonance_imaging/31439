Based on previous observations that zzso encompassing the zzso were linked to zzso clinical outcome, we hypothesized that insular damage was directly associated with worsened zzso in zzso but potentially viable neighboring brain zzso 

Using acute zzso and zzso zzso within the first 12 hours of symptom onset and a follow-up zzso on day 5 or later, we calculated the percentage of mismatch lost zzso in 61 consecutive patients with zzso stroke within the middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso the percentage of mismatch tissue between zzso imaging and mean transit time maps that eventually underwent zzso We explored the relationship between zzso and insular location using a zzso zzso 

The median zzso was zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso in insular and zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlated with the volume of abnormal regions on zzso imaging zzso mean transit time zzso cerebral blood flow maps zzso and cerebral blood volume maps zzso A linear zzso model with zzso as response and with acute zzso volumes, age, and the site of vascular zzso as zzso showed that insular involvement was an independent predictor of zzso zzso The zzso model predicted an approximately zzso increase in zzso with insular zzso 

zzso of the zzso is associated with increased conversion of zzso but potentially viable neighboring zzso into zzso The zzso tissue outcome in insular zzso may not be a mere bystander effect from zzso middle cerebral artery zzso
