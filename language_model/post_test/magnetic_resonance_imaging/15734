zzso disorder is a symptom of schizophrenia expressed as zzso or incoherent zzso zzso of thought disorder zzso with decreased left superior zzso zzso zzso matter volume and cortical zzso in zzso zzso regions during the performance of language zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso mediates the association between thought disorder and left superior zzso lobe zzso matter zzso 12 patients with schizophrenia were assessed for thought zzso zzso images were acquired for each subject while they listened to English speech, along with a high resolution structural zzso zzso disorder was used as a zzso in the functional analysis to identify brain regions within which zzso correlated with symptom zzso zzso based zzso was used to calculate zzso matter volume of the zzso zzso A mediation model zzso using a zzso multiple zzso approach incorporating cortical volume, functional zzso and symptom zzso zzso disorder correlated with zzso in a single cluster within the left zzso middle zzso zzso during listening to zzso Grey matter volume within the zzso zzso correlated significantly with severity of thought disorder and zzso within the functional zzso zzso thought disorder on zzso matter volume and zzso response simultaneously led to a significant reduction in the correlation between zzso matter volume and thought zzso These results support the hypothesis that the association between decreased zzso matter volume in the left zzso zzso and severity of thought disorder is zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso lobe during language zzso
