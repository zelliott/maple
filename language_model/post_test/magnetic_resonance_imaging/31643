Recent evidence suggests that schizophrenia reflects a neurodegenerative zzso The studies have not compared brain change patterns in male and female patients with schizophrenia or examined the relation of these patterns to patient zzso defined by specific symptom zzso zzso Total Brain Volume zzso total zzso zzso total brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were measured in 66 normal controls (32 zzso 34 zzso and 85 patients with schizophrenia (21 zzso 64 zzso zzso patients were zzso as zzso and 19 as deficit zzso Patients had smaller zzso and larger zzso than normal zzso Patients also showed significant excessive brain volume loss after, but not before, zzso was achieved compared with normal zzso Although male patients had larger brain volume loss compared with male normal controls than female patients had compared with female normal controls, there were no significant gender zzso diagnosis zzso Male patients with the deficit syndrome, but not those without the deficit syndrome, had significantly larger zzso than normal zzso There were no other significant zzso zzso The present study suggests that brain volume loss in schizophrenia occurs after zzso and that male and female patients and deficit and zzso patients with schizophrenia do not demonstrate any differences in the time course of their brain volume zzso
