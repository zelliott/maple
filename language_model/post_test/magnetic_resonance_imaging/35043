The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso toxicity zzso and zzso distribution of a zzso toxin zzso targeting the zzso growth factor zzso in patients with zzso zzso brain tumors using the zzso infusion technique of zzso delivery zzso Twenty patients were enrolled and zzso for dose escalation by the presence of residual tumor from 25 to 100 zzso in a zzso infusion zzso In the last eight patients, zzso of zzso was performed to monitor distribution within the zzso The zzso was not reached in this zzso zzso escalation was stopped at 100 zzso due to inconsistent drug delivery as evidenced by imaging the zzso zzso Two zzso were seen, and both were zzso Median survival after zzso was 28 weeks zzso confidence zzso zzso Of 15 patients treated with residual disease, two zzso demonstrated zzso responses, including one patient with zzso zzso who had a nearly complete response and remains alive zzso weeks after zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that high zzso of the zzso could be delivered zzso zzso from the zzso zzso However, only 3 of 16 zzso zzso produced zzso zzso distribution, while the majority leaked zzso into the zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso of zzso was well tolerated and produced some durable zzso responses at doses zzso zzso zzso has significant potential for enhancing delivery of therapeutic zzso throughout the human zzso However, the potential efficacy of drugs delivered by this technique may be severely constrained by ineffective infusion in many zzso
