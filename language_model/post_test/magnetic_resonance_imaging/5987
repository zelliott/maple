The aim of this study was to develop a novel zzso magnetic zzso as an zzso contrast agent to target zzso as well as to evaluate the targeting ability of the zzso with zzso in zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso were zzso by a zzso decomposition and seed growth zzso An zzso zzso zzso reaction coupled zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into the core of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and size distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso electron zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso reduced the zzso of bare iron particles and enhanced their zzso ability in zzso The zzso of zzso into zzso zzso showed zzso magnetic zzso After in zzso zzso zzso injection, zzso revealed relative signal enhancement in the zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso blue zzso and zzso zzso We have successfully developed an zzso zzso that effectively targets zzso The zzso can be used as a contrast agent to aid in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
