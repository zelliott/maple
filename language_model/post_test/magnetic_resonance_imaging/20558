When humans perform movements and receive zzso visual feedback about their performance, the spatial qualities of the visual information alter zzso The spatial qualities of visual information can be altered via the manipulation of visual gain and changes in visual gain lead to changes in force zzso The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging during a zzso precision grip force task to examine how cortical and zzso brain activity can change with visual gain induced changes in force zzso Small increases in visual gain zzso zzso were associated with a substantial reduction in force error and a small increase in the spatial zzso of visual zzso These behavioral effects corresponded with an increase in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and in left primary motor zzso and left zzso zzso zzso Large increases in visual gain zzso zzso were associated with a small change in force error and a large change in the spatial zzso of visual zzso These behavioral effects corresponded with increased activity zzso in zzso and zzso zzso areas and right inferior zzso zzso Finally, activity in the left and right zzso VI of the zzso and left and right zzso did not change with increases in visual zzso Together, these findings demonstrate that the zzso system does not respond zzso to changes in the gain of visual zzso Instead, specific regions of the zzso system selectively change in activity related to large changes in force error and large changes in the spatial zzso of visual zzso
