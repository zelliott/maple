The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso on zzso pressure zzso and zzso mortality in dogs with structural zzso zzso 

zzso dogs had a single zzso zzso zzso during zzso for zzso mass biopsy or zzso 

Seven dogs with zzso zzso disease in the zzso angle zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was permanently zzso during the surgical approach to the zzso zzso to increase surgical exposure by allowing a zzso lateral zzso zzso to be combined with a zzso zzso In five dogs, zzso pressure was monitored during surgery using a zzso zzso pressure monitoring zzso 

zzso zzso varied among dogs, ranging from 7 to 21 zzso zzso zzso pressure, however, decreased in all dogs after zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No increase in zzso pressure occurred after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All dogs survived the surgical zzso 

zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso during zzso in dogs with zzso zzso zzso did not result in significant increases in zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso unilateral zzso zzso zzso during zzso can be used to increased surgical exposure to the zzso zzso of the brain without increased risk of increasing zzso
