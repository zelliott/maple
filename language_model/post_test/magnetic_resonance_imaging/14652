zzso disease zzso is a rare zzso infection with a zzso clinical zzso The central nervous system zzso is involved in 3 situations: zzso involvement in classic zzso zzso zzso in previously treated zzso and isolated zzso zzso We zzso analyzed clinical features, diagnostic zzso brain imaging, zzso fluid zzso study, treatment, and follow-up data in 18 patients with zzso and zzso zzso Ten men and 8 women were included with a median age at diagnosis of 47 years zzso zzso zzso The median follow-up duration was 6 years zzso zzso zzso As zzso in the 3 subgroups, 11 patients had classic zzso with zzso involvement, 4 had an isolated zzso infection, and 3 had a zzso zzso of previously treated zzso zzso involvement occurred during prolonged zzso zzso treatment in 1 patient with classic zzso The zzso symptoms were various and always zzso as zzso confusion or coma zzso related to zzso or status zzso zzso zzso cognitive impairment zzso including memory loss and attention defects or typical frontal lobe zzso zzso zzso abnormal movements zzso zzso movements, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upper motor zzso zzso or zzso symptoms zzso and zzso zzso in conjunction or not with progressive zzso zzso No specific pattern was correlated with any zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso revealed a unique focal zzso zzso mostly as a zzso brain zzso or zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso diffuse zzso zzso diffuse cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The spinal zzso was involved in 2 zzso zzso showed zzso zzso at diagnosis or during follow-up in 4 zzso Brain zzso was normal despite zzso symptoms in 3 zzso zzso zzso was normal in zzso of patients, whereas zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis was positive in zzso of cases with tested zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were identified in cerebral zzso of 4 zzso All patients were treated with zzso therapy for a mean duration of 2 years zzso zzso zzso with either oral zzso zzso zzso third-generation zzso or a combination of antibiotics that sometimes followed zzso treatment with zzso and zzso Eight patients also received zzso At the end of zzso the clinical outcome was favorable in 14 patients zzso with mild to moderate zzso in zzso Thirteen patients zzso had stopped treatment for an average time of 4 years zzso zzso zzso Four patients had clinical worsening despite zzso zzso 2 of those died following diffuse encephalitis zzso zzso 1) and lung infection zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso manifestations of zzso are diverse and may mimic almost any zzso zzso Brain involvement may occur during or after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is a major tool for diagnosis and may be positive in the absence of zzso zzso zzso syndrome may occur in the early months of zzso Late prognosis may be better than previously reported, as a consequence of earlier diagnosis and a better use of zzso therapy, including zzso and zzso zzso
