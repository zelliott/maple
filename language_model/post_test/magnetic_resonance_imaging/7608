zzso therapy limits zzso size and improves survival in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso itself may, in some cases, deteriorate zzso damage, causing the so-called zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at the time of zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso We designed a Phase zzso proof of concept clinical trial to evaluate the potential of zzso an zzso zzso as zzso therapy to primary zzso coronary intervention zzso for patients with zzso 

This is a zzso randomized, zzso zzso clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of zzso in patients with first anterior zzso who are undergoing zzso Immediately before zzso a zzso intravenous injection followed by infusion of zzso (up to 30 zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso were zzso salvage index zzso determined by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed 3-5 days after zzso and safety up to 7 zzso Secondary zzso were the degree of zzso injury based on cardiac zzso release and zzso score by zzso zzso cardiac functions determined by zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso and safety up to 3 months following zzso Furthermore, zzso studies were also performed where possible zzso days and 3 months after zzso 

The appropriateness of assessing safety and efficacy of zzso as zzso therapy to zzso for patients with zzso will be discussed in this study zzso
