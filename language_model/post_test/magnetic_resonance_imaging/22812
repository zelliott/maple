A frequent zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso gene zzso has been suggested to zzso zzso zzso plasticity and has been associated with individual variations in emotional zzso traits and episodic zzso 

The zzso formation was outlined in high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging zzso data in a sample of 36 healthy volunteers and compared between individuals as a function of the presence of the zzso zzso Both zzso volume corrected and zzso data were tested for effects of zzso sex, and zzso 

The zzso zzso was associated with an zzso reduction in the volume of the zzso zzso 

In spite of a relatively small sample size, the presence of the zzso zzso was found associated with a reduced volume of the zzso formation in healthy volunteers and may represent a vulnerability factor for the development of disease processes associated with the dysfunction of this brain zzso
