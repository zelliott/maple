zzso zzso zzso enables correction of zzso zzso zzso in the setting of hip zzso Patients with insufficient zzso coverage often have zzso pathology, but the degree of this pathology has been incompletely zzso We have used zzso as an adjunct to zzso to further delineate zzso pathology in patients with hip zzso with mechanical zzso 

We documented the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathology, zzso zzso neck cam zzso and zzso internal snapping or zzso zzso pathology among patients having zzso before zzso 

We reviewed all 16 patients (17 zzso mean age at surgery, 21 years; range, zzso zzso with hip zzso who underwent zzso and zzso hip zzso at our institutions from October 2010 to March zzso During this period, 80 patients underwent zzso making the zzso cohort zzso of the total zzso zzso for zzso hip zzso were mechanical symptoms consistent with zzso pathology identified on zzso We documented pathology involving the zzso zzso surface, zzso zzso cam zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso revealed significant zzso pathology in all zzso Fourteen hips had zzso zzso tears, and three hips had zzso findings of internal snapping zzso Eleven hips had zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso and 16 hips had zzso zzso zzso Two hips had zzso zzso tears, and 13 hips had zzso zzso 

zzso pathology at the time of zzso is zzso Future studies are needed to rigorously address the use of zzso intervention during zzso and the impact on clinical outcome compared to zzso zzso
