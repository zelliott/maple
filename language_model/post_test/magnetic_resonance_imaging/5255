zzso zzso death following peripheral nerve trauma is implicated in poor sensory zzso zzso research for zzso proven zzso drugs requires knowledge of the numbers and distribution of sensory zzso in the human upper limb and a novel zzso clinical measure of zzso zzso 

To compare optical zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso root zzso zzso in zzso zzso and objective clinical assessment of human zzso zzso sensory zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were harvested from 5 human zzso for zzso volume measurement and sensory zzso counts zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained from 14 healthy volunteers for zzso analysis of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso with a significant difference in zzso counts and zzso volume between zzso levels zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso volume correlated with zzso counts zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso artery zzso hindered zzso and 6 imaging, yet high-resolution zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso permitted unbiased volume zzso In zzso with zzso analysis, zzso confirmed a significant difference between zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sex differences zzso zzso zzso Slight zzso sided disparity in zzso counts zzso P zzso zzso was possibly related to hand dominance, but no significant volume disparity zzso 

zzso counts for the human zzso zzso are zzso These correlate with zzso zzso volumes and zzso with zzso zzso results in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a legitimate zzso proxy measure of sensory zzso for clinical zzso
