In the United States and Europe, zzso cancer is the second leading cause of zzso zzso It is well known that zzso zzso may originate from zzso zzso For the zzso of zzso cancer and other zzso changes such as zzso two zzso methods zzso zzso and zzso zzso in MR zzso were compared in our zzso MR zzso was carried out in 17 patients on a zzso T MR scanner using a 10 zzso zzso water solution zzso zzso as well as rotated zzso and zzso views were compared in order to examine the technical quality zzso of the zzso model and grade of confidence zzso in the pathological zzso zzso findings revealed 8 zzso zzso 10 patients with zzso 4 zzso disease, and 2 with redundant zzso zzso Based on a total of 248 zzso segments for both zzso methods, volume rendering were significantly superior to surface rendering for both, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Volume rendering and surface rendering were not dependent on individual colon segments zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso or on image rotation zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso It is also independent of the type of pathology zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso This indicates, that for the purpose of interpreting the technical quality and pathological findings, volume rendering is superior to surface rendering in MR zzso Volume rendering could be used as an zzso zzso zzso enabling MR zzso examinations to be completed sooner in cases where colon zzso is zzso and it would also provide an overview of potential mass zzso
