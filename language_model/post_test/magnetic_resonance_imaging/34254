The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to explore central auditory function may be compromised by the intense bursts of stray acoustic noise produced by the scanner whenever the magnetic resonance signal is read zzso We present results evaluating the use of one method to reduce the effect of the scanner zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this technique, single volumes of brain images are acquired at the end of stimulus and baseline zzso To zzso detection of the zzso images are taken near to the zzso and zzso of the zzso response during the experimental zzso Thus, the effective auditory stimulus for the zzso is not masked by the scanner zzso In experiment 1, the course of the zzso response to auditory stimulation was mapped during continuous task zzso The mean peak of the response was at zzso zzso after stimulus zzso with little further change until stimulus zzso In experiment 2, sparse imaging was used to acquire zzso zzso Despite the fewer samples with sparse imaging, this method successfully zzso broadly the same regions of zzso as conventional continuous zzso However, the mean percentage MR signal change within the region of interest was greater using sparse zzso zzso experiments that use continuous imaging methods may measure zzso that is a result of an interaction between the stimulus and task factors zzso attentive zzso induced by the intense background zzso We suggest that sparse imaging is advantageous in auditory experiments as it ensures that the obtained zzso depends on the stimulus zzso
