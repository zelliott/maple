zzso abnormalities are considered a zzso characteristic of zzso However, the pattern of such deficits as they progress over the illness remains poorly zzso The goal of this project was to assess the progression of cortical thinning in frontal and zzso cortical regions in zzso and determine whether relationships exist between them and zzso and clinical symptom zzso As part of a larger zzso zzso follow-up study, schizophrenia zzso and healthy participants zzso zzso for age, zzso and zzso use, were zzso Using zzso estimates of gray matter thickness were derived from primary anatomical zzso of the frontal and zzso zzso using zzso zzso These values were entered into zzso analysis of zzso models to determine group status and time zzso Change values in cortical regions were correlated with changes in zzso functioning and clinical zzso zzso revealed exaggerated cortical thinning of the middle zzso superior zzso and middle zzso zzso in schizophrenia zzso These thickness changes strongly influenced zzso zzso but were not related to shrinking surface zzso zzso and clinical symptom profiles were stable in the schizophrenia participants despite these zzso zzso zzso it appears that ongoing abnormalities in the cerebral zzso continue after initial onset of zzso particularly the lateral aspects of frontal and zzso regions, and do not relate to zzso or clinical measures over zzso Maintenance of zzso performance and clinical stability in the face of changing zzso structure suggests the involvement of alternative zzso zzso
