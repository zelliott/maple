A signal increase in zzso muscle on magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been described in several clinical and experimental zzso Here, we studied the time course of zzso time changes in zzso and subsequent zzso in a rat model and correlated the findings with zzso and quantitative zzso A zzso of the zzso relaxation time in muscles was present 48 h after zzso which was paralleled by spontaneous activity on zzso zzso zzso there was a marked enlargement of the zzso at that time point, indicating increased blood zzso The relaxation time changes peaked 3 weeks after beginning of nerve zzso identified by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso until 10 weeks after beginning of zzso which was associated with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso closely mirrors the zzso changes following zzso and zzso and may thus be used as adjunct to zzso The zzso basis for the MR relaxation time changes is predominantly the enlargement of the zzso zzso
