To zzso evaluate the depiction of brain fiber tracts at zzso versus zzso zzso zzso fiber zzso performed with parallel zzso 

Institutional review board approval was zzso and each subject provided written informed zzso zzso were 30 healthy volunteers (15 men, 15 zzso mean age, 28 years; age range, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso sequences with parallel imaging were zzso Four fiber tracts were zzso zzso tract zzso superior zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso compared zzso and zzso zzso in terms of fiber tract depiction by using five depiction scores zzso zzso and numbers of reconstructed tract fibers and in terms of lateral asymmetry in the zzso by using numbers of reconstructed zzso The zzso signed rank test was applied for statistical zzso 

Visual scores for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the right zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the right zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher at zzso zzso zzso zzso numbers of zzso zzso P zzso zzso left, P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso left, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso tract fibers were depicted at zzso zzso The asymmetry index for the zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Visual scores for the left zzso and the left zzso and numbers of zzso tract fibers were not significantly zzso 

zzso of most fiber tracts was improved at zzso zzso zzso compared with depiction at zzso zzso
