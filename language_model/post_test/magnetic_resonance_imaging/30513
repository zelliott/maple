In animal models, zzso zzso factor zzso appears to protect against cerebral zzso The authors examined whether the zzso zzso zzso which affects zzso distribution, was associated with greater volumes of zzso zzso as detected on magnetic resonance imaging in a cohort of depressed and zzso zzso 

zzso completed zzso zzso including clinical evaluation and a brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso and provided blood samples for zzso zzso 

The study was conducted at a zzso academic zzso 

Participants included 199 depressed and 113 zzso subjects aged 60 years or zzso 

zzso zzso volumes were measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso models examined the relationship between zzso and zzso volume while controlling for depression, presence of hypertension, age, and zzso 

After controlling for zzso zzso zzso carriers exhibited significantly greater white matter zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This effect was independent of a diagnosis of depression or report of zzso zzso was not significantly related to gray matter zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is associated with greater white matter zzso volumes in older zzso Further work is needed to determine how this may be associated with other clinically relevant findings in late-life zzso
