This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of a zzso zzso staging method in predicting surgical zzso in patients with pancreatic or zzso zzso 

Despite progress in imaging techniques, accurate staging and correct prediction of zzso remains one of the chief problems in the management of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso designed to separate zzso from zzso patients to save the latter an unnecessary zzso are becoming increasingly complex, expensive, zzso zzso and not without risks for the zzso 

Between August 1996 and February 1997, 58 consecutive patients referred for operation of a pancreatic or zzso tumor were examined clinically and by 5 staging zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) selective visceral zzso and 5) zzso zzso zzso The assessment of zzso by each procedure was verified by surgical exploration and zzso zzso 

The study comprised 40 male and 18 female patients with a median age of 63 zzso Thirty-five zzso were located in the pancreatic head zzso 11 in the body zzso and 1 in the tail of the zzso zzso there were 9 tumors of the zzso zzso and 2 of the zzso common duct zzso All five staging methods were completed in 36 zzso For reasons ranging from metallic implants to contrast medium zzso or because investigations already had been performed elsewhere, US was completed in 57 zzso zzso in 54 zzso CT in 49 zzso zzso in 48 zzso and zzso in 49 zzso of these 58 zzso Signs of zzso found were vascular involvement in 22 zzso zzso tumor spread in 16 zzso liver zzso in 10 zzso zzso zzso involvement in 6 zzso and zzso zzso in only 2 patients zzso These findings were collated with those of surgical exploration in 47 patients zzso zzso and zzso biopsy in 5 zzso such invasive zzso was deemed unnecessary and therefore unethical in 6 clearly zzso patients zzso In assessing the four main signs of zzso zzso tumor spread, liver zzso zzso zzso involvement, and vascular zzso the overall accuracy of zzso was zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso for US and zzso zzso zzso for zzso In assessing vascular invasion, the sensitivity, zzso and overall accuracy of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were 3 complications zzso after 24 zzso 5 in 17 zzso procedures, and none after 6 explorations zzso The hospital stay was 14 days after zzso 13 after zzso zzso and 6 after exploration zzso There was no operative or hospital mortality in these 58 zzso 

Although it is by no means zzso accurate, zzso is equal or even superior to all other staging zzso It probably will replace most of these, because it provides an zzso investigation avoiding zzso vascular zzso allergic zzso and zzso But because even zzso is not perfect, the final verdict on zzso of a tumor still will depend on surgical exploration in some zzso
