To compare zzso and clinical staging of invasive zzso cancer zzso and identify additional zzso features on zzso before zzso 

143 patients with a pathological diagnosis of transitional cell zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso of the abdomen and pelvis before radical zzso zzso size, site, degree of zzso presence of zzso and zzso were assessed and an appropriate zzso stage zzso Following zzso all patients received regular zzso zzso Date of first zzso and date of death were zzso 

The median follow-up was zzso years for zzso Those patients upstaged from zzso clinically to zzso on zzso had a significantly worse outcome zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis a number of zzso features were significantly associated with adverse zzso zzso size, zzso zzso extent, and presence of zzso (all P zzso zzso After adjustment for clinical T stage and zzso grade, all these zzso features and the zzso T stage were found to zzso additional zzso information in predicting early disease zzso and death zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso before zzso provides valuable additional zzso information compared to clinical zzso
