zzso memory is an important form of spatial memory, zzso different zzso that each process specific types of information within memory, zzso remembering objects, remembering positions and binding these features in zzso In the current study we investigated the neural zzso of binding zzso zzso or coordinate zzso position information with objects in zzso zzso an zzso memory battery was used, including different task conditions assessing zzso memory, zzso memory for position information per se, and binding object information with coordinate and zzso position zzso zzso stroke patients with focal brain zzso were examined and compared with 77 healthy matched zzso The zzso zzso method was used to define the area of zzso zzso indicate an important role of the left zzso zzso zzso in the binding of both zzso and coordinate positions with object zzso Additionally, the zzso seems important for zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso and coordinate zzso memory depend on similar cognitive and neural zzso
