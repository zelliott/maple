We present a new zzso sampling method for the accurate zzso of mutual information in zzso brain image rigid zzso Most existing density zzso used for mutual information zzso incorrectly assume that the intensity of each zzso is independent from its zzso Our method uses the zzso Fast zzso zzso zzso to reduce the sampled zzso zzso by sampling zzso that are less dependent on their neighborhood, and thus provide a more accurate zzso of the mutual information and a more accurate zzso The main advantages of our method over other zzso sampling schemes are that: zzso it provides more accurate zzso of the image statistics with fewer zzso zzso it is less sensitive to the zzso of anatomical structures shapes, zzso and sizes, zzso zzso it yields more accurate registration zzso zzso evaluation on 1000 synthetic registrations between zzso and zzso clinical zzso images and 20 real clinical registrations of brain CT images to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso images from the public zzso database show the effectiveness of our zzso Our method has the lowest mean registration errors recorded to date for zzso image registration in the zzso zzso for methods tested on more than five zzso These results indicate that our sampling scheme can be used to achieve more accurate zzso registration required for image guided therapy and zzso
