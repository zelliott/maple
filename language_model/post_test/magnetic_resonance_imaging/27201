zzso imaging approaches may contribute to the characterization of zzso zzso in major depression, especially in clinically zzso patient groups such as those with melancholic zzso We assessed brain zzso zzso both zzso and zzso in patients with melancholic depression using a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images were collected from a relatively aged sample of 70 zzso recruited major depressive disorder zzso with melancholic features and from a group of 40 healthy control zzso All patients were clinically followed for at least 2 years, and a subset of 30 depressive patients and 20 control subjects were zzso after a zzso zzso Imaging data were analyzed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients showed gray matter reductions in the left zzso and white matter increases in the upper zzso zzso Male patients showed gray matter decreases in the right thalamus, and zzso white matter reductions were specifically observed in older zzso Volume decreases in the left zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso predicted a slower recovery after treatment zzso In zzso assessment, white matter of the upper zzso zzso showed a different zzso evolution between zzso Additionally, bilateral gray matter reductions in the zzso were associated with the number of relapses during zzso 

zzso zzso were identified in regions potentially related to relevant aspects of zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated zzso interactions of baseline zzso with age as well as a significant association of clinical severity with focal changes occurring over zzso
