A previous zzso study on neural activities during the orientation singleton search showed that both efficient and inefficient searches shared a common neural network and the search efficiency was determined by a neural process executed in the zzso and zzso zzso The target zzso stage, however, remains to be zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso experiments were conducted, and zzso of equivalent current zzso were estimated with an zzso zzso zzso method to obtain differences between zzso and zzso conditions in each brain region for the whole time zzso The zzso moments around the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased at zzso around zzso zzso zzso around the zzso consisted of a prominent and a subsequent smaller but still obvious peak zzso 215 zzso the first peak showed no difference between conditions, while the second peak was significantly larger in the zzso zzso zzso around the zzso had a prominent peak zzso zzso and subsequent small activity zzso zzso whereas the target's presence or not had no influence on either zzso The activity of the right zzso zzso zzso was significantly larger than that for the left zzso at zzso around 196 zzso irrespective of the target's presence or zzso The activity of the other brain regions such as the zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and central zzso showed no difference between target zzso The results demonstrate that neural activities of multiple regions had different zzso zzso and the later activity around the zzso was related to the target segregation from its surroundings during the orientation contrast zzso
