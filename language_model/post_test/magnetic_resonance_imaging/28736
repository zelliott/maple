Based on observations from MR imaging studies, the natural history of the zzso zzso appears to be progression from an acute enhancing zzso corresponding to the early inflammatory stage, with evolution to a chronic zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso zzso of the prior zzso In addition to zzso of these relatively zzso zzso we find in zzso evaluations that patients with only mild to modest disability are already developing significant cerebral zzso zzso particularly that resulting from volume loss around the third zzso appears to be predicted by the presence of prior temporally and zzso distant enhancing zzso One can speculate that the initial zzso zzso events in the brain, place into motion, at an early stage, the processes that ultimately lead to cerebral zzso and these processes may include early zzso zzso
