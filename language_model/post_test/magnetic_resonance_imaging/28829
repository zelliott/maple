To assess zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging for mapping of zzso zzso defects that have been validated at surgery in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging, and surgical findings in 22 women with zzso zzso who underwent zzso repair were zzso zzso US and MR imaging had been performed before zzso The findings were evaluated separately and validated with surgical zzso 

zzso MR imaging findings showed better agreement with surgical results than did zzso US findings for diagnosis of zzso of the external zzso zzso value, zzso vs zzso and of the internal zzso zzso value, zzso vs zzso zzso US could not accurately demonstrate thinning of the external zzso MR imaging results correlated moderately with US results zzso zzso zzso If zzso MR images alone had been considered, the correct surgical decision would have been made in 21 zzso zzso if zzso US images alone had been considered, the correct decision would have been made in 17 zzso zzso 

MR imaging is more accurate than US for demonstration of zzso zzso MR imaging provides higher spatial resolution and better inherent image contrast for zzso zzso zzso MR imaging allows more precise description of the extent and structure of complex zzso and is superior for help in decisions about optimal zzso
