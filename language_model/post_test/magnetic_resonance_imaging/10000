zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging has dramatically emerged over the last zzso Technical improvements have enabled reliable zzso of the zzso and zzso of the coronary artery tree for exclusion of significant coronary artery zzso However, current technical developments focus also on direct zzso of the diseased coronary vessel wall and imaging of coronary plaque because plaques without zzso are typically more vulnerable with higher risk of plaque zzso zzso zzso with subsequent zzso and vessel zzso is the main cause of zzso zzso Very recently, the first success of molecular imaging in the coronary arteries has been demonstrated using a zzso contrast agent for selective zzso of coronary zzso This demonstrates in general the high potential of molecular MR imaging in the field of coronary artery zzso In this review, we will address recent technical advances in coronary MR imaging, including zzso of the zzso and the vessel wall and molecular imaging of coronary zzso First results of these new approaches will be zzso
