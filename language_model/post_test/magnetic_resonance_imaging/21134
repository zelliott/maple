zzso available automated MR image analysis techniques are being increasingly used to investigate zzso abnormalities in patients with neurological zzso It is important to assess the specificity and zzso of automated zzso of structure volumes with respect to reliable manual methods that rely on human anatomical zzso The zzso is widely investigated in many neurological and zzso disorders using zzso but zzso volumes are notoriously difficult to zzso given the poor zzso contrast at the zzso zzso matter zzso In the present study we investigated the reliability of automatically determined zzso volume zzso obtained using zzso software with respect to a manual zzso technique on zzso zzso MR images obtained from a 3 T MR zzso Further to demonstrating impressive consistency between zzso and zzso volume estimates of the zzso in healthy subjects and neurological patients, we demonstrate that the extent of zzso between zzso and zzso is equal to the zzso between two human zzso zzso zzso volume using zzso zzso Using patients with juvenile zzso zzso as a model for zzso zzso we also show that both automated and manual methods provide very similar ratios of zzso volume loss in zzso This work promotes the use of zzso for reliable zzso of global volume in healthy and diseased zzso
