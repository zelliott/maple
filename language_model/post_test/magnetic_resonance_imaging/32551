zzso zzso type 1 zzso is a common inherited zzso zzso In addition to zzso symptoms, many zzso patients show central nervous system zzso This study evaluated whether zzso patients display diffusion zzso zzso abnormalities associated with regional cortical zzso and clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance images of the brain were obtained in 11 zzso patients and 13 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso values were calculated in corpus zzso zzso with zzso imaging zzso along with zzso changes, and correlations with clinical features were zzso zzso between zzso patients and healthy subjects were analyzed zzso zzso lower zzso and higher MD values were found in the zzso zzso body, anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients than in control subjects zzso zzso lower zzso in the zzso was at a trend zzso These corpus zzso zzso were the areas connected to cortical areas where significantly lower volumes were found in zzso zzso No significant decrease in volumes was noted in the zzso cortex, where connecting fibers pass through the zzso in which zzso abnormalities were not detected in zzso zzso zzso negative correlations to volumes of frontal areas were noted, particularly bilateral motor areas, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in corpus zzso may reflect zzso changes in the connecting cortical areas of zzso zzso
