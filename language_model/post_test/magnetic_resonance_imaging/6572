The usefulness of zzso images in addition to zzso images for detection of additional zzso injuries or bone zzso has been zzso Some authors believe zzso tears are rarely seen only in the zzso zzso We performed a retrospective review of zzso and zzso MR images of the knee to determine whether zzso imaging resulted in the detection of any additional zzso tears or bone zzso when compared with zzso zzso of the knee zzso 

Two musculoskeletal zzso zzso reviewed 200 consecutive sets of MR images of the knee by zzso Both observers recorded their retrospective findings on zzso zzso density images, zzso and zzso zzso images, and zzso zzso zzso zzso recorded were those of zzso tears, bone zzso zzso and bone zzso 

On these 200 consecutive sets of MR images of the knee, 114 zzso tears were zzso zzso zzso tears were shown on zzso zzso density images zzso One hundred zzso zzso tears were seen on zzso zzso density and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Use of zzso images resulted in the confident detection of 21 additional zzso tears not well seen on zzso zzso density images zzso Twelve of the 21 additional zzso tears were seen on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nine of the 21 additional zzso tears were seen only on zzso zzso zzso Most of these additional zzso tears were in the body of the zzso These 21 additional zzso tears were confirmed zzso Eight zzso zzso were well characterized only on zzso zzso zzso Five were zzso zzso one was an zzso zzso and two were zzso 

zzso MR images of the knee allowed better detection and characterization of some zzso tears than zzso images zzso zzso zzso tears, zzso tears, and horizontal tears in the body of the zzso may be difficult to characterize in the zzso plane zzso Use of zzso zzso images, rather than zzso zzso or zzso zzso density images alone, allows accurate characterization of some additional zzso zzso The addition of a zzso sequence in the zzso plane adds only 1 zzso 30 zzso to the scanning zzso
