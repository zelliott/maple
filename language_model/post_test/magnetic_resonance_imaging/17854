zzso explore the visual world through the use of zzso eye zzso zzso activity in the zzso a structure known to be essential for memory, is modulated by this zzso activity, but the relationship between visual exploration through zzso and memory formation is not well zzso Here, we identify a link between zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso and zzso activity in monkeys performing a recognition memory zzso As monkeys freely explored novel images, zzso produced a zzso phase zzso and the reliability of this phase reset was zzso of subsequent zzso In addition, enhanced zzso power before stimulus onset predicted stronger stimulus zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso zzso zzso act in concert with active exploration in the zzso and possibly serve to establish the optimal conditions for stimulus zzso
