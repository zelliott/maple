The aim of this study was to analyze a zzso of patients harboring zzso angle zzso originating from the zzso zzso bone in regard to clinical zzso surgical zzso zzso and long-term functional zzso zzso 

Data in a series of 51 patients with zzso of the zzso zzso bone who had undergone zzso treatment at the zzso institution between 1989 and 2002 were zzso zzso The patient population consisted of 46 women and five men with a mean age of 53 years zzso zzso zzso The main symptom on first admission was impaired hearing in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso of physical examination and zzso testing revealed zzso in zzso of patients, zzso zzso in zzso and impairment of the fifth zzso nerve in zzso All patients underwent surgical treatment via a lateral zzso zzso zzso the tumor was found to be attached to the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso in zzso and centered on the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso extension into the internal acoustic zzso was present in seven zzso zzso zzso was zzso as Grade I in 14 patients, Grade II in 29, Grade III in six, and Grade IV in two patients, according to the Simpson zzso zzso The site of displacement of the zzso nerves was predictable in up to zzso of patients, depending on the zzso origin of the tumor as depicted on zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso a new and permanent facial zzso was observed in five patients zzso In 38 patients in whom both zzso and zzso zzso data were available, hearing function deteriorated after surgery in zzso and improved in zzso Clinical and MR imaging zzso data from a mean period of zzso years zzso 13 zzso zzso were available in all zzso zzso patients zzso resumed normal daily zzso zzso recurrence was observed in two patients zzso and both underwent a second zzso 

zzso detailed analysis of MR imaging data gives the surgeon a clue about the dislocation of critical zzso structures, particularly the zzso zzso Nonetheless, the exact relationship of the zzso nerves to the tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso can only be fully appreciated during zzso
