zzso stimulation of the zzso nucleus zzso is an accepted treatment for advanced Parkinson disease zzso Although procedural details are well established, targeting zzso remains problematic because of its variable location and relatively small size zzso zzso A combination of zzso imaging with a zzso frame, zzso zzso and zzso zzso is currently considered the most reliable approach for zzso zzso CT imaging is dependent on zzso zzso because the zzso is not zzso The zzso is also difficult to zzso directly by using MR imaging at zzso zzso 

We performed zzso zzso MR imaging at zzso to zzso the zzso in 13 patients undergoing zzso stimulation for zzso With the patient positioned within a standard zzso type G zzso frame zzso rapidly acquired scout images are used to prescribe volumes of zzso high-resolution zzso fast zzso images in the zzso zzso and zzso planes through the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is identified in all 3 planes by zzso in a zzso zzso These coordinates are used for surgical zzso 

At zzso the zzso was zzso as a small, zzso zzso structure in 3 planes located immediately lateral to the anterior edge of the red nucleus, zzso to the internal zzso about 5 zzso inferior, 1-2 zzso zzso and 9-12 zzso lateral to the zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings confirmed these coordinates in all cases from the first zzso pass, thereby eliminating prolonged zzso zzso zzso searching and tissue disruption that may occur from multiple zzso 

zzso MR imaging appears to be an excellent tool for reliable and accurate direct zzso of the human zzso necessary for precise surgical zzso
