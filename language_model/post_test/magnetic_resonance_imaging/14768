Alcohol use in excessive quantities has deleterious effects on brain structure and behavior in adults and during periods of rapid zzso such as zzso Whether similar outcomes characterize other zzso zzso such as adolescence, and in the context of less extensive use is zzso Recent zzso studies suggest that binge drinking as well as alcohol use disorders in adolescence are associated with disruptions in white matter zzso and gray matter zzso 

The current study followed typically developing adolescents from a baseline assessment, where no experience with alcohol was present, through two years, after which some individuals zzso into regular zzso 

Participants zzso zzso zzso completed zzso scans and behavioral zzso 

Alcohol initiators zzso zzso zzso mean baseline age zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso 25; mean baseline age zzso zzso zzso zzso showed altered patterns of zzso They showed zzso decreases in cortical thickness in the right middle frontal zzso from baseline to follow-up as well as blunted development of white matter in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed a relative decrease over time in fractional zzso in the left zzso region as well as in the right inferior frontal zzso zzso Alcohol initiators did not differ from zzso at the baseline zzso the groups were largely similar in other zzso zzso 

zzso alcohol use during zzso adolescence is associated with zzso in zzso across several brain tissue zzso zzso for continued development and behavior are zzso
