zzso diffuse intrinsic zzso zzso are aggressive zzso tumors that fail to respond to zzso We zzso that the protective features of the zzso may hinder zzso agents from entering zzso tissue compared with cortical brain zzso To test this hypothesis, we developed a unique nonhuman zzso model using zzso a continuous in zzso zzso sampling technique, to compare drug exposure zzso in zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso and plasma after intravenous administration of zzso zzso The surgical coordinates and approach for zzso zzso placement were determined in 5 adult male zzso monkeys zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso were implanted zzso in the brain, zzso was performed to measure relative recovery, and a zzso intravenous infusion of zzso was zzso Continuous zzso samples were collected from the zzso and zzso over 4 h with concurrent serial plasma and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso placement was obtained via zzso in 3 zzso and by gross pathology in all 5 zzso The zzso coordinates and surgical zzso resulted in accurate zzso probe placement in the zzso and zzso in 4 of the 5 zzso zzso examination from these 4 animals revealed negligible tissue damage to the zzso and cortical tissue from zzso One zzso was maintained for 8 zzso and had no deficits attributed to the zzso This animal model allows for the determination of differences in zzso penetration of zzso agents in the zzso cortex, and zzso after systemic drug zzso
