Most prostate zzso examinations are performed with an zzso zzso inflated with air, leading to an zzso interface that zzso magnetic zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of the zzso with a zzso zzso suspension is described and compared to inflation with air or liquid zzso zzso The zzso field in the prostate zzso was mapped for five healthy volunteers when the zzso zzso was inflated with each of the three zzso A marked decrease in the zzso zzso field zzso and a significant improvement in field zzso were evident in the presence of a zzso suspension and zzso relative to zzso MRS data acquired from the prostate zzso in the presence of air, zzso and a zzso suspension in the zzso zzso showed similar trends, demonstrating improvement in zzso and spectral resolution when the zzso suspension or the zzso were inflating the zzso zzso On this basis we conclude that a zzso suspension provides an available, cheap, and safe alternative to zzso and we suggest that inflating the zzso zzso with a zzso suspension should be considered for prostate MR studies, especially at high field strengths (such as zzso
