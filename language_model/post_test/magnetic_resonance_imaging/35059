zzso optical imaging zzso is a zzso optical technique that employs zzso zzso light to zzso characterize the optical properties of thick zzso Although zzso methods were first applied to breast zzso (also called zzso nearly 80 years ago, quantitative zzso methods employing zzso or zzso zzso migration technologies have only recently been used for breast imaging zzso since the zzso In this review, the state of the art in zzso for breast cancer is outlined and a zzso Network for zzso Research in zzso Imaging zzso is zzso which has been formed by the National Cancer Institute to advance diffuse optical zzso and imaging zzso for the purpose of improving breast cancer detection and clinical zzso zzso employs broadband technology both in zzso spectral and zzso signal zzso in order to separate zzso from scattering and zzso zzso of multiple molecular zzso based on zzso or zzso zzso Additional zzso in the data is provided by zzso and zzso the functional information of zzso with zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso which provide structural information or vascular flow information, zzso zzso affecting zzso performance, such as intrinsic and zzso contrast mechanisms, zzso of zzso zzso image zzso and zzso zzso are under investigation in the ongoing research zzso zzso One of the goals is to develop standardized zzso platforms that can be used as zzso devices or in conjunction with zzso zzso or zzso This zzso multidisciplinary effort is expected to provide new insight regarding the origins of breast disease and practical approaches for addressing several key challenges in breast cancer, zzso zzso disease in zzso dense zzso distinguishing between zzso and benign zzso and understanding the impact of zzso zzso
