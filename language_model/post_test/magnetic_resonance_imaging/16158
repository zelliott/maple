The purpose of this study was to test whether zzso the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso contact area of anterior cruciate ligament zzso knees are different from those of normal, zzso knees and zzso zzso reconstruction restores in zzso zzso zzso and contact zzso 

Ten zzso knees and twelve zzso knees, as well as the zzso zzso knees, were zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed at full extension and 40 degrees of zzso under simulated partial zzso zzso zzso of freedom zzso zzso zzso contact area, and contact location were analyzed by use of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso knee zzso 

The zzso in the zzso knees underwent significantly more lateral tilt during zzso zzso zzso zzso and tended to translate more zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso in zzso zzso After zzso zzso no zzso parameters were significantly different from those in zzso zzso The zzso contact areas of zzso knees at both the extended and zzso positions zzso zzso 22 zzso and zzso zzso 53 zzso zzso were significantly smaller than those of zzso knees (78 zzso 45 zzso and zzso zzso 119 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso the zzso contact area of zzso knees in the extended position zzso zzso 41 zzso was significantly larger zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso knees zzso zzso 34 zzso but no difference was detected in the zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso contact zzso translation, and contact area showed zzso of variation of less than zzso 

zzso injuries alter zzso zzso including zzso tilt and zzso lateral translation, but zzso reconstruction with hamstring or zzso restores altered zzso zzso zzso injuries reduce the zzso contact area at both the extended and zzso positions, but zzso reconstruction zzso the zzso contact area at extension and restores the normal contact area at low angles of zzso 

Level III, zzso zzso
