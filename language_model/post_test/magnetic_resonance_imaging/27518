In recent years, breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been used to evaluate the zzso and functional markers of breast zzso which might influence local staging and surgical zzso 

To evaluate the feasibility of a one stop zzso protocol combined with zzso imaging with background body signal suppression zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All experiments were conducted with a zzso clinical zzso zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso the zzso signal intensity drop rate zzso in zzso and the intensity increasing rate zzso on zzso were compared between breast zzso zzso zzso 29) and benign zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso sequences were classified into two zzso (a and b) according to the end of the zzso The zzso zzso the first zzso signal intensity decrease time zzso and zzso between the zzso and benign zzso were statistically analyzed by zzso zzso 

Overall, zzso of the zzso were detected by zzso There were significant differences in zzso zzso and zzso between the zzso and benign zzso The zzso zzso in zzso demonstrated a specificity of zzso in zzso between zzso and benign zzso At a fixed specificity of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso differentiated breast zzso from benign zzso with sensitivities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso might be a compensation sequence for detecting breast zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso had the best specificity index, and the two zzso in the zzso curve were helpful in the differential diagnosis of zzso from benign zzso
