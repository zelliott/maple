To compare the accuracy of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with that of standard MR imaging for assessing the viability of the zzso pole of the zzso in patients with zzso 

The study protocol was submitted to the institutional review board, and the need to obtain additional approval was zzso for this retrospective zzso zzso patients zzso age zzso standard zzso zzso years zzso zzso with zzso of a zzso fracture underwent dynamic zzso MR imaging of the wrist 28 days zzso 19 before zzso Dynamic zzso MR imaging consisted of acquisition of 40 consecutive zzso zzso images over 1 zzso Two readers zzso evaluated MR images obtained with a standard protocol and rated the viability of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was calculated in a region of interest placed in the zzso zzso pole by a third zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso were zzso and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso were zzso zzso performance in determining zzso viability was calculated for readers 1 and zzso zzso findings in 11 patients and surgical findings in all patients served as the standard of zzso 

The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of standard MR imaging in the detection of zzso necrosis were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for reader 1 and zzso zzso and zzso for reader zzso zzso reliability was excellent zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso for reader 1 and zzso for reader zzso The diagnostic performance of dynamic zzso MR imaging, determined with the zzso zzso value, was inferior to that of standard MR imaging, with an zzso of zzso zzso at zzso examination zzso bone, zzso bone, callus zzso did not correlate with those at dynamic zzso MR zzso 

Because the diagnostic performance of dynamic zzso MR imaging in the evaluation of zzso viability was inferior to that of a standard MR imaging zzso dynamic acquisition may not be needed in patients with zzso of zzso zzso
