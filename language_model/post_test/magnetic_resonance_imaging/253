Human drug dependence routinely features a difficulty with disengaging attention from drug-related zzso a symptom previously shown to be zzso of zzso during zzso We examined the neural mechanisms underlying this zzso bias in cocaine users, varying working memory zzso load to reflect the demands imposed by zzso craving zzso Sixteen active users of cocaine were administered a zzso task that manipulated the requirement for selective attention by varying the background zzso zzso or neutral, upon which a recall probe item was zzso zzso and zzso data were zzso zzso users had significantly poorer zzso control under high zzso demands, suffering both increased response times and reduced recall zzso with this effect more pronounced for cocaine stimuli (when compared to neutral zzso The presence of background cocaine stimuli was associated with increases in zzso zzso activity, consistent with increased visual processing of the irrelevant stimuli for these zzso In addition, the cocaine stimuli were associated with increased right prefrontal activity with those participants with higher levels of right prefrontal activity having lower levels of zzso zzso zzso users under high cognitive demands had difficulty modulating the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control which appear necessary for restricting the visual processing of zzso but salient zzso zzso a finding that may be relevant to identifying those at most risk of zzso
