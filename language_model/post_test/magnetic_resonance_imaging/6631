zzso imaging may be defined as zzso localized and/or temporally resolved sensing of molecular and cellular processes in zzso An zzso molecular event may be the result of the zzso of a gene that produces a specific zzso zzso The zzso protein could be an zzso or could be incorporated into zzso zzso or zzso Any step of this process is a potential target for molecular zzso Current molecular imaging zzso include magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear imaging, zzso and optical zzso Nuclear medicine has been at the forefront of molecular imaging because of the relatively high sensitivity to detect zzso or zzso quantities of the zzso imaging zzso Imaging has had a central role in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso which is considered the fifth most frequent zzso zzso Nuclear imaging was one of the earlier zzso used for liver zzso Traditional zzso included zzso zzso ( zzso zzso sulfur zzso zzso 67, and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Other less traditional zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso for evaluation of functional liver volume and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for detecting drug zzso zzso is the most widely used probe for zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso however, carbon zzso zzso appears to show improved sensitivity and specificity for zzso zzso 15 PET imaging allows for the measurement of zzso and tumor blood zzso zzso developing specific imaging methods for zzso are caused by the lack of obvious specific molecular targets, problems with drug delivery, and poor zzso No magic molecular imaging method exists today to accurately zzso zzso and monitor zzso in zzso
