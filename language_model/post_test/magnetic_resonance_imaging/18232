We report the synthesis and characterization of a novel carbon zzso magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and the in zzso assessment of its essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partition zzso protein zzso zzso zzso release, and zzso The results indicate that, at zzso between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso are zzso highly zzso and stable in zzso water, as well as zzso zzso addition of zzso and zzso to zzso At potential zzso equilibrium zzso in blood zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso are zzso stable (with no zzso zzso zzso do not allow zzso protein zzso and elicit negligible allergic zzso The r 1 zzso of zzso was 92 zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso greater than that of clinical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results open avenues for zzso in zzso safety and efficacy studies with zzso toward its development as a clinical zzso zzso
