zzso with zzso spectrum conditions zzso have difficulties in social interaction and communication, which is reflected in zzso of brain regions engaged in social processing, such as zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso state studies in zzso have identified reduced connectivity of the default mode network zzso which includes zzso suggesting that other resting state networks incorporating zzso brain regions may also be zzso Using zzso connectivity and group independent component analysis zzso approaches, we looked at resting functional connectivity in zzso between specific zzso brain regions, as well as within and between whole networks incorporating these zzso We found reduced functional connectivity within the zzso in individuals with zzso using both zzso and zzso zzso Two further networks identified by zzso the zzso network, incorporating the zzso and a zzso zzso lobe network, incorporating the amygdala, showed reduced zzso zzso This was zzso by reduced zzso connectivity between the zzso and zzso The results demonstrate significantly reduced functional connectivity within and between resting state networks incorporating zzso brain zzso This reduced connectivity may result in difficulties in communication and integration of information across these networks, which could contribute to the impaired processing of social signals in zzso
