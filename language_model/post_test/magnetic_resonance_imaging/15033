To estimate the zzso of and to characterize cognitive and imaging findings associated with incident zzso PET zzso 

zzso normal zzso participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who had 2 or more serial imaging zzso which included zzso zzso zzso and zzso at each time point, were eligible for analysis zzso zzso zzso Twelve subjects with zzso disease zzso were included for zzso 

Of the 123 zzso participants who were zzso at zzso 26 met criteria for incident zzso PET zzso Compared to the 69 subjects who remained stable zzso on average these 26 did not differ on any imaging, zzso or cognitive variables except zzso PET (by zzso and zzso functional zzso which at baseline was greater in the incident zzso zzso Eleven of the 26 incident zzso subjects had abnormal zzso volume, zzso or both at zzso 

The zzso of zzso PET zzso is approximately zzso per year among zzso participants over age 70 sampled from a zzso zzso In zzso zzso incident zzso zzso occurred prior to abnormalities in zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso incident zzso subjects had evidence of zzso prior to incident zzso zzso These 11 could be subjects with combinations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso who newly entered the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso profile pathways to zzso zzso zzso
