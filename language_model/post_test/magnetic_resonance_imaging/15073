To investigate zzso chemical zzso zzso mapping of zzso density fat fraction zzso and zzso zzso in bone zzso as zzso for osteoporosis zzso 

Fifty-one patients zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso underwent dual energy X-ray zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso score, 173 valid zzso bodies were divided into three groups zzso zzso and zzso Three echo chemical zzso zzso sequences were acquired at 3 zzso zzso and zzso with correction for zzso fat zzso were measured for each zzso zzso zzso test and post hoc analysis were performed to evaluate differences between zzso Further, the area under the curve zzso for each technique was calculated using zzso zzso zzso 

On the basis of zzso 92 samples were normal zzso zzso 47 zzso (27 zzso and 34 zzso (20 zzso zzso was increased in osteoporosis compared with healthy zzso zzso showed significant differences between normal and zzso zzso and between normal and osteoporosis zzso zzso to differentiate between normal and osteoporosis was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for both zzso 

zzso and zzso are moderate zzso for zzso zzso and zzso combination might improve the prediction in zzso healthy subjects from those with zzso
