To investigate the role of MR imaging in detecting zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in breast cancer patients with zzso but without palpable zzso 

MR imaging of the zzso was performed on 26 breast cancer patients with zzso zzso without palpable regional masses, using zzso T and zzso T imaging zzso zzso were correlated with the clinical zzso 

Twenty-six patients with zzso zzso and history of breast cancer were enrolled in the zzso All patients presented with zzso zzso Fourteen patients were positive and 12 patients were indeterminate for zzso zzso according to clinical zzso 

MR imaging demonstrated masses involving the zzso representing zzso in two zzso Nine patients had other regional abnormalities with a normal zzso zzso It is concluded that MR imaging is useful in the assessment and direction of therapy of zzso zzso in breast cancer patients by detecting both zzso to the zzso as well as other zzso unrelated to the zzso which may explain the patient's zzso
