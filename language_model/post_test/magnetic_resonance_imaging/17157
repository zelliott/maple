To evaluate zzso with thin slices to depict anatomical variations of the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed in 51 zzso The zzso zzso were differentiated on zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstructions were zzso The variation in zzso of the zzso facet of the zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso images of the zzso were zzso All images were studied by an experienced physical zzso 

Analysis revealed that 18 zzso of the subjects had 3 distinct zzso on the zzso A missing anterior facet was revealed in five zzso of zzso Twenty-six zzso subjects showed a fusion of the anterior and middle zzso In four cases, an articulation was found between the zzso and the zzso zzso At the zzso zzso zzso variations were observed of the zzso of the zzso side of the zzso 

The zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso can be zzso on MR zzso On zzso images, an zzso connection was seen between the zzso and the zzso bone, as well as variations in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These anatomical variations may have implications for mobility and stability of the zzso
