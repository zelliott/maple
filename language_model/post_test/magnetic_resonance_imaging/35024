The purpose of this study was to zzso evaluate the diagnostic performance of dynamic zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso correlation in the detection of zzso zzso zzso in patients undergoing liver zzso 

zzso patients zzso men, 19 zzso mean age, 49 zzso underwent dynamic zzso zzso zzso within 3 months before primary liver zzso Dynamic imaging was performed before zzso and after zzso zzso portal zzso zzso and zzso delayed zzso IV zzso administration of zzso zzso at zzso zzso body zzso zzso image analysis to detect zzso zzso was performed independently by two abdominal zzso who had no zzso zzso On a zzso basis, the sensitivity and positive zzso value were calculated for the two zzso zzso and specificity in the diagnosis of zzso also were zzso zzso exact test was performed to determine whether there was a detection difference between zzso zzso 1 zzso in diameter or larger and zzso smaller than 1 zzso and to evaluate the differences in causes of zzso zzso findings based on zzso size zzso 1 zzso vs zzso 1 zzso 

zzso patients had 41 zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso (35 of 41 zzso and a positive zzso value of zzso (35 of 53 zzso for observer 1 and a sensitivity of zzso zzso of 41 zzso and a positive zzso value of zzso zzso of 52 zzso for observer zzso For both observers, sensitivity in the detection of zzso 1 zzso in diameter and larger zzso was significantly different zzso zzso zzso from that in detection of zzso smaller than 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more often caused zzso diagnoses of zzso smaller than 1 zzso in diameter zzso on MR images than of those 1 zzso in diameter and larger zzso The difference was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso for both zzso In diagnosis, zzso zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso (20 of 23 zzso and a specificity of zzso (19 of 24 zzso for both zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso zzso has a sensitivity of zzso and a positive zzso value of zzso in the detection of zzso The technique, however, is of limited value for detecting and characterizing zzso smaller than 1 zzso in zzso
