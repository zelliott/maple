To zzso evaluate differences in carotid plaque characteristics in symptomatic and zzso patients using high resolution zzso 

20 symptomatic and 20 zzso patients, with at least 50% carotid zzso as determined by zzso zzso underwent zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the carotid zzso Studies were zzso both zzso and zzso in a zzso manner by two experienced readers in consensus, blinded to clinical status, and plaques were classified according to the modified American Heart Association zzso zzso 

After exclusion of poor quality images, 109 zzso sections in 18 symptomatic and 19 zzso patients were available for zzso There were no significant differences in mean zzso zzso severity zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso or plaque burden zzso plaque areas 50 zzso vs 50 zzso p zzso zzso between the symptomatic and zzso zzso However, symptomatic zzso had a higher zzso of zzso zzso caps zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso vs zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and complicated type VI zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso findings of plaque zzso or zzso had an odds ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso while thin or zzso zzso cap (as opposed to a thick zzso zzso had an odds ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for prediction of symptomatic clinical zzso 

There are significant differences in plaque characteristics between symptomatic and zzso carotid zzso and these can be detected in zzso by high resolution zzso
