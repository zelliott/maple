We used zzso zzso zzso an automatic zzso MR image analysis technique, to investigate gray matter abnormalities in patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso in whom zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by application of the zzso method of modern design zzso zzso results zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated preferential gray matter concentration zzso reduction in anterior zzso in patients with left zzso and zzso zzso in patients with right zzso GMC reduction was also found in right zzso prefrontal zzso in left and right zzso zzso zzso zzso may be due to zzso zzso zzso from the zzso connected pathological zzso and may be the underlying biological cause for executive dysfunction in patients with zzso GMC excess in zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions was common to both left and right zzso groups relative to controls, and is hypothesized to reflect diminished zzso matter zzso underlying white matter zzso or structural displacement due to zzso fluid zzso However, bilateral zzso lobe GMC excess was observed in left zzso patients, while zzso zzso lobe GMC excess was observed in right zzso zzso This work demonstrates zzso consistency between automated zzso and manual zzso analysis of the zzso in group zzso indicates widespread zzso gray matter abnormalities in unilateral zzso and suggests that there may be inherent differences in the effect of zzso on zzso lobe structures depending on the side of zzso
