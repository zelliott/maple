We describe an zzso zzso feature present in several zzso species that involves a fusion between the zzso lobe zzso including zzso zzso in great zzso and the zzso zzso zzso such that a portion of insular zzso forms an isolated pocket zzso to the zzso zzso We assessed the frequency of this fusion in 56 zzso species (including apes, Old World zzso New World zzso and zzso by using either magnetic resonance images or zzso zzso A fusion between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was present in 22 species zzso apes, two Old World zzso four New World zzso and nine zzso The zzso fusion was observed in most eastern gorilla zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specimens zzso and zzso of cases, zzso but was seen less frequently in other great apes and was never found in zzso We further explored the zzso of this fusion in eastern gorillas by examining the zzso and zzso within this region and observed that the degree to which deep cortical layers and white matter are incorporated into the fusion varies among individuals within a zzso We suggest that fusion between zzso and insular zzso is an example of a relatively rare zzso feature that has become more common in eastern zzso possibly as the result of a population bottleneck zzso zzso the zzso distribution of this zzso highlights a derived feature of these great zzso
