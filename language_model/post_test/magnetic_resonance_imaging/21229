Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory neurological condition characterized by focal and diffuse zzso and zzso throughout the central nervous zzso zzso influencing the progression of pathology are poorly zzso One hypothesis is that anatomical connectivity influences the spread of zzso This predicts that measures of zzso will correlate most strongly between interconnected zzso However, such patterns have been difficult to zzso through zzso zzso or in zzso scanning zzso In this study, we used the complementary approaches of whole brain zzso magnetic resonance imaging and quantitative zzso to assess patterns of multiple sclerosis zzso Two zzso projection systems were considered based on their distinct zzso and their documented involvement in multiple zzso lateral zzso nucleus to primary visual zzso and zzso nucleus of the zzso to prefrontal zzso Within the zzso distinct zzso projection systems, magnetic resonance imaging derived cortical thickness was correlated significantly with both a measure of zzso in the connected tract and a measure of connected zzso nucleus cell zzso Such correlations did not exist between these markers of zzso across different zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso analysis depicted clearly demarcated zzso zzso zzso on the white matter tracts of interest; however, zzso of the extent of zzso overlap failed to demonstrate any appreciable association with the severity of markers of diffuse pathology within each zzso projection zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging metrics in both white matter tracts were correlated significantly with a zzso derived measure of tract zzso These data demonstrate for the first time the relevance of functional anatomical connectivity to the spread of multiple sclerosis pathology in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso relationship between metrics from zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso measures from fixed tissue further zzso the potential of imaging for future zzso zzso
