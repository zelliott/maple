Modern zzso image processing methods have yielded zzso zzso functional, and structural assessments of the human zzso These analyses typically exploit carefully zzso protocols for specific imaging zzso Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, zzso and zzso their zzso Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining zzso protocols in zzso zzso zzso these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity zzso with functional and/or anatomical zzso Yet, validation of the zzso of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate zzso zzso We present an imaging protocol zzso to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, zzso and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible zzso protocol on a zzso zzso zzso We present zzso zzso of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 zzso zzso zzso years zzso The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, zzso zzso fluid, thalamus, zzso zzso zzso gray matter, zzso white matter, and zzso were identified with mean zzso zzso of zzso We zzso the mean intensity, zzso and zzso of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis zzso Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition zzso zzso while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher zzso Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures zzso exhibited variation of zzso in the cerebral white zzso or in thin structures zzso zzso varied by up to zzso in the zzso due, in large part, to zzso in automated zzso zzso The richness of the joint distribution of zzso across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary zzso As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely zzso This effort provides the zzso community with a resource for zzso of zzso that exploit the diversity of modern zzso zzso Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and zzso of zzso imaging zzso
