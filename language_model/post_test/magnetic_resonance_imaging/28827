To assess whether magnetic resonance zzso imaging can be used for reliable prediction of zzso extension of cervical zzso into the zzso 

Thirty patients with early cervical zzso underwent MR imaging with use of a zzso magnet prior to zzso The MR images were analyzed by two zzso unaware of the zzso findings, for the relationship of the tumor to the internal zzso and extension of the tumor into the zzso zzso at MR imaging were compared with those at zzso zzso 

At MR imaging, 24 patients were considered not to have tumor extension zzso to the internal zzso and into the zzso All tumors were confirmed zzso In six patients thought to have zzso tumor invasion at MR imaging, five tumors were confirmed zzso in one, tumor extended up to the internal zzso but did not involve the zzso 

This is a small study, but MR imaging appears accurate in the prediction of zzso tumor involvement and in showing the relationship of cervical zzso to the internal zzso and, zzso the patient's suitability for zzso
