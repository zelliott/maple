To zzso evaluate accuracy of zzso anatomy depiction and quality of zzso tract zzso of magnetic resonance zzso zzso at zzso T in living potential liver donors zzso 

Our institutional review board approved this study and did not require patient's informed zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso at zzso magnetic resonance and zzso zzso as the reference zzso zzso protocol included zzso rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two readers independently analyzed 2 zzso image sets with a zzso zzso for zzso zzso anatomy and scoring degree of zzso of zzso branches with a 4-point scale, and recorded the number of visible zzso zzso One month later, both readers independently evaluated combined both zzso image set to assess zzso zzso 

zzso anatomy was correctly depicted by zzso sequence in 28 zzso and 26 zzso zzso by zzso sequence in 27 zzso and 26 zzso and by combined both sequences in 27 zzso and 28 zzso for readers 1 and 2, zzso The mean zzso branch zzso scores for 2 readers were significantly higher for zzso images than for zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The mean numbers of visible zzso branches were significantly higher for zzso images than zzso for both readers zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso at zzso T with both zzso and zzso sequences enables accurate depiction of zzso zzso zzso sequence more clearly zzso second- and zzso zzso branches than zzso zzso
