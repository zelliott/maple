The zzso analog zzso has been demonstrated to improve zzso tract zzso caused by zzso zzso within hours of its administration and/or reduce tumor size in some zzso We report the results of a prospective zzso study of the effects of zzso on visual function and tumor size in patients with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso patients with visual defects caused by zzso confirmed zzso were administered zzso via continuous subcutaneous infusion, as zzso 100 zzso the 1st day and, if necessary, 200 zzso the 2nd and then 100 or 200 zzso three times daily if visual function zzso Vision was assessed after 4 days, 1 month, and 2 months, including tumor size zzso Visual improvement was defined by a net gain of at least zzso in acuity and/or of more than zzso of the surface of one zzso (a reduction in tumor volume of zzso or zzso zzso of the initial zzso opposite changes were defined as zzso 

Visual improvement was noted in 13 of 24 patients, 10 of 23 patients and 9 of 22 patients, and was not noted in 11 of 24 patients, 14 of 23 patients, and 13 of 22 patients after 4 days, 1 month, and 2 months, zzso After 2 months, three zzso had zzso three had not changed in size, and one had zzso visual function improved in the seven patients with these zzso zzso was discontinued in 13 patients for lack of zzso 

The zzso of visual improvement and tumor shrinkage noted in this study was higher than previously zzso Our data suggest that early onset of visual improvement might help in deciding which patients profit from zzso However, zzso gain in visual acuity with deterioration in visual fields or visual improvement with an increase zzso in tumor size can zzso
