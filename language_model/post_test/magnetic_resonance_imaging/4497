To determine the relationship between reductions in the apparent diffusion zzso of water zzso and in cerebral blood flow zzso during focal zzso we used zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso zzso analysis to examine rats subjected to 30 or 90 zzso of permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso In the zzso zzso group zzso zzso 10), the area with substantially reduced zzso zzso or more below the zzso level zzso corresponded best to the area with zzso below 25 zzso zzso and was significantly smaller than the area with zzso below 50 zzso zzso zzso a level associated with reduced protein synthesis and delayed necrosis (40 zzso zzso versus 74 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso the zzso area corresponded best to the zzso to zzso area and was again significantly smaller than the zzso area (54 zzso zzso versus 73 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Thus, the area of substantially reduced zzso at 30 and 90 zzso represents only zzso and zzso respectively, of the tissue at risk for zzso These findings indicate a potential limitation in using early zzso imaging to predict stroke zzso
