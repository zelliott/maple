The relative contributions to gastric zzso from common cavity zzso pressure difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waves in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in humans by high-resolution zzso zzso with zzso three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging during zzso zzso infusion at 2 zzso zzso volume, zzso pressure, and contraction wave histories in the zzso region were measured in seven healthy zzso The subjects fell into two distinct groups with an order of magnitude difference in levels of zzso pressure zzso However, there was no significant difference in average rate of gastric zzso between the two zzso zzso pressure history was separated into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso periods zzso and average pressure during zzso periods remained unchanged with decreasing gastric volume, suggesting that common cavity pressure levels were maintained by increasing wall muscle tone with decreasing zzso When zzso zzso moved to within 2-3 zzso of the zzso zzso resistance was found statistically to increase with decreasing distance between zzso waves and the zzso We conclude that zzso flow tends to be blocked when zzso contraction waves are within a zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso suggesting zzso coordination between zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further conclude that gastric zzso of zzso liquids is primarily through the zzso zzso mechanism controlled by zzso opening during periods of relative zzso in zzso zzso wave zzso
