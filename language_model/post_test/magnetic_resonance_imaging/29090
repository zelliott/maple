Rapid zzso weighted zzso images would facilitate physicians being able to distinguish normal zzso vessels, tumors, and zzso zzso from therapeutic devices throughout zzso zzso procedures commonly performed in open zzso scanners zzso zzso zzso Conventional diagnostic zzso techniques have not been successful at zzso strength for fast zzso imaging during the guidance phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods yield zzso images and do not always provide sufficient contrast for device guidance or zzso zzso As such, a zzso of zzso (a zzso reversed form of zzso which collects the zzso spin echo of the zzso signal was developed and implemented at zzso T for use in zzso zzso The sequence has a balanced zzso zzso to reduce motion zzso zzso sampling toward the end of the zzso cycle reduces zzso zzso of the spin echo component in the zzso zzso The sequence gives one image in zzso s in zzso with adequate zzso and zzso contrast for zzso zzso Patient studies showed that the zzso sequence zzso zzso many tumors not zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso from animal experiments suggested that it has potential to monitor zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
