We assessed the use of intravenous zzso for the zzso of the zzso mask airway in 10 healthy awake volunteers, a technique primarily developed to facilitate functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of zzso Each volunteer received 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso airway zzso was zzso by 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by 12 sprays of zzso zzso zzso was subsequently infused to achieve an initial target zzso concentration of 2 zzso increments of 1 zzso were allowed with the maximum zzso concentration limited to 6 zzso zzso of the zzso mask airway was successful on the first attempt in all zzso The median zzso zzso target zzso zzso concentration at zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso All volunteers were zzso during the procedure and only one reported zzso zzso throat was a complication in all zzso We conclude that the technique allows successful zzso of the zzso mask airway in healthy awake volunteers under conditions that were safe and zzso
