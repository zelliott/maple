zzso zzso oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface are the primary source of the scalp zzso and zzso Thus, in particular, zzso and zzso structures on the cortical surface have a zzso possibility to influence the zzso and zzso This was examined by comparing the spatial power spectral density zzso of the upper portion of the human zzso in zzso slices to that of simulated scalp zzso and zzso The electrical activity was modeled with zzso zzso sources oriented normal to the local cortical zzso The resulting scalp zzso were calculated with a finite element model of the head constructed from 51 segmented zzso MR zzso The zzso was zzso after taking the fast zzso transform of scalp zzso The zzso of the cortical zzso in each slice was also zzso The zzso was then averaged over all the zzso This was done for zzso and zzso view zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso showed two broad peaks, one from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso showed a broad peak from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other two zzso within the range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are definitely due to the zzso structures and associated larger patterns on the cortical zzso Smaller zzso in the range of 1-3 zzso were also observed which are possibly due to zzso zzso These results suggest that the spatial information was present in the zzso and zzso at the spatial zzso of zzso This also implies that the practical zzso frequency for sampling scalp zzso should be zzso zzso and an optimal zzso spacing of about 3 zzso is needed for extraction of cortical patterns from scalp zzso in zzso
