A novel imaging zzso is introduced which uses zzso zzso detected electron spin resonance zzso It is capable of providing qualitative and zzso information on a variety of parameters reflecting zzso function, the most significant being tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso electronic relaxation time maps of the abdomen of living zzso rats were generated after intravenous administration of a zzso free radical zzso These maps were used to evaluate oxygen zzso zzso between the liver, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were made regarding the distribution, zzso and zzso rate of the contrast zzso zzso zzso in the kidney was also zzso zzso involves zzso zzso zzso with a modulated zzso and observing zzso in the spin zzso parallel to the main magnetic zzso The zzso and zzso maps were calculated from a set of zzso signal phase images collected at different detection zzso Each phase image also provides qualitative information on tissue oxygen levels without any further zzso This method presents an alternative to the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso methods, particularly for animal zzso imaging zzso
