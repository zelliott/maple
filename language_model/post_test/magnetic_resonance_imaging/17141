Over the last decade, zzso has re-emerged as an interesting option in the management of zzso zzso in both children and zzso Nonetheless, as it has become more difficult to use zzso specimens in training, the development of alternative methods was zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the performance of a real simulator, in association with zzso zzso as a teaching tool for the training of zzso zzso zzso 

3 real zzso were built using a special type of zzso 1 was designed to represent the zzso enlarged zzso making it possible for a third zzso to be zzso The remaining 2 were designed to simulate a person's skull and brain bearing zzso zzso which were placed as zzso in the zzso of zzso region, in the frontal and zzso horns of the lateral zzso and within the third zzso In all models, zzso images were obtained for navigation zzso Within the zzso the relevant zzso structures and the zzso were identified through the zzso and compared with the position given by the navigation zzso The next step consisted of manipulating the zzso using standard zzso zzso 

We observed that the models were zzso zzso easy and safe to zzso They nicely reproduced the zzso anatomy and brain zzso as well as simulated zzso zzso The zzso navigation was efficient in guiding the surgeon through the zzso zzso allowing the selection of the best approach as well as defining the relevant surgical landmarks for each zzso zzso Nonetheless, as expected, navigation zzso zzso After the training sessions the surgeons felt they had gained valued experience by dealing with zzso zzso employing zzso zzso 

The use of real zzso in association with zzso navigation proved to be an effective tool in training for zzso
