In a previous study of normal elderly male zzso the zzso of quantitative white matter zzso zzso volume has been estimated to be high zzso We investigated zzso of zzso in a zzso sample of the zzso Heart Study for sex differences and the impact of zzso 

Brain magnetic resonance scans were performed on 2012 individuals in the cohort and offspring of the zzso zzso This report was limited to zzso zzso and zzso members zzso age zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with a history of multiple zzso stroke, zzso or other neurological condition including traumatic brain injury were excluded from this zzso zzso volume and total zzso volume zzso were zzso using a previously published zzso Because of extreme zzso measures of zzso were zzso before zzso zzso components methods were used to estimate zzso of zzso after adjusting for sex, age, zzso and zzso 

In the full zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso among women was zzso zzso whereas zzso among men was zzso zzso zzso varied as average age increased, with a peak of zzso zzso in individuals aged 55 or zzso 

Using a zzso study design zzso generally healthy individuals, this study found high zzso of zzso overall and similar zzso for both men and zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso remained high among individuals in whom the prevalence of cerebrovascular brain injury was generally low, suggesting that zzso is also likely to be an excellent genetic marker of brain zzso
