There is a major resurgence of interest in brown zzso tissue zzso biology, particularly regarding its zzso and consequences in newborns and zzso Reliable methods for zzso BAT measurement in human infants have yet to be zzso The current study first zzso methods for quantitative BAT imaging of zzso post zzso followed by BAT zzso and zzso of excised zzso zzso methods are then employed in a cohort of in zzso infants to establish the reliability of these measures and provide zzso statistics for BAT depot volume and fat zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images of zzso and zzso were acquired and ratios of fat to the combined signal from fat and water zzso signal zzso were zzso Neonatal scans zzso zzso zzso were acquired during natural sleep to zzso BAT and zzso deposits for depot volume and fat zzso Acquisition zzso was assessed based on multiple scans from the same zzso zzso and zzso measures of reliability in regional BAT depot volume and fat fraction zzso were determined based on multiple zzso by two zzso zzso BAT was characterized as having significantly higher water content than zzso in both in zzso as well as ex zzso imaging zzso Human zzso deposits indicative of bilateral BAT in zzso zzso and zzso regions were zzso zzso zzso fat fraction was significantly greater than BAT fat fraction throughout the sample zzso zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso scans demonstrated a high zzso correlation for fat fraction zzso zzso zzso BAT depot volume and fat fraction zzso showed high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reliability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the reliability of using zzso zzso zzso in human zzso for zzso throughout the torso of BAT depot volume and fat fraction zzso
