zzso independent component analysis zzso is a well-established technique for zzso analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso It blindly extracts zzso patterns of neural activity from functional zzso by seeking for sources that are zzso zzso Additional information on one or more sources zzso spatial zzso is often zzso however, it is not considered while looking for independent zzso In the present work, we propose a new zzso zzso based on the zzso of an objective function that accounts for both independence and other information on the sources or on the mixing model in a very general zzso In particular, we apply this approach to zzso data analysis and zzso by means of simulations, how inclusion of a spatial zzso term helps to recover the sources more effectively than with conventional zzso The improvement is especially evident in high noise zzso zzso we employ the same approach on data sets from a complex mental imagery experiment, showing that consistency and zzso zzso of relatively weak components are zzso
