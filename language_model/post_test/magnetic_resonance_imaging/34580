The flow zzso through zzso valves may be zzso by zzso the area of an zzso zzso zzso by its zzso This was tested zzso and zzso zzso zzso Q zzso 14 to 141 zzso using flat and zzso orifice zzso zzso Q versus zzso zzso a plateau was found which, for low flow, corresponded to the true zzso At higher flow or large zzso Q was zzso For zzso plates, angle correction worked at low Q but not at higher values due to the formation of separation zzso These converted the cone plate into a flat zzso zzso produced similar results at 57 zzso in that Q was correct with no angle zzso At low flow, zzso was too noisy to produce a clear plateau zzso
