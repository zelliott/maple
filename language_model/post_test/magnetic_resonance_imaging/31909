zzso frontal zzso is commonly involved in traumatic brain injury zzso The smell identification test zzso object zzso zzso and the Iowa gambling task zzso are associated with this brain region in experimental and zzso zzso We examined the relationship of performance on these tests to residual structural brain integrity zzso from zzso in 58 zzso patients, including 18 patients with focal cortical zzso and 40 patients with diffuse injury zzso Image analysis yielded regional zzso measures of gray matter, white matter and zzso zzso zzso analyses identified distributed patterns of regional volume loss associated with test performance across all three behavioral zzso The tasks were sensitive to effects of zzso In zzso zzso performance in all three tasks was related to gray matter loss including zzso frontal cortex, but the zzso was most sensitive to zzso frontal zzso damage, even in patients without focal zzso The zzso was further related to zzso lobe and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were associated with superior zzso frontal zzso Complex tasks, such as zzso and the zzso do not consistently zzso to a single cortical zzso The zzso is associated with the integrity of zzso frontal regions, but it is also affected by distributed damage, although the contribution of zzso zzso tract or bulb damage could not be ruled zzso This study illustrates the scope and limitations of functional zzso in human zzso frontal zzso
