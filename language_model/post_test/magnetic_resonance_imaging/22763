Face recognition is more strongly impaired by stimulus inversion than zzso object zzso This phenomenon, known as the face inversion effect zzso suggests that the visual system contains specialized processing mechanisms that are more engaged by upright faces than by zzso faces or zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies indicate that environmental scenes may also recruit zzso processing machinery but a comparable inversion effect for scenes has not been zzso Here we demonstrate that both face and scene inversion lead to behavioral penalties during performance of a continuous visual matching zzso however, the scene inversion effect was less robust and declined in magnitude over the course of the zzso Scene inversion led to greater neural response in the functionally defined lateral zzso zzso object area for zzso versus upright scenes and reduced response in the zzso place area zzso while face inversion lead to greater response in zzso and the right middle zzso zzso object area for zzso versus upright faces but no change in the zzso face area zzso A zzso analysis revealed several regions that responded more strongly to either upright versus zzso faces or upright versus zzso scenes, some of which may be involved in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that both face and scene inversion cause a shift from specialized processing zzso towards generic zzso zzso however, this shift only leads to a reliable behavioral penalty in the case of face zzso
