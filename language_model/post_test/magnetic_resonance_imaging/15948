We investigated the early effects of zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso on tumor zzso and on the possible consequences of combining zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular consumption of zzso and radiation sensitivity were studied in zzso liver tumors after daily doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and tumor cell oxygen consumption were carried out using electron zzso resonance zzso and zzso parameters were assessed by dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso delay zzso were performed after treatment with zzso alone, radiation alone or a combination of both zzso zzso induced an early increase in tumor zzso that did not correlate with zzso of the tumor zzso or with changes in tumor zzso A decrease in tumor cell oxygen consumption was observed that could have been responsible for this increase in tumor zzso zzso with this increase in tumor zzso we found that zzso zzso the tumor response to zzso Our results confirm that treatment with an inhibitor of zzso signaling reduces oxygen consumption rate by tumor zzso The observation that zzso causes an early increase in tumor zzso has implications for the timing and sequencing of treatment with zzso signaling zzso in combination with zzso
