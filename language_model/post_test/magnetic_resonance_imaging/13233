In this paper, a total variation zzso based approach is proposed for zzso fusion to fuse images acquired using multiple zzso In this approach, fusion is posed as an inverse problem and a locally zzso model is used as the forward zzso A TV zzso based approach in conjunction with principal component analysis is used zzso to estimate the fused zzso The feasibility of the proposed zzso is demonstrated on images from zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as zzso and infrared zzso The results clearly indicate the feasibility of the proposed zzso
