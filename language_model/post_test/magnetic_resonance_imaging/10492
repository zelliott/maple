The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso stimulation using a newly developed zzso compatible zzso zzso Ten healthy subjects zzso zzso were zzso zzso stimulation of the sole of the foot with a frequency of 50 zzso and a displacement of 1 zzso was performed during zzso zzso imaging sequence at zzso zzso using an zzso compatible moving magnet zzso that is able to produce zzso zzso between 0 and 100 zzso and displacement zzso between 0 and 4 zzso The zzso measurement during zzso stimulation of the right foot revealed brain zzso zzso within the primary zzso cortex, zzso within the secondary zzso cortex, zzso within the superior zzso inferior zzso and zzso insular region, zzso within the anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso and zzso nucleus, zzso within the zzso nucleus, and zzso within the anterior and zzso zzso zzso The advantages of the new zzso compatible zzso device include effective transmission of the stimulus and controlled zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso can be a suitable paradigm to observe zzso within the zzso network in zzso Furthermore, the method may be used to determine the optimal responsiveness of the individual zzso zzso
