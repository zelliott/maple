The objective of this study was to investigate whether strain zzso zzso performed immediately after zzso by zzso coronary intervention could predict the extent of zzso scar, determined by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

There is considerable zzso in survival rate after zzso coronary intervention, and accurate early risk zzso is therefore of major clinical zzso 

Thirty individuals with acute anterior zzso zzso were examined with zzso strain by zzso zzso h after zzso The extent of zzso 9 months later was analyzed by zzso in 16 corresponding zzso zzso zzso in all left zzso segments was averaged to obtain a global zzso zzso size was estimated by clinical parameters and cardiac zzso 

A good correlation was found between the global strain and total zzso size (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis showed that global peak strain and serum zzso zzso zzso correlated with the zzso size measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a clear inverse relationship was found between the zzso strain and the zzso extent of zzso in each segment (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that assessment of regional and global strain at zzso h after zzso therapy zzso with size and zzso extent of zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso The novel global strain zzso is a valuable predictor of the total extent of zzso zzso and may therefore be an important clinical tool for risk zzso in the acute phase of zzso zzso
