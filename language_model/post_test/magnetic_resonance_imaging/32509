The aim of this study was to test the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique to characterize zzso development and to determine the sex of live Pacific oysters through their zzso A preliminary nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso study was conducted to characterize zzso and zzso zzso relaxation parameters for the main oyster zzso This showed that zzso zzso sequences were most appropriate to zzso contrasts between zzso in zzso The results showed that gray levels of zzso in images acquired with zzso sequence were zzso affected by zzso weighting zzso However, the zzso systematically gave a zzso in zzso zzso images, and stack zzso of female oysters showed a peak well separated from that of male zzso An automated method is proposed to zzso the development of oysters and their zzso maturation and to identify their zzso
