zzso is an established therapy in term zzso to reduce death and disability after zzso zzso zzso zzso regional cerebral oxygen zzso zzso and zzso electroencephalogram zzso background pattern have been shown to be early zzso of long-term zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso value of zzso and zzso for zzso outcome in zzso with zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso 

In zzso with zzso who were subjected to hypothermia, the zzso background pattern and zzso were studied zzso from admission up to 84 h in relation to early magnetic resonance imaging and zzso outcome at 18 zzso of zzso 

Of 39 zzso 12 zzso died because of neurological zzso One had an adverse outcome and 26 had a favorable zzso The zzso was higher in zzso with adverse outcome, although zzso scores were zzso Positive zzso values at 12, 24, and 36 h of age for adverse outcome ranged from 50 to zzso for zzso and zzso negative zzso values ranged from 73 to zzso for zzso and 90 to zzso for zzso Combining zzso and zzso increased positive zzso values zzso and negative zzso values zzso 

During hypothermia, zzso and zzso zzso are early zzso of long-term outcome after zzso Combining both parameters further improves early zzso
