To determine whether white matter zzso zzso progression rate is a better predictor of cognitive impairment risk than baseline zzso volume in healthy elderly zzso 

zzso cognitively intact elderly subjects were followed in the Oregon Brain Aging zzso zzso had at least 3 brain zzso and annual cognitive and zzso assessments until diagnosed with persistent cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were zzso Cox zzso hazards survival analyses were used to assess cognitive impairment zzso 

After adjusting for age, zzso zzso status, incident hypertension, zzso entry zzso State zzso baseline zzso and both baseline zzso volume and rate of zzso volume change, increased progression of total zzso volume zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso higher risk of zzso whereas baseline zzso volumes did zzso Every 1 zzso increase in zzso zzso volume was associated with a zzso increased risk of zzso 

zzso of total and zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso volumes are better zzso of persistent cognitive impairment zzso than baseline zzso zzso Greater zzso zzso burden progression is associated with the development of zzso a potential precursor to zzso or vascular zzso Identification of factors that decrease zzso zzso over time is needed to maintain cognitive health in our growing elderly zzso
