zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is used to distinguish areas of the brain responsible for different tasks and zzso It is possible, for example, by using zzso images, to identify particular regions in the brain which can be considered as zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso regions which would cause significant patient morbidity if zzso The aim of this study is to propose and validate a method to exploit functional information for the identification of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso in particular, given the high spatial accuracy offered by the zzso system, local zzso registration is used to reach accurate image zzso Five patients affected by zzso zzso zzso and scheduled to undergo zzso were scanned prior to treatment using zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weighted and blood zzso level dependent echo zzso imaging zzso zzso were chosen on the basis of zzso location by considering those areas which could be potentially close to treatment zzso zzso data were superimposed on zzso and CT used for treatment zzso The procedure for the zzso of zzso areas was validated by direct cortical stimulation on 38 zzso and tumor patients undergoing conventional zzso Treatment plans studied with and without considering zzso were significantly different, in particular with respect to both maximum dose and dose volume zzso consideration of the zzso allowed quality zzso of treatment plans to remain almost constant or to improve in four out of five cases compared to plans with no consideration of zzso In conclusion, the presented method provides an accurate tool for the integration of functional information into zzso zzso which might help to minimize zzso side effects and to make zzso less zzso
