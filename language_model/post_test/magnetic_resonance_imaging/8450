zzso is an important cue in face zzso We manipulated symmetry and other zzso variables to study their role in face processing in the human zzso We employed 2 types of zzso image symmetry (where one part of the image is defined as the mirrored transform of the other part about an zzso and object symmetry (where the spatial relationships among the image components are interpreted as parts of a zzso zzso zzso We compared blood zzso level dependent responses in healthy human observers for upright zzso faces with responses to different zzso zzso The cortical areas activated by the face images, relative to zzso scrambled images, were the zzso zzso and zzso zzso face areas, the middle zzso zzso zzso and areas around the superior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso faces and their zzso scrambled versions showed a similar zzso pattern except in the right zzso suggesting an involvement in facial symmetry zzso The upright versus zzso faces (with the same image symmetry but unfamiliar object zzso showed robust differential zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The response to zzso versus zzso faces zzso the same object symmetry but disrupted image zzso showed little differential zzso in the zzso or the zzso but strong responses in the zzso and zzso suggesting that face processing in the zzso and the zzso is holistic and viewpoint zzso
