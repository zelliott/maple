Thirteen patients with zzso cell disease zzso undergoing zzso therapy and 8 control patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging to discriminate bone zzso change due to iron deposition from zzso zzso zzso Using zzso spin echo images, only two subjects showed extremely low signal intensity zzso compatible with iron zzso However, using zzso fast spin echo images with fat suppression, zzso bone zzso in zzso patients with zzso therapy showed considerably lower signal than that of zzso The main cause of zzso signal decrease in zzso patients with zzso therapy was considered to be iron deposition due to repeated zzso therapy rather than red zzso zzso
