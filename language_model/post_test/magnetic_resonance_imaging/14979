zzso working memory zzso is a hallmark of zzso In addition to classical zzso regions such as the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso network zzso contribute to these zzso zzso zzso siblings of patients also show zzso zzso However, the nature of the functional deficits underlying these zzso is zzso mainly because of impaired performance zzso zzso zzso 

Here, we investigated zzso and zzso activity in 23 unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy volunteers using zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso load was determined prior to scanning to ensure zzso accuracy for all zzso 

zzso showed zzso during the zzso phase of zzso in the right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso which is the anterior part of the zzso No differences were found during the maintenance zzso During the retrieval phase, siblings showed zzso in zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and the zzso zzso who showed zzso in the zzso during zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso during zzso 

Our finding of zzso in zzso and zzso areas indicates that siblings fail to adequately inhibit zzso activity during demanding cognitive tasks and subsequently zzso zzso zzso This failure may reflect zzso zzso in the zzso which prevents adequate zzso suppression needed for effective zzso This study provides support for the notion that zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns may represent candidate zzso for zzso
