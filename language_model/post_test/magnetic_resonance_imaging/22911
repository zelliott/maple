To zzso assess the usefulness of contrast zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging alone and with zzso MR imaging in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso 

A waiver of informed consent and institutional review board approval for this retrospective study were zzso The study was zzso zzso zzso men zzso age, 49 years; range, zzso zzso and 10 women zzso age, 53 years; range, zzso zzso with zzso underwent zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging at zzso T within 90 days of liver zzso Three readers reviewed the zzso images alone and then the zzso and zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso and reader confidence levels were zzso 

At liver zzso 57 zzso were present in 18 zzso 19 zzso 33 zzso zzso and five zzso zzso zzso imaging depicted 13 of 19 zzso with an overall sensitivity of zzso (13 of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso of zzso The sensitivity and specificity for detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were nearly identical for zzso images read alone or read with zzso zzso The only difference was the specificity for zzso images read alone zzso and read with zzso images zzso The addition of zzso images altered the diagnosis in one of 90 zzso cases and provided an increase in diagnostic confidence in four of 258 zzso cases for independent readers and three of 90 zzso cases at consensus zzso 

zzso zzso imaging can be used as a zzso sequence for the diagnosis of zzso in patients with zzso prior to liver zzso
