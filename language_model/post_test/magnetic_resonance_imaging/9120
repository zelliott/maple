The zzso network zzso is a functional network with increasing relevance for psychiatric research, characterized by increased zzso at rest and decreased zzso during task zzso The degree of zzso zzso during a cognitively demanding task depends on its zzso However, the relation of zzso responses in the resting phase after a preceding cognitive challenge remains relatively zzso We test the hypothesis that the degree of zzso of the zzso following cognitive challenge is influenced by the cognitive load of a preceding zzso zzso 

Twenty-five healthy subjects were investigated with functional zzso at 3 zzso while performing a zzso task with embedded short resting zzso Data were zzso into statistically independent zzso components using zzso Independent zzso Analysis zzso The zzso was selected using a zzso zzso The spatial map contained zzso zzso in the zzso frontal cortex, zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso The time course of the zzso revealed increased zzso at rest after zzso and zzso blocks compared to the zzso after a zzso zzso 

We present evidence that a cognitively challenging zzso task is followed by greater zzso of the zzso than a simple zzso zzso This might be interpreted as a functional correlate of zzso and reflection of the preceding task or as relocation of cerebral resources representing recovery from high cognitive zzso This finding is highly relevant for zzso studies which include resting zzso in cognitive tasks as stable baseline zzso Further studies investigating the zzso should take possible interactions of tasks and subsequent resting zzso into zzso
