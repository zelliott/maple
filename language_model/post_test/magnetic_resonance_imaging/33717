The zzso changes and signal intensity of the spinal zzso on zzso magnetic resonance images were correlated with zzso outcomes in 74 patients undergoing zzso cervical surgery for zzso zzso The zzso area of the spinal zzso on zzso images at the level of maximum zzso was closely correlated with the severity of zzso duration of disease, and recovery rate as determined by the Japanese zzso Association zzso In patients with zzso of the zzso zzso ligament or cervical zzso zzso the increased zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging signal at the site of zzso zzso zzso and duration of disease significantly influenced the rate of zzso A multiple zzso equation was then developed with these three variables to predict surgical zzso
