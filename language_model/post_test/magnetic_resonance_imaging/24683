zzso stroke carries a major risk of stroke zzso which can be markedly reduced by early initiation of appropriate secondary zzso We investigate whether combined examination of the heart, zzso and zzso arteries with zzso zzso zzso may improve the diagnosis of stroke zzso 

Patients with suspected zzso zzso stroke or transient zzso attack zzso zzso zzso mean age 60 zzso 10 years; 95 zzso underwent zzso and standard zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso were excluded because cardiac imaging will not affect to zzso zzso Imaging findings with a potential zzso source were zzso zzso and cardiac risk findings were evaluated zzso Consensus reading of 2 experts using the findings of both approaches and zzso by cardiac zzso when needed served as the reference zzso 

In 101 patients zzso the clinical diagnosis was stroke, and transient zzso attack was confirmed in the remaining zzso Imaging findings associated with highly increased zzso risk were detected in 22 patients zzso Nine high-risk findings in 140 patients were found by zzso and this number rose to 25 high after performing both zzso and zzso No difference was found between zzso and zzso in detecting patients with of at least one high-risk findings zzso 68 zzso zzso p zzso zzso specificity 98 zzso zzso overall accuracy 94 zzso zzso Combined use of zzso and zzso was more sensitive than zzso alone for detecting patients with at least one cardiac or zzso high-risk finding zzso 91 zzso zzso p zzso zzso specificity 98 zzso zzso overall accuracy 97 zzso zzso zzso was insufficient for diagnosing zzso zzso with left zzso aneurysm, whereas the accuracy of zzso was zzso In 9 patients zzso with normal or mild zzso in zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso large enough to indicate zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was not suitable for diagnosing small left zzso zzso patent zzso zzso or to measure left zzso ejection zzso 

zzso and zzso alone show limited accuracy for the zzso of stroke zzso zzso zzso could be a valuable tool in patients with zzso stroke despite standard stroke zzso
