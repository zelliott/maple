zzso zzso Transfer zzso reports on contrast derived from the exchange of zzso between zzso groups and zzso zzso zzso contrast is zzso by asymmetry analysis, providing an ensemble contrast of both zzso zzso concentration and exchange zzso An alternative is to sample the zzso spectrum and fit an exchange model, permitting the zzso effect to be zzso correcting automatically for zzso effects of zzso field zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, it should permit zzso concentration and exchange rate to be independently zzso Here, a zzso method is applied to this problem allowing pertinent prior information to be zzso A zzso model was used incorporating water zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer zzso The method is demonstrated in simulations, zzso zzso with varying pH and in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso approach was able to zzso the zzso effect accurately zzso error zzso zzso even when subject to zzso field variation and zzso transfer effect, unlike traditional asymmetry zzso The in zzso results gave approximate zzso concentration zzso to water) and exchange rate values of 3 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso A degree of correlation was observed between these zzso making the latter difficult to zzso with absolute zzso suggesting that more optimal sampling strategies might be zzso
