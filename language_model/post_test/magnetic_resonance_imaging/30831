Evidence from previous zzso magnetic resonance studies has revealed that patients with chronic zzso lobe zzso show zzso of distinct zzso zzso predominantly zzso to the focus zzso We were interested to find out if there is also selective zzso zzso in patients suffering from long standing zzso lobe zzso 

Thirty one patients in whom zzso evaluation zzso zzso an zzso focus were included in this zzso Using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging, the volumes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured zzso in both zzso and compared with zzso obtained in 15 healthy zzso 

No significant difference in volumes was found between the two subject groups, or in any zzso of zzso lobe zzso patients, nor was there any relation to clinical variables such as age of zzso overall seizure frequency, or disease zzso However, patients who had no or only rare zzso zzso zzso seemed to differ from the other patients and controls in that they had smaller zzso volumes zzso zzso 

We concluded that zzso lobe zzso in general is not associated with diminished volumes in the studied zzso structures, which contrasts with findings in zzso lobe zzso zzso Thus, both entities differ both zzso and zzso However, we found that small zzso volume was zzso associated with absent or rare zzso zzso seizures, implicating the zzso in the control of the most disabling seizure type, independent of the site of zzso zzso
