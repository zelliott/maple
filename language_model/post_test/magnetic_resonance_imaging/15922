zzso zzso zzso may provide unique information about the cellular and zzso integrity of the zzso The zzso of tissue sodium concentration from zzso images with zzso echo time zzso requires knowledge of zzso parameters that influence the zzso sodium signal such as zzso zzso relaxation zzso We report the sodium zzso long component of the effective zzso relaxation time zzso (*) values obtained at 7 T in several brain regions from six healthy zzso A zzso protocol based on a zzso sequence zzso for the least error per given imaging time was used zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 times; pulse repetition time zzso 130 zzso The results reveal that long zzso component of tissue sodium zzso zzso standard zzso varied between zzso fluid (54 zzso 4 zzso and gray zzso zzso 2 zzso and white (29 zzso 2 zzso matter zzso The results also show that the long zzso component increases as a function of the main zzso field zzso indicating that correlation time of sodium zzso motion is smaller than the zzso defined by the zzso zzso These results are a prerequisite for the zzso of tissue sodium concentration from zzso zzso scans with zzso echo time, will contribute to the design of future zzso (such as zzso zzso and themselves may be of clinical zzso
