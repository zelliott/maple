Recently, a new zzso map of the human inferior zzso zzso zzso has been proposed, with the zzso consisting of seven zzso distinct areas zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the different aspects of zzso of these zzso zzso As one aspect of zzso we zzso the topographical relationship between the zzso of the borders of the areas and zzso zzso Although five areas occupy the surface zzso zzso and two the angular zzso their borders cannot be reliably detected by means of zzso To account for zzso in size and extent of the areas in zzso space, zzso zzso maps have been calculated for each zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences have been investigated on basis of volumes of zzso zzso For one of them, area zzso a significant gender difference in volume was found with males having larger volumes than zzso this difference exceeds that of gender differences in total brain zzso The different aspects of zzso and zzso asymmetry may zzso some of the well-known functional zzso in the zzso observed, for example during zzso experiments zzso spatial attention or motor attention, and zzso The zzso zzso maps of the seven zzso areas provide a robust anatomical reference and open new perspectives for further zzso investigations of the human zzso
