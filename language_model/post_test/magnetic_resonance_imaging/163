To evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso during zzso surgery of zzso zzso 

Fifty-five zzso surgeries were performed for zzso zzso zzso Grade zzso zzso All of the surgical processes were guided by real-time updated contrast zzso zzso and zzso images, which were acquired with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Louisville, zzso The definitive benefits as well as major drawbacks of zzso zzso in zzso surgery were assessed with respect to zzso imaging, tumor zzso control, comparison with early zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and follow-up zzso 

zzso imaging revealed residual tumor and guided extended tumor zzso in 17 of 55 zzso As a result, the percentage of gross total removal of zzso increased from zzso to zzso The accuracy of imaging evaluation of zzso zzso was zzso compared with early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A significantly lower accuracy was identified with zzso zzso in 6 cases with cavernous zzso invasion zzso in contrast to the zzso found with other sites zzso exact test, P zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso navigation system is a promising tool for safe, minimally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It enables zzso to control the extent of tumor zzso particularly for zzso tumors, ensuring surgical accuracy and safety, and leading to a decreased likelihood of repeat zzso However, this technology is still not satisfying in zzso the amount of the zzso residual tumor invading into cavernous zzso given the false or uncertain images generated by zzso zzso in this region, which are difficult to discriminate between tumor remnant and blood within the zzso zzso
