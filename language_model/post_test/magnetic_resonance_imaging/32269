The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of endurance training on the early zzso global and regional left zzso zzso relaxation with three magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Fourteen subjects were examined with zzso before and after zzso endurance zzso Global early zzso zzso zzso relaxation was assessed with zzso flow zzso mapping and regional zzso early zzso relaxation with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volumes and mass were assessed with zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso flow zzso mapping analysis revealed that the time to peak early filling shortened after training zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso indicating more rapid global early zzso zzso zzso mass increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso According to zzso tagging analysis early zzso relaxation in the zzso and in the zzso lateral wall increased zzso Regional tagging analysis showed enhanced zzso relaxation in the zzso zzso zzso Global and regional zzso early zzso relaxation improved and zzso zzso zzso was found after the exercise training period for 3 months in healthy sedentary zzso
