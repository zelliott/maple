Upper airway zzso may be influenced by both muscular and zzso zzso Because zzso blood volume (and therefore vascular zzso is an important zzso of zzso airway zzso vascular tone may be an important zzso zzso of zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested in two experimental zzso First, upper airway closing zzso and opening zzso pressures and zzso compliance were measured in nine zzso zzso paralyzed cats with isolated upper zzso zzso tone was decreased with either zzso or sodium zzso zzso and increased with zzso zzso whereas blood pressure and zzso CO2 were maintained zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso In contrast, zzso tended to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso Thus, zzso increased and zzso tended to decrease upper airway zzso Upper airway zzso compliance was unchanged during either drug zzso In order to assess changes in zzso zzso area zzso that occurred during zzso magnetic resonance imaging was zzso in seven zzso During zzso with zzso zzso zzso was reduced from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso and zzso volume was reduced from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
