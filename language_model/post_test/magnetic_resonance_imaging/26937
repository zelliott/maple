Three years ago zzso guidelines were published referring management and follow-up of low risk zzso cancer zzso The aim of this paper is to zzso the changes and new directions in this zzso High risk patients require another zzso Neck ultrasound plays important role in differential diagnosis and in detecting zzso Some new ultrasound techniques are discussed, zzso zzso can help to solve the problem of patients having negative scan and increased zzso zzso In recent years there was an expansion of our knowledge about the zzso of zzso zzso It appears that genetic zzso frequently play a key role in zzso There are molecular methods that allow the detection of these genetic events in zzso fine needle aspirations samples providing important information for diagnosis, management and zzso Instead of diagnostic whole body scanning the zzso scan became preferable but in high risk cases the diagnostic whole body zzso serve useful zzso zzso therapy of zzso cancer is an adequate zzso total zzso and, if necessary, zzso zzso dissection or limited surgery in selected zzso Nowadays zzso surgery can help to improve the zzso zzso therapy zzso rest zzso proved to be a safe and effective method to complete zzso It can prevent relapses and results in longer zzso zzso hormone withdrawal or zzso human zzso stimulation can increase zzso level before zzso zzso These two methods have similar success rate of rest zzso but zzso burden of blood is lower in the case of zzso stimulation which avoids zzso state and preserves quality of zzso Since tumor cells fail to maintain the ability to perform zzso functions they undergo zzso zzso an important aim is to reactivate some function of differentiated cells, zzso zzso zzso production of zzso and zzso Opportunities for this therapeutic effort are also zzso Restoration of zzso zzso enables zzso zzso Until now there has been little interest in the development of new drugs for the treatment of zzso zzso However, advances in our understanding of tumor cell biology will lead to a paradigm shift in the therapy that is likely to benefit patients who have high risk disease and who do not almost have any therapeutic zzso There are new drugs in clinical trials that appear to be more effective than earlier zzso zzso Probably modern chemotherapy of advanced zzso cancer will have significant results in the near zzso
