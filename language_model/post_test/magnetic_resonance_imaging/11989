Fifty volunteers were studied by means of MR zzso of the zzso vessels, with a zzso T zzso zzso The technical features of the most employed MR zzso techniques were zzso The inflow technique was tested with refocused zzso sequences for the zzso zzso flow and a dedicate zzso The study was aimed at evaluating the resolution power of each technique and at identifying the most useful zzso and angles for each chosen zzso The acquisition volume of the zzso sequence was positioned on the zzso plane with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was set at zzso zzso TE at 10 zzso and flip angle was 15 zzso A 256 zzso 256 zzso was used, and an zzso acquisition volume, with 64 zzso The chosen images were rotated on the zzso and zzso planes 0 zzso zzso The results showed that both rotation planes and their relative angles allow the zzso of all the zzso To reduce zzso time, with immediate availability of computer keyboard, a zzso is suggested with 0 zzso degrees zzso on the zzso plane, with 15 degrees zzso and 0 zzso degrees zzso on the zzso plane, with 15 degrees zzso The main limitation of this method is its spatial resolution, which was zzso zzso in zzso and acquisitions on the zzso plane and 1 zzso in acquisitions on the zzso plane rotated on the zzso zzso
