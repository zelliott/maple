The synchronized zzso of zzso channels generates long-range electrical signals that can be detected on the surface using zzso and zzso We propose that the spatial and zzso properties of these signals during rhythmic activity are associated with the zzso attributes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso present a phase relationship with the open probability of the channels that drives the rhythm, zzso The zzso preferences of the zzso zzso spectral zzso determined by the location probability zzso of the zzso In order to test and apply the hypothesis, it is suggested to correlate open and location probabilities with changes in the structure and dynamic of water zzso water zzso and pH using novel zzso
