Data may now be recorded zzso from zzso and functional zzso using the zzso Imaging for zzso zzso zzso zzso As yet, there is no established means to integrate the analysis of the combined data zzso Recognizing that the zzso zzso zzso zzso spectrum, zzso is zzso zzso in space, frequency, and time motivated us to use zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to decompose zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data uniquely as a sum of zzso Each zzso atom is the outer product of zzso zzso and zzso signatures and each zzso atom the product of spatial and zzso zzso The decomposition was constrained to maximize the zzso between corresponding zzso signatures of the zzso and zzso On all data sets, three components whose spectral zzso were in the zzso zzso and gamma bands zzso only the alpha atom had a significant zzso correlation with the zzso zzso The spatial distribution of the zzso atom included zzso cortex, thalamus, and zzso and corresponded closely to that reported by Goldman et zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso using a more conventional zzso The source reconstruction from zzso spatial signature showed only the zzso zzso We interpret these results to indicate that some electrical sources may be zzso invisible to scalp zzso yet may be revealed through zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso These results may also expose brain regions that participate in the control of brain rhythms but may not themselves be zzso As of yet, no single zzso method offers the optimal combination of spatial and zzso zzso fusing zzso and zzso zzso extends the zzso resolution and sensitivity of each zzso
