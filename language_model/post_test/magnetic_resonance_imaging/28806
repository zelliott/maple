zzso retrograde zzso with no or almost no zzso zzso is zzso Recently, a combination of zzso prefrontal and zzso cortical zzso has been suggested as the cause of such isolated or focal retrograde zzso It is also assumed that when the zzso cortical structures are damaged, autobiographical episodic memories are zzso 

To search for new zzso zzso for focal retrograde zzso 

We performed extensive zzso tests and obtained detailed zzso on a 43-year-old woman who showed a zzso persistent retrograde zzso but only a limited zzso zzso after probable zzso zzso zzso 

Tests of autobiographical memory revealed that she had a memory loss extending back to her childhood for both zzso and zzso however, the ability to recall specific episodes appeared much more severely impaired than the ability to recall factual information about her zzso The patient also showed profound zzso in recalling public zzso however, her scores improved nearly to a control level on zzso recognition memory tasks, although the recall of memories for a decade just before her illness remained mildly zzso zzso revealed focal zzso in the zzso poles and the anterior parts of the zzso zzso on both sides, predominantly on the left, with some extension to the anterior parts of the zzso zzso zzso There was additional damage to the left insular zzso and its surrounding structures but no evidence of frontal lobe damage on zzso or cognitive zzso 

A profound retrograde zzso may be produced by damage to the bilateral zzso poles and anterior zzso zzso in the absence of frontal lobe zzso and a dense and persistent episodic old memory loss can arise even with a relatively small zzso in the right anterior zzso lobe if it is combined with extensive damage to the zzso
