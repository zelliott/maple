zzso of the zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal zzso zzso in the visual zzso were studied at varying levels of zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso appeared after positive zzso response zzso under control zzso zzso blood volume zzso as determined with zzso zzso increased by zzso during the positive zzso peak, but the zzso proceeded at baseline level during the zzso zzso zzso zzso hypoxic zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso had no effect on the zzso or duration of zzso zzso in activated zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso during the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the positive zzso signal at the level of all activated zzso was smaller in zzso than in zzso The present results show that the zzso zzso zzso is not influenced by curtailed oxygen availability and that, during the zzso zzso is not different from resting zzso
