Recent studies have used zzso signals from early visual areas to reconstruct simple geometric zzso Here, we demonstrate a new zzso decoder that uses zzso signals from early and anterior visual areas to reconstruct complex natural zzso Our decoder combines three zzso a structural zzso model that characterizes responses in early visual areas, a semantic zzso model that characterizes responses in anterior visual areas, and prior information about the structure and semantic content of natural zzso By combining all these zzso the decoder produces reconstructions that accurately reflect both the spatial structure and semantic category of the objects contained in the observed natural zzso Our results show that prior information has a substantial effect on the quality of natural image zzso We also demonstrate that much of the zzso in the responses of anterior visual areas to complex natural images is explained by the semantic category of the image zzso
