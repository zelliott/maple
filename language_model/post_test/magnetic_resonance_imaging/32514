To build up zzso between sentences zzso zzso we must draw zzso zzso activate and integrate information that is not actually zzso We used zzso zzso to determine the zzso and extent of brain activity zzso zzso zzso across short, three-sentence zzso Participants read and made zzso zzso judgments to sentences that were highly zzso zzso zzso related or unrelated to their preceding zzso zzso The highly related and zzso related scenarios were matched in terms of semantic similarities between their individual component zzso A zzso study established that zzso zzso were generated to the zzso related but not to the highly related or unrelated zzso In the zzso sentences that were zzso related zzso to highly related or zzso to their preceding contexts were associated with longer judgment reaction times and sustained increases in zzso activity within left lateral zzso zzso zzso the right inferior prefrontal zzso and bilateral superior zzso prefrontal zzso In contrast, sentences that were unrelated zzso to highly zzso to their preceding contexts were associated with only transient increases in activity zzso but not after, the peak of the zzso zzso within the right lateral zzso zzso and the right inferior prefrontal zzso These data suggest that, to make sense of zzso we activate a large bilateral cortical network in response to what is not explicitly zzso We suggest that this network reflects the zzso retrieval and integration of information from long-term semantic memory into incoming discourse structure during zzso zzso
