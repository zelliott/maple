The distribution and extent of traumatic zzso were zzso evaluated with MR imaging in 40 patients with closed head zzso zzso zzso zzso were classified according to their distinctive topographical distribution within the brain and were of four main zzso zzso diffuse zzso injury zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injury zzso and zzso primary zzso injury zzso zzso zzso injury most commonly involved the white matter of the frontal and zzso zzso the body and zzso of the corpus zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso most frequently involved the inferior, zzso and anterior aspects of the frontal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were most commonly seen in the zzso aspects of the zzso zzso The pattern and distribution of primary zzso seen by MR were compared with those expected from previous zzso studies and found to be quite zzso Our data and review of the literature would also indicate that MR detects a more complete spectrum of traumatic zzso than does zzso Secondary forms of injury zzso zzso zzso pressure necrosis from increased zzso pressure, cerebral zzso secondary zzso zzso were also visible by MR in some zzso The level of consciousness was most impaired in patients with primary zzso injury, followed by those with widespread diffuse zzso injury and zzso zzso zzso The best MR imaging planes, pulse zzso and imaging strategies for evaluating and zzso traumatic zzso were zzso and the mechanisms by which traumatic stresses result in injury were zzso MR was found to be superior to CT and to be very effective in the detection of traumatic head zzso and some secondary forms of zzso While zzso images were most useful for zzso zzso zzso images proved to be most useful for zzso zzso and zzso
