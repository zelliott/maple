The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of prostate cancer zzso with simple visual diagnostic criteria using dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso A total of 46 consecutive patients with zzso prostate cancer underwent prostate zzso T zzso with pelvic zzso coils before zzso Besides the usual zzso zzso a zzso zzso sequence was acquired three times after zzso zzso On zzso images, all early enhancing zzso of the peripheral zone were considered zzso In the central zzso only early enhancing zzso appearing homogeneous or invading the peripheral zone were considered zzso Three readers specified the presence of cancer in 20 prostate sectors and the location of distinct zzso zzso were compared with zzso p zzso zzso was considered zzso For zzso of cancer in the sectors, zzso imaging had a significantly higher sensitivity zzso regression, odds ratio zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a slightly but significantly lower specificity zzso zzso p zzso zzso Of the tumors zzso zzso zzso and zzso were correctly depicted with zzso and zzso imaging, zzso For both techniques, the depiction rate of tumors zzso zzso was significantly influenced by the zzso score (most zzso zzso tumors were zzso but not by the tumor zzso 

zzso using pelvic zzso coils and simple visual diagnostic criteria is more sensitive for tumor zzso than zzso zzso
