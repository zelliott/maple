To evaluate the imaging appearance of the zzso in the zzso patients by using chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging, and, to correlate the chemical shift ratio zzso with zzso findings after surgical zzso 

In the past year, a total of 11 zzso patients (4 zzso 7 zzso age range of zzso zzso have been investigated by zzso centered at the zzso zzso Our protocol included a zzso technique, zzso zzso MR images in all zzso A chemical shift ratio zzso was calculated by comparing the signal intensity of the zzso zzso with that of the chest wall muscle for quantitative zzso For this purpose, we have used standard zzso electronic zzso at a slice level of the maximum zzso surface of the zzso We have identified two patients groups: a zzso zzso group and a zzso zzso zzso 

With the decrease in the signal intensity of the zzso zzso at chemical shift, the MR imaging was evident only in the zzso zzso The mean zzso in the zzso group was considerably lower than that in the tumor group, zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso between the zzso and tumor groups was statistically significant zzso 

MR imaging using zzso zzso images could be a useful diagnostic tool in the zzso assessment of the zzso lodge and may help differentiate zzso zzso from tumors of the zzso zzso
