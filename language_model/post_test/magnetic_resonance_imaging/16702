Over 75,000 patients have undergone deep brain stimulation zzso procedures zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is an important clinical and research tool in analyzing zzso location, documenting zzso zzso and investigating novel symptoms in zzso zzso zzso zzso may shed light on the mechanism of action of zzso zzso safety in zzso patients is therefore an important zzso 

We report our experience with zzso in patients with implanted zzso hardware and examine the literature for clinical reports on zzso safety with implanted zzso zzso 

A total of 262 zzso examinations were performed in 223 patients with zzso zzso hardware, including 45 in patients with an implanted pulse zzso Only 1 temporary adverse event occurred related to patient agitation and movement during immediate zzso MR zzso zzso resolved after a few hours, and an zzso obtained before implanted pulse generator zzso revealed zzso around both zzso Over zzso zzso examinations in patients with implanted zzso hardware have been reported in the zzso Only 4 led to adverse events, including 2 hardware failures, 1 temporary and 1 permanent neurological zzso zzso neurological events occurred in a unique set of circumstances where appropriate safety protocols were not zzso zzso guidelines provided by zzso hardware manufacturers are inconsistent and vary among zzso 

The importance of zzso in modern medicine places pressure on industry to develop fully zzso zzso zzso Until then, the literature suggests that, when observing certain zzso zzso MR images can be obtained with an extremely low risk in patients with implanted zzso zzso
