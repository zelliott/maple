zzso zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by visceral zzso possibly related to abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging has suggested specific central nervous system zzso abnormalities in visceral pain processing in zzso This study aimed to determine zzso if functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso detects zzso activity during painful and zzso visceral zzso and zzso if zzso pain centers in zzso respond zzso 

zzso was performed during zzso and painful zzso zzso in 18 patients with zzso and 16 zzso 

zzso stimulation increased the activity of anterior zzso zzso prefrontal zzso insular zzso zzso and zzso zzso in most zzso In zzso subjects, but not controls, pain led to greater zzso of the anterior zzso zzso zzso than did zzso zzso zzso patients had a greater number of zzso activated in the zzso and reported greater intensity of pain at zzso zzso zzso than zzso 

zzso patients activate the zzso a critical zzso pain center, to a greater extent than controls in response to a painful zzso zzso zzso to previous reports, these data suggest heightened pain sensitivity of the zzso axis in zzso with a normal pattern of zzso
