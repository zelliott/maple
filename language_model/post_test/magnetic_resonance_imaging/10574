To zzso evaluate whether the zzso of zzso features and the diagnostic criteria that have been established for breast magnetic resonance zzso imaging in female patients may be used for differential diagnosis with breast MR imaging in male patients as zzso 

The study design was approved by the institutional review board; all patients gave informed zzso The Institutional Review Board and informed consent information applied to the prospective and any retrospective component of the zzso zzso consecutive male patients zzso age, 53 years zzso zzso were referred for imaging of a palpable breast zzso In addition to zzso and zzso breast zzso patients underwent dynamic breast MR imaging in a prone position with a dedicated zzso surface zzso The standardized protocol consisted of a zzso zzso zzso sequence followed by a dynamic zzso zzso were recorded by using the zzso and zzso and by evaluating the diagnostic criteria zzso to zzso and enhancement zzso that have been developed for breast MR imaging in female zzso zzso was achieved at biopsy zzso zzso or follow-up with clinical examination and conventional imaging zzso zzso Because of the small size of the patient zzso statistical significance was not zzso 

A total of 24 breast abnormalities were zzso Three patients had invasive breast cancer (five zzso 11 had zzso (six zzso five zzso two had zzso and one had a benign solid tumor zzso All zzso tumors appeared as irregular masses with zzso internal architecture or rim enhancement and showed rapid initial enhancement zzso value, zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso time course zzso Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso category zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed slow initial and persistent enhancement with zzso zzso architecture zzso category 2; 15 of 16 breasts in 10 of 11 zzso In one patient with zzso bilateral zzso an area with zzso enhancement was classified as suspicious for zzso zzso in zzso zzso did not enhance at zzso The zzso showed benign zzso features and slow initial and persistent enhancement zzso category zzso 

In the small study zzso the MR imaging features of benign breast diseases and breast zzso in male patients seemed to be comparable to those seen in female zzso
