zzso transmission has the potential to improve many aspects of zzso through a new paradigm in zzso In this study, zzso transmission is used to address the effects that variations in zzso zzso have on zzso preparation through the use of the frequency, phase, and zzso degrees of freedom afforded by independent transmission zzso zzso zzso is zzso included via use of zzso sensitivities in zzso A new method, parallel zzso for zzso insensitive zzso preparation, can achieve fat zzso in zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso 4 zzso zzso variation, where traditional zzso methods achieve only zzso in the same zzso While there has been much progress to apply zzso transmission at high field strengths, particular focus is given here to application of these methods at zzso zzso
