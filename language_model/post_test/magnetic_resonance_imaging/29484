A new zzso zzso zzso block method has the patient zzso with an zzso zzso The target is any of the three cords behind the zzso minor zzso The point of needle zzso is the intersection between the zzso and the zzso zzso The needle is advanced 0 degrees zzso degrees zzso always strictly in the zzso plane next to the zzso process while abutting the zzso edge of the zzso We tested the new method using magnetic resonance imaging zzso in 20 adult volunteers, without inserting a zzso Combining 2 simulated needle directions by 15 degrees zzso and 0 degrees in the images of the volunteers, at least one zzso in 19 of 20 volunteers was zzso This occurred within a needle depth of zzso zzso In the zzso plane of the method the shortest depth to the zzso among all volunteers was zzso zzso The zzso study indicates that the new zzso technique may be efficient in reaching a zzso of the zzso zzso often not demanding more than two needle zzso The risk of zzso should be minimal because the needle is inserted no deeper than zzso zzso However, this needs to be confirmed by a clinical zzso 

A new zzso zzso zzso block method was investigated using magnetic resonance imaging without inserting needles in the zzso The study suggests two needle directions for performance of the block and that the risk of lung injury should be zzso Expectations need to be confirmed by a clinical zzso
