We assessed errors in cerebral blood flow zzso obtained from our proposed zzso method without using zzso input function zzso zzso in dynamic zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We calculated zzso and the zzso zzso ratio zzso using zzso simulation and 3 zzso methods and a zzso method of zzso singular value decomposition zzso We compared errors with and without simulated noise as parameters of mean transit time zzso zzso delay and zzso resolution, and clinical zzso zzso 

The errors in zzso obtained using maximum zzso zzso were smallest among the zzso methods and almost equivalent to errors in the zzso method under practical imaging zzso In addition, errors in the zzso obtained using zzso US zzso referring to white matter were zzso even compared to all errors in zzso and zzso The zzso method introduced less error than the zzso method, especially at low flow rates, was further robust against zzso noise and coarse zzso resolution, and was comparably robust against transit zzso In zzso correlations between absolute value maps for US and for zzso in clinical zzso those correlation zzso zzso between the 2 maps were stable, r zzso zzso despite variation in the slopes of the linear zzso line, so the 2 zzso maps were visually well correlated in any zzso 

The zzso technique without zzso measurement can become a practical zzso methodology for zzso in patients even with acute stroke because it balances zzso with systematic and random errors and it is simply zzso
