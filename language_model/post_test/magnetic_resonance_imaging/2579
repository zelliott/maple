To study the potential impact of the combined use of CT and zzso scans on the Gross zzso Volume zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Four observers outlined the zzso in six patients with advanced head and neck cancer on CT, zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso The zzso scans were subsequently matched to the CT zzso The zzso and zzso set variation were assessed in three zzso 

The mean CT derived volume was a factor of zzso larger than the mean zzso zzso zzso The range in volumes was larger for the CT than for the zzso zzso volumes in five of the six zzso The ratio of the scan set common zzso the volume common to all zzso and the scan set encompassing volume zzso the smallest volume encompassing all zzso was closer to one in zzso zzso than in CT zzso The rest volumes zzso the volume defined by one observer as zzso in one data set but not in the other data zzso were never zero for CT zzso zzso nor for zzso zzso zzso In two cases the zzso border was poorly recognized on the zzso zzso but could be delineated with a good agreement between the observers in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are smaller and have less zzso variation than zzso zzso CT and zzso are complementary in zzso the zzso A zzso or zzso zzso adds to a better zzso definition in the zzso zzso
