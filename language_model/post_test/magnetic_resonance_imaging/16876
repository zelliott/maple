zzso zzso pulmonary disease zzso is often associated with changes of the structure and the function of the right zzso zzso zzso the assessment of right zzso function and zzso mass zzso is clinically important for the evaluation of the severity of zzso which may provide an objective basis for therapeutic zzso 

To assess the right zzso function and RV zzso in patients with mild to severe COPD using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

We zzso studied 49 COPD patients determined by the pulmonary function test zzso Using the Global Initiative for COPD zzso the COPD patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of the disease: group I zzso mild zzso zzso zzso group II zzso moderate zzso zzso zzso and group III zzso severe zzso zzso zzso The patient groups were compared to a control group consisting of 30 zzso healthy, zzso zzso The RV function and RV zzso were obtained by zzso cardiac zzso in all of the four zzso The results were compared among the four groups using the zzso zzso correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between the right zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso with the zzso results in COPD zzso 

The zzso was significantly lower in group III than in the other groups zzso zzso zzso The RV zzso differed significantly among all groups zzso zzso zzso and gradually increased with the severity of COPD zzso zzso zzso The correlation was significant between the zzso results and forced zzso volume in 1 s zzso zzso zzso for zzso r zzso zzso for RV zzso in COPD zzso 

The zzso and RV zzso measured by zzso correlate significantly with the severity of disease as determined by zzso in patients with zzso
