Sixteen healthy volunteers zzso zzso aged between 18 and 50 years received two zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso or zzso separated by 30 zzso on separate days according to a zzso zzso crossover zzso Volunteers performed an zzso working memory task and a spatial paired associates learning task while being scanned using a zzso zzso 

zzso activity changes in zzso networks and performance were zzso No zzso changes in brain activity were found in these zzso zzso liberal zzso analyses showed activity changes in areas outside task networks, like the lateral zzso zzso 

Clear effects of zzso on working memory could not be zzso Future studies should use higher doses and explore the role of zzso in visual information zzso
