An zzso model for the study of drug interactions with solid zzso is zzso It is based on the use of packed cells in a simple zzso The system is capable of dealing with cellular zzso at a molecular level through experiments conducted in a homogeneous field by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, through a simple imaging technique, it is also possible to introduce a spatial element into the chemistry of the packed zzso The use of these complementary zzso methods are illustrated by the action of the zzso agent zzso on cellular zzso A pattern of signals observed in a homogeneous field experiment following zzso stress are duplicated in the imaging experiment to illustrate the zzso ability to penetrate the model zzso
