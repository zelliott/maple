zzso zzso study has opened an avenue for exploring the zzso of cluster headache zzso The aim of our study was to assess the changes in brain activity in zzso patients by the regional zzso method using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained for 12 male zzso patients with spontaneous zzso headache attacks during zzso zzso and zzso of zzso periods and 12 zzso and zzso normal zzso The data were analyzed to detect the altered brain activity by the regional zzso method using statistical zzso mapping zzso 

zzso regional zzso was detected in the anterior zzso cortex, the zzso zzso cortex, the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and other brain regions involved in pain processing and zzso among different zzso 

It is referred that these brain regions with altered regional zzso might be related to the pain processing and zzso of zzso
