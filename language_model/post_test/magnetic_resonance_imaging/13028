zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso a zzso expressed on cells of the zzso zzso A phase 2 clinical trial recently provided strong evidence of the beneficial effects of zzso in patients with zzso multiple zzso We and other investigators previously demonstrated that zzso therapy zzso B zzso from peripheral blood and zzso fluid of patients with zzso multiple zzso 

To determine the effect of zzso on the presence of B cells in cerebral zzso zzso Design, zzso and Patients Case report from a zzso academic medical zzso zzso white matter from autopsy material of a patient with gastrointestinal zzso zzso who developed progressive zzso zzso following zzso therapy was evaluated by zzso zzso brain sections of patients with multiple sclerosis not treated with zzso patients without central nervous system disease, and patients with progressive zzso zzso not associated with zzso were used as zzso 

Assessment of the number of B zzso in cerebral zzso spaces in a patient with gastrointestinal zzso zzso treated with zzso patients with multiple zzso patients with progressive zzso zzso not associated with zzso and healthy control zzso 

We were unable to detect B cells in cerebral zzso spaces of the patient who developed progressive zzso zzso following zzso therapy 8 months after her last zzso In contrast, B cells were zzso in all control brain zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first report to show zzso depletion from brain tissue following zzso zzso A reduction in zzso numbers may be an important contributing factor in the zzso of central nervous system zzso
