The goal of our study was to: determine the zzso of zzso zzso in a cohort of children and young adults with zzso and analyze the magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of zzso zzso zzso including their contrast behavior and diffusion zzso 

zzso studies of 27 zzso patients zzso age, zzso zzso were evaluated for: zzso zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso and giant cell zzso Patients with zzso involvement were further analyzed for the imaging and diffusion zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were performed and compared with the zzso normal appearing zzso The clinical charts were revisited for symptoms suggesting zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were seen in zzso patients, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso appearance with a broad base reaching the zzso The majority of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso contrast zzso All zzso zzso had increased zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the patients had zzso zzso zzso 

zzso percent of zzso patients had zzso zzso most of them being zzso zzso zzso zzso differ from zzso zzso both concerning shape and contrast zzso The exact zzso of contrast enhancement remains zzso Future studies have to determine the impact of zzso zzso on zzso zzso
