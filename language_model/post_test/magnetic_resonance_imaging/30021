Our previous zzso studies have consistently demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso by zzso information in visual zzso matching task represents a type of conflict process, which is distinct from that represented by the classic conflict task or other negative components in delayed zzso stimulus presentation patterns, since the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was presented as shorter as 500 zzso The zzso component of zzso was shown to reflect conflict processing during the simple working memory zzso In the present study, a functional zzso zzso was used to investigate the zzso characteristics of brain zzso associated with the task zzso zzso The zzso data showed an increased zzso in the right anterior zzso zzso zzso BA 24) and right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso BA zzso and zzso biased to the left zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It is suggested that the greater zzso of the right zzso zzso with right zzso to zzso task reflect functional efficiency of the right zzso network during the brief visual delayed period discrimination performance and mismatched information zzso
