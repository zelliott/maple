The load theory of selective attention zzso that zzso interference is suppressed after zzso processing zzso in the later stage of central zzso at low zzso load of the central task, but in the early stage of zzso processing at high zzso zzso zzso studies on the neural zzso of attention have found a smaller zzso zzso in the sensory zzso at high relative to low zzso zzso However, it is not clear whether the zzso zzso in brain regions linked to later stages of central processing zzso in the zzso zzso is also smaller at high rather than low zzso load, as might be predicted based on the load zzso 

We studied 24 healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during a visual target identification task with two zzso loads zzso zzso zzso Participants showed zzso increases in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and lateral prefrontal zzso at low load, but zzso decreases in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso area and zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and extensive sensory zzso at high zzso 

Multiple levels of central processing involving zzso and zzso circuits participate in suppressing zzso interference at either low or high zzso zzso For suppressing zzso zzso the processing of sensory zzso in both early and late stages of central processing are enhanced at low load but inhibited at high zzso
