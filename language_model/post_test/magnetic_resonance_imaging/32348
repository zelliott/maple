We examined the functional organization of cerebral activity in zzso infants when they were listening to their mother zzso Short sentences were presented in a slow zzso functional zzso zzso We then parsed the zzso network of zzso responsive regions into functionally distinct regions based on their speed of zzso and sensitivity to sentence zzso An zzso structure of functional zzso response delays was observed along the superior zzso regions, suggesting a zzso processing zzso The fastest responses were recorded in the vicinity of zzso zzso whereas responses became increasingly slower toward the zzso part of the superior zzso zzso and toward the zzso poles and inferior frontal regions zzso zzso zzso in the latter region increased when the sentence was repeated after a zzso zzso suggesting the early involvement of zzso area in verbal zzso The fact that zzso area is active in infants before the zzso stage implies that activity in this region is not the consequence of sophisticated motor learning but, on the contrary, that this region may drive, through interactions with the zzso system, the learning of the complex motor sequences required for future speech zzso Our results point to a complex, zzso organization of the human brain in the first months of life, which may play a crucial role in language acquisition in our zzso
