To assess the utility of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with clinically suspected zzso pregnancy zzso 

We zzso reviewed zzso of 26 consecutive patients who were clinically suspected of having an zzso The diagnostic utility of zzso features of zzso was analyzed zzso as zzso zzso zzso sign detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signs zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of each sign and their combination was compared to surgical zzso The zzso findings of an zzso zzso were reviewed as zzso size, shape, signal intensity, and enhancement zzso 

Of 26 patients, 24 had a zzso zzso 22 of these 24 patients zzso had a direct sign zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value: zzso The diagnostic accuracy of the direct sign was zzso this was more accurate than that of any single indirect sign zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the diagnostic accuracy of zzso increased to zzso when diagnostic criteria required the presence of a direct sign or at least two indirect zzso 

zzso is an effective zzso for diagnosing zzso with a high detection rate of zzso zzso The combination of direct and indirect signs is useful for establishing the correct zzso
