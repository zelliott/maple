Since tumor volume is recognized as an important predictor of clinical stage and disease outcome of prostate cancer, accurate zzso zzso of tumor volume can play an important role in planning the appropriate treatment and establishing a patient's zzso We performed this study to evaluate the accuracy of the zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso technique for reliable prediction of tumor volume in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging was performed in 57 consecutive men who were suspected to have prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy revealed prostate cancer in 44 zzso The pathological volume of the surgical specimens of 25 selected patients who underwent radical zzso was zzso compared to the volume estimated by zzso zzso MR studies, and the zzso correlation zzso was zzso 

In 15 patients the estimated size of the tumor was within zzso of the true tumor zzso in the remaining 10 cases MR imaging tended to underestimate large tumors and overestimate small zzso A significant correlation between the volumes as determined with MR imaging and zzso of surgical specimens was observed zzso zzso slope zzso To our knowledge, this is the best correlation found between pathological volume and tumor volume as evaluated by any other imaging zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging is a powerful means of evaluating the prostate zzso however, further improvements in imaging and/or volume calculation are required to provide a more accurate zzso assessment of prostate cancer zzso
