zzso (also known as zzso zzso or zzso are a widely acknowledged complication of zzso zzso injections but they are rare following functional zzso zzso zzso 

Our first case features a 45-year-old woman presenting with a zzso swelling two weeks after functional zzso zzso zzso The procedure was complicated by a fractured zzso zzso A zzso packing with zzso zzso was left in zzso Initially, the inflammation was controlled successfully with zzso but the swelling persists to this zzso Our second case is a 45-year-old man who suffered from a zzso swelling of the right zzso after zzso zzso zzso Multiple treatments with oral antibiotics and zzso brought about no zzso zzso surgery was performed and a zzso film was placed between the zzso and the zzso zzso floor but the swelling zzso The patient finally consulted a plastic surgeon as a last resort, but the zzso procedure only exacerbated the clinical zzso In both cases a biopsy was performed which established the foreign body reaction typical of a zzso At present, both patients still suffer from this zzso 

The complete zzso of a zzso is seldom possible because of diffuse zzso and recurrence is very zzso We therefore conclude that zzso zzso should not be used with zzso packing after zzso surgery, especially when there has been a zzso involving the zzso zzso
