zzso disruption of the zzso barrier zzso provides a method for zzso delivery of therapeutic agents to the zzso The apparent global delivery of zzso iron oxide particles to the rat brain after zzso opening as seen on MR images was compared with the cellular and zzso location and distribution of the zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso contrast agents, zzso and zzso were administered zzso in rats at 10 zzso zzso immediately after zzso opening of the zzso with zzso zzso After 2 to 24 hours, iron distribution in the brain was evaluated first with MR imaging then by zzso analysis and electron zzso to assess zzso and zzso zzso 

After zzso zzso MR images showed enhancement throughout the disrupted zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso of the disrupted zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso particles passed the zzso zzso cells but did not cross beyond the basement zzso In contrast, after zzso delivery, iron zzso was detected within cell bodies in the disrupted hemisphere, and the zzso zzso core was detected zzso and zzso in the zzso 

MR images showing homogeneous delivery to the brain at the zzso level did not indicate delivery at the microscopic zzso These data support the presence of a zzso barrier at the zzso zzso analogous to the zzso in the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which may limit the distribution of some proteins and viral particles after zzso delivery to the zzso
