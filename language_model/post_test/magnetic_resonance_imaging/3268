Video capsule zzso zzso has revolutionized small zzso imaging, enabling visual examination of the zzso of the entire small zzso while MR zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso have largely replaced conventional zzso zzso A new indication for zzso and zzso is the clinical suspicion of small zzso zzso as indicated by delayed or zzso of a test capsule given before a zzso examination, to exclude zzso The aim of this study was to determine the clinical value of subsequent zzso and zzso in patients in whom a test capsule did not present itself in due zzso 

Seventy-five consecutive patients were identified with a delayed or unnoticed delivery of the test zzso zzso patients zzso to participate and underwent zzso zzso or zzso zzso The medical records and imaging studies were zzso reviewed and symptoms, laboratory results and imaging findings zzso 

zzso compatible with zzso disease were shown by zzso in 5 patients, by zzso in one and by zzso in four, one of whom had zzso on zzso In patients without alarm symptoms and findings zzso loss, zzso zzso nocturnal zzso zzso zzso zzso and abnormal blood zzso imaging studies did not unveil any such zzso zzso were performed in only 20 patients, mainly younger than 50 years of age, although no zzso zzso was shown by zzso and zzso In the remaining 50 patients no zzso or other zzso intervention was performed indicating that the referring physician was content with the diagnostic information from zzso or zzso 

The diagnostic value of zzso and zzso is sufficient for clinical management of most patients with suspected small zzso disease, and thus zzso may be omitted or at least postponed for later zzso
