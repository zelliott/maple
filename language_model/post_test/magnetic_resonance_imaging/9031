The aim of this study was to establish and compare diagnostic accuracy zzso zzso and diagnostic odds zzso of plain zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in pediatric acute zzso zzso 

Analysis of patients' data, hospitalized at the Department of zzso Surgery with suspected acute zzso zzso in the period of zzso was carried out zzso zzso criteria were age of zzso years, pain in bone area, fever, functional disorder, and zzso signs of zzso Plain zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were zzso The recommendations of zzso for Reporting of zzso zzso were used in study zzso 

A total of 183 patients were included into the zzso Acute zzso zzso was diagnosed in 156 zzso patients, and 27 zzso had other zzso A total of 169 early plain zzso zzso on the first day of hospital zzso 142 late zzso (15th day of hospital zzso 82 zzso zzso zzso 76 bone zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso scans (seventh zzso and 17 CT (15th day) were zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of CT was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of early zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of late zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of bone zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our analysis showed that late zzso is the most valuable zzso method in the diagnosis of acute zzso zzso but bone zzso and magnetic resonance imaging are the most valuable tests at the onset of the zzso
