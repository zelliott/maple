Although a significant number of proteins include bound metals as part of their structure, the identification of zzso acid zzso coordinated to zzso metals by zzso remains a zzso Metal zzso can stabilize the native structure and/or play critical zzso roles in the underlying zzso An zzso chemical shift is exquisitely sensitive to its electronic zzso Chemical shift data can provide valuable insights into structural features, including metal zzso In this study, we demonstrate that overlapped zzso chemical shift zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso are largely resolved by the inclusion of the corresponding zzso chemical shift information, together with secondary structural zzso We demonstrate this with a zzso distribution plot, and statistically with a zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso shift pairs from 79 proteins with known three-dimensional structures, including 86 zzso and zzso shifts for 43 zzso zzso zzso along with corresponding zzso state and secondary structure information, we have built a zzso zzso model that zzso between oxidized zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with a statistical model incorporating all three phenomena resulted in a predictor of zzso zzso with a recall, precision and zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso This model was applied in the analysis of zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in zzso cluster zzso The model predicts that all three zzso of zzso are metal zzso We confirmed these results by zzso examining the effect of metal zzso on the zzso spectrum of zzso and zzso zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso To gain further insight into the frequency of occurrence of zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso Data Bank and found that zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso and zzso (with nearly identical zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso
