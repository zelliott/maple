Cases involving a confirmed tissue diagnosis of PA from zzso were reviewed zzso The authors included only patients with evidence of zzso on zzso zzso and/or magnetic resonance imaging seen prior to biopsy or zzso and in the absence of trauma or other vascular pathological zzso 

In 138 patients with zzso proven zzso the mean age at diagnosis was 23 zzso In 11 patients zzso 5 male and 6 zzso there was evidence of zzso at zzso There were no locations more susceptible to zzso than any other, although no bleeding occurred within the zzso All but 1 patient was treated with a zzso zzso
