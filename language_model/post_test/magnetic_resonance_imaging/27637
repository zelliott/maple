zzso fusion of the zzso zzso is the most prevalent form of zzso Although the typical clinical appearance usually points the way to the right diagnosis, zzso zzso zzso scans are still recommended as necessary tools for both the diagnosis of zzso and the zzso zzso Because CT scans are accompanied by the biological effects of zzso radiation, some authors have already zzso the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso especially because zzso seems to be valuable for detecting zzso anomalies compared with CT zzso zzso we investigated the zzso zzso of 42 children with isolated zzso zzso to evaluate the frequency of brain anomalies and their therapeutic zzso our study, 10 patients zzso showed zzso zzso findings such as zzso zzso and zzso corpus zzso whereas 32 patients zzso had an unremarkable zzso except a zzso secondary deformation of the brain caused by the zzso shaped skull, which was present in all zzso Seven patients showed clinically significant symptoms including zzso or zzso zzso zzso however, the clinical appearance was not zzso for zzso zzso findings and vice zzso the detection of brain anomalies had no influence on the surgical procedure or led to any additive therapy in our patients, we conclude that evaluation of possible zzso brain findings does not legitimate the general use of zzso in clinically normal children with isolated zzso zzso
