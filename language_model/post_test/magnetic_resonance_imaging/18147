zzso level difference zzso is the difference in sound pressure level zzso between the two ears and is one of the key physical cues used by the auditory system in sound zzso Our current understanding of zzso zzso has come primarily from invasive studies of individual structures, which have implicated zzso structures such as the cochlear nucleus zzso superior zzso complex zzso lateral zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso brain imaging enables studying zzso processing in multiple structures zzso 

In this study, blood zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is used for the first time to measure changes in the zzso responses in the adult zzso rat zzso during zzso stimulation with different zzso 

zzso responses are observed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso analysis of the change of the response zzso with zzso indicates statistically significant zzso dependence in zzso zzso zzso and a region containing parts of the zzso and zzso For all three regions, the larger zzso response is located in the zzso zzso from the higher zzso zzso These findings are supported by region of interest zzso zzso shows that zzso dependence occurs in both zzso and multiple zzso levels of the auditory zzso This study is the first step towards future studies examining zzso zzso processing and sound zzso in animal models of zzso
