The aim of this study was to investigate the value of magnetic resonance imaging after zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resonance images were obtained before and 12 months after unilateral zzso without disk zzso zzso resonance findings at follow-up were correlated to residual zzso At the zzso 20 of 28 patients were free of pain in the joint that had been surgically treated, four patients had mild pain, and four patients had significant residual zzso The magnetic resonance images at follow-up showed that the joint space was filled with soft tissue after zzso In patients without pain at zzso this soft tissue had a magnetic resonance signal that was equal or higher than that of the zzso In the four patients with significant residual pain and in one patient with mild residual pain, the soft tissue in the joint space between the zzso and zzso zzso had a magnetic resonance signal intensity that was lower than the zzso On the basis of findings in a previous study, the areas of low signal intensity were interpreted as zzso zzso The study suggests that areas of low signal intensity in the joint space appear to be associated with residual pain and that magnetic resonance imaging could be a valuable tool for assessment of the zzso joint after zzso
