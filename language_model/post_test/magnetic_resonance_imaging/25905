zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent approximately zzso of all zzso zzso zzso serum levels of intact zzso or their free zzso and zzso have been demonstrated in patients with such tumors, and isolated zzso of zzso has been reported to occur in zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to decrease zzso zzso levels in cultured zzso cells in zzso and zzso receptors have been identified on the cell zzso of these zzso zzso therefore, investigated the effect of chronic zzso analog administration on hormone production and tumor size in six patients with zzso zzso and elevated serum zzso zzso Patients initially received native zzso as an zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso followed by a constant infusion of 2 zzso over 4 zzso and serum zzso zzso were measured at zzso intervals after baseline sampling for a total of 9 zzso Patients then received a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso twice daily, zzso for 8 zzso zzso zzso levels were determined weekly at zzso intervals before and for 4 h after the zzso h zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans and visual field testing were assessed before and after the zzso During the zzso zzso infusion, four patients had a significant decrease in zzso levels zzso zzso zzso During the zzso chronic zzso administration period, two patients had significant decreases in zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of these two patients had a small reduction in tumor zzso Two patients whose serum zzso level did not significantly change while receiving zzso had a reduction in tumor size or zzso improvement in visual field zzso Three patients received a maximum zzso dose of 250 zzso three times zzso In one patient, there was a significant decrease in zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso in association with a marked improvement in visual field zzso In another such patient, continued administration of zzso to a maximum dose of 250 zzso three times daily, was associated with a marked reduction in tumor zzso Of the four patients who demonstrated significant decreases in zzso zzso during the initial zzso infusion, three patients had a significant reduction in zzso levels while receiving zzso One patient who did not have a decrease in zzso levels during the zzso infusion demonstrated a small decrease in tumor size during higher dose zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
