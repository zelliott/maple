zzso studies revealed that zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso primates zzso reward prediction zzso It was zzso shown that reward prediction errors are zzso scaled with respect to the range of possible zzso enabling sensitive zzso for a large range of reward zzso zzso zzso studies in humans demonstrated that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso reward prediction errors in similar fashion as zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso may be driven by zzso zzso zzso However, zzso results are ambiguous with respect to the zzso zzso of reward prediction zzso leading to the conjecture that under certain circumstances other than zzso zzso input may drive zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to substantiate whether zzso in the zzso zzso rather respond to zzso scaled reward prediction errors or absolute reward zzso In addition, we aimed to identify zzso structures modulating activity in the zzso zzso Sixteen healthy participants played a wheel of fortune game, where they could win three differently valued rewards while being zzso zzso increased after gaining zzso this gain was however independent of the absolute reward zzso In contrast zzso upon reward omission decreased with reward zzso A zzso interaction analysis identified a cluster in the zzso in proximity of the zzso zzso nucleus, a cluster in the lateral zzso cortex, and a cluster in the zzso zzso zzso These clusters changed their connectivity with the zzso zzso in relation to the absolute reward magnitude in reward omission zzso
