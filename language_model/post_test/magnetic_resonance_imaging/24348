The dynamics of the blood zzso zzso zzso response are dependent on changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and the cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the response is dependent on the baseline zzso state, defined by the zzso oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood zzso As a result of this complex zzso the accurate interpretation of zzso data and robust zzso comparisons when the baseline physiology is varied are zzso The zzso zzso technique was developed to address these zzso However, the methodology is complex and its full promise has not yet been zzso In this review, the theoretical zzso of zzso zzso and issues regarding this theory that are still to be zzso are zzso Important aspects of practical zzso are reviewed and reported applications of this methodology are zzso
