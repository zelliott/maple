Recent development of zzso techniques has opened new possibilities for the study of the relation between zzso and the brain functional zzso Here we report zzso zzso of dominant and zzso hand movement representation in 12 right-handed subjects using block zzso We measured possible asymmetry in the total volume of activated neural tissue in the two zzso during simple and complex finger movements performed either with the right hand or with the left zzso zzso movements consisted in zzso of the index finger and complex movements in successive zzso opposition from little finger to index zzso A general predominance of zzso zzso relative to right zzso zzso was zzso zzso the complexity of the motor activity resulted in an enlargement of the volume of consistently activated areas and greater involvement of zzso areas, especially in the left zzso zzso of the dominant hand zzso large zzso zzso zzso than movements of the zzso hand) and relatively smaller zzso zzso zzso of the zzso hand resulted in a more balanced pattern of zzso in the two zzso due to relatively greater zzso zzso This suggests that the dominant (right) hand is controlled mainly by the zzso (left) hemisphere, whereas the zzso hand is controlled by both left and right zzso This effect is especially apparent during execution of complex zzso The expansion of brain areas involved in motor control in the zzso zzso to the dominant hand may provide neural zzso for higher efficiency and a greater motor skill repertoire of the preferred zzso
