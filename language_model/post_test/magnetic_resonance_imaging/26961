Although magnetic resonance imaging zzso is much more sensitive than zzso for detecting early invasive breast cancer, in many high-risk screening studies zzso was less sensitive than zzso for detecting zzso zzso in zzso zzso We reviewed our experience detecting zzso in our single center study of annual zzso zzso ultrasound and clinical breast examination zzso for screening very high-risk zzso All cases of zzso and invasive cancer were compared in two time zzso before zzso zzso and after zzso zzso July zzso we acquired expertise in the detection of zzso with zzso respect to patient zzso method of zzso and rates of detection of invasive cancer and zzso In period A there were 15 cases zzso of zzso zzso in 223 women, of which 2 zzso were zzso with zzso detected by zzso In period B there were 29 cases zzso of 877 zzso in 391 women, of which 10 zzso were zzso zzso all 10 detected by zzso but only one by zzso No zzso cases were detected by ultrasound or zzso zzso was lower in period B than in period A but zzso The ability to detect zzso with screening zzso improves significantly with zzso zzso biopsy capability is essential for a high-risk screening zzso In experienced centers the increased sensitivity of zzso relative to zzso is at least as high for zzso as it is for invasive breast zzso
