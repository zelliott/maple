Imaging of cerebral oxygen metabolism is useful for selecting and monitoring therapy, matching patients with interventions, and zzso outcomes while reducing the zzso of zzso zzso We aimed to measure oxygen metabolism using magnetic resonance zzso zzso Because the magnetic zzso of zzso varies with its zzso status, the regional oxygen zzso should be measurable by MR zzso We derived equations based on the blood zzso zzso zzso theory and evaluated their zzso in patients with chronic cerebral zzso From changes in zzso zzso cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso after loading of zzso or zzso we calculated the cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso zzso by zzso and compared the results to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation zzso between the 2 zzso was between zzso and zzso in 4 patients, suggesting the zzso of zzso MR imaging, but ranged from zzso to zzso in assessment of oxygen extraction fraction zzso zzso contrast MR imaging tended to overestimate the region of decreased zzso Some technical challenges remain for improving the sensitivity of delta zzso selective measurement of zzso blood volume, and zzso of examination zzso
