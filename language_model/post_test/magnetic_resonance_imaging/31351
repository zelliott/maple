We asked whether zzso valve replacement using a mechanical zzso would allow zzso of left zzso function and structure in children and young zzso 

We performed a clinical follow-up examination in 30 patients with zzso valve replacement at 25 years of age or younger, including conventional and tissue zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso valve replacement was performed at the median age of zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso using a mechanical zzso zzso Jude zzso median diameter, 23 zzso range, 17 to 27 zzso zzso were severe zzso zzso in 6 of 30 patients, zzso zzso in 20 of 30 patients, or a combination of zzso zzso and zzso (4 of 30 zzso zzso valve replacement was a zzso in 12 of 30 patients who primarily underwent zzso zzso at a median of zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso mortality was zzso zzso was a median of 6 years zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of 30 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I without zzso zzso cerebrovascular zzso or major bleeding on oral zzso Left zzso zzso before zzso valve replacement was present in 20 of 30 patients but zzso in all but 4 patients on zzso Most patients showed a normal zzso volume on magnetic resonance imaging, and 23 of 26 patients showed a normal left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso Peak zzso strain of the left zzso zzso was a median of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and was normal in 28 of 30 zzso 

zzso valve replacement in children and young adults offers a good treatment option and may lead to zzso of left zzso size and function in most zzso
