The aim of this study was to determine to what degree current compressed sensing methods are capable of accelerating clinical magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

Two zzso clinical sequences were chosen for this study because of their long scan zzso A pilot study was used to establish the sampling scheme and zzso zzso needed in compressed sensing zzso These findings were used in a subsequent blinded study in which images reconstructed using compressed sensing were evaluated by 2 zzso zzso Image quality was evaluated at up to 10 anatomical zzso 

The findings indicate that compressed sensing may provide zzso acceleration of certain clinical magnetic resonance zzso zzso A global ringing artifact and image blurring were identified as the 2 primary artifacts that would hinder the ability to confidently discern zzso 

zzso sensing is able to moderately accelerate certain zzso sequences without severe loss of clinically relevant zzso For those sequences with zzso spatial resolution and/or at a higher acceleration factor, artifacts degrade the quality of the reconstructed image to a point where they are of little to no clinical zzso
