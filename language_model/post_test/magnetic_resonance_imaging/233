This study assessed clinical condition at midterm follow-up after total zzso connection for a functionally zzso heart performed on children younger than 5 zzso 

Thirty-four zzso patients zzso age zzso years, range zzso years, 22 boys, median follow-up zzso years, zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso monitoring, bicycle exercise testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso were in zzso zzso zzso monitoring demonstrated normal mean heart rate, low zzso heart rate, and no clinically significant zzso or zzso zzso zzso With zzso bicycle zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum workload zzso of zzso maximum heart rate zzso of zzso and zzso oxygen zzso zzso of zzso were all significantly lower in the zzso group than in a control group zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso exercise indicated less efficient oxygen zzso during exercise in all zzso zzso zzso fraction was lower than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Mean zzso and zzso volumes and zzso mass were higher than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso levels were increased relative to reference values, but only 8 patients had levels above the upper reference zzso 

At midterm zzso zzso patients were in acceptable clinical condition, with preserved global zzso function, moderately decreased exercise capacity, and zzso levels within reference zzso zzso zzso mass was zzso however, suggesting zzso zzso zzso consequences for zzso function merit further zzso
