To present the development of a compact low field zzso MR image guidance system and its application in brain zzso 

The zzso zzso system zzso Medical Technologies, Israel and zzso zzso zzso was developed for use in a standard operating zzso Its primary physical fixed parameters are magnetic field of zzso T and field of view of 20 zzso 16 zzso The magnet is mounted on a zzso zzso and can be positioned under the surgical table when not in use for zzso Additional functionality includes integrated zzso and system operation by the zzso 

The zzso system zzso into existing operating rooms requiring only slight modification of the surgical zzso Standard instruments can be zzso The system's imaging allows it to be used for the following zzso zzso tumors, low grade zzso (including awake zzso high grade zzso zzso tumors, accurate navigation to small zzso such as cavernous zzso or zzso drainage of zzso and brain zzso The image quality, which is comparable to post operative diagnostic high field imaging, enables high quality zzso zzso More than 6,000 brain surgeries were done with the system in 50 centers in the US and zzso 

The low field zzso zzso system is a valuable tool in the modern operating zzso
