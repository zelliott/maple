We have developed an animal model to zzso the acute effects of zzso abnormalities on muscle metabolism induced by different zzso classes of zzso isolated from zzso cell anemia zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso SS zzso zzso were injected into the zzso artery of the rat and quantitative zzso imaging, zzso magnetic resonance zzso by surface zzso at 2 zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso were zzso Between 5 and 25 zzso of zzso cells was trapped in the zzso of the thigh (or zzso zzso zzso cells per cubic zzso of zzso In contrast, fewer SS zzso zzso or AA cells were trapped (an equivalent packed cell volume of less than zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After injection of zzso cells an initial increase in zzso zzso was observed in the region of the thigh served by the zzso artery, zzso pH zzso and subsequently the zzso relaxation time zzso reached a broad maximum at zzso zzso When zzso obtained at this time was plotted against the volume of cells zzso an increase of zzso over the control value of 411 zzso 48 zzso was found that was zzso to the number of cells zzso We conclude that the densest SS cells are most effective at producing zzso The extent of the change detected by zzso magnetic resonance imaging is dependent on the amount of cells trapped in the zzso and the magnitude of the initial increase of zzso zzso
