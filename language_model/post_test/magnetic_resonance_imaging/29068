We zzso evaluated zzso changes in late delayed zzso injury to the zzso zzso on zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in 34 zzso zzso more severe injury on imaging tended to have lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A significantly higher zzso ratio was found in the most severe grade of cerebral zzso in which zzso might be zzso The progressive decrease in zzso with increasing severity reflected zzso loss at different stages of late delayed zzso brain zzso The absence of zzso zzso in mild and moderate zzso did not suggest zzso or zzso zzso as an zzso mechanism of late delayed zzso brain zzso The association of severe zzso zzso with elevated zzso suggests zzso as the underlying mechanism for severe zzso zzso MRS may provide zzso information conducive to the understanding of the zzso of late zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
