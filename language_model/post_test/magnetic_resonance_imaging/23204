The impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on memory and brain development was investigated in 92 African-American, young adults who were first identified in the prenatal zzso Three groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using structural zzso with brain volume calculated for multiple regions of zzso Memory was measured using the zzso Selective Reminding Memory Test and its zzso counterpart, the zzso Selective Reminding Memory zzso which each yielding measures of learning and zzso For both zzso and zzso Recall and Slope, linear trends were observed demonstrating a spectrum of deficits associated with prenatal alcohol zzso zzso individuals performed significantly poorer than zzso controls on 5 of 6 memory zzso zzso individuals demonstrated significantly lower total brain volume than controls, as well as lower volume in a number of specific regions including zzso zzso analyses indicated that memory performance associated with effects of prenatal alcohol exposure was zzso from zzso severity through zzso volume, particularly right zzso These results indicate that the association between the physical effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and deficits in memory are zzso by zzso reduction in specific brain zzso
