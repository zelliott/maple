We present a novel cortical correspondence method employing zzso registration in a zzso zzso space for the use in local cortical thickness analysis in human and zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed method is unbiased registration that estimates a continuous smooth deformation field into an unbiased average space via zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso harmonic decomposition of the zzso deformation zzso We zzso a correspondence by our zzso method that establishes a surface correspondence with a prior zzso Since this zzso correspondence is biased to the choice of a template, we further improve the correspondence by employing unbiased ensemble zzso zzso across all surfaces, which yields a deformation field onto the zzso updated unbiased zzso The specific zzso metric incorporates two terms: the first focused on zzso the correspondence of automatically extracted zzso landmarks and the second on that of zzso depth zzso We also propose an zzso scheme for zzso deformation via zzso zzso as well as a novel method to choose an optimal zzso polar coordinate system for the most efficient deformation field zzso The experimental results show evidence that the proposed method improves the correspondence quality in zzso zzso and human subjects as compared to the zzso zzso
