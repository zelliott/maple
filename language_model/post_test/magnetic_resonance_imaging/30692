To estimate the zzso of muscle strength, knee pain, cartilage volume, bone size, and zzso zzso zzso and to assess whether zzso of the knee structural components is independent of zzso 

A zzso design was zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the right knee was performed to determine cartilage volume and bone zzso Standing zzso zzso of the same knee were obtained to assess the presence of zzso zzso pain was assessed by questionnaire and muscle strength by zzso zzso was estimated using the genetic analysis program zzso 

A total of 128 subjects zzso men, 67 zzso mean age 45 zzso from 51 families representing 115 zzso were zzso Lower limb muscle strength had high zzso zzso P zzso zzso as did knee pain zzso P zzso zzso zzso estimates for cartilage volume were zzso for zzso zzso cartilage, zzso for lateral zzso cartilage, and zzso for zzso cartilage, and zzso estimates for bone size were zzso for zzso zzso bone area, 57% for lateral zzso bone area, and zzso for zzso bone volume (all P zzso or zzso zzso For zzso zzso was zzso for presence (with a large standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for severity zzso zzso zzso The estimates for zzso bone areas were the only ones markedly reduced after adjustment for body size, while all estimates with the exception of knee pain were independent of zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, bone sites investigated by zzso were largely under independent genetic control, with a lesser shared genetic zzso 

With the exception of prevalent zzso all knee zzso assessed had high zzso most likely reflecting a strong genetic zzso zzso volume, bone size, and muscle strength all have the potential to be studied in quantitative trait linkage zzso but their exact relevance with regard to zzso remains uncertain at this zzso
