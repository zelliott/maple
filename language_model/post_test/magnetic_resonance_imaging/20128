Estimates of auditory zzso zzso sizes in a zzso model as derived from classical zzso zzso reconstructions from zzso brain zzso and structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso scans from a zzso T animal zzso were compared in the same specimens zzso zzso Estimates of zzso volumes obtained with the two methods were very similar, zzso highly correlated and not significantly different from each zzso zzso the general usefulness of structural zzso for the determination of brain zzso size in small animal models is zzso zzso therefore seems to be well suited to determine proper size and location of an experimental brain zzso prior to zzso zzso behavioral zzso
