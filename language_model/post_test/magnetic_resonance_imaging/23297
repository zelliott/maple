zzso magnetic resonance analysis often requires accurate, zzso and reliable automatic extraction of anatomical zzso Recently, zzso methods incorporating a label fusion strategy have demonstrated high accuracy in zzso cerebral zzso In this study, we propose a novel zzso method using expert manual zzso as zzso to achieve this zzso Inspired by recent work in image zzso the proposed zzso zzso label fusion produces accurate and robust zzso zzso with two different zzso is zzso In our experiments, the zzso of 80 healthy subjects and the lateral zzso of 80 patients with Alzheimer's disease were zzso The influence on zzso accuracy of different parameters such as patch size and number of training subjects was also zzso A comparison with an zzso method and a zzso method was also carried zzso The highest median zzso index values obtained with the proposed method were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for lateral zzso zzso
