A zzso selective zzso zzso MR imaging technique was used to map selectively the zzso drug zzso zzso and its major zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The pulse sequence employed a zzso zzso zzso pulse to suppress either the zzso or the zzso resonance before the other component in the zzso zzso MR zzso was zzso Selective zzso and zzso images with a spatial resolution of 10 zzso 10 zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso were obtained in 40 zzso from six zzso rats with implanted Morris zzso Because the zzso frequency could always be set to the zzso frequency of the zzso resonance employed for imaging, the images were free of zzso artifacts in zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso appeared only in the liver, the zzso and the zzso zzso could also be detected in all major zzso and in the muscular zzso In the Morris zzso a small zzso zzso and no zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso technique provides useful zzso and zzso data on the zzso of the zzso drug zzso and on the different zzso activities of the zzso
