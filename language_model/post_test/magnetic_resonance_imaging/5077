Multimedia zzso Service zzso is used by zzso residents to transmit scan images to the attending zzso in conjunction with telephone zzso This service has been well received by the attending zzso who felt that after viewing scan images on their zzso they felt increased confidence in clinical decision making and that it reduced the need for recall to the zzso 

The use of zzso can be extended to junior doctors making referrals from regional hospitals with no zzso zzso This study aims to validate the competency of zzso trained junior doctors in selecting optimal images to transmit via zzso to the attending zzso on zzso 

Ten junior doctors with no formal zzso training and five zzso residents were zzso They were shown the full complement of images together with relevant clinical history and zzso They were then asked to make the zzso diagnosis and then select two images for zzso transmission to the attending zzso that they thought would best aid the zzso in clinical decision zzso The attending zzso was asked to comment, on each image, whether his management plan would differ if he was shown the entire series of the zzso 

All the images chosen are deemed appropriate, and the decision made based on the zzso images would be similar if the entire series of images were available to the zzso However, 7 of 10 junior doctors were unable to read magnetic resonance images of zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the images chosen by the zzso residents and the junior zzso 

It is feasible and safe for junior doctors to zzso zzso to transmit zzso zzso images to a zzso while making an urgent zzso The images selected are representative of the disease pathology and facilitate clinical decision zzso
