zzso hybrid zzso with calcium zzso zzso core and zzso shell were developed to incorporate magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent zzso acid zzso zzso zzso for zzso diagnosis of solid zzso A zzso preparation method was applied to elaborate hybrid zzso with a zzso zzso diameter about zzso neutral surface zzso and high zzso stability in zzso environments by zzso of zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso and zzso in zzso solution, followed with zzso zzso zzso into the hybrid zzso allowed zzso to show significant enhanced retention ratio in blood zzso leading to high zzso in tumor positions due to enhanced zzso and retention zzso zzso Moreover, zzso revealed above 6 times increase of zzso in the zzso system compared to free form, and eventually, selective and elevated contrast enhancements in the tumor positions were zzso These results indicate the high potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel contrast agent for zzso cancer zzso
