Our understanding of how zzso determines zzso in primary zzso is zzso zzso zzso primary zzso is commonly due to the zzso gene zzso A critical question, given the zzso zzso of clinical symptoms in zzso zzso carriers, is why the same zzso leads to differential clinical expression and whether zzso zzso primary zzso with and without family history share zzso mechanisms with zzso zzso This study examines the relationship between zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso by monitoring zzso structure using zzso zzso We acquired magnetic resonance imaging data of symptomatic and zzso zzso zzso carriers, of zzso primary zzso patients, with and without family history and control subjects with normal zzso zzso By crossing the factors zzso and zzso we demonstrate a significant interaction in terms of brain anatomy confined to the zzso zzso zzso The explanation for this effect differs according to both gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and zzso zzso carriers have significantly larger zzso zzso compared to healthy subjects and symptomatic zzso zzso zzso There is a significant negative correlation between severity of zzso and zzso zzso size in zzso zzso zzso We propose that differential zzso and zzso mechanisms lead to brain structure changes in zzso primary zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Given the range of age of zzso there may be differential genetic zzso of brain development that in turn determines clinical zzso zzso a zzso gene dependent primary zzso of motor circuit development may lead to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and hence zzso
