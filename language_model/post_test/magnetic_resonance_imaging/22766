We used zzso to examine the functional zzso of zzso processing in the first zzso and second zzso languages of zzso late zzso zzso either covertly read words or produced sentences from zzso zzso production during sentence production activated regions including left inferior frontal zzso zzso and the supplementary motor area in both zzso zzso performed on the zzso zzso identified on a zzso basis revealed greater zzso in zzso compared to zzso during sentence production and during word reading, consistent with previous work suggesting that greater cognitive effort may be zzso by less zzso neural representations that require greater zzso zzso zzso there was a greater separation in the zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso in less compared to more zzso zzso during syntax production, suggesting a functional zzso of regions involved in zzso production as a function of zzso zzso
