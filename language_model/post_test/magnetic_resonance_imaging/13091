Our objective was to characterize variations in mechanical knee zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between Japanese and Caucasian populations in the healthy, young adult knee zzso zzso young adult subjects participated in this study, including 23 Japanese and 47 Caucasian zzso zzso magnetic resonance images of the hip, knee, and ankle were acquired for zzso Japanese subjects had a significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment zzso zzso zzso degrees standard zzso than Caucasians zzso zzso zzso zzso while women exhibited a more zzso alignment zzso zzso zzso zzso than men zzso zzso zzso degrees, p zzso zzso zzso differences were found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso with Japanese exhibiting lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to Caucasians zzso zzso zzso degrees and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between genders were found in zzso alignment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were reliable between observers and for repeated zzso Our study provides new insight into anatomical and geometric differences in the knee joint between Japanese and zzso as well as between females and zzso Further consideration of these results may improve development of implants to accommodate for these differences, and understanding of characteristics leading to increased prevalence of knee zzso in certain zzso The use of magnetic resonance imaging to obtain these zzso also allows soft tissue structure characterization without exposure to zzso zzso
