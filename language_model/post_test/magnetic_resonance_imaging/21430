In patients with zzso lobe zzso and associated zzso sclerosis zzso there are brain abnormalities extending beyond the presumed zzso zone as revealed separately in conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and MR diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso However, little is known about the relation between zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso 

For 62 patients with unilateral zzso and 68 healthy controls, we determined volumes and mean fractional zzso zzso of zzso and zzso brain structures from zzso and zzso data, zzso We report significant volume zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions, which were more diffuse and bilateral in patients with left zzso relative to right zzso We observed significant relationships between volume loss and mean zzso particularly of the zzso and zzso zzso When corrected for age, duration of zzso was significantly correlated with zzso loss of an zzso plausible route - including zzso zzso zzso and zzso lobe white matter, the zzso zzso and zzso regions of the corpus zzso that contain zzso lobe zzso - that may be suggestive of progressive brain zzso in response to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with interrelated zzso and zzso brain degenerative abnormalities that are influenced by the duration of the disorder and the side of seizure zzso This work confirms previously contradictory findings by employing zzso imaging techniques in parallel in a large sample of zzso
