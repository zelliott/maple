The aim of the study is to evaluate the reliability of the zzso zzso zzso MR imaging in the cases of zzso acute brain zzso 

CT and MR standard and diffusion images observed in 29 patients affected with early brain stroke and reference CT in all the zzso zzso CT was performed 3-5 days later in all zzso 

The zzso and zzso CT in 23 patients did not reveal any brain zzso In contrary to CT areas of zzso high signal were zzso well in diffusion MR in 20 of these patients, which supported early zzso zzso zzso zzso of the same locations were seen also in the zzso MR imaging in 19 of zzso In the 6 patients CT revealed only discrete zzso areas, which were seen more pronounced in the zzso and diffusion MR zzso In the 3 cases even the second CT did not reveal zzso 

The diffusion MR imaging in patients suspected of acute brain stroke reveals zzso zzso earlier and more clearly than zzso imaging, which discrete presented the same pathological zzso
