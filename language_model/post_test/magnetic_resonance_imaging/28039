In a wide range of zzso studies of zzso injection zzso zzso zzso New York, NY, and zzso zzso Oslo, zzso the zzso of the compound have been delineated and its safety zzso The zzso behavior of zzso was consistent with its zzso zzso Its zzso in rats, zzso and monkeys was short, 18, 38, and 75 minutes, zzso zzso was shown to be zzso zzso primarily through the zzso In rats, zzso of the administered dose was zzso in the urine within the first 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso to zzso appeared in the feces during the same zzso zzso injection has been shown to have a remarkably low acute lethal zzso superior to that of zzso zzso injection zzso zzso Laboratories, Wayne, NJ, and zzso zzso Berlin, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison with zzso zzso injection, zzso injection had fewer effects on cardiovascular and zzso function after rapid intravenous injection in zzso dogs and, in zzso at high zzso on zzso fragility and zzso wall zzso The lesser effects might be zzso at least in part, to the lower zzso of zzso injection, although it remains to be seen whether this will translate into any advantage for zzso injection at the lower doses used for imaging procedures in zzso Similar to all known zzso administered diagnostic imaging agents, zzso injection produces zzso of the zzso zzso cells in the zzso without any change in zzso zzso However, the zzso threshold for this effect is greater than zzso zzso in the zzso even after a dose of 10 zzso the zzso was only zzso in degree and was shown to have zzso partially during the 7 days after zzso In zzso administration of zzso zzso daily for 28 days had no effect on the zzso thus providing reassurance of the wide margin of safety for any effect of this compound on the zzso Although intended for single administration in patients, zzso injection has been studied extensively in a range of zzso studies in rats and zzso The compound was well tolerated in monkeys even when administered at doses up to zzso zzso daily for 28 consecutive zzso In rats, significant toxicity occurred only at high doses, particularly in male animals, and the pattern of toxicity zzso the stomach, zzso and zzso suggested a zzso of zinc zzso zzso injection produced no significant irritation when administered by a variety of zzso and zzso zzso
