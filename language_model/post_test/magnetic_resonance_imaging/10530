zzso beating heart zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso may be limited by heat from zzso blood zzso We therefore evaluated the ability to create zzso using an zzso zzso device, which temporarily zzso blood flow and zzso zzso 

Six zzso dogs underwent zzso A clamp employing a zzso zzso linear zzso device was used zzso to isolate the pulmonary veins and left zzso zzso After clamping of zzso the probe was removed from the zzso device, and the remaining linear zzso analogous to the Cox maze III, were zzso Pulmonary vein zzso was evaluated with the use of magnetic resonance zzso Left zzso function and pulmonary zzso flow zzso were assessed with zzso zzso zzso was confirmed both zzso and zzso Animals were then put to death at 30 zzso 

All acute and chronic zzso zzso produced zzso zzso There was no change in right zzso or left pulmonary vein zzso diameter on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at planned death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Left zzso function and pulmonary zzso flow zzso were zzso zzso sections determined zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of linear zzso performed with the zzso malleable zzso 

zzso application of this zzso device on the beating heart produced zzso zzso which persisted 30 zzso Linear zzso zzso was not as effective as the zzso device at producing consistent zzso zzso This novel, versatile device may be useful in treating patients with zzso zzso on the beating heart without zzso zzso
