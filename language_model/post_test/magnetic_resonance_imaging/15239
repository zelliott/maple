Alzheimer's disease zzso is associated with widespread brain zzso including structures zzso zzso We applied an improved structural detection methodology to examine the less well known progression of zzso in zzso zzso We sought to zzso zzso study zzso differences in patients with zzso zzso and healthy zzso and zzso test the hypothesis that zzso volumes would be correlated with clinically relevant cognitive zzso Seven patients and zzso healthy subjects underwent two structural zzso scans and zzso zzso zzso were zzso to a zzso template and zzso zzso to reduce tissue zzso Using zzso patient zzso was zzso to left zzso and zzso zzso whilst left zzso volumes were correlated with a cognitive performance zzso A zzso search methodology, showed that patients had reduced volumes including zzso regions zzso in zzso and zzso and right zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that cognitive performance was correlated with volumes of both zzso superior zzso zzso and left zzso Neither group exhibited significant zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel methodology, we have shown that in zzso zzso clinically relevant cognitive deficits are correlated with regionally specific zzso volumes, which are zzso at an early stage of the zzso
