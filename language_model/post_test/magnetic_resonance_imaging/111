Although several studies have examined zzso volume in zzso results have been mixed and no investigation has specifically measured zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this investigation was to assess zzso and zzso volumes in children with zzso 

zzso included 22 zzso zzso retarded boys with zzso and 22 zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso scans were obtained using a zzso scanner and zzso zzso were performed using the zzso software zzso zzso and zzso volumes were measured using a zzso zzso zzso 

There were no significant differences in age and total brain volume zzso between the two groups but zzso zzso was higher in zzso A decrease in zzso zzso volume was observed in the zzso group before and after controlling for zzso No significant differences were observed in zzso zzso A significant relationship was observed between zzso zzso volume and oral sensory sensitivity as measured by the zzso Profile zzso zzso 

zzso from this study are suggestive of zzso abnormalities in zzso involving zzso structures with evidence supporting the existence of a relationship between these zzso and sensory zzso These results are consistent with previous investigations and support the existence of disturbances in zzso zzso thought to be implicated in the sensory dysfunction observed in zzso
