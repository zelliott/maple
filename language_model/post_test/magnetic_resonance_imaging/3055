Mechanical contrast media application is used to improve image quality and allow better quantitative assessment of the contrast media zzso for CT as well as zzso The pressure within the zzso line system must be known to enable safe and zzso exact zzso 

Experimental setup to zzso the zzso pressure, the storage volume as well as the zzso of delivery within the zzso line system was zzso Representative contrast media zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 60 as well as zzso zzso were measured with ten different flow rates from zzso zzso to zzso zzso using the six most common zzso zzso sizes zzso 

System pressures between zzso zzso zzso allowed system pressure zzso 60 zzso are commonly obtained with standard sizes of zzso zzso such as an 18 G zzso and flow rates zzso or zzso zzso zzso using zzso 300 zzso 13 zzso at 20 degrees zzso Higher system pressures zzso 25 zzso produce an exponential increase of the storage volume within the zzso line zzso The additional storage volume within the zzso line tubing zzso zzso zzso zzso 76 zzso is at 60 zzso and 20 degrees C 5 zzso and at 37 degrees C 11 zzso in addition to the volume of the tubing of 7 zzso 

Based on the measured data, both the minimum and the recommended sizes of the zzso zzso in respect of flow rate and zzso of the used contrast media were compiled for system pressures at zzso or zzso 60 zzso as well as zzso or zzso 38 zzso
