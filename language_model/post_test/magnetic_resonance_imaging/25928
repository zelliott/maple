We have developed a simple method for locating functional regions of interest on successive zzso scans obtained at different times and for locating zzso regions defined with MR on functional images obtained with zzso Plastic zzso are made for each external auditory zzso and the zzso A pocket is then made in each mold in which either a zzso disk (for zzso or an identical disk containing zzso solution (for zzso can be zzso zzso zzso slices are reconstructed with the same slice thickness in the two zzso The zzso software zzso both zzso and zzso reconstructed images so that the three zzso markers lie in one zzso reference plane and the three zzso markers lie in one zzso reference zzso zzso zzso and MR images may then be displayed simultaneously to locate chosen regions of zzso The technique was validated by taping test markers to the forehead of 12 zzso the difference between the positions of the centers of the test markers on zzso and MR scans was within 1 zzso acquisition zzso zzso
