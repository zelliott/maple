Previous zzso studies suggest that prefrontal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and related zzso structures is an underlying neural zzso of zzso emotion zzso zzso individuals experience excessive negative emotions, signaling potential dysfunction of systems supporting zzso of negative zzso We examined the hypothesis that anxious individuals require increased recruitment of lateral and zzso zzso to decrease negative zzso An emotion regulation task that involved viewing moderately negative images was presented during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Participants with elevated trait anxiety scores zzso and normal trait anxiety scores zzso were trained to reduce negative emotions using cognitive zzso Blood zzso zzso zzso changes were contrasted for periods when participants were reducing emotions versus when they were maintaining zzso Compared to healthy controls, anxious participants showed greater zzso of brain regions implicated in zzso zzso zzso and automatic zzso anterior zzso zzso control of emotions during zzso of negative zzso Left zzso zzso activity was associated with greater zzso reduction of distress in anxious participants, but not in healthy zzso These findings provide evidence of altered functioning of neural zzso of emotion regulation in zzso zzso zzso participants required greater engagement of lateral and zzso zzso in order to successfully reduce negative zzso
