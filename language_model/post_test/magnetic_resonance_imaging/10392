We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of an zzso zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso in detecting high-grade zzso zzso in the three main coronary arteries in patients with coronary artery disease zzso Side branches were zzso We correlated magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings of the zzso with zzso of the coronary zzso 

Fourteen zzso patients underwent conventional coronary zzso zzso zzso and zzso We determined the calcium burden with zzso zzso zzso Then zzso was performed after intravenous contrast injection during a single zzso The left zzso zzso MR zzso imaging was assessed at rest and zzso defects were observed during zzso stress after contrast zzso Delayed zzso zzso was performed to picture zzso 

zzso had sensitivity zzso specificity zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso of zzso of more than 50% in the main coronary arteries when compared with zzso zzso wall dysfunction, zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso of sectors assigned to zzso or zzso but also in sectors supplied by normally zzso coronary zzso 

zzso and zzso revealed comparable results in evaluating zzso zzso above 50% in the main zzso coronary zzso There were no significant correlations between the degree of zzso or zzso at zzso and the MR findings, but the combined information of zzso and zzso showed the zzso of zzso changes in regions zzso by significantly zzso zzso and normal main coronary zzso
