zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso traverse the zzso zzso cavity and zzso the zzso Previous studies suggest that the zzso fold has adopted an increasingly important role in supporting the increased load of the zzso during human evolution, brought about by zzso and an adaptation to bipedal zzso zzso studies of the fetal zzso suggest that its zzso profile zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso in response to disproportionate growth of the zzso This study tests the hypothesis that differential growth of the cerebral and zzso components of the brain zzso the zzso rotation of the zzso zzso during human fetal zzso Brain volumes and zzso angles were taken from high-resolution magnetic resonance images of 46 human fetuses ranging from 10 to 29 zzso zzso Apart from the expected increases of both zzso and zzso brain volumes with age, the results confirm previous studies showing a significant relative enlargement of the zzso zzso zzso with this enlargement was a rotation of the zzso section of the zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso These findings support the concept that increases of zzso volume relative to zzso volume affect an zzso rotation of the human fetal zzso zzso These results are discussed in the context of the role played by the zzso zzso during human evolution and underline implications for zzso and zzso models of zzso
