A brief speech expression protocol that can be administered and scored without special training would aid in the differential diagnosis of the 3 principal forms of primary progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and semantic zzso zzso 

We used a zzso task to elicit a short speech sample, and we evaluated zzso in zzso production, speech rate, zzso zzso and zzso We compared the results with those obtained by a longer, previously validated protocol and further validated performance with zzso imaging to assess the zzso basis of the zzso 

We found different patterns of impaired grammar in each zzso zzso and additional language production features were impaired in each: zzso zzso was characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso starts and zzso and semantic zzso zzso by poor retrieval of zzso Strong correlations were found between this brief speech sample and a zzso narrative speech zzso A composite measure of zzso and other measures of speech production were correlated with distinct regions of gray matter zzso and reduced white matter fractional zzso in each zzso zzso 

These findings provide evidence that large-scale networks are required for zzso grammatical zzso that these networks can be selectively disrupted in zzso zzso and that quantitative analysis of a brief speech sample can reveal the corresponding distinct speech zzso
