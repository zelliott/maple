To determine by magnetic resonance imaging zzso whether knees with advanced zzso disease zzso joint space narrowing zzso encounter greater zzso cartilage loss than zzso knees with earlier disease (no or less zzso 

Participants were selected from zzso cases in the zzso Initiative, based on exhibition of bilateral pain, body mass index zzso zzso zzso in 1 knee, no or less zzso in the zzso knee, and no lateral zzso in both zzso Eighty participants zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso fulfilled these zzso zzso zzso and zzso cartilage zzso was analyzed from the baseline and the zzso followup zzso zzso double echo at steady state by zzso of both knees by experienced readers blinded to the time point and zzso zzso 

zzso with more zzso zzso displayed greater zzso cartilage loss zzso zzso assessed by zzso than zzso knees with less zzso zzso zzso The difference reached statistical significance in participants with an zzso grade of 2 or 3 zzso zzso zzso but not in participants with an zzso grade of 1 zzso zzso zzso In knees with more zzso cartilage loss increased with higher grades of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with an zzso grade of 2 or 3 displayed greater cartilage loss in the zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with advanced zzso displayed greater cartilage loss than zzso knees with less zzso These data suggest that zzso can be used to zzso fast structural zzso and that zzso cartilage thickness loss is more pronounced at advanced zzso disease zzso
