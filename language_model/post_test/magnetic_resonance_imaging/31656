In humans, the vertical zzso dimensions vary significantly with the size of the jaw muscles, which are regarded as important controlling factors of zzso zzso The functional relevance of the maximum zzso area zzso indicating maximum muscle strength, is questionable since peak forces are generated only a fraction of the zzso zzso muscle volume zzso the generated zzso might be a more meaningful functional zzso zzso the aim of this study was to investigate if jaw muscle volume is stronger related with vertical zzso dimensions than with jaw muscle zzso 

Thirty-one adult healthy subjects with varying vertical zzso zzso participated in this zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans were used for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles zzso This enabled zzso of the muscle zzso and zzso zzso analysis was performed using lateral zzso With factor analysis, the number of zzso variables was reduced into two factors that represented the anterior face height and the zzso face height zzso zzso zzso mutual relationships between these factors and muscular variables were assessed using a multiple zzso zzso 

It was found that vertical zzso dimensions were significantly better (up to zzso related with muscle volume rather than with zzso Furthermore, it was shown that especially the zzso factor was significantly correlated with the zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso dimensions are stronger related with jaw muscle volume than with zzso zzso it can be assumed that the generated muscle zzso rather than maximum forces, influence vertical zzso zzso
