Several studies have shown beneficial effects of zzso human growth hormone zzso in reducing visceral zzso tissue zzso in zzso patients with zzso 

Patients were zzso to zzso 4 zzso daily zzso zzso or three times per week zzso zzso over 12 weeks, followed by a 2 zzso daily maintenance dose for 12 zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso scans were performed to assess body zzso 

A total of 26 subjects were included in the zzso zzso was reduced overall by zzso zzso zzso at week 12 and by 49 zzso zzso at week 24, respectively, compared with baseline zzso for both zzso By week 12, zzso was reduced by 27 and zzso (A vs zzso zzso while facial fat was reduced by zzso and zzso zzso in groups A and B, respectively zzso Over 24 weeks, zzso was reduced by 42 and 38% zzso and facial fat by zzso and zzso zzso in groups A and B, respectively zzso compared with zzso There was a greater increase in zzso zzso zzso in group A than in group B zzso vs zzso zzso in week 12 and zzso vs zzso zzso in week 24; zzso zzso insulin levels increased, whereas zzso and insulin measured in oral zzso tolerance tests remained zzso zzso side effects were transient and zzso but more common in group A zzso than in group B zzso 

This study confirms reports that zzso effectively reduces zzso with a relatively small reduction of facial and limb zzso
