There is evidence to suggest vascular involvement in the initiation and progression of zzso zzso The relationship between large artery characteristics and zzso of zzso has not been investigated and was the aim of this zzso 

Large artery characteristics zzso zzso zzso zzso and central blood pressure zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso measured by magnetic resonance imaging as a surrogate index of zzso were recorded in 208 participants zzso 63 zzso 7 years; mean zzso zzso with symptomatic knee zzso zzso between large artery characteristics and zzso were assessed by multiple zzso adjusting for age, sex and body mass zzso 

There was a high prevalence of zzso presence in the study population zzso but no significant difference between participants with and without zzso for all large artery and zzso variables zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, there were no significant relationships between zzso size and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso central pulse pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso pulse pressure zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso When participants were zzso according to high or low zzso zzso there was no significant difference between groups regarding the proportion of those with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso indicative of large artery characteristics are not significantly correlated with zzso size or presence in people with symptomatic knee zzso Thus, large artery characteristics may not have a zzso influence in the development of zzso but this needs to be confirmed in prospective zzso
