To date, there are only a few, zzso based, zzso therapeutic strategies for treatment and, zzso for prevention of secondary brain injuries following severe closed head zzso In order to develop new therapy strategies, existing realistic animal models need to be zzso The objective is to bridge standardized small animal models and actual patient medical care, since the results of experimental small animal studies often cannot be transferred to zzso zzso For improved zzso of high-velocity zzso new trauma devices for initiating closed traumatic brain injury in sheep were zzso The following new devices were zzso zzso An zzso shaped rubber zzso with an integrated zzso zzso for prevention of skull zzso zzso zzso mounting of the zzso to guarantee stable experimental zzso zzso zzso degrees of trauma severity, zzso mild and severe closed traumatic brain injury, using different zzso and zzso zzso analysis via high-speed video zzso zzso zzso of zzso pressure, brain tissue zzso brain tissue zzso and carbon dioxide pressure, as well as neurotransmitter zzso were zzso zzso injuries were documented with magnetic resonance imaging and compared to zzso zzso Due to the new trauma devices, skull fractures were zzso The high-speed video recording documented a realistic trauma mechanism for a car zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso acid zzso began zzso after the zzso zzso resonance imaging and zzso results showed characteristic injury patterns of mild, and zzso closed traumatic brain zzso The zzso closed traumatic brain injury group showed diffuse zzso injuries, traumatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso with inconsistent distribution among the zzso The model presented here achieves a gain in zzso of zzso closed traumatic brain injury by increasing approximation to zzso The still zzso zzso of brain pathology mimics brain changes observed in patients after zzso zzso This model seems to close the gap between experimental small animal models and clinical zzso However, further investigations are needed to evaluate if this model can be used for testing new therapeutic strategies for these zzso
