The present study was designed to investigate the brain functional architecture that zzso zzso and motor processing in highly skilled zzso By using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we measured brain activity while zzso Formula zzso drivers and zzso zzso volunteers performed a motor reaction and a zzso zzso zzso were set at a relatively low level of difficulty such to ensure a similar performance in the two groups and thus avoid any potential zzso effects on brain activity due to discrepancies in task zzso The brain functional organization was analyzed in terms of regional brain response, zzso interactions and blood oxygen level dependent zzso signal zzso While performance levels were equal in the two groups, as compared to zzso drivers, professional drivers showed a smaller volume recruitment of zzso regions, stronger connections among zzso areas, and an increased information integration as reflected by a higher signal zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, as compared to zzso subjects, the brain functional architecture sustaining zzso processing in professional zzso drivers, trained to perform at the highest levels under extremely demanding conditions, zzso both zzso and zzso modifications that are evident even when the brain is engaged in relatively simple, zzso zzso These results provide novel evidence in favor of an increased zzso zzso in the brain of highly skilled zzso
