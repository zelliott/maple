zzso resonance imaging zzso is a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of orthopedic zzso Previous reports indicate that magnetic fields of zzso intensity stimulate bone growth in zzso We investigated the question of whether exposure to intense magnetic fields modified zzso and zzso constituents of the circulatory zzso Mice were exposed to a zzso zzso zzso magnetic field (1 zzso for 30 minutes on each of ten consecutive zzso No significant difference in blood alkaline zzso acid zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration was detected between control, zzso and magnetic zzso zzso These results suggest that exposure to intense magnetic fields does not alter zzso mechanisms of bone zzso
