If tumor volumes are to be used for evaluating responses to treatment and long-term outcomes of patients with primary zzso zzso the zzso of these zzso must be zzso We determined the zzso zzso of MR zzso volume zzso of these zzso and their regional zzso 

We used an interactive computer program zzso that enables the extraction of tumor volumes from zzso MR data to obtain 202 volume zzso in 17 patients with zzso zzso zzso to five time points zzso The primary cancer and largest zzso mass were manually outlined on every zzso image of each MR zzso The same zzso zzso this MR zzso zzso weeks zzso zzso error and percentage measurement error zzso zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso between primary zzso and zzso as well as between stages of treatment were tested with a zzso rank sum zzso 

The mean and median percentage measurement zzso respectively, were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for primary tumors and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The difference in the percentage measurement error between primary zzso and cervical zzso approached statistical significance zzso zzso zzso in the variation of volume zzso based on the stage of therapy were significant zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that MR zzso tumor volumes are reliably zzso Such zzso may be important in predicting patient outcome, determining appropriate therapy, and conducting patient zzso
