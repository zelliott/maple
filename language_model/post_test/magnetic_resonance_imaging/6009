The search for genes zzso liability for schizophrenia may be aided by the identification of zzso Response selection is a zzso cognitive function that is impaired in patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected zzso The abnormalities in cerebral function that presumably zzso the deficit in patients and unaffected siblings remain to be zzso zzso zzso during performance of a zzso reaction time zzso task in 25 patients with schizophrenia (15 medication free first episode zzso and 10 chronic zzso 32 controls, and 12 unaffected siblings of individuals with schizophrenia was investigated using zzso zzso was impaired in both medication free zzso and chronic patients with zzso and unaffected zzso zzso patients, chronic patients, and unaffected siblings demonstrated greater zzso response in the right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during zzso task zzso The nature of the altered zzso in the zzso was further examined using functional connectivity zzso This revealed marked reductions in connectivity between the right zzso and multiple brain regions in both patient groups and, to a lesser degree, unaffected zzso The magnitude of connectivity between right zzso and inferior zzso zzso correlated with task performance in the combined zzso siblings group, but not controls suggesting that the network of brain regions recruited to perform the task differed as a function of genetic liability for zzso The findings suggest that altered activity and connectivity of the right zzso appears to be related to genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia and may represent a potential zzso of the zzso
