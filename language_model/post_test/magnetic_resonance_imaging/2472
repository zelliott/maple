We present a method for the zzso and zzso mapping of zzso magnetic stimulation zzso data on surface rendered images of the cortex, derived from zzso zzso Images zzso We describe the zzso procedure and the methods used to locate the zzso stimulation sites in the zzso coordinate system, and the zzso needed to depict the zzso distribution as a zzso zzso map on the cortical zzso The methods are validated using zzso data from the hand zzso and leg zzso zzso The methods used correctly depict the expected motor representations of each of these areas and we therefore propose that this technique may be used as a functional imaging tool in the investigation of cortical function in both zzso and zzso
