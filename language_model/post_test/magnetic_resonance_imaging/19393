We examined MR imaging findings and determined the clinical significance of zzso bone zzso changes in the zzso spine of zzso aluminum zzso laser zzso zzso 

We zzso reviewed the zzso and zzso MR images of 109 patients with zzso zzso lower back pain, or both 1 year after laser zzso of 178 zzso From this group of patients, MR images were also obtained in 11 patients with zzso zzso changes zzso years after zzso These patients were interviewed regarding residual lower back zzso Thirteen zzso laser zzso patients also underwent follow-up MR imaging within 1 year of zzso 

After surgery, zzso zzso abnormalities were identified in 41 of 109 laser zzso zzso The remaining 68 patients had no zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were not associated with inflammation of the adjacent disk space and did not affect surgical zzso Bone zzso changes decreased in size in the 11 patients examined zzso years after laser zzso and eight of these patients described their lower back pain as zzso In 13 zzso laser zzso patients, one new zzso zzso zzso was zzso
