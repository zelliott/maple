The zzso zzso zzso zzso arise in the zzso orbit, zzso zzso and zzso To date, they have been clinically staged using the Ann Arbor staging system, first designed for zzso and later for zzso zzso zzso The Ann Arbor system has several shortcomings, particularly when staging zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso which show different dissemination patterns from zzso zzso 

To describe the first zzso clinical staging system for zzso 

zzso literature zzso 

We have developed, to our knowledge, the first American Joint Committee on zzso Union Against Cancer zzso staging system for zzso to overcome the limitations of the Ann Arbor zzso Our staging system defines disease extent more precisely within the various zzso compartments of the zzso zzso and allows for analysis of zzso factors not addressed zzso It aims to facilitate future studies by identifying clinical and zzso features of zzso zzso This system is for primary zzso only and is not intended for zzso zzso 

Our zzso staging system for zzso is a zzso zzso documentation of disease extent, which creates a common language for zzso and international zzso Data points will be collected with the aim of identifying zzso to be incorporated into the staging zzso
