The effects of zzso depression and stimulation of cerebral activity were investigated in seven healthy young volunteers using blood zzso zzso at zzso zzso Dynamic zzso imaging (7 zzso was performed before, during and after the intravenous application of 10 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso as well as of the corresponding drug zzso zzso zzso in a brain section covering zzso gray matter, zzso gray matter structures, and zzso The zzso responses were significantly different for the two drugs applied zzso zzso zzso Relative to signal strength during injection, zzso zzso a signal increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso within the whole section 4-5 zzso after zzso Similarly, both zzso conditions led to a small signal increase, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso abolished this signal zzso A zzso analysis revealed the zzso signal increase to be more pronounced in zzso gray matter structures zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso cortical gray matter zzso zzso zzso This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that pertinent responses not only reflect global cerebral zzso adjustments, but also localized zzso changes coupled to zzso in synaptic zzso The occurrence of a zzso response is best explained by expectancy and may provide a zzso factor in the design of functional zzso zzso
