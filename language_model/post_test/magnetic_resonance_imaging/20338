We report the case of a patient suffering from sudden apathy and pathological zzso zzso after bilateral zzso zzso involving the zzso portion of the head of the zzso zzso and adjacent anterior limb of the internal zzso This is the first report of the association of an apathy and abnormal gambling zzso following a stroke affecting zzso zzso Although the location of the zzso affecting the zzso zzso may explain the emergence of an zzso state, it is, however, at first sight, not easy to explain the gambling zzso because the patient was normal in tests evaluating sensitivity to zzso and no zzso zzso was found in the zzso system of zzso It is proposed that, for this patient, the mechanism of zzso gambling zzso was the development of a routine zzso related to the patient's cognitive inertia, a mechanism different from the changes in reward sensitivity observed after damage to the zzso zzso zzso zzso system or in zzso zzso syndrome in Parkinson's zzso
