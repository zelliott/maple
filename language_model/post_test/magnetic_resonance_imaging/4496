The temperature dependence of zzso resonance frequency zzso is related to the temperature dependence of the screening constant and of the volume zzso zzso To evaluate the relative importance, an experimental setup was designed allowing zzso of both effects in different zzso notably pure water in a gel structure, and zzso muscle and fat zzso The temperature varied from 28 to 44 degrees C, a range significant for zzso zzso Good agreement with results from the literature was obtained for zzso zzso muscle tissue behaves like zzso Its screening constant varies zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effects of zzso changes of the zzso constant are negligible for muscle zzso zzso The zzso relation in fat zzso however, is almost completely determined by zzso zzso
