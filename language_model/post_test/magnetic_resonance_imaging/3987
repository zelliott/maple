A novel method for reducing field zzso effects in magnetic resonance images is described in this zzso Observing that image degradation arises from zzso zzso phase zzso during data zzso the present method zzso zzso the accumulated phase in the zzso data based on an initial estimate of the image and a corresponding field zzso The zzso process generates a corrected zzso data set that is subsequently zzso transformed to produce the final zzso In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the method and applications of the technique to magnetic resonance imaging data are zzso The theoretical analysis of the method indicates that it is a general approach zzso to a variety of zzso zzso obtained by applying the method to experimental data acquired with zzso zzso imaging, segmented zzso imaging with zzso zzso and spiral sequences demonstrate that it is robust in reducing image degradation induced by zzso zzso
