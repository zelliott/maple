Brain zzso formation is a serious complication of zzso stroke and can lead to mechanical zzso of adjacent brain structures, cerebral zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso zzso regional cerebral blood flow zzso which is particularly important in the zzso phase of zzso In the present study, the authors evaluated the natural course of zzso formation in the zzso phase of focal cerebral zzso 

Middle cerebral artery zzso zzso or a sham procedure was performed in rats within an MR imaging unit zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso images could be compared on a zzso zzso The zzso relaxation time zzso a marker for brain water content, was measured in regions of zzso 

A significant increase in the zzso was zzso as early as zzso minutes after zzso At this early time point the zzso shift zzso amounted to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the sham group zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso Evans blue dye was zzso injected in additional animals 20 and 155 minutes after zzso zzso of the dye was visible in all animals, indicating increased zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso brain zzso occurs much earlier than expected following permanent zzso and leads to zzso and mechanical zzso of adjacent brain zzso Since zzso effects can impair zzso early zzso formation can significantly contribute to zzso formation and thus represents a promising target for zzso
