The zzso contains several structures important for the generation of zzso and vertical eye movements including the zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso and the zzso nucleus of zzso zzso While the zzso is the immediate zzso structure for the generation of zzso and vertical zzso the zzso is considered a major part of the neural zzso for zzso and vertical eye zzso zzso in monkeys show that a unilateral zzso of the zzso with zzso leads to spontaneous zzso zzso zzso whereas an zzso zzso causes zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of either structure leads to a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso While the deficits after a zzso zzso are thought to result from an imbalance of the zzso zzso a zzso imbalance probably causes the deficits after an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also found in patients with unilateral zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso from zzso scans shows a preferential involvement of the zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso and a major involvement of zzso in cases with zzso zzso zzso Thus, the direction of zzso zzso appears to be a valuable zzso sign for patients with zzso zzso
