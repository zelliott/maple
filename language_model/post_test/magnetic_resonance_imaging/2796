Previous studies tried to correlate prognosis and response to oral zzso in patients with idiopathic sudden zzso hearing loss to such factors as the age of the patient, presence of zzso shape of the zzso or severity of the hearing zzso However, zzso bone zzso evidence shows that idiopathic sudden zzso hearing loss may be caused by zzso or cochlear nerve zzso zzso we report results of a retrospective study of 96 consecutive patients with idiopathic sudden zzso hearing loss who were evaluated with auditory brain stem responses and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the auditory brain stem response and magnetic resonance imaging were correlated with hearing zzso zzso was available for 65 zzso 14 with abnormal and 51 with normal auditory brain stem zzso The overall rate of hearing recovery or improvement was zzso in the normal auditory brain stem response group compared with zzso in the abnormal auditory brain stem response group zzso zzso zzso Among the 38 patients treated with a tapering course of oral zzso the recovery or improvement rate was zzso for those with normal auditory brain stem responses and zzso for those with abnormal auditory brain stem responses zzso zzso zzso Of the 27 patients who did not receive steroid therapy, the improvement rate was zzso in those with normal auditory brain stem responses and zzso in those with abnormal auditory brain stem responses zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging with zzso was obtained on all 14 patients with abnormal auditory brain stem responses but on none with normal auditory brain stem zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
