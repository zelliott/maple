zzso measurement of zzso displacement fields within a closed object is a fundamental zzso zzso of how the brain zzso following skull impact have thus relied largely on indirect estimates and zzso zzso zzso We developed a magnetic resonance technique to zzso identify the modes of displacement of an accelerating soft object relative to an object enclosing it, and applied it to study zzso brain deformation in human zzso We show that, contrary to the prevailing hypotheses of the field, the dominant mode of interaction between the brain and skull in mild head acceleration is one of sliding arrested by zzso
