The majority of zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso experienced the first zzso zzso zzso zzso episode within the first three months after zzso zzso However, so far, little is known about the exact zzso mechanism of zzso effects on brain zzso We aimed to investigate the dynamics of brain function zzso of zzso patients using zzso functional zzso zzso 

Sixteen zzso patients who were scheduled for zzso and 16 healthy controls were included in the zzso zzso Ten patients repeated the zzso study in a median zzso follow-up zzso following zzso and seven in a median zzso zzso The zzso of low frequency fluctuation zzso an index reflecting the spontaneous brain activity, was compared between patients before zzso and healthy controls as well as patients zzso and zzso 

Compared with healthy controls, patients showed decreased zzso in frontal and zzso regions and increased zzso in zzso Patients who underwent the median zzso follow-up zzso examinations showed decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso in anterior zzso zzso zzso Of 10 patients in this group, 9 had moderate to large increase rate of zzso value zzso mean zzso in zzso while only one patient with the smallest increase rate of zzso value zzso in zzso who experienced three episodes of overt HE during the zzso zzso In the median zzso follow up zzso patients displayed persistently decreased zzso in zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso while no increased regional zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso alters zzso patients' zzso patterns in the resting state, which may imply different short-term and zzso effects on zzso patients, zzso both impairment and zzso mechanism of brain functions in zzso and continuous impairment of brain function 3 months following zzso
