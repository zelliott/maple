To propose a new zzso spin labeling zzso zzso method zzso slab zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso that takes advantage of the qualities of zzso 

zzso zzso alternate slab zzso zzso zzso for labeling blood to obtain a higher zzso ratio zzso zzso simulations were used to evaluate zzso zzso In zzso studies were performed to show the feasibility of zzso on five healthy zzso We performed a statistical analysis of the differences in zzso zzso zzso between zzso alternating inversion recovery zzso and zzso 

In signal zzso the signal obtained by zzso at zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the signal obtained by FAIR at zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso In an in zzso study, the zzso of FAIR zzso and FAIR zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso at zzso was significantly greater than that in FAIR at zzso 

The most significant potential advantage of zzso is its high zzso which takes advantage of the qualities of zzso This sequence can be easily applied in the clinical setting and will enable zzso to become more relevant for clinical zzso
