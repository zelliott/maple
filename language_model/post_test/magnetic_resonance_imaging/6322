A new variety of zzso materials for use in zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso has been developed and extensively tested, principally at 10 zzso and at room zzso The materials can be formed with a broad range of zzso and zzso representative of soft zzso They are zzso of various percentages of zzso animal hide zzso water, and zzso Small zzso of zzso and zzso prevent melting through 100 degrees C and prevent bacterial zzso The materials are easily zzso A thorough description of compositions and production procedures is zzso zzso exhibit about a zzso C rise in zzso zzso exhibit less than a zzso zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso stability is exhibited both for zzso properties and for absence of fluid zzso zzso results indicate that zzso depend on the zzso frequency in a similar way to that observed in soft zzso
