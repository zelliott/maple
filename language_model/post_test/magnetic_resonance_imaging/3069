To evaluate bone islands that showed increased zzso of zzso on skeletal zzso and to present an zzso for examining such zzso to avoid zzso in difficult zzso 

Over an zzso period, 20 patients (10 men and 10 women ranging in age from 33 to 82 zzso with bone islands that showed activity on skeletal zzso were examined with plain zzso (all zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 4 zzso For six of the patients the clinical presentation and the zzso studies suggested zzso which prompted biopsy and zzso zzso zzso study was also performed for six other patients in whom the bone islands were found zzso during evaluation for joint replacement surgery for zzso In the last eight patients the zzso exhibited the characteristic zzso features of zzso and these patients were followed for up to 3 years without zzso 

In all cases plain zzso showed the characteristic features of a bone zzso a zzso dense, sclerotic focus in the zzso bone with distinctive radiating zzso streaks zzso zzso that blended with the zzso of the host bone to create a feathered or zzso zzso zzso examination of zzso active bone islands showed increased zzso activity, and the zzso were marked by a mixture of compact and zzso zzso In the patients who did not undergo biopsy but were followed with zzso zzso there was no change in the size or appearance of the zzso 

The key to the correct diagnosis of bone island lies in the distinctive zzso features of zzso An zzso isolated sclerotic bone zzso showing feathered or brush borders is most likely an zzso regardless of its size or its activity on zzso zzso a practical zzso for examining bone islands should flow from their zzso features as observed on zzso and CT and zzso scans, rather than from their activity on zzso
