To determine the targeting error of a novel zzso prostate biopsy system that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso prostate zzso 

We performed zzso zzso on five prostate zzso (one zzso zzso and four zzso zzso Phantom zzso incorporates three zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso within phantom zzso are only zzso on zzso In both zzso the zzso zzso volume zzso are placed zzso The zzso were examined by zzso zzso Then three zzso zzso from one zzso in phantom zzso and from all zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were taken under zzso imaging zzso During intervention, a mix of blue ink and zzso was injected into each biopsy zzso Afterward, another zzso was zzso These zzso images were then fused again with the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the targeting error zzso between the planned and performed biopsy zzso could be zzso In addition, the procedural targeting error zzso between the virtually planned biopsy trajectory and the manually registered three-dimensional needle position of every single biopsy core taken was zzso 

The overall TE of the 39 biopsy zzso taken was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the highest TE in the zzso plane zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The procedural zzso which is provided zzso was zzso zzso on average zzso zzso zzso Comparing zzso and zzso there was no statistically significant difference zzso 

The TE of zzso zzso using our novel zzso prostate biopsy system is below 1 zzso and can be estimated in zzso by the automatically calculated procedural zzso Thus, zzso prostate zzso guided by the combination of zzso and US allow effective and precise examination of zzso zzso
