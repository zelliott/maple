Cancer therapy involving zzso zzso therapeutic agents often fails, zzso to inadequate zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso transport of a 19 zzso linear zzso zzso or zzso was studied in the present work in an attempt to identify transport barriers limiting the delivery of zzso to zzso zzso of four human melanoma zzso lines were included in the zzso The zzso of zzso was measured by zzso zzso recalled magnetic resonance imaging zzso The effective zzso zzso constant and the zzso influx constant of zzso were calculated from zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso tissue zzso The zzso of zzso was limited by the zzso transport and not by the zzso transport in all zzso zzso If the melanoma zzso used in this study are representative models of human cancer, our results suggest that strategies for increasing the delivery of zzso therapeutic agents to tumors should focus on improving the transport conditions in the zzso rather than enhancing the zzso of the zzso zzso
