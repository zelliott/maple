The aim of the current study is to test the ability to label and detect zzso embryonic stem zzso cardiovascular zzso cells zzso with cardiac magnetic resonance zzso using the novel contrast agent zzso zzso zzso 

Cell therapy shows great promise for the treatment of cardiovascular zzso An important limitation to previous clinical studies is the inability to accurately identify transplanted zzso zzso is a zzso zzso contrast agent that contains a zzso side chain and an zzso character that allows for zzso formation in an zzso zzso Previous studies reported that it is easily taken up and stored within the zzso of zzso stem cells, thereby allowing for zzso cell zzso Investigators in our laboratory have recently developed techniques for the robust generation of zzso We reasoned that zzso would be a promising agent for the in zzso detection of these cells after cardiac cell zzso 

zzso were labeled with zzso by zzso In zzso studies were performed to assess the impact of zzso on cell function and zzso A total of 500,000 zzso zzso or control zzso were injected into the zzso of mice with and without zzso zzso Mice were zzso zzso before and over a zzso time zzso after stem cell zzso Mice were then zzso and their hearts were zzso for zzso zzso 

In zzso studies demonstrated that zzso was easily zzso zzso stayed within cells after zzso and could be zzso using zzso and zzso zzso In zzso studies confirmed the efficacy of the agent for the detection of cells transplanted into the hearts of mice after zzso zzso A correspondence between zzso and zzso was zzso 

The results of the current study suggest that it is possible to identify and potentially track zzso zzso in zzso zzso models via zzso
