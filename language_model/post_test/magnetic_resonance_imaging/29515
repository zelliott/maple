To investigate the diagnostic value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso in patients with breast zzso 

zzso patients underwent breast zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso MR was used to identify the zzso after which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso was zzso Water, zzso and zzso zzso images were reconstructed from zzso zzso The area of the zzso was measured in the zzso and expressed relative to the background noise level zzso ratio zzso measured between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared between benign and zzso zzso as determined by zzso 

Three cases were considered technical failures on zzso Of the remaining 15 cases, on zzso eight were classified as zzso zzso and seven were zzso The zzso zzso from zzso tissue was significantly elevated compared to benign tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso are feasible in the human breast, and the zzso for zzso was significantly different between benign and zzso zzso The potential advantages of zzso over zzso zzso include the ability to assess multiple zzso as well as tissue with normal zzso appearance, as well as to perhaps gauge zzso borders and zzso into surrounding zzso
