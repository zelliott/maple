The close correlation between energy supply by blood vessels and energy consumption by cellular processes in the brain is the basis of blood zzso functional imaging zzso Regional differences in vascular density can be detected using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso in zzso might help to identify zzso distinct areas zzso in zzso It was reported previously that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso monkeys are characterized by a notably higher vascular density zzso higher than zzso zzso However, zzso have so far never been identified in zzso on the basis of their vascular zzso Here, we analyzed zzso of the primary visual zzso of zzso monkeys and zzso with respect to the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso By double zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to define the zzso and collagen type IV zzso to zzso the blood vessels, a close correlation between zzso metabolism and zzso was confirmed and zzso in zzso The vascular length density in zzso zzso zzso was on average zzso higher than in the zzso regions, a difference almost one order of magnitude smaller than previously zzso Thus, the vascular density that is closely associated with local average zzso activity is a structural equivalent of cerebral metabolism and blood zzso However, the quantitative differences in zzso between blob and zzso regions are small and below the zzso threshold of the zzso zzso imaging methods of zzso
