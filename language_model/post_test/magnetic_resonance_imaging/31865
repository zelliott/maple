There are two distinct zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso in zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso extensive spinal zzso zzso zzso extending over three or more zzso segments are characteristic of patients with zzso yet in zzso zzso of zzso patients also have zzso To clarify the distinction between zzso in zzso and zzso and to characterize the relationship between the presence of zzso and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings, we studied 142 patients with clinically zzso zzso of zzso onset and 12 patients with primary progressive zzso zzso by zzso of the whole spinal zzso and zzso The former was diagnosed by zzso criteria, including 57 with zzso 67 with zzso and 18 with zzso form of zzso while the latter by McDonald zzso The presence of zzso throughout the entire clinical course was significantly more common in zzso patients than in zzso patients, while brain zzso fulfilling the zzso criteria zzso brain zzso were significantly more common in zzso patients than zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients most frequently affected the upper to middle zzso cord, with either zzso or central gray matter zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso in zzso patients predominantly affected the peripheral white matter of the zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso also showed preferential involvement of the peripheral white matter of the zzso zzso One-third of zzso patients had neither zzso nor zzso brain zzso more than 10 years after disease zzso and showed significantly milder disability than zzso patients with zzso These findings suggest that zzso are zzso between zzso and zzso patients, and that there are distinct zzso of zzso in Japanese, according to clinical and zzso zzso
