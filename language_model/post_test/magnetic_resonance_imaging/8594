It has been proposed that zzso and zzso are zzso by distinct zzso of visual processing, the zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The visual brain in zzso Oxford University Press, zzso Such a distinction has been supported by a recent functional magnetic resonance zzso adaptation study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sharif, zzso Westwood, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A double zzso between sensitivity to changes in object identity and object orientation in the zzso and zzso visual zzso A human zzso zzso zzso 44, zzso which demonstrated selectivity to object identity but not object orientation within the zzso zzso and selectivity to object orientation but not object identity within the zzso zzso These results were interpreted as suggesting that changes to object identity (but not to zzso would alter the representation of the stimulus in the zzso system, whereas changes in object orientation (but not necessarily zzso would alter the coding of the stimulus within a zzso system concerned with zzso such as zzso If orientation sensitivity in the zzso stream does reflect such a potential for action, then this sensitivity should be specific to zzso zzso Using an zzso adaptation zzso we presented participants with an image of either a zzso or zzso zzso followed by the same image in either the original orientation or its mirror zzso One region within the zzso zzso the lateral zzso junction zzso was shown to be sensitive to orientation changes for zzso zzso this region did not show orientation sensitivity for zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the sensitivity to orientation changes in this region is specific to zzso objects, presumably because such changes affect the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso
