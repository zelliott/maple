A specific mouse whole body zzso and a dedicated zzso system at zzso T were coupled with an zzso zzso zzso echo zzso and zzso reconstruction technique to obtain zzso zzso dynamic zzso or zzso zzso The technique was used to zzso the real-time distribution of zzso zzso and zzso contrast agent zzso in a zzso mouse zzso zzso dynamic zzso imaging was performed with a fast imaging with zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso before and after CA injection zzso and zzso for 21 zzso The zzso resolution was 1 zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso was performed before and after zzso zzso and zzso particles of iron zzso CA injection for 45 zzso The zzso resolution was 1 zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso were determined in various mouse zzso The zzso zzso and zzso systems made it possible to acquire data with sufficient and homogeneous zzso ratio on the whole zzso The spatial resolution allowed adequate depiction of the major zzso blood vessels and brain zzso The distribution and the zzso of zzso and zzso contrasts upon contrast agent injection were also zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso is feasible at high spatial resolution in movie mode and can be applied successfully to zzso real-time contrast agent zzso This method should be effective in future zzso molecular imaging zzso
