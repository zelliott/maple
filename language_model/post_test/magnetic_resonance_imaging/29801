Peak zzso zzso detected in individual zzso in the zzso space in patients with zzso I zzso exceed those in similar locations in the zzso space in healthy zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the peak zzso zzso are decreased by zzso zzso 

A consecutive series of patients with symptomatic zzso I zzso was studied before and after zzso zzso with zzso phase contrast MR zzso zzso were calculated for each zzso within the zzso zzso at 14 time points throughout the cardiac zzso The greatest zzso measured in a zzso during the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso flow through the zzso zzso were tabulated for each patient before and after zzso The differences in these zzso between the zzso and zzso studies were tested for statistical significance by using a zzso zzso zzso test of paired zzso 

Eight patients with a zzso I zzso including four with a zzso were zzso Peak zzso zzso diminished after zzso zzso in six of the eight patients, and the average diminished significantly from zzso zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peak zzso zzso diminished in six of the eight zzso The average diminished from zzso zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso a change that nearly reached the significance level zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in patients with zzso I zzso decreases peak zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The study supports the hypothesis that successful treatment of the zzso I zzso is associated with improvement in zzso flow zzso
