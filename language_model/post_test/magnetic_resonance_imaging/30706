The purpose of this work is to assess the additional benefit of zzso zzso and zzso of contrast enhancement in the differential diagnosis of zzso breast zzso zzso women with suspected breast cancer were examined using X-ray zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso Dynamic contrast imaging was performed and relative enhancement at various zzso was zzso The dynamic data was also processed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso interpretation of high-resolution zzso images revealed a similar accuracy zzso compared to X-ray zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso zzso The best individual zzso calculated from the dynamic images was found to be the exchange rate constant which revealed a diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso When information from the zzso images and dynamic data was combined in a zzso zzso model a diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso was zzso In conclusion, MR imaging of small breast zzso is feasible and the incorporation of quantitative MR derived parameters is zzso
