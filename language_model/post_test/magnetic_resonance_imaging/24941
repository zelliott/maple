Recent imaging evidence suggests that normal brain zzso of the frontal zzso and association areas is a zzso process consisting of continued zzso and expansion of white matter volumes into the late 40s accompanied by complementary reductions in gray matter zzso The possibility that a zzso of this process may contribute to the syndrome of schizophrenia was investigated using magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso normal adult males and 35 males with schizophrenia underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso images were acquired using pulse sequences that zzso zzso zzso The age-related change in the gray to white matter ratio was used as a measure of zzso zzso in the schizophrenic subjects and contrasted to the age-related changes of the normal control zzso 

zzso analyses on frontal and zzso gray to white matter ratio yielded highly significant interactions of diagnosis and age for both regions zzso zzso and p zzso zzso In the normal group, both frontal and zzso gray to white matter ratios decreased significantly and zzso across the age zzso In contrast, neither ratio showed meaningful age-related change in the schizophrenia zzso Thus, differences in gray to white matter ratio between the groups increased markedly with age, driven primarily by the absence of a white matter volume expansion in the patient zzso 

The absence of the normal complementary volume changes in the gray and white matter with age in the schizophrenic sample suggests that this dynamic zzso process is zzso in adult schizophrenic zzso The importance of zzso to the continued maturation and normal functioning of the brain has implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of zzso
