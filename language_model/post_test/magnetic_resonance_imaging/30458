zzso advanced cervical zzso are generally managed by radiation and zzso zzso zzso assessment of zzso zzso in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer offers valuable information for individualized treatment planning with minimal morbidity when the zzso approach is zzso Although the pioneers of the technique proposed to sample only the zzso and common zzso zzso there is growing evidence that zzso radiation and chemotherapy does not control all the diseased pelvic zzso As a result, diseased but not fixed pelvic zzso amenable to an attempt at zzso removal should be zzso during the staging zzso The objective of this paper is to describe a new development of the zzso zzso zzso 

The left zzso approach routinely used for zzso and common zzso dissection has been extended to the pelvic area in eight zzso 

The left pelvic zzso including the removal of zzso zzso has been successfully completed in all cases, including two patients with zzso diseased zzso The right pelvic dissection has been successful in three out of four zzso 

The lateral zzso route used for the routine staging in our institution can be extended to the pelvic area without additional zzso zzso zzso thus reducing the zzso formation in patients candidates for definitive radiation zzso
