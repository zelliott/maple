Although MR zzso imaging zzso of the prostate has demonstrated clinical utility for the staging and monitoring of cancer extent, current acquisition methods are often inadequate in several zzso Conventional 180 degrees zzso can suffer from chemical shift zzso and have high zzso requirements that can exceed hardware limits in many prostate zzso zzso zzso water and zzso suppression are also critical to obtain zzso zzso While complete suppression of the zzso zzso resonance is zzso controlled partial suppression of water can provide a valuable phase and frequency reference for data analysis and an assessment of experimental success in cases in which all other zzso are zzso following zzso In this study, new zzso zzso zzso were developed to zzso chemical shift zzso errors and to provide zzso zzso with partial zzso of the water resonance and full zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso phase zzso was also included in the pulse design to provide zzso reduction in peak zzso zzso Patient studies using the new zzso demonstrated both feasibility and clear benefits in the reliability and zzso of prostate cancer zzso
