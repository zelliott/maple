To correlate site and diameter of brain zzso with zzso sparing in patients treated by zzso zzso technique on whole brain with simultaneously integrated boost zzso 

An zzso plan was calculated for brain zzso of zzso of zzso The whole brain dose was zzso zzso (15 zzso and zzso doses to brain zzso were 63 zzso (2 and zzso or zzso zzso zzso Plans were zzso and evaluated for zzso target coverage, prescription zzso to target volume, zzso index, and zzso zzso 

Fifteen brain zzso and zzso plan were zzso zzso volume was zzso and zzso avoidance volume was zzso Related to site of zzso the mean zzso dose was zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for frontal zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for deep brain structures, and zzso zzso for zzso zzso The mean zzso dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, excluding results relative to zzso brain zzso 

zzso more than size of zzso can adversely influence the zzso zzso Further investigation is necessary to meet definitive zzso
