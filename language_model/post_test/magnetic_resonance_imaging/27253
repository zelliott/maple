To correlate imaging and zzso findings in patients with large zzso aqueduct syndrome zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso evident on magnetic resonance imaging with available clinical and zzso data were selected from the databases of the study zzso Images were analyzed for zzso zzso and duct size, evidence of incomplete cochlear zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso duct was measured in two different locations: near the zzso zzso zzso and at the zzso between the common zzso and the zzso zzso Imaging data were correlated with zzso zzso 

There was significant correlation between ears for the zzso and zzso variables zzso zzso zzso patients had a fluctuating or progressive hearing loss, and 13 zzso remained stable (four were not zzso At the time of the analysis, zzso of ears had a profound zzso zzso correlation was identified between the presence of zzso signal zzso and worse pure tone average zzso zzso measures were significantly larger among ears with a progressive pattern of hearing loss when compared to those that were zzso Also, zzso correlated with zzso and the presence of progressive hearing loss, but zzso had no such a zzso 

Evidence of zzso zzso signal zzso and larger measures of zzso zzso when measured near the zzso zzso are markers of poorer hearing in these zzso By contrast, zzso measures of the zzso duct zzso have no correlation with zzso zzso
