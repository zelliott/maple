zzso facet zzso zzso are a cause of back pain and zzso with facet joint zzso the most common cause for zzso zzso Typically, zzso are zzso zzso on MR imaging, but the signal intensity is zzso Treatment options include zzso zzso and surgical zzso This study evaluates the relationship between zzso signal intensity on MR imaging and outcomes as it relates to zzso zzso success and need for subsequent zzso 

A retrospective review of 110 patients who underwent CT zzso zzso of symptomatic zzso was zzso The zzso were characterized by their zzso signal intensity on MR imaging and divided into 3 groups: high, zzso and low zzso signal zzso The rates of successful zzso zzso and need for subsequent surgery were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was technically successful in zzso of all zzso zzso zzso was successful in zzso and zzso of high and intermediate signal intensity zzso respectively, and in zzso of low signal intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High signal intensity zzso had lower zzso surgical rates zzso when compared with intermediate and low signal zzso as a group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and intermediate signal intensity zzso are easier to zzso perhaps because the zzso contain a higher proportion of fluid and are less zzso or zzso than zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso are less likely to need zzso
