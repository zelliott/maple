zzso changes in zzso and zzso levels remain controversial, being affected by inconsistent zzso for zzso and body fat distribution in the zzso In a zzso study on 210 Caucasians zzso women, zzso men, zzso years, zzso zzso zzso we investigated the effect of age on zzso levels independent of fat mass zzso measured by zzso visceral and subcutaneous zzso tissue volumes zzso and SAT assessed by zzso zzso zzso levels increased with age in both zzso whereas zzso levels decreased with age in women zzso There was an age-related increase in zzso (as a percentage of total zzso zzso zzso associated with a decrease in zzso zzso was the main predictor of zzso levels, with zzso % of the zzso explained by zzso in women and zzso % in zzso Independent of zzso age had a minor contribution to the zzso in zzso levels zzso % in women zzso The zzso in zzso levels explained by age was zzso % in women and zzso % in zzso In addition, independent and inverse contributions to the zzso in zzso levels were found for zzso SAT zzso additional zzso % in women and zzso % in zzso and zzso zzso additional zzso % in zzso In conclusion, age-related changes in zzso and zzso levels are opposite to each other and partly independent of zzso and body fat zzso zzso for zzso but not for body fat distribution is required for zzso zzso levels are adversely affected by subcutaneous and visceral trunk zzso
