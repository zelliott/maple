zzso has been increasingly zzso as a disorder of brain zzso in large part due to findings emerging from white matter and functional connectivity zzso zzso This work has focused primarily on zzso zzso however some evidence has suggested abnormalities in zzso structure and zzso zzso Here we examined functional connectivity between zzso points in the brain using a technique called zzso zzso connectivity zzso We performed zzso analyses on resting state zzso data from 23 healthy controls and 25 patients with schizophrenia or zzso zzso We found highly significant reductions in zzso in patients for a number of regions, particularly the zzso zzso the thalamus, and the zzso No regions of increased zzso were detected in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso extending into the zzso zzso was correlated with zzso Total zzso These results show substantial impairment of zzso coordination in zzso
