Patients with repaired zzso of zzso are monitored for pulmonary zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso We sought to compare measures of zzso and RV function on zzso to those on cardiac magnetic resonance zzso and to develop a new tool for assessing zzso by zzso 

Patients with repaired zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso had an zzso and zzso within 3 months of each zzso On zzso RV function was assessed by zzso zzso tissue imaging of the RV free wall and zzso zzso performance zzso The ratio of zzso and zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso of the main pulmonary artery was zzso zzso variables included RV ejection zzso RV volumes, and pulmonary zzso fraction zzso Pulmonary zzso was graded as mild zzso moderate zzso and severe zzso On zzso zzso was zzso and RV ejection fraction was zzso zzso had good sensitivity identifying cases with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but overestimated the amount of zzso when zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso showed moderate correlation with zzso on zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso of zzso and zzso corresponded with a zzso and zzso zzso integral of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso RV zzso performance index correlated modestly with RV ejection fraction zzso zzso 

This study suggests that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio may make a modest contribution to the overall assessment of zzso in patients with repaired zzso of zzso and warrants further zzso However, zzso continues to have a limited ability to zzso zzso and RV function as compared with zzso
