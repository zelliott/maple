Conventional zzso zzso used for zzso zzso in zzso resonance zzso MR zzso require increased sequence length compared to shorter zzso zzso This is because zzso zzso are longer than zzso zzso and the echo time period starts midway through zzso zzso for a fixed echo time, one must increase sequence length to accommodate conventional zzso zzso in zzso resonance zzso zzso We introduce improved zzso zzso zzso for which the echo time period starts near the beginning of zzso Instead of requiring increased sequence zzso these zzso extend into the long echo time periods common to zzso zzso The new zzso therefore alleviate the traditional zzso between sequence length and fat zzso We zzso demonstrate an zzso improvement in frame rate in a zzso resonance frequency imaging sequence compared to conventional zzso zzso We also introduce a novel zzso pulse design technique that is a hybrid of previous zzso and zzso techniques and that zzso advantages from zzso We zzso validate the zzso performance in suppressing zzso signal and in reducing sequence length compared to conventional zzso zzso
