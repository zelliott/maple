zzso zzso in term zzso often results from zzso obvious birth zzso blood zzso or vascular zzso but may occur without an obvious inciting zzso In this study, we review the clinical and zzso features of healthy term zzso presenting with spontaneous superficial zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

The clinical records and zzso studies of seven term zzso with spontaneous superficial zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso All underwent zzso MR imaging and 6 underwent CT within 72 hours of zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed in five, MR zzso in two, and MR zzso in zzso zzso MR imaging was performed in one zzso Clinical follow-up was done in four zzso 

All zzso had normal birth weights and high zzso zzso zzso All were delivered zzso (one with zzso assistance, and one with vacuum zzso No blood zzso were zzso Within 36 hours after delivery, all zzso presented with zzso or zzso or zzso zzso subsequently revealed superficial zzso and zzso zzso Four occurred in the zzso zzso lobe adjacent to the zzso The remaining three were located in the zzso zzso frontal zzso and lateral zzso lobe under the zzso zzso zzso diffusion in zzso adjacent to the zzso and zzso subcutaneous zzso swelling were apparent in five zzso zzso imaging showed no additional zzso MR zzso and MR zzso findings were zzso zzso MR imaging in one patient demonstrated zzso Four patients with short-term clinical follow-up were zzso zzso 

zzso superficial zzso and zzso zzso occurs in otherwise healthy term zzso The zzso is most often in the zzso lobe and in proximity to zzso accompanied by zzso zzso swelling and adjacent decreased zzso This pattern leads us to zzso local trauma with zzso or zzso zzso or zzso in the development of these zzso
