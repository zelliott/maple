The present study investigated the relationships between attention and other zzso processes prior to a response zzso task and the processes involved in the zzso zzso To achieve this, a mixed zzso design was employed to identify the functional areas activated during both zzso decision events and the block of trials following a visual cue introduced 2 to 7 zzso prior zzso zzso zzso for successful performance produced increases in zzso for both the cue period and the zzso itself in the zzso cortical zzso Furthermore, preparation produced zzso decreases in zzso areas zzso and zzso zzso argued to be responsible for monitoring internal emotional states, and these cue period zzso alone predicted subsequent success or zzso The results suggest that when cues are provided to signify the imminent requirement for behavioral control, successful performance results from a coordinated pattern of zzso zzso in zzso areas and zzso of zzso zzso
