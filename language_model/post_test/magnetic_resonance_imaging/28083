zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in zzso has been suggested recently as a possible zzso diagnostic test in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, differences between protocols and also within subjects may have led to inconsistent MRS abnormalities reported during and after zzso The aim of the current study was to detect zzso abnormalities in the leg muscles using in zzso zzso during the rest zzso 

Fourteen patients shown to be zzso and 22 patients zzso on the basis of in zzso zzso zzso tests according to the European zzso group protocol were compared to 36 control subjects using in zzso zzso during the rest zzso A score of MRS combined abnormalities was calculated from a zzso zzso function zzso 

The zzso group had a significantly zzso zzso zzso higher zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso than either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the control zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso group also exhibited a significantly zzso zzso zzso higher zzso zzso to zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso than either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the control zzso zzso zzso zzso Combining both MRS zzso 13 of the 14 zzso patients demonstrated abnormal MRS test results zzso value zzso zzso zzso 21 of the 22 zzso patients had normal MRS results zzso value zzso or zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of this threshold value were 93 and zzso zzso 

This study confirms that zzso could be useful for distinguishing zzso between zzso and zzso patients if several MRS zzso are zzso Moreover, the present MRS approach appears to be more reliable and easier than that used during zzso
