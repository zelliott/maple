To provide zzso zzso data for the precise zzso of zzso zzso of fetal brain in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

After abdominal and pelvic zzso zzso the zzso zzso was cut into serial zzso slices in correspondence with zzso in a low temperature laboratory to demonstrate the structures of fetal zzso 

zzso zzso determination of the zzso and rotating fetal zzso From the serial zzso sections of pregnant zzso at term, we concluded that, the zzso lying and zzso presentation fetal had run into maternal zzso and rotated and sloped to zzso zzso position and median zzso plane of the fetal was in correspondence with his zzso zzso Seven serial zzso sections of the fetal brain were obtained through lateral surface of the right cerebral hemisphere, lateral zzso internal zzso median zzso plane, middle zzso zzso zzso and lateral surface of the left cerebral zzso 

Through the comparison study between zzso sections and corresponding zzso of fetal brain at term, we could obtain zzso zzso structures and zzso of fetal brain, providing zzso demonstration of the zzso development of fetal brain and auxiliary diagnosis of ultrasound and zzso in pregnant zzso
