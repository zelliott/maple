Despite compelling evidence of zzso zzso as a risk factor for zzso stroke, its underlying mechanism remains zzso Our aim is to investigate whether serum zzso level is associated with the extent and location of cerebral zzso zzso and with large artery zzso zzso stroke in Korean zzso 

We analyzed data zzso collected over a zzso period on consecutive patients with stroke or zzso Based on an zzso study, a total of zzso patients were classified into four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carotid zzso zzso and combined zzso and zzso carotid zzso zzso Independent associations of zzso levels with the extent and location of cerebral zzso were zzso and zzso levels of zzso by the zzso criteria were zzso 

zzso levels of zzso stroke were significantly higher than those of the other four stroke zzso Patients with more advanced zzso zzso and zzso carotid zzso zzso tended to have higher zzso zzso In multiple zzso analysis, the third zzso zzso was the strongest risk factor for isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the fourth zzso zzso was the most powerful predictor for combined zzso and zzso carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that greatly elevated zzso levels are associated with zzso stroke and extensive burden of zzso zzso zzso which might offer indirect evidence of zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso
