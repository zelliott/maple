A number of reliable techniques have been described that can zzso zzso zzso from zzso images to preserve topographical characteristics of individual zzso but these tend to use in-house zzso We describe here an adaptation of the methods previously described by Kim et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zhang, zzso Harris, zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso method for the zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso but zzso commercially and, therefore, generally available zzso Using zzso we traced individual zzso and identified zzso zzso planes, and used a combination of three zzso plane views, manual limit tracing and zzso edge detection to zzso 13 zzso of zzso zzso from sets of serial zzso zzso We applied this technique to the baseline scans of the first seven subjects in the Edinburgh High zzso Study zzso who developed zzso and a matched group of healthy controls, to see if zzso lobe zzso volumes could predict the onset of zzso Two relatively inexperienced zzso developed these techniques in a short time period, and zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso while the mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso There were, however, no significant differences in zzso lobe zzso volumes between the two groups we zzso We have, therefore, developed a reliable zzso technique that requires relatively little zzso It is, however, a zzso process, and it remains uncertain whether it is more sensitive to early disease processes in zzso than are other zzso zzso
