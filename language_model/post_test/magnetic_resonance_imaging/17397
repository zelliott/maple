The growing zzso of motor tasks is one of the most visible changes in the developing zzso The zzso is known to play a central role in learning, planning, and performance of motor zzso We investigated the age dependency of motor zzso zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso right-handed subjects were zzso 11 children zzso age 9 years, range 6 - 10 zzso 10 adolescents zzso age 13 years, range 11 - 15 zzso and 11 adults zzso age 27 years, range 23 - 42 zzso The subjects performed a simple, paced unilateral motor task zzso squeezing of a ball with the right zzso Also, we set up a control experiment zzso stimulation using an alternating zzso zzso in which no age-related differences were zzso 

Compared to children, adults showed significantly increased zzso of the bilateral zzso cortex, zzso areas, the supplementary motor area, and the zzso In the visual stimulation experiment there were no age-related zzso 

Children show a significant difference in the degree of cortical zzso compared to adults when performing a simple motor zzso The change in zzso zzso patterns may reflect a maturation process of primary and secondary motor zzso
