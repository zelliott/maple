High sensitivity to magnetic zzso changes and accurate zzso of functional zzso are key requisites for pulse sequences used for zzso zzso This paper seeks to develop a framework for zzso the performance of various zzso sampling techniques in this respect, with special emphasis on spiral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their performance under influence of induced field zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso method for calculating synthetic MR images is developed and used to simulate zzso zzso experiments using zzso and zzso The data is then examined for zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Nine subjects are scanned with both techniques while performing a motor zzso zzso is used for zzso the experimental zzso The simulated spirals provide generally higher zzso scores at low zzso but lose more strength than zzso at higher zzso where zzso zzso is offset from the true zzso In the primary motor area spirals provide significantly higher zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso variation of zzso is higher in zzso direction than in zzso direction zzso zzso zzso In the low zzso areas spirals provide stronger zzso than zzso and less spatial zzso Thus, spirals are recommended for zzso in motor area and language zzso
