zzso evidence suggests that stress may orchestrate the engagement of multiple memory systems in the zzso In particular, stress is thought to favor zzso zzso procedural over zzso zzso zzso However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying these zzso effects of stress remain zzso especially in zzso Here, we targeted the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso memory systems in the human brain using a combination of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso blockade of the zzso 

Eighty healthy participants received the MR zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso and underwent a zzso or control manipulation before they performed, in the zzso a zzso task that can be supported by the zzso and the zzso zzso 

Stress after zzso did not affect learning performance but reduced explicit task knowledge and led to a relative increase in the use of more procedural learning zzso At the neural level, stress promoted zzso learning at the expense of zzso zzso zzso connectivity analyses showed that this shift was associated with altered zzso of the zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade before stress prevented the zzso shift toward zzso zzso procedural learning, same as the zzso zzso of zzso connectivity with zzso and zzso zzso but resulted in significantly impaired zzso 

Our findings indicate that the zzso shift from zzso to zzso zzso memory systems is zzso by the amygdala, required to preserve performance after stress, and dependent on the zzso
