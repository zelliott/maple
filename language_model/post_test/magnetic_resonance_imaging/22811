In zzso determination of zzso zzso zzso occupancy by selective zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso can aid in determination of zzso Previous studies used chronic zzso administration that may zzso zzso and used the zzso as reference region despite measurable zzso We examine the reference region and occupancy after acute zzso zzso 

We conducted zzso of human zzso zzso to determine an optimal reference zzso We zzso zzso binding using zzso and zzso input functions in 17 healthy zzso zzso PET scans were followed by a scan 4-6 days after 25 zzso to zzso of daily zzso Several modeling methods and outcome measures were zzso 

zzso gray matter is the optimal reference zzso zzso of zzso sites zzso at low plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso across all brain zzso There is a weak correlation between oral zzso and plasma zzso Occupancy measures vary based on the reference region and outcome measure zzso 

Occupancy studies and zzso zzso can help define the optimal reference zzso zzso tissue modeling using the optimal reference region returns the same occupancy measures as those determined using an zzso input zzso
