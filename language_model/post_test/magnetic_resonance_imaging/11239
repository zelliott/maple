zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare the neural zzso of three different types of spatial coding, which are implicated in crucial cognitive functions of our everyday life, such as zzso coordination and orientation in topographical zzso By manipulating the requested spatial reference during a task of relative distance zzso we directly compared zzso zzso and zzso spatial coding of the same realistic 3-D zzso Common zzso was found in bilateral zzso zzso and right frontal zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso (and parts of the zzso and zzso zzso were significantly more activated during the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was particularly involved in zzso zzso zzso strongly demonstrate that zzso zzso coding is restricted to the zzso stream and connected frontal regions, whereas a coding centered on external references requires both zzso and zzso regions, depending on the reference being a zzso object or a zzso
