A number of human brain areas showing a larger response to faces than to objects from different categories, or to scrambled faces, have been identified in zzso zzso Depending on the statistical criteria used, the set of areas can be zzso or zzso both at the local zzso of zzso and global zzso of zzso zzso Here we analyzed a zzso zzso functional zzso obtained in a large sample of right-handed participants zzso zzso zzso objects zzso zzso and their zzso counterparts zzso zzso were presented in a block design during a zzso task that was well matched for difficulty across zzso A conjunction contrast at the group level zzso and zzso identified six zzso in the zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso amygdala, and anterior zzso cortex, which were all strongly right zzso While the zzso showed the largest difference between faces and cars, it also showed the least zzso response, responding more to cars than scrambled zzso Moreover, the zzso larger response to scrambled faces than scrambled cars suggests that its zzso is partly due to low-level visual zzso In contrast, the pattern of zzso in the zzso points to a higher degree of zzso A zzso zzso mapping analysis suggests that zzso emerges first in the right zzso as compared to all other zzso Individual brain analyses support these zzso but also highlight the large amount of zzso zzso in terms of number, zzso extent and zzso of the areas responding zzso to faces in the human zzso zzso zzso This observation emphasizes the need to rely on different statistical thresholds across the whole brain and across individuals to define these areas, but also raises some concerns regarding any objective labeling of these areas to make them zzso across individual zzso This large-scale analysis helps understanding the set of zzso areas in the human brain, and encourages in-depth single participant analyses in which the whole set of areas is considered in each individual zzso
