To compare the diagnostic sensitivity of diffusion weighted images with that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques in patients presenting within 24 hours of onset of symptoms of acute cerebral zzso a one year prospective study was conducted in the department of zzso of Christian Medical College and Hospital, zzso Patients with signs and symptoms of cerebral zzso presenting within 24 hours of onset were included in the zzso MR imaging was performed with zzso zzso system zzso GE Medical systems) with zzso zzso A total of 40 patients were zzso with majority zzso in the zzso years age zzso zzso of patients presented to the hospital after 12 hours of symptom zzso Eight patients presented within three hours of zzso In this group of 8 patients conventional MR was positive in only 5 patients zzso while diffusion weighted imaging was positive in all 8 zzso The time of presentation is a crucial factor in determining the therapeutic options for a patient with zzso zzso weighted imaging is more sensitive than conventional zzso in detecting cerebral zzso changes in patients presenting less than 24 hours from the onset of zzso
