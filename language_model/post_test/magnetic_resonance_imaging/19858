Most of the currently used methods for functional brain imaging do not zzso zzso activity directly but rather rely on the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso but the specific mechanisms are still poorly zzso To investigate the role of the two major zzso zzso receptors zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso for the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signals, we used zzso zzso of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso together with recordings of zzso evoked zzso zzso during electrical zzso stimulation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) responses but reduced the zzso only mildly zzso zzso zzso application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased both the zzso response zzso zzso zzso 13 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 and zzso zzso zzso for 5 and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso zzso zzso 4) and the zzso (up to zzso These data indicate that the interaction of zzso with its zzso and/or zzso receptors is necessary for the generation of blood flow and zzso responses and illustrate the differential role of zzso and zzso in the signaling chain leading from increased zzso activity to the zzso response in the zzso zzso
