zzso timing is essential for functional zzso data zzso zzso are commonly measured using repeated zzso imaging methods, resulting in a zzso offset between zzso To compensate for this timing difference, zzso correction zzso zzso data zzso has been used as an zzso zzso step for more than zzso zzso However, there has been an ongoing debate about the effectiveness and zzso of this zzso This paper presents the first elaborated analysis of the impact of the zzso effect on simulated data for different zzso zzso and measurement zzso taking into account data noise and smoothing zzso Here we show, depending on repetition time and paradigm design, zzso effects can significantly impair zzso results and zzso correction methods can successfully compensate for these effects and therefore increase the zzso of the data zzso In addition, our results from simulated data were supported by empirical in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso correction should be included in the zzso zzso zzso
