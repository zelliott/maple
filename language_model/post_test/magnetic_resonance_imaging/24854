A wide variety of spinal zzso pathology traditionally has been treated from a zzso zzso zzso using standard zzso zzso This approach has been successful in treating the zzso however, it carries a risk of zzso complications including zzso zzso wound infection, and spinal zzso The authors describe a minimally invasive surgical zzso approach to treating spinal zzso pathology with a low rate of zzso zzso 

Through a retrospective review of a zzso collected surgical database, the authors identified 26 patients who underwent 27 surgeries via an zzso approach for zzso pathology of the zzso Using a zzso zzso system and an operative zzso the authors were able to treat all patients with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso They then collected data regarding operative blood loss, length of stay, imaging zzso and zzso 

Eight zzso 8 zzso and 11 zzso zzso pathological entities, which included 14 zzso zzso 4 zzso I zzso 4 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 1 zzso and 1 chronic visceral pain, were treated via an zzso zzso The average blood loss was 197 zzso and the average hospital stay was 3 zzso One patient had to return to the operating room for zzso wound zzso One patient required zzso 18 months after the initial surgery for recurrence of the initial zzso There was no zzso zzso no infection, and no spinal instability associated with the initial surgery on zzso 

zzso spinal pathology can be safely and effectively treated with zzso approaches without an increased risk of neurological zzso This approach may also offer a reduced zzso length of stay, risk of zzso zzso and risk of future spinal zzso
