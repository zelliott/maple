In addition to the patient's history and a thorough clinical investigation, magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso joint zzso has been introduced to complete the findings for the diagnosis of internal zzso of the zzso However, zzso zzso is desirable to help us to understand the mechanism of internal zzso This information is given for example by electronic zzso recording zzso The lack of any ability to assess joint function zzso in zzso is a point of zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso should be now zzso In this investigation 21 patients with zzso disorders were examined using both conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the diagnosis of an anterior displaced disc with or without reduction in 18 cases zzso it was only necessary to consider two zzso zzso a closed mouth position and a zzso open mouth zzso zzso showed there was no advantage in using zzso zzso zzso and resolution of the zzso zzso were shown to be better and so additional findings such as joint zzso and disc deformation could be diagnosed on zzso zzso with greater zzso Only in three zzso cases was the dynamic information from zzso mode useful for the diagnosis of the displacement of the zzso
