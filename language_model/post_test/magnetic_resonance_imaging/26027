The use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in neurosurgery has increased zzso and a variety of concepts have recently been zzso Although the feasibility of the procedure has been demonstrated zzso no conclusive analysis of its effects on the surgical procedures, the extent of tumor zzso and zzso or its possible problems, has been zzso 

Of 242 operations performed with zzso zzso 97 procedures for zzso zzso treatment were analyzed with respect to zzso imaging results and zzso zzso Analysis of the images included assessment of imaging artifacts, image quality, and extent of tumor zzso Patients were monitored to determine zzso zzso survival times, zzso zzso and morbidity zzso 

No zzso complications related to the imaging procedure were zzso Image quality was good or fair in zzso of the zzso Different types of surgically induced imaging changes could be zzso In 56 cases, zzso was continued using navigation with zzso zzso data sets zzso zzso zzso zzso For high-grade zzso the percentage of cases in which residual tumor was identified by zzso could be significantly reduced from zzso zzso to zzso zzso which was paralleled by a significant increase in survival times for patients without residual zzso zzso and morbidity rates were within the ranges reported for other zzso 

zzso zzso is safe and allows reliable updating of zzso data, with compensation for brain zzso zzso induced imaging changes, which have been identified as a possible problem with zzso zzso in general, necessitated comparisons with zzso scans and require future zzso The extent of tumor removal and survival times were increased zzso Overall, patients seemed to benefit from the zzso
