When diagnostic tests are repeated and combined, a number of schemes may be zzso zzso for their interpretations are zzso 

Three combination schemes, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso To evaluate these schemes, dependency by specifying zzso values zzso repeated test agreement was zzso In a pilot study, the combined zzso of magnetic resonance imaging using six different pulse sequences of zzso collateral ligaments of the elbows of 28 zzso with eight having zzso artificially created zzso were zzso Images were evaluated simultaneously by using a zzso zzso zzso For each pulse zzso individuals for whom the diagnosis varied from once to three repetitions were zzso 

zzso M improves diagnostic accuracy when sensitivity and specificity of a single test exceed zzso with zzso improvement at zzso Under scheme A, sensitivity decreases to zzso Under scheme O, sensitivity increases to zzso zzso M yields a small improvement, reaching zzso Under scheme A, specificity increases to zzso Under scheme O, specificity decreases to zzso zzso M also yields a small improvement, reaching zzso 

zzso A is recommended for ruling in diagnoses, scheme O is recommended for ruling out diagnoses, and scheme M is zzso zzso different schemes may be used to zzso the target diagnostic zzso
