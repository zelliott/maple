zzso pain zzso is a common condition and often presents without evidence of arthritis on zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has shown good correlation between zzso and zzso relaxation times and changes in the cartilage zzso but as of yet, there are limited data in the literature utilizing these zzso to evaluate the zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso tilt will show longer zzso relaxation times in the lateral zzso of their zzso but no difference in zzso zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

A total of 20 patients aged 18 to 45 years with anterior knee pain, zzso zzso and no evidence of zzso were identified and zzso to undergo zzso including zzso zzso and zzso relaxation time mapping zzso zzso cartilage was segmented on zzso zzso recalled acquisition in steady state zzso images using a zzso zzso These results were then compared with those of 10 zzso zzso 

The mean zzso values of the lateral zzso were significantly elevated in patients with zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso while no significant difference was observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso higher mean zzso values were noted in the lateral zzso of the patients with zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while no significant differences in zzso values were observed between the zzso and lateral zzso of the controls zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were noted in zzso relaxation zzso A high correlation was noted between the mean zzso values of the whole zzso of patients with zzso and the degree of zzso tilt zzso zzso zzso 

There were significantly higher zzso values in the lateral zzso of patients with zzso and zzso tilt that were not seen in control zzso These higher values approach the numbers seen in patients with early zzso
