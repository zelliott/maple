The objectives of this study were to develop protocols that measure abdominal fat and calf muscle lipids with magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso respectively, at 3 T and to examine the correlation between these parameters and insulin zzso 

Ten zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso subjects and five zzso zzso zzso were scanned at 3 zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso were segmented zzso from abdominal zzso zzso lipids zzso in calf muscles were zzso with zzso MRS in both zzso and zzso anterior muscles and with magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso 

The average zzso of variation zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and zzso for SAT and zzso estimates, zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in zzso anterior and zzso with zzso zzso based on zzso zzso were significantly zzso correlated with zzso disposal rate, as measured by a zzso zzso zzso volume correlated significantly with zzso zzso based on zzso for zzso subjects was significantly greater than that for IS subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and MRS techniques provide a robust zzso measurement of abdominal fat and muscle zzso which are correlated with insulin action in zzso
