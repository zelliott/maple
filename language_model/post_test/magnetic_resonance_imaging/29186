zzso disease zzso is a rare zzso disease that typically causes a rapidly progressive zzso and leads to death in less than 1 zzso Although a few anecdotal reports suggest that zzso magnetic resonance imaging may help substantiate zzso diagnosis of zzso detailed correlation between zzso data and clinical, zzso and zzso parameters is not zzso 

Signal abnormalities on zzso images in 3 consecutive patients with probable zzso were correlated with zzso features, zzso findings, and functional images with either zzso zzso zzso or single zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of abnormalities on zzso image, not apparent on routine magnetic resonance images, correlated closely with clinical manifestations of zzso The zzso distribution of signal zzso on zzso image corresponded with abnormal metabolism or zzso on zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 2 cases, the zzso of diffusion abnormalities correlated with periodic sharp wave activity on zzso 

These findings extend previous observations that suggested a diagnostic and zzso utility of zzso imaging in zzso
