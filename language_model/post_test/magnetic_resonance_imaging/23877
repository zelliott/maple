We compared the zzso functional anatomy of zzso right index finger movement as revealed by zzso water zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso Image data sets were acquired with both techniques on a group of eight subjects, zzso zzso in the zzso space and subsequently processed in order to get identical zzso and degrees of zzso zzso PET and zzso zzso maps were found zzso in the left primary zzso area zzso bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral zzso zzso zzso left zzso left inferior zzso zzso right middle frontal zzso and right zzso In those regions the mean distance between PET and zzso local zzso was zzso zzso zzso detected additional zzso in the right zzso zzso right zzso zzso right inferior zzso zzso and bilateral zzso whereas PET demonstrated a higher detection sensitivity at the deep zzso zzso PET and zzso percentage signal variations were found zzso related by a factor around 10, both within the zzso and across a set of distributed local zzso However, in most cases, zzso was more sensitive than zzso as assessed by zzso zzso Finally the pattern of zzso was markedly dissimilar between the two techniques, possibly due to differences in the zzso control zzso
