To evaluate the effects of improved zzso control on the abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat in type 1 zzso 

Sixteen subjects were enrolled for this zzso zzso The goal was to achieve normal zzso zzso zzso zzso in our zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat areas at the zzso disk zzso zzso and energy intake were assessed using a weekly recall and food diary zzso Plasma zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured at baseline and at 6 zzso 

Twelve subjects completed the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso at zzso and abdominal visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso dropped to zzso zzso zzso at 6 months zzso zzso zzso There was a zzso zzso weight change in 6 months zzso zzso zzso whereas the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratios changed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Daily zzso zzso zzso of activity at 6 months correlated with a decrease in the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratios zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso level changes correlated zzso with the changes in the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio zzso zzso zzso 

The visceral to subcutaneous fat changes had a negative correlation with the physical activity zzso at 6 months but not with zzso changes in this zzso The correlation between the changes in zzso and the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratios is intriguing, but a larger study may be needed to confirm this zzso
