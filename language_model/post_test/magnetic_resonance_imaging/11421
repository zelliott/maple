BACKGROUND AND zzso Geriatric depression is often thought to differ from that at other times of zzso Recently, several studies have shown that the zzso of white matter zzso zzso identified by brain zzso is higher in patients with geriatric depression than in healthy elderly subjects, but a consensus has not yet been reached on the relationship between the severity of white matter zzso and either cognitive impairment or depressive zzso 

zzso patients aged 50 to 75 years with major depression were divided into two groups based on age at onset of zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso group (20 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso group (27 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso The severity of zzso white matter zzso on zzso was classified by region, then a zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso focusing on the white matter of the frontal zzso zzso zzso tests and evaluation of depressive symptoms were zzso 

The severity of the deep white matter zzso the deterioration of cognitive function related to zzso brain system and zzso depressive symptoms were all more pronounced in the zzso group compared with those in the zzso zzso It was further observed that the more severe the deep white matter zzso the lower the levels of zzso With the age of onset as the zzso the patients with moderate deep white matter zzso had more pronounced cognitive impairment and zzso depressive symptoms than those with none and/or mild zzso 

These results suggest that zzso type cognitive impairment and the persistence of depressive symptoms in geriatric depression is related to moderate deep white matter zzso more often complicated in the zzso zzso The zzso findings were suggested to be a useful indicator of zzso loss in the white matter of the frontal zzso which precedes cognitive zzso
