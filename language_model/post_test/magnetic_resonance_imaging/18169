The zzso zzso collateral ligament zzso is the primary stabilizer against zzso stress on the zzso The anatomy of the 3 zzso of the zzso has been well studied in adults, but our review of the English literature found no study evaluating the origin of the zzso in a large group of zzso zzso immature elbows as it relates to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso resonance zzso images of 44 zzso immature elbows zzso 5 to 17 zzso with no history of fracture were evaluated by 2 independent musculoskeletal zzso a zzso zzso surgeon with fellowship training in pediatric zzso and an zzso surgery zzso The location of the origin of the anterior bundle of the zzso zzso was identified and its distance from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

All 44 images showed that the zzso attached either on or zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The average distance from the origin of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso There was no statistically significant relationship between age and location of the zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso 

In the zzso immature elbow, the zzso originates zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 

Although treatment of zzso zzso zzso fractures remains controversial, understanding the relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso may be helpful in making decisions regarding fracture zzso
