The role of attention in zzso integration zzso is presently uncertain, with some studies supporting an zzso zzso process and others suggesting possible zzso through selective zzso The goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to investigate the role of spatial attention on the processing of zzso audiovisual speech stimuli (here indexing zzso zzso were presented with two simultaneous visual zzso zzso lips in the left and right visual zzso plus a single central audio stream zzso zzso In the selective attention conditions, the auditory stream was zzso with one of the two visual zzso zzso attended to either the zzso or the zzso visual zzso allowing the comparison of brain activity for attended zzso unattended zzso while the amount of zzso information in the environment and the overall zzso requirements were held zzso zzso mapping and a zzso zzso zzso were used to identify early visual areas and to zzso regions responding to zzso visual zzso zzso showed that attention to the zzso audiovisual stimulus resulted in increased zzso in the superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso visual cortex, and superior zzso These findings demonstrate that audiovisual integration and spatial attention jointly interact to influence activity in an extensive network of brain areas, including zzso regions, early zzso visual zzso and zzso structures that together contribute to the perception of a fused audiovisual zzso
