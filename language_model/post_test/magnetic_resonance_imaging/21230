zzso zzso associated with zzso I zzso have received scant attention in the medical zzso zzso we describe our experience and long-term outcome in patients with this zzso 

A retrospective analysis of a zzso I database was zzso Patients known to have an associated zzso were then further analyzed for the type of zzso zzso When an eccentric zzso was noted, the symptoms and zzso course of these patients were zzso 

Of well over 500 operative cases of zzso I zzso roughly 70 % zzso and minimally zzso central canals were zzso were found to have an associated zzso Of these, four patients were found to have an eccentrically positioned zzso Three of these cases presented with symptoms zzso to the side of the eccentric zzso zzso cases with both a central and eccentrically located zzso were found to have a greater decrease in the size of the central portion of their zzso compared to the eccentrically located zzso zzso decreased in all zzso 

The minority of our patients with zzso zzso were found to have an eccentrically located zzso Of these, most will have symptoms localized to the abnormal zzso zzso and these may not decrease in size as much as centrally located zzso following zzso zzso zzso However, all symptoms decreased in those zzso Based on the literature, zzso zzso is more likely to result in an eccentrically placed zzso The mechanism for this is yet to be zzso
