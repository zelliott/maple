The aim of this work was to evaluate the clinic usefulness of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the staging after surgery, zzso and chemotherapy of the zzso germ cells zzso of the zzso The Authors discussed the CT and MR zzso criteria for the diagnosis of zzso zzso of the zzso germ cells zzso and delineated their CT and MR zzso appearances in zzso The density of the residual mass on CT was classified as solid, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso formed as a complication respectively of zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso to represent zzso disease on post operative staging CT zzso Early recognition of this complication are crucial if unnecessary treatment is to be zzso Finally the Authors zzso in patients affected from zzso germ cells zzso of the zzso the possibility to characterize with CT and MR imaging the zzso zzso The density and character of the residual mass on CT scan did not reliably predict the zzso On the basis of tumor consistency and signal intensity in zzso and zzso weighted images, MR cannot yet warrant any conclusion about the ultimate effect of zzso
