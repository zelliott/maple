Treatment with gamma knife zzso zzso provides adequate short-term pain control in about zzso of the patients with intractable zzso zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether the presence of zzso contact zzso at the root entry zone of the zzso nerve on zzso knife MR imaging predicts an increased likelihood of an adequate response to zzso We studied 40 consecutive patients who underwent zzso for treatment of intractable zzso Two zzso blinded to the side of symptoms analyzed zzso constructive interference in steady state zzso images to determine the presence of zzso by zzso An adequate response was defined as freedom from pain with or without reduced need for medical zzso zzso short-term response to zzso was seen in 29 zzso of 40 zzso zzso was seen in 30 of the 40 zzso Twenty-five zzso of 30 patients with zzso had adequate short-term response to zzso Only four zzso of the 10 patients without zzso had adequate response to zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso were seven times more likely to have an adequate response to zzso than those without zzso zzso ratio zzso presence of zzso on zzso MR imaging predicts an increased likelihood of an adequate response to zzso
