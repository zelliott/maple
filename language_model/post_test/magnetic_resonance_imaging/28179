To define the site of pathology in Tourette's syndrome zzso we performed a zzso zzso study of zzso zzso structures and lateral zzso on 37 children with this disorder and 18 zzso There were no statistically significant differences in the size of the right or left zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in these zzso In contrast, there were significant differences for measures of symmetry in the zzso and the zzso zzso Virtually all controls (17 zzso and one zzso had a zzso predominance of the zzso whereas in 13 of 37 zzso subjects, a right predominance exceeded that of any zzso zzso comparisons among zzso patients, with zzso zzso zzso or without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disorder zzso and controls showed significant differences for the volume of the left zzso zzso and for zzso zzso Post hoc evaluations showed that in the zzso + zzso group, the volume of the left zzso zzso was significantly smaller than the volume of the right and that zzso asymmetry was due to a greater zzso predominance in the zzso zzso This study lends further support to proposals that claim the zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso and also suggests that the zzso problem of zzso is related to regional changes that differ from those primarily associated with zzso
