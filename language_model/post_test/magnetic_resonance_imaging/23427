To evaluate a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique which allows the zzso analysis of cardiovascular zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model by means of a clinical zzso 

Eight rats underwent zzso zzso surgery and four rats served as zzso zzso and cardiac zzso as well as cardiac function was assessed from Week 3 to 12 using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 T in one imaging zzso 

zzso surgery resulted in progressive zzso zzso and a subsequent cardiac zzso This procedure led to downstream zzso of the zzso vein and inferior zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively (3 zzso To accommodate the increased returning blood volume, cardiac output zzso increased significantly zzso 6 zzso This was caused by increased zzso volume zzso stroke volume zzso and heart rate zzso consistent with an increased volume zzso A continuous increase in heart weight peaked at 12 zzso This increase combined with a distinct zzso left zzso zzso implied eccentric zzso 

Small zzso zzso is feasible and clearly depicts zzso maturation and cardiac zzso This technique proved to be a valuable tool for zzso in zzso monitoring in this model, which strongly resembles clinical findings in zzso zzso
