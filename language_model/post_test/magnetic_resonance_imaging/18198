zzso is the zzso technique for zzso measurement of human brain zzso However, its utility is limited by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between zzso activity and the zzso zzso Though the primary peak of the zzso response is modulated by zzso activity, the origin of the typically negative zzso signal is poorly understood and its zzso assumed to zzso with the primary zzso We use simultaneous recordings of zzso with blood zzso zzso zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso zzso during unilateral median nerve stimulation to show that the zzso zzso signal is zzso zzso We observe high spatial agreement between concurrent zzso and zzso responses to median nerve zzso with primary signal increases in zzso zzso zzso and primary signal decreases in zzso zzso zzso During the zzso period, the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso signal in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso depends on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, which is often considered to reflect cortical zzso along with zzso changes in zzso and zzso Therefore we present conclusive evidence that the zzso time course represents a zzso signature of at least two distinct zzso zzso of zzso activity, substantially improving understanding of the origin of the zzso response and increasing the potential zzso of brain function provided by zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso responses may be required for the zzso of the entire sensory network to enable a return to zzso activity zzso
