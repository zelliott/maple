Independent zzso zzso allows three-dimensional imaging of multiple volumes without zzso the space between volumes, thus reducing scan zzso Parallel imaging further zzso data acquisition by exploiting zzso sensitivity differences between zzso This work compared bilateral breast image quality from zzso parallel imaging reconstruction methods such as modified sensitivity zzso generalized zzso partially parallel acquisitions and zzso reconstruction for Cartesian sampling zzso for data with and without zzso zzso A study showed an improvement of image quality by incorporating zzso zzso zzso factors measured from phantom images were more zzso and lower on average when zzso zzso was used for both zzso and zzso zzso The resulting improved zzso ratio zzso was validated for in zzso images as well using ARC instead of zzso illustrating average zzso efficiency increases in zzso by zzso and ARC by zzso based on region of interest zzso Furthermore, zzso artifacts from zzso reconstruction were reduced when zzso zzso was zzso Overall, zzso zzso with parallel imaging improved image quality and efficiency for zzso bilateral breast zzso
