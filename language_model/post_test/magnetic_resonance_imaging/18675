zzso models, originally proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso 36 (1988) zzso and zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Vision 1 (1988) zzso in 1988, have been widely used in medical image zzso However, they manifest two well-known zzso the lack of an appropriate long-range force to drive the model surface towards the object boundary and poor performance at high zzso boundaries (such as zzso due to the zzso intrinsic zzso zzso In this paper, a new zzso force with local control is zzso The local control is used to devise a long-range force, referred to as the zzso force, and a corner fitting zzso The zzso force enables the model surface to expand and shrink without a limit in zzso The corner fitting force propels the model surface to fit zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the model surface is driven to the object boundary by the new forces even if the initial estimate is not close and the object is zzso or has a high local zzso
