The zzso position is often considered optimal for direct zzso Another concept of airway zzso involving a zzso zzso axis and two zzso has also been zzso We investigated whether this theory can be supported zzso and if it supports the zzso position as being optimal for direct zzso 

zzso resonance imaging scans were performed in 42 normal adult zzso The airway passage was divided into two zzso zzso zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in the neutral, extension, head lift, and zzso zzso The airway passage, point of inflection (where the two zzso zzso its zzso and the line of sight were plotted on each zzso 

The point of inflection lay within the zzso zzso in all zzso The head lift and zzso positions caused the zzso to the point of inflection to approximate the horizontal zzso The zzso extension, and head lift positions caused a reduction in the area between the line of sight and the airway curve compared with the neutral zzso 

A zzso theory is proposed as a basis for explaining airway zzso The changes in these zzso with head and neck positioning support the zzso position as optimal for direct zzso Application of this new concept to other forms of zzso should be zzso
