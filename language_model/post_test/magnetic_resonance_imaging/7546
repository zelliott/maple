The uncertainty over the true zzso changes in brains with major depressive disorder zzso zzso the necessity of comprehensive studies with zzso structural brain imaging zzso This study aimed to evaluate the differences in cortical zzso cortical and zzso volume, and white matter integrity between first episode, zzso zzso patients and healthy zzso 

zzso with their first episode of zzso whose illness duration had not exceeded 6 months zzso were enrolled in this study and were compared to zzso zzso and education zzso healthy controls zzso All participants were subjected to zzso structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso We used an automated procedure of zzso and zzso spatial statistics zzso to analyze differences in cortical zzso cortical and zzso volume, and white matter integrity between two zzso 

The patients with first episode zzso exhibited significantly reduced cortical volume in the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso compared to healthy zzso We also observed altered white matter integrity in the body of the corpus zzso zzso reduced cortical volume of the zzso middle frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso and enlarged zzso volume in the first episode zzso zzso 

We relied on a relatively small sample size and cortical volume reduction in several brain regions was not zzso in the analysis of cortical zzso 

Using zzso imaging analyses on zzso first episode zzso patients, we demonstrated fundamental structural zzso of brain gray and white matter, such as reduced cortical volume of the zzso zzso and white matter integrity in the body of the corpus zzso
