We present a simple and intuitive means for determining the flip angles zzso required for smooth transitions between zzso zzso steady states zzso in fast spin echo zzso imaging with variable zzso zzso echo zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of single and multiple transition zzso to successfully vary zzso zzso while retaining high signal zzso The zzso interpretation presented here is consistent with previous zzso techniques and permits accurate zzso predictions along the echo zzso
