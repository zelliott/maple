To evaluate whether using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso of the prostate increases the yield of cancer in a high-risk population, and in a subset analysis to compare the yield with zzso (3 zzso vs lower field zzso zzso zzso 

Between March 2003 and November 2005, 26 consecutive patients had zzso before their zzso biopsy of the prostate zzso age 62 years, range zzso The median zzso zzso zzso level was zzso zzso zzso All patients had at least one previous negative prostate biopsy zzso 3, range zzso zzso patients had at least one risk factor for prostate cancer zzso history, high zzso zzso low percentage of free zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso small zzso proliferation on previous zzso zzso studies consisted of zzso and dynamic zzso zzso imaging zzso 

There was a close correlation between zzso and zzso images zzso agreement, zzso Neither zzso nor zzso imaging correlated with a higher yield for cancer on final biopsy zzso positive zzso value, zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Combining the two methods did not improve the cancer zzso There was no significant difference in the probability of cancer based on zzso T or 3 T imaging zzso vs zzso zzso 

Although zzso before zzso zzso tended to give higher cancer yields the difference was not statistically zzso zzso for this might include zzso zzso of the zzso findings and the biopsy zzso Better methods for fusing zzso and zzso images are presently being developed at our institution to allow more accurate zzso
