The role of body fat content and distribution in infants is becoming an area of increasing interest, especially as perception of its function appears to be rapidly zzso Although a number of methods are available to estimate body fat content in adults, many are of limited use in zzso especially in the context of regional distribution and internal zzso In this study we developed and implemented a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso protocol that allows fast and zzso zzso of zzso tissue content in newborn zzso with an zzso zzso of zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso The percentage total body fat for this cohort of infants ranged from zzso zzso and standard zzso zzso zzso zzso which agrees closely with published zzso zzso fat accounted for just over zzso of the total body fat, whereas internal fat corresponded to almost zzso most of which was zzso zzso There were no gender differences in total or regional body fat zzso These results show that zzso zzso can be readily applied to the study of zzso tissue content and distribution in newborn zzso Furthermore, its zzso nature makes it an ideal method for zzso and zzso studies in newborn zzso
