To correlate cross sections of the zzso notch to cross sections of the anterior cruciate ligament zzso and to analyze zzso differences in notch and zzso zzso with an attempt to explain the observation that a small zzso notch and the female gender zzso to a zzso of the zzso 

High resolution MR imaging was performed on a zzso T magnet using a dedicated zzso in ten left and ten right knee zzso of 20 volunteers (10 male, 10 female, mean age 25 zzso with no history of knee zzso Continuous zzso zzso MR images perpendicular to the zzso axis of the zzso were zzso zzso areas of the zzso zzso at the contact area to the zzso cruciate ligament were zzso For imaging and evaluation of the zzso limits of the zzso notch a zzso of the knee was zzso zzso middle and zzso planes of the zzso notch were calculated and analyzed for measurement of the notch area AN and notch zzso index zzso The ratio of the zzso zzso area of the zzso and the zzso area of the notch was defined as the zzso notch index zzso and used as a standardized tool for zzso For statistical zzso linear zzso analysis was zzso Mean values between male and female were compared using a zzso zzso In addition, five matched pairs of male and female volunteers of same height were zzso 

Mean zzso size of the zzso at the crossing with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso area to the notch areas on all three planes and zzso zzso zzso between the sexes revealed that female participants had significantly smaller zzso areas of the zzso the notch areas, the zzso and zzso This difference was found for both the complete study group and the matched pairs of same zzso 

The smaller the zzso notch the smaller the zzso area of the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso of the zzso at the anterior and zzso roof of the zzso a zzso weaker zzso may be the reason for disposition to an zzso zzso in patients with a small zzso zzso Women have a thinner zzso zzso than men of the same height which may be one of the critical zzso factors that zzso women to an zzso zzso
