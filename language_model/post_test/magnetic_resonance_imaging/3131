In a prospective study comparing zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the staging of zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso patients were noted to have zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The recognition of zzso abnormalities depends on the familiarity of the normal zzso CT and zzso appearances of the normal zzso in the remaining 97 zzso patients were zzso The zzso were symmetrical and fat was seen in all zzso and in zzso of the CT zzso There was destruction of the zzso process in 10 zzso patients and a further 10 patients showed erosion of the zzso zzso Superior zzso from the zzso into the inferior zzso zzso was demonstrated in 7 zzso zzso zzso spread via the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso could be seen in 10 zzso zzso The earliest indication of zzso zzso of the zzso is the replacement of the normal fat zzso zzso of the zzso and erosion of the zzso margins are late zzso As expected, zzso zzso is best seen on zzso However, direct zzso of zzso or replacement of fat is more elegantly demonstrated on zzso zzso
