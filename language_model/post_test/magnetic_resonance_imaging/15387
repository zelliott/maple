The objective of this study was to determine the value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the surgical planning of invasive zzso zzso zzso diagnostic challenge for zzso 

zzso patients with zzso proven zzso were studied between 1998 and zzso All patients underwent physical examination, zzso zzso and zzso All anomalies detected were graded using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso zzso and careful research was made for the presence of zzso zzso 

On zzso zzso of images were zzso as masses and zzso corresponded to zzso zzso The size zzso compared with zzso findings, were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (physical zzso and zzso zzso The zzso correlations for zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso percent of therapeutic strategy cases were zzso 

zzso is zzso valuable for the management of zzso It provides the most accurate estimate of tumor size and is highly sensitive for zzso zzso Its main drawback is its lack of zzso which requires zzso zzso zzso zzso often justifies the modification of the initial therapeutic strategy, generally ruling out conservative zzso
