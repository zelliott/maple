To compare the new zzso sequence zzso metal artifact correction zzso zzso tilting zzso and increased zzso for the reduction of both zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso artifacts with current zzso MR sequences in patients with total hip zzso zzso 

The institutional review board issued a waiver for this zzso Forty patients with zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased bandwidth were applied by using the zzso zzso sequence at zzso zzso zzso short zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images, as well as standard zzso STIR and zzso zzso sequence images zzso with high bandwidth zzso and zzso were zzso Fifteen additional patients were examined to compare the zzso and zzso sequence with an identical zzso zzso Signal void was zzso zzso criteria zzso of zzso structures, zzso and zzso were assessed on a zzso scale zzso no zzso 5, not visible due to severe zzso by two zzso zzso imaging findings were zzso zzso data were analyzed with a zzso test and qualitative data with a zzso signed rank zzso 

Signal void around the zzso component was smaller for zzso than zzso images zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and for zzso than zzso images zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso distinction was better on zzso compared with zzso images zzso vs zzso zzso and on zzso compared with zzso images zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and noise were lower with zzso sequences than with the standard sequences zzso Almost half of the abnormal imaging findings were missed on zzso compared with zzso images (55 vs 105 zzso zzso while zzso was similar to zzso imaging zzso vs 55 zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso sequences were significantly better according to quantitative and qualitative image criteria, but a clinically relevant artifact reduction was only present for STIR zzso
