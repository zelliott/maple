The criteria for brain zzso in dogs have not yet been established, because of wide variation in the zzso of the zzso and zzso of the brain depending on the breed and zzso In this study, we examined the thickness of the zzso zzso in a zzso magnetic resonance image to investigate normal, to examine the correlation with age, body weight, and zzso and to assess whether measurement would be a useful indicator of brain zzso The animals used in this study were of various breeds and weight, and had no identifiable zzso zzso They were divided into two groups: a normal group zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso aging group zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso thickness in both zzso and zzso zzso images were measured in all zzso The zzso zzso thickness in the normal and zzso groups was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso thickness in the zzso group was significantly zzso In an analysis of the correlation of zzso zzso thickness with age and weight in normal dogs, significant negative and positive correlation was zzso zzso However, the strength of these correlations was zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso thickness may be a good zzso for evaluating brain zzso in dogs with cognitive zzso
