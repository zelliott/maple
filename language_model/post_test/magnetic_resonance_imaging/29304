The aim of this study was to evaluate high resolution zzso zzso our case a zzso zzso zzso the diagnosis of acoustic zzso Especially to be clarified was if high-resolution zzso sequences can substitute zzso zzso zzso and in which circumstances they can give important additional information when compared with zzso zzso zzso 

The MR examinations were performed using a zzso unit with a zzso polarized head zzso All 20 patients (11 zzso nine zzso aged from 12 to 80 zzso with acoustic zzso underwent zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition time, 8 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition time, 8 zzso zzso The zzso of acoustic zzso was evaluated following the consensus of three zzso using a zzso work station zzso tumor presence, extent, nerve zzso 

All tumors were detected by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the diameters of the zzso were equally well zzso zzso zzso was the best sequence for the attribution of a zzso to a certain zzso zzso involvement could be better detected using zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a very sensitive method for tumor screening which can also detect even small zzso and labyrinthine zzso In the case of abnormal findings zzso pathology or variations, zzso vascular zzso however, zzso zzso zzso is necessary in order to confirm the presence of a tumor with typical zzso
