To determine initial locus and rate of zzso of zzso lobe structures zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso studies suggest that the earliest changes in Alzheimer's disease are zzso tangle formation in zzso and adjacent zzso zzso volume analysis of zzso lobe structures over time in subjects prior to developing zzso may allow the identification of when these processes begin, the rate they zzso and which areas are key to symptom zzso 

30 zzso zzso healthy, elderly individuals enrolled in a prospective study of healthy aging evaluated annually over a mean of 42 zzso Twelve subjects with subsequent cognitive decline were assigned to the zzso zzso group zzso All 120 annual zzso studies analyzed by zzso techniques assessed group differences in zzso lobe volumes and rates of brain zzso 

zzso as well as zzso subjects had zzso zzso decreases in zzso and zzso zzso Rates of volume loss between the groups did not significantly zzso zzso cases had significantly smaller zzso when zzso zzso volume did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso was present only in zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso occurs at a similar rate regardless of diagnostic zzso Those who develop zzso may have smaller zzso to begin with, but become symptomatic because of accelerated loss of zzso lobe zzso zzso lobe volume loss may mark the beginning of the disease process within six years prior to zzso zzso
