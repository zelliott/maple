We investigated the influence of brain zzso and white matter zzso on cognitive function in elderly zzso We selected 33 subjects zzso age, zzso zzso zzso with a zzso score from 14 to 30 who had no previous history of stroke from the zzso in the Memory Clinic of our zzso These subjects were divided into four groups on the basis of their zzso score as zzso zzso moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these four groups, we compared the frequency of the associated risk factors for cerebral zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso heart zzso and the severity of brain zzso and cerebral white matter zzso which were visually evaluated by zzso zzso Brain zzso and white matter zzso were assessed by reviewing the cerebral zzso and zzso and deep white matter zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso was divided into three grades zzso moderate, zzso and white matter zzso were classified into four grades zzso using zzso zzso We performed statistical analysis to detect zzso parameters which correlate with and influence zzso scores from among the zzso zzso The cases with zzso were all diagnosed as Alzheimer's zzso There were no significant differences among the four groups in mean age, the zzso of individual associated risk factors, the severity of cortical zzso or the grade of zzso zzso or zzso 2) and zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, the frequency of zzso zzso change greater than a moderate grade increased in parallel with the zzso of reduced cognitive function zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and approximately zzso with such a change were zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the grade of zzso zzso and zzso score zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a great influence of zzso zzso on that score zzso zzso analysis: r zzso zzso p zzso zzso From the above results, it was suggested that more than moderate zzso change in the zzso might possibly be related with cognitive impairment and that both zzso and zzso less than the second grade had little influence on the decline of brain zzso
