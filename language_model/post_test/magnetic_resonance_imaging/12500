Very low cerebral blood volume zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes have been proposed as zzso of zzso transformation following stroke zzso We aimed to compare these zzso validate zzso in an independent cohort using zzso study data, and investigate the interaction of zzso with regional zzso 

The zzso and zzso studies obtained diffusion and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients 3 to 6 hours from onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients to tissue zzso zzso zzso or zzso and all zzso patients received zzso zzso was defined as cerebral blood zzso zzso of brain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined using European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study zzso zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso to baseline zzso 

In zzso 69 patients were zzso including 9 who developed zzso The zzso zzso zzso threshold defined in zzso predicted zzso with zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, and zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients, including 23 with zzso zzso models using zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicted zzso independent of clinical factors better than models using diffusion or time to zzso seconds zzso zzso Excluding zzso in regions without zzso improved specificity from 61 to zzso in the pooled zzso 

zzso predicts zzso after stroke zzso and appears to be a more powerful predictor than baseline diffusion or zzso zzso zzso zzso of regions of zzso is strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso may be clinically useful to identify patients at significant risk of zzso following zzso
