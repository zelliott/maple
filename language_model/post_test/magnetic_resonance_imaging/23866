The Edinburgh High zzso Project is a zzso study of brain structure (and zzso in subjects at high risk of developing schizophrenia in the next zzso years for genetic zzso In this article we describe the methods of zzso analysis of structural magnetic resonance images used in the zzso We also consider potential sources of error in these zzso the zzso of our image analysis zzso zzso and zzso zzso possible zzso zzso and zzso criteria used in separating brain from zzso fluid zzso Investigation with a phantom test object (of similar imaging characteristics to the zzso provided evidence for the zzso of our image acquisition and analysis zzso Both zzso and zzso reliability were found to be good in whole brain measures but less so for smaller zzso There were no statistically significant differences in positioning across the three study groups zzso with zzso high risk subjects and normal zzso A new technique for zzso zzso scans zzso is described (the zzso zzso and compared with our established method zzso by zzso Few differences between the two techniques were seen at 3- and zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the zzso and reliability of the structural zzso analysis techniques used in the Edinburgh High zzso Project, and highlight zzso issues of general concern in zzso and zzso studies of brain structure in healthy control subjects and zzso zzso
