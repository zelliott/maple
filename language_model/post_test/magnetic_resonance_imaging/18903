To evaluate the feasibility of zzso zzso Control zzso a new MR image navigation system, during zzso puncture in zzso 

With the zzso system in place, zzso zzso zzso was performed in 26 cases, with the zzso system being used in 11 cases (five zzso tumors, three zzso zzso and three zzso liver zzso The zzso system comprised infrared cameras and an zzso optical tracking tool that was directly connected to a zzso zzso sizes ranged from zzso zzso zzso liver zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for a mean size of zzso zzso With zzso one to three zzso with a diameter of 2 zzso or 3 zzso were advanced into the tumors with the guidance of an MR zzso zzso Two zzso cycles were used for zzso During the zzso the formation of zzso was monitored on MR zzso zzso dynamic CT or zzso as well as physical examinations were conducted after two weeks and six zzso 

Placement of zzso was successfully performed under the control of the zzso zzso During zzso zzso of the tumors by zzso was carefully monitored by zzso zzso of the zzso area was confirmed in all zzso tumors by follow-up dynamic zzso The size zzso of the zzso zzso was observed through follow-up zzso Two of the three cases of zzso liver tumor were zzso zzso Additional therapy for a residual tumor was performed on one patient with a zzso liver zzso A small amount of zzso was the only complication found in a patient with a zzso liver zzso 

zzso zzso with this new navigation system was feasible with low morbidity and allowed for safe and accurate puncture with a zzso
