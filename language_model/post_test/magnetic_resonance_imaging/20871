Cell groups of the zzso zzso which are located in the zzso region of the lower zzso are zzso zzso that project to the zzso zzso Their zzso produces zzso zzso which resembles eye movement disorders resulting from zzso of the zzso zzso in animal zzso zzso zzso tract cells are assumed to fulfill an important function in zzso movement control, such as zzso and maintaining zzso zzso This paper presents a 50-year-old female who zzso zzso zzso due to damage to the zzso tract cells caused by a localized zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We found that a zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to that observed following zzso zzso clearly indicates that a zzso of zzso tract cells projecting to the zzso was zzso This finding has important implications in considering a zzso feedback loop involved in zzso controls, such as zzso zzso Although there have been a few reports of zzso zzso caused by zzso in the zzso region of the lower zzso to our knowledge none report the occurrence of zzso due to a strictly localized zzso zzso such as the one described zzso
