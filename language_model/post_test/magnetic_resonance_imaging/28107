The use of zzso zzso sequences is mandatory for identifying zzso in the zzso region and for differential diagnosis of pathological zzso A highly promising alternative to time-consuming conventional zzso sequences is now available in the zzso sequences zzso zzso was compared with the conventional zzso zzso basing on 100 assessments of examinations of 20 zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with one average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 4 averages zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis was performed in zzso to on zzso analysis by 5 zzso as a blind zzso The zzso differentiation and contrast performance were compared as well as the differentiation and definition of zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso overall zzso zzso of pathological findings was the same with both zzso zzso was superior to zzso in the zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso and also in the zzso overall zzso The following criteria were employed in the zzso overall zzso sum total of impressions gathered from contrast zzso or performance, zzso to artifacts, and zzso zzso Due to the definitely improved parameters of image quality and the markedly reduced scanning zzso is reduced to zzso will replace the conventional zzso sequence in routine zzso
