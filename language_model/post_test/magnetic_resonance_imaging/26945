Within the neural zzso network, the right zzso face area zzso plays a prominent role, and it has been suggested that it receives both zzso and zzso feedback from other face sensitive zzso Its functional role is less well understood and whether the zzso is involved in the initial analysis of a face stimulus or in the detailed integration of different face properties remains an open zzso The present study investigated the functional role of the zzso with regard to different face properties zzso zzso and zzso using zzso magnetic stimulation zzso zzso 1 showed that the zzso zzso information across different face zzso performance for the combined processing of identity and expression decreased after zzso to the zzso while no impairment was seen in gaze zzso In zzso 2 we examined the zzso dynamics of this zzso We zzso the impaired zzso zzso to 170 zzso post stimulus zzso Together the results suggest that zzso to the zzso affects the zzso processing of facial identity and expression at a zzso processing zzso
