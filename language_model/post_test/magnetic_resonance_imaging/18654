zzso diseases are very common in zzso zzso zzso Silent cerebral zzso zzso has not been investigated in HD patients although it may be a significant risk factor for cerebrovascular zzso 

zzso zzso failure may be an independent risk factor for zzso and cerebrovascular zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was performed on 123 HD patients without symptomatic cerebrovascular disease and on 52 control zzso We investigated the prevalence of zzso and performed zzso study using multiple zzso analysis to assess the relationship between zzso and the risk zzso 

The prevalence of zzso was significantly higher in HD patients than in the healthy control group zzso patients zzso zzso 5 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis with all subjects showed that independent risk factors of zzso were chronic zzso failure, hypertension, smoking and age zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In only the HD patient group, age and smoking were shown to be independent risk factors of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso while HD duration and hypertension were zzso 

The findings of the present study indicate that chronic zzso failure maintained by zzso increases the prevalence of zzso and that age and smoking habits are also significantly associated with zzso in HD zzso
