The aim of this prospective study of patients with breast cancer was to identify zzso to zzso in zzso chemotherapy zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We analyzed the maximum standardized zzso value zzso of zzso before and after the first course and the reduction rate in tumor size shown by magnetic resonance imaging zzso before the first and after the fourth course of zzso 

None of the eight patients zzso whose zzso decrease was less than zzso revealed a clinical partial response or clinical complete zzso Seven out of the zzso patients zzso with an zzso decrease over zzso achieved a complete zzso 

An zzso reduction rate less than zzso is observed in patients with breast cancer after the first course of zzso in zzso and may be indicator of zzso to zzso
