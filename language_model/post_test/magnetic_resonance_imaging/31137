zzso detection of zzso is a novel technique in which an zzso sensor surveys an environment of interest and retains memory of that environment to be recovered at a later time in a different zzso The zzso or zzso information about the sensor nucleus is zzso and stored as spin polarization at the first location and subsequently moved to a different physical location for zzso zzso A dedicated probe incorporating two separate radio frequency zzso was built for this zzso The zzso zzso zzso was large enough to fit around the bulky sample zzso while the smaller detection zzso zzso had not only a higher quality factor, but also an enhanced filling factor since the zzso volume comprised purely the sensor zzso We obtained two-dimensional zzso void space images of two model porous samples with resolution less than zzso zzso The remotely reconstructed images demonstrate the ability to determine fine structure with image quality superior to their directly detected counterparts and show the great potential of zzso remote detection for imaging applications that suffer from low sensitivity due to low zzso and filling zzso
