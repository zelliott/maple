Most in zzso knee zzso analyses are based on external markers attached to the shank and the zzso Literature data show that markers positioning and soft zzso artifacts affect the zzso parameters of the bones true zzso Most of the techniques of zzso used were zzso The aim of the present study was to develop and apply a zzso methodology to zzso the relative movement between the bones and the zzso 

zzso resonance imaging acquisitions were performed on the right knee of zzso volunteers without knee zzso The subjects were equipped with external magnetic resonance zzso marker zzso A foot drive device allowed the subjects to perform an actively loaded knee zzso The whole volume of the zzso knee was processed for four zzso held knee zzso positions during the knee zzso The bones and external marker sets geometry were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging zzso Then a registration zzso was applied to the bones and the relative movement of the thigh and shank marker sets with respect to their underlying bones was zzso 

The protocol resulted in a good geometrical accuracy and zzso zzso sets movement differ from that of the bones with a maximum of 22 zzso in translation and 15 degrees in rotation and it affects the knee zzso 

zzso sets relative movement modify the knee movement finite zzso axes direction zzso zzso degrees ) and zzso zzso zzso zzso The methodology developed can evaluate external marker set system to be used for zzso analysis in a clinical zzso
