To assess the ability of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect tissue changes immediately after laser zzso of the prostate and to correlate these changes with clinical outcome by detecting changes that may improve the outcome by allowing the laser zzso to be adjusted during therapy by monitoring effects on zzso zzso 

Eight men with proven zzso outlet obstruction had a standard zzso laser zzso of the prostate with a zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were performed before, during and immediately after treatment and again after one week, 3 months and one zzso 

The clinical outcome was a decrease in the American Urological Association zzso symptom score from a zzso mean of zzso 1 year after treatment and a corresponding increase in peak urinary flow rates from a mean of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Immediately after treatment, zzso showed marked swelling of the zzso zzso increase in volume zzso range zzso with the loss of internal zzso A zzso thin zzso band was present in six of the eight patients after 1 week and was replaced by a wider zzso ring at 3 months in four of the six zzso No patient had evidence of zzso zzso after treatment or a significant reduction in prostate volume at 1 zzso 

zzso can detect tissue changes after laser zzso of the zzso The marked swelling seen on zzso immediately after laser zzso may explain the delayed improvement in zzso The zzso ring may indicate the depth to which laser energy has an effect on the tissue and could delineate an area of zzso The lack of zzso at one year questions the durability of the effect of laser treatment delivered in this zzso
