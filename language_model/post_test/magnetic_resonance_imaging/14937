A rapid zzso method was developed to transfer high quality zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso by using zzso acid as a zzso via zzso zzso After zzso exchange, the zzso zzso not only exhibited outstanding stability in water, but also maintained high zzso and zzso zzso Cell viability experiments demonstrated good zzso of the zzso For 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso the small zzso size of 14 zzso enabled a high zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso while high zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso enabled the zzso to exhibit a high zzso zzso of 220 zzso zzso in zzso phantom zzso In zzso MR imaging experiments further confirmed that the zzso were eminent zzso and zzso contrast zzso Moreover, the high quality zzso can be used as excellent magnetic heating agents under an alternating magnetic zzso With all those features, including zzso imaging and magnetic zzso the zzso can be used as single compound zzso agents for various biomedical applications, especially for cancer diagnosis and zzso
