To test the reliability of four previously proposed zzso criteria for the diagnosis of zzso we reviewed 1,500 consecutive brain scans for the presence, number, size, and location of areas of increased signal zzso on zzso and zzso images, unaware of the patients' clinical presentations and zzso This series included zzso subjects with a clinical diagnosis of zzso Relying exclusively on the presence of at least three or four zzso for a positive diagnosis of zzso resulted in high sensitivity zzso for three zzso and zzso for four) but inadequate specificity zzso for three zzso and zzso for four) and positive zzso value zzso for three zzso and zzso for zzso If one of these zzso was required to border the lateral zzso specificity was zzso and positive zzso value was 50% at a sensitivity of zzso Using the zzso criteria (at least three zzso and two of the following features: abutting body of lateral zzso zzso zzso location, and size zzso 5 zzso led to a further highly significant improvement of specificity zzso p zzso zzso and increase of the positive zzso value zzso at the expense of a less significant decrease in sensitivity zzso p zzso zzso
