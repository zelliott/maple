To evaluate the zzso zzso of gross tumor volume zzso - zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with prostate cancer using published zzso criteria for zzso zzso at 3 zzso by 6 different zzso 

90 zzso based on 15 zzso zzso sequences zzso diffusion weighted zzso and dynamic contrast enhanced zzso of 5 patients with prostate cancer were generated for zzso of zzso by 6 zzso The reference zzso was contoured by a zzso with expertise in diagnostic imaging of prostate cancer using zzso zzso zzso was performed by 5 radiation zzso who received teaching of zzso of primary prostate cancer before starting zzso zzso zzso were contoured using zzso zzso and zzso zzso For purposes of comparison zzso were imported to the zzso platform zzso zzso and the similarity zzso or Kappa zzso zzso were calculated with the zzso that a zzso indicates excellent, a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso substantial and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso moderate zzso zzso all observers rated difficulties of zzso for each zzso using a 3 point rating scale zzso to zzso zzso difficulties, zzso zzso 

zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso images zzso resulted in substantial zzso zzso zzso using zzso images resulted in moderate agreement zzso zzso and zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso and zzso Degree of difficulty in zzso zzso was significantly lower using zzso and zzso compared to zzso (both zzso Analysis of zzso differences revealed inadequate comparison of functional zzso zzso to anatomical sequences zzso and lack of awareness of zzso imaging findings as a source of erroneous zzso 

Using zzso and zzso sequences at 3 zzso for zzso of zzso in prostate cancer patients by radiation zzso with knowledge of zzso features results in substantial agreement compared to an experienced zzso but for zzso purposes higher zzso are desirable, strengthen the need for expert zzso zzso sequence for zzso zzso was considered as difficult in zzso
