The anatomical factors underlying reorganization of language representation are yet to be zzso although correlations between zzso structures and language zzso have been zzso Previous research has implicated the corpus zzso in the development of language zzso This study examined the relationship between zzso zzso and language zzso using letter zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, in 13 patients with focal zzso and 8 healthy zzso Regional zzso thickness was determined without relying on a zzso zzso of zzso zzso We predicted that language asymmetry measured by zzso zzso zzso scores would be correlated with regional zzso thickness in both zzso However, only the degree of language zzso asymmetry was significantly correlated with zzso thickness in the zzso and the zzso of patients, and there was a significant interaction between the groups with respect to zzso thickness and language zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso pathways may be important for language reorganization in the context of early cerebral zzso
