This study investigated the variation in magnetic resonance characteristics of the fetal liver during a time of changing zzso zzso zzso imaging was carried out in 25 normal pregnant women at 20 and 26 zzso zzso The signal intensity from regions of the fetal liver, background image, and maternal back muscle and the highest signal intensity from the maternal spinal zzso were measured and compared with the signal intensity of zzso zzso Data are expressed as ratios, in arbitrary units zzso zzso values; zzso range shown in zzso and analyzed with the use of zzso zzso zzso At 20 zzso the signal intensity ratio of liver to zzso fluid was zzso zzso At 26 zzso the ratio was zzso zzso The change was highly significant zzso zzso zzso No change in the signal intensity ratios of zzso fluid compared with other measured parameters was zzso These data are consistent with known changes in fetal liver zzso occurring between 20 and 26 zzso gestation and have potential use in early zzso zzso assessment of the zzso
