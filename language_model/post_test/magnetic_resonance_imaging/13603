The purpose of this study was to zzso evaluate paradoxical zzso motion using magnetic resonance zzso zzso A total of 27 subjects were zzso including 12 normal young adults, six control individuals, and nine patients with zzso With subjects in the zzso position, 30 sequential zzso MR images of the entire right lung were obtained during tidal and deep slow zzso zzso movement between sequential images was estimated as the displacement area and the total zzso movement in a respiratory cycle was zzso The paradoxical motion of the zzso representing the zzso movement to increase or decrease lung area, since paradoxical movement ratio zzso paradoxical zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In patients with zzso paradoxical zzso motion was observed on MR images during deep zzso The mean zzso in zzso patients during deep breathing was zzso which was significantly higher than zzso in young adults zzso and zzso in zzso controls zzso The present results indicate that magnetic resonance images could be used to detect paradoxical zzso motion in patients with zzso
