Several late zzso of the administration of zzso zzso zzso contrast agents have been described in patients with advanced zzso zzso In an zzso series, we found a remarkable frequency of zzso reactions after administration of zzso used for cardiovascular evaluation before zzso zzso 

In a zzso zzso period, 13 of 136 zzso or zzso patients exhibited onset of fever, zzso and zzso within hours after administration of zzso zzso A minority showed persistent zzso of residual zzso We performed blood cultures in most patients and evaluated white blood cell zzso counts, zzso zzso heart rate and blood zzso 

Within an average of 12 h zzso zzso zzso after zzso administration, the 13 patients (9 zzso 4 zzso median age 61 years, range zzso developed consistent zzso with fever zzso zzso degrees C, range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raising suspicion of zzso zzso blood cultures on bacterial contamination of the injected product remained negative zzso bacterial or zzso contamination of the zzso was zzso zzso were tried in the first two patients without a noticeable zzso In all subsequent patients, symptoms were attenuated during the first 5 h dialysis zzso with 280 zzso blood zzso and disappeared within 72 zzso zzso levels remained markedly elevated up to 14 zzso zzso was seen in all patients, and zzso zzso zzso remained zzso Two zzso patients developed persistent zzso After a median of 16 months, none of these patients developed zzso systemic zzso 

This series with unusually severe acute phase reactions was caused by one specific zzso Such zzso reactions may be relevant for the zzso largely unresolved zzso of the skin reaction to some zzso products in zzso zzso disease zzso zzso It remains unresolved whether the reaction observed with zzso do in principle also occur with other zzso zzso
