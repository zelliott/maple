The location of zzso within the base of the skull and cervical junction prevents complete zzso from being zzso Previous series have shown that zzso zzso can be used as a treatment for residual zzso with good overall zzso In the present study, we reviewed our experience in using gamma knife surgery zzso to treat patients with residual skull base zzso 

Thirty-one patients with residual skull base zzso underwent gamma knife zzso from June 1996 to December zzso The mean age of patients was zzso years zzso zzso zzso There were 20 male and 11 zzso The zzso tumor volume treated with zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso with a mean of zzso zzso The mean tumor margin radiation dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean maximum dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were available for follow-up reviews, ranging from 6 to 102 months zzso zzso zzso and from 6 to 78 months zzso 28 zzso for clinical and image zzso zzso 

zzso survival analysis showed a survival of zzso and zzso after 3 and 5 years, zzso Most tumors were smaller in size 1 year after treatment, which paralleled an zzso of clinical zzso However, nine zzso zzso and seven recurred over the course of zzso The zzso tumor control rate was zzso and zzso after 3 and 5 years, zzso No serious zzso complication was found in any of the patients with zzso zzso 

zzso knife zzso can be effectively used for residual zzso beside surgical zzso with zzso tumor control zzso
