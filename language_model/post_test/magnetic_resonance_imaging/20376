zzso zzso or zzso leads to zzso changes in certain zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that the amount of zzso in the zzso visible in MR imaging is reduced in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with zzso were zzso zzso Three readers assessed the zzso of the zzso zzso rim at 4 different zzso positions by using zzso STIR sequences from a zzso MR imaging zzso The height of the zzso zzso was also zzso zzso were compared with normal values obtained with the same imaging zzso zzso signs of zzso also recorded were zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhancement, zzso zzso narrow zzso and sagging zzso 

zzso signal intensity surrounding the zzso nerves was diminished in at least 2 of the 4 positions used for zzso so that decreased diameters of the zzso were observed in all patients zzso zzso zzso zzso The height of the zzso zzso was above normal limits in 12 of 19 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of qualitative signs of zzso varied from zzso to zzso 

The zzso in patients with zzso is partially or fully collapsed due to reduced zzso zzso In comparison with other zzso zzso this sign showed the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of patients with zzso in this zzso
