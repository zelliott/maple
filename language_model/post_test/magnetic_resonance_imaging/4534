Spinal zzso zzso is unusual, and rarely results in spinal zzso zzso because the zzso fluid tends to dilute the blood and prevent the formation of zzso We describe a patient with spinal zzso zzso of unusual spontaneous zzso 

A 66-year-old female presented with sudden onset of intense back pain with zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated a mass zzso between zzso and zzso zzso the spinal zzso zzso Emergency zzso zzso exposed a zzso in the zzso space from zzso to zzso but no source of the zzso was zzso The patient was able to walk by herself about 20 days after the zzso 

The outcome is significantly influenced by the duration between onset and operation, zzso zzso status, and zzso of symptom zzso zzso we emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, and rapid and complete operative removal of spinal zzso zzso in order to achieve the best zzso
