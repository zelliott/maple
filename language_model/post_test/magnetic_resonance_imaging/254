Previously, we found that distinct brain areas predict individual selection bias in decisions between small immediate zzso and larger delayed rewards zzso Furthermore, such selection bias can be manipulated by zzso zzso zzso To test whether blocking zzso zzso with zzso zzso alters brain activity during decision-making in areas predicting individual bias, we compared zzso zzso signal correlated with Now versus Later decision-making after acute administration of zzso zzso zzso or zzso We tested zzso zzso and control subjects in a zzso zzso zzso We defined regions of interest zzso centered on zzso zzso predicting Now versus Later selection zzso zzso administration significantly increased zzso signal during decision-making in the right lateral zzso zzso zzso an area where enhanced activity during decision-making predicts Later zzso zzso analyses identified additional zzso where zzso signal during decision-making was enhanced zzso zzso cortex, left inferior zzso zzso and zzso or reduced zzso superior zzso zzso by zzso Additional analyses identified sites, including the right lateral zzso zzso in which zzso effects on zzso signal predicted zzso effects on selection zzso These data agree with zzso zzso expression in human frontal and zzso zzso and suggest possible mechanisms of zzso therapeutic zzso
