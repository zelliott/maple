zzso 1 zzso is a common, zzso dominant, zzso disease that is clinically and genetically distinct from the rare condition zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso has been regarded as a common feature of zzso but is an unusual and unexplained complication of zzso The clinical and zzso features of the zzso zzso are distinct from those encountered in zzso We describe eight patients with a symmetrical zzso which has been called zzso zzso 

Clinical zzso laboratory zzso zzso and zzso were undertaken in eight individuals with zzso zzso None were referred because of zzso zzso Two subjects underwent zzso nerve biopsy and three agreed to zzso zzso 

The patients had an zzso symmetrical predominantly sensory zzso zzso and unusually early development of large numbers of zzso The zzso nerves showed diffuse zzso change and disruption of the zzso Two patients developed a high grade zzso peripheral nerve sheath zzso Disease causing zzso were detected in two individuals and molecular studies did not reveal any whole gene zzso 

zzso zzso occurred in zzso of 600 patients with zzso Its cause may be a diffuse zzso process arising from inappropriate zzso between zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso
