To investigate the acute effects on the central nervous system zzso of zzso radiation, a component of zzso charged particles zzso in space radiation, using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

zzso rats were exposed to zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 4 zzso At 1 week zzso zzso scans were made using zzso zzso zzso zzso and contrast enhanced zzso zzso zzso relaxation time and apparent diffusion zzso zzso values were obtained from zzso brain regions of interest zzso zzso was correlated using ex zzso zzso 

No overt abnormalities were zzso using zzso and zzso at 1 week zzso zzso values did not differ significantly between the zzso and control zzso Compared to 0 zzso there were significant zzso in zzso values and reductions in zzso after zzso In the absence of evident zzso pathology, zzso revealed zzso zzso in 4 zzso zzso 

At 1 week after zzso zzso exposure, zzso and zzso values can differentiate zzso in regions critical for zzso zzso zzso may provide zzso assessment of the initial zzso disturbances in zzso after zzso zzso
