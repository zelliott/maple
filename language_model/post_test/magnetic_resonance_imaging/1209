To assess the incremental value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings in addition to clinical variables for prediction of zzso extension zzso in patients with prostate zzso 

In this cohort study, 344 consecutive patients with zzso prostate cancer underwent zzso MR imaging prior to zzso 216 of these patients also underwent MR zzso zzso MR images were interpreted by 10 attending zzso The likelihood of zzso was scored zzso on the basis of MR imaging zzso Clinical variables included serum zzso zzso zzso level, zzso score, clinical stage of zzso greatest percentage of cancer in all core biopsy zzso percentage of zzso core specimens in all core biopsy zzso and presence of zzso zzso For data analysis, receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses were zzso zzso analysis was used for prediction of probability from a model that included clinical variables as tested comparatively with a model that included the clinical variables plus zzso MR imaging zzso A difference with P zzso was considered zzso 

At zzso analysis, all variables were associated with zzso At zzso zzso analysis, zzso MR imaging findings had the largest area under the zzso zzso At zzso analysis, serum zzso level, percentage of cancer in all core biopsy zzso and zzso MR imaging findings zzso zzso P zzso and P zzso zzso were zzso of zzso Areas under zzso curve for two models, with and without zzso MR imaging findings, were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso 

A model containing zzso MR imaging findings has a significantly larger area under the zzso curve than a model containing only clinical zzso thus, zzso MR imaging findings add incremental value in the prediction of zzso
