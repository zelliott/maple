We recently proposed a method for zzso zzso of zzso medical images based on the advanced video coding standard zzso In this paper, we present two major contributions that enhance our previous work for zzso of functional zzso zzso zzso 1) a new zzso motion compensation process that employs zzso search, zzso block matching, and zzso zzso and 2) a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designed for zzso zzso of the residual and motion zzso zzso We validate our method on real zzso sequences of various resolutions and compare the performance to two state-of-the-art zzso zzso and zzso zzso results demonstrate that our proposed technique significantly zzso current state of the art with an average zzso ratio improvement of zzso
