An increasing number of studies suggest that bone zzso zzso tissue zzso might play a role in the zzso of zzso Our previous study of Caucasian women demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between zzso and zzso bone mineral density zzso It is unknown whether visceral zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and skeletal muscle had an effect on the relationship between zzso and zzso 

In the present study we investigated the relationship between zzso hip, and zzso spine zzso with hip and zzso spine zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Development in Young Adults zzso sample with adjustment for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso SAT, and skeletal zzso 

zzso zzso was acquired for 210 healthy African-American and Caucasian men and women (age zzso zzso zzso and zzso spine zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso hip, and zzso spine zzso had negative correlations with hip and zzso spine zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso The inverse associations between zzso and zzso remained strong after adjusting for zzso weight, skeletal muscle, SAT, zzso total zzso tissue zzso zzso status, lifestyle factors, and inflammatory markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 296 to zzso P zzso zzso Among body composition measures, skeletal muscle was the strongest correlate of zzso after adjusting for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with little additional contribution from weight, SAT, zzso or total zzso zzso 

In this middle-aged population, a negative relationship existed between zzso zzso and hip and zzso spine zzso independent of demographics and body zzso These observations support the growing evidence linking zzso with low bone zzso
