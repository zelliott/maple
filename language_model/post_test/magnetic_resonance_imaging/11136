For use in a magnetic resonance zzso scanning room infusion pumps must be MR safe and zzso This study tested two commonly used infusion pumps zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine if they met these zzso 

The pumps underwent testing within the scanning room of a 3 T MR zzso zzso infusion rates were tested at up to 100 zzso magnetic field strength, with and without radio frequency signals zzso The effect of the pumps on image quality was zzso The zzso pressure alarm of the pumps was tested at up to 100 zzso The zzso risk was assessed by measuring the force exerted upon the pumps at the entrance to the zzso 

The maximum mean flow rate errors at 100 zzso were zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso both within our accepted zzso Radio frequency signals had no effect on flow zzso The pumps produced no zzso zzso on the acquired zzso The maximum mean zzso pressure error was 204 zzso higher for the zzso zzso pump and 99 zzso lower for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 100 zzso compared to testing outside the zzso Both pumps were subject to significant attractive force at the entrance to the zzso 

zzso the pumps cannot strictly be termed MR safe or compatible at 100 zzso we have demonstrated that flow rates are unchanged and that, for the zzso zzso the effect on the zzso pressure alarm is unlikely to have patient safety zzso
