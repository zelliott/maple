It was recently shown that brain activity can be represented as a zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso field of brain activity is specifically transformed by sensory zzso we suggested that a zzso field that zzso brain activity reflects sensory zzso We calculated the zzso fields that transform brain activity between visual baseline and auditory word processing in PET data and between environmental sounds and auditory word processing in zzso zzso In the first comparison, significant clusters formed a distributed network over the brain zzso In the second comparison, clusters were more zzso in the zzso network of speech zzso Our study therefore demonstrated that zzso fields reflect the sensory input that specifically zzso brain zzso
