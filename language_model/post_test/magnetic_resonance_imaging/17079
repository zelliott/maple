The purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso zzso zzso a new zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, for its zzso and zzso enhancement in nonhuman zzso Studies were performed in zzso monkeys at intravenous doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were acquired at zzso T using fast zzso zzso recalled echo and fast spin echo imaging zzso The zzso contrast agent zzso was used as a zzso zzso in the monkey showed a zzso zzso The initial blood zzso within 2 h of zzso administration were much higher than those for zzso The high blood concentration of zzso was consistent with the MR imaging data, which showed prolonged circulation of zzso in the blood zzso Enhancement of blood vessels and zzso with a high blood zzso zzso liver, and zzso was clearly zzso at 2 h after contrast injection at the three doses zzso A greater than zzso increase of the area under the blood zzso curve was observed when the administered single dose was increased from zzso to zzso zzso By 2 days after zzso injection, the contrast agent was mostly cleared from all major zzso including zzso The mean residence time was 15 h at the zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso profile was observed in mice, with a mean residence time of zzso h and a volume of distribution at zzso of zzso zzso indicating that the drug was mainly distributed in the blood zzso Based on this pilot study, further investigations on the potential systemic toxicity of zzso in both zzso and large animals are warranted before testing this agent in zzso
