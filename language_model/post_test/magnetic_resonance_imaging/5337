Recent research using various zzso methods revealed the crucial role of the zzso concerning the zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes located in the zzso zzso are already zzso in zzso stages of zzso disease zzso zzso before the onset of manifest motor zzso Although the impact of the zzso on reward and punishment processing is well-established in healthy subjects, these processes have not been investigated in manifest and zzso HD subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso so zzso We used the Monetary Incentive zzso Task to investigate zzso discrimination in terms of rewarding and punishing cues in 30 zzso and 15 healthy zzso According to the probability of disease onset within the next 5 years, zzso subjects were zzso as either near to motor symptom onset zzso zzso zzso years to zzso or far from manifest disease onset zzso zzso zzso years to zzso Compared to zzso and healthy subjects, zzso subjects showed a disturbed zzso differentiation between reward and control anticipation located in the left zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and healthy subjects, no significant zzso zzso discrimination between punishing and control cues was detected in zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time significant differences in zzso discrimination in zzso subjects compared to zzso subjects and healthy zzso zzso reward and punishment processing could therefore reflect a motivational deficit that may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso
