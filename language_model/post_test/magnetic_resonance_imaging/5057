The zzso of cortical thickness is in part dependent on the degree of contrast in zzso signal intensity between white matter and gray matter along the cortical zzso The ratio of white matter to gray matter signal zzso zzso has been found to vary as a function of age and Alzheimer's disease status, suggesting a biological component to what might otherwise be labeled as a nuisance zzso The aim of the present study was to determine if measures of zzso contrast are genetically zzso as well as the degree to which this zzso may be related to the genetic and environment zzso of cortical zzso Participants were zzso male twins zzso zzso 97 zzso pairs, and 60 zzso zzso from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of zzso Ages ranged from 51 to 59 zzso zzso of zzso contrast and cortical thickness were derived for 66 cortical regions of interest zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso twin analyses were used in order to estimate the zzso of zzso contrast, as well as the degree of shared genetic and environmental zzso between zzso contrast and cortical zzso zzso contrast was found to be significantly zzso in the majority of zzso The average zzso across individual zzso was highest in the zzso lobe zzso and lowest in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations between zzso contrast and cortical thickness were observed for most of the zzso The majority of the zzso correlations were negative, ranging from zzso to zzso Of the 66 associations, only 17 significant genetic correlations were found, ranging from zzso to zzso indicating small amounts of shared genetic zzso The majority of the zzso correlations were accounted for by small unique environmental effects common between zzso contrast and cortical zzso These findings demonstrate that like cortical zzso zzso contrast is a genetically influenced brain structure zzso The lack of significant genetic correlations with cortical thickness suggests that this measure potentially represents a unique source of genetic zzso one that has yet to be explored by the field of imaging zzso
