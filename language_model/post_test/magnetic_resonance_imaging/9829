Previous work showed that zzso cortical volume loss is evident early after presentation with acute clinically isolated zzso zzso zzso The aims of this study were: zzso to determine whether zzso zzso in patients with ON is associated with conversion to multiple sclerosis zzso zzso to investigate whether regional zzso zzso affects zzso zzso and zzso to investigate potential causes of early zzso zzso using zzso 

28 patients with acute ON and 10 controls underwent structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso and were zzso over 12 zzso zzso between the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation and zzso cortical damage measures were investigated using multiple linear zzso zzso Regional cortical zzso differences between patients and controls were calculated using zzso zzso 

The development of zzso at 12 months was associated with greater whole brain and zzso radiation zzso zzso shorter acute zzso nerve zzso and smaller zzso cortical volume at zzso Regional zzso was not evident in other sampled cortical zzso zzso zzso was not directly associated with whole brain zzso load, zzso radiation measures or zzso nerve zzso zzso However, the association between zzso zzso and zzso was not independent of these zzso 

zzso zzso cortical volumes in patients with early clinically isolated ON were associated with the development of zzso but volumes of other cortical regions were zzso Hence zzso cortical regions appear particularly susceptible to early zzso These findings could be explained by a combination of pathological effects to visual zzso and white matter in patients with zzso
