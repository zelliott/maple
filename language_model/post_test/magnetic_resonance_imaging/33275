zzso nerve zzso is a known complication of cervical spine zzso The development and zzso of this complication are not completely zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine whether rotation of the cervical spinal zzso predicts the development of a zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of zzso collected spine registry data as well as magnetic resonance zzso We reviewed the records for 176 patients with degenerative disorders of the cervical spine who underwent anterior cervical zzso or zzso within the C4 to zzso zzso Our zzso included area for the spinal cord, space available for the cord, and rotation of the zzso with respect to the zzso zzso 

There was a zzso prevalence of zzso zzso nerve zzso as defined by zzso motor strength of zzso 3 of zzso The average rotation of the spinal zzso (and standard zzso was zzso zzso zzso A significant association was detected between the degree of rotation zzso to zzso versus zzso to zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso p zzso zzso A diagnostic criterion of zzso of rotation could identify patients who had a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso negative zzso value zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

Our evidence suggests that spinal zzso rotation is a strong and significant predictor of zzso zzso zzso Patients can be classified into three types, with Type 1 representing mild rotation zzso to zzso Type 2 representing moderate rotation zzso to zzso and Type 3 representing severe rotation zzso zzso The rate of zzso zzso was zero of 159 in the zzso group, eight of thirteen in the zzso group, and four of four in the zzso zzso This information may be valuable for surgeons and patients considering anterior surgery in the C4 to zzso zzso
