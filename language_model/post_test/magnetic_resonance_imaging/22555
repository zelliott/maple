zzso zzso is a feature of many zzso and zzso zzso zzso variables that characterize tissue zzso zzso zzso and the volume of the zzso zzso zzso are altered in pathological zzso zzso analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso has found a widespread use in the assessment of abnormal zzso due to the direct link between the contrast agent zzso and underlying zzso zzso A representation of zzso variation of contrast agent concentration in blood plasma zzso is central to this zzso In clinical applications of zzso signal intensity zzso derived from rapidly enhancing zzso often display a zzso shape during the initial phase of contrast zzso and rapid arrival at the equilibrium zzso In this work, the features of two principal methods for zzso analysis of zzso which allow for theoretical representation of zzso are examined and combined to improve analysis of this particular class of zzso zzso The proposed method allows the representation of the initial zzso part of the enhancement profiles whilst retaining a realistic representation of zzso based on previously published zzso obtained in healthy zzso The results of the computer simulations indicate that in rapidly enhancing zzso with the transfer constant zzso greater than zzso zzso the zzso acquisition can be restricted to 5 zzso zzso and a zzso representation of zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso delivery can be represented as a short constant rate infusion when the tissue under investigation exhibits a zzso pattern of contrast zzso
