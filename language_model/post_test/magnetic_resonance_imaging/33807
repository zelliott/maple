zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has been shown to be a robust and zzso method to assess left zzso zzso cardiac zzso This study sought to assess volumes and mass calculated with zzso using fast techniques for acquisition and zzso and to compare results in terms of zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso or contrast zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients and 15 healthy volunteers were zzso All patients underwent an zzso examination during the same period that they underwent zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso From 7 to 11 zzso slices were acquired with a zzso zzso zzso sequence from zzso to zzso zzso were drawn with an automated border detection zzso 

zzso fraction zzso correlated well between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso is a fast and accurate technique for zzso of zzso volumes, zzso and zzso
