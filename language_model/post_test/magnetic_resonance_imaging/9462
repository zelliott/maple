zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso The relation of contrast enhancement within the zzso and the zzso muscle was suggested for the evaluation of disease activity and response to treatment, but no standardized method for the zzso of the disease activity is currently zzso We introduce an MR zzso for the evaluation of zzso 

29 patients with zzso idiopathic zzso were examined before medical therapy and after three months of zzso MR analyses included zzso of T 1 and T zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso Furthermore, we examined the dynamic contrast enhancement of the zzso zzso The respective data were compared with the extent of the zzso after 3 zzso 

In the follow-up examinations we observed a significant zzso in zzso % zzso zzso zzso of cases, a mild zzso in zzso % zzso zzso zzso and a stable extent in zzso % zzso zzso zzso Patients with a significantly reduced extent showed the highest mean values for the applied MR zzso in the initial zzso The lowest mean values for the respective parameters were found for the group with a stable zzso Only dynamic enhancement zzso showed statistically significant differences zzso zzso zzso between the groups of zzso 

We observed a significant reduction in the zzso tissue after pharmacological treatment in patients with an elevated dynamic enhancement zzso in the initial zzso
