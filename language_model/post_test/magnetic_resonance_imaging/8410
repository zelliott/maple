zzso zzso zzso especially zzso CT zzso provides important information on the severity and prognosis of acute zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso has become a useful tool as an alternative to CT in the assessment of zzso The primary aim of our study was to determine the diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso to assess severity and predict outcome in patients with zzso from the third to fifth day after zzso We also correlated zzso findings with CT and zzso zzso 

The study included 101 patients zzso men, 52 women, median age 62 zzso range zzso with a diagnosis of zzso admitted to our hospital between January 1, 2004 and June 31, zzso The inclusion criteria consisted of a combination of clinical features, a typical case history, zzso of serum pancreatic zzso and diagnosis confirmed by imaging zzso zzso spiral CT exams were performed in all patients from the third to fifth day after admission, and Balthazar grade and CT severity index were zzso All patients underwent zzso and MR severity index zzso was zzso We also performed magnetic resonance zzso zzso in all patients to detect zzso duct zzso 

zzso correlation between zzso and zzso was found for Balthazar grade zzso and the assessment of pancreatic necrosis zzso as well as between the combined severity zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso score zzso zzso zzso protein zzso levels 48 h after admission zzso zzso appearance of systemic complications zzso zzso and length of hospital stay zzso zzso Considering the Atlanta criteria as the gold standard and the zzso score, no difference in sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, negative zzso value, and accuracy of the two methods was zzso Comparing the group of patients with presumed acute pancreatic zzso with the group of patients with severe zzso we found a significantly higher zzso II score on the first day zzso that the development of systemic complications was more frequent zzso zzso zzso and that the hospital stay and zzso management of patients with zzso signs of pancreatic zzso tended to be zzso 

zzso is comparable to zzso in the early assessment of the severity of zzso and both methods are equally efficient in predicting local and systemic complications of zzso zzso has a potential advantage over CT in detecting zzso duct zzso and pancreatic zzso
