Studies of zzso joint zzso discs removed from autopsy specimens and in surgery indicate that they are often thicker in patients with zzso disorders zzso zzso thickness may also change when the zzso moves in and out of the joint zzso during opening and zzso 

The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that the zzso disc thickness is greater in zzso patients than in healthy subjects and is affected by the degree of jaw zzso 

zzso resonance images zzso were made of the zzso in young volunteers, 9 zzso subjects and 9 zzso subjects, at closed and at zzso zzso and zzso open zzso The thickness of the anterior and zzso bands of the discs and the intermediate zones was measured and compared between zzso and control groups, and between closed and opened positions, using the zzso method in general linear model zzso 

The hypothesis that the disc was thicker in the zzso than in the control group was supported with respect to the anterior band and intermediate zone zzso but not with respect to the zzso zzso The hypothesis that the thickness is affected by the degree of jaw opening was only supported for the zzso band, where it increased during opening in both groups zzso 

The results indicate that the anterior band and the intermediate zone of the zzso discs are thicker in zzso patients than in healthy zzso The zzso band thickness increases with mouth opening in both zzso and zzso zzso
