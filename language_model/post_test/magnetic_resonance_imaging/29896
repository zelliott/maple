The aim of this study was to validate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for assessing left zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso and zzso zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso from gated zzso zzso 

zzso patients with severe coronary artery disease were examined with gated zzso PET (8 gates per cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated from gated zzso PET using zzso and zzso Within 2 d zzso cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso (20 gates per cardiac zzso was done as a zzso 

zzso failed to accurately detect zzso borders in 1 zzso zzso in 2 zzso For the remaining 42 patients, correlation between the results of gated zzso PET and zzso was high for zzso (R zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso (R zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso underestimated zzso whereas no other zzso differed significantly between gated zzso PET and zzso for either zzso 

Despite small systematic differences that, among other aspects, limit zzso agreement between gated zzso PET and zzso is good across a wide range of clinically relevant volumes and zzso values assessed by zzso and zzso
