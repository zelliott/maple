zzso pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data is continuing to increase in zzso Like all zzso zzso these analyses require extensive data processing and zzso choices, but the impact of these decisions on the final results is not always zzso This study explores the impact of four zzso choices on analysis outcomes and introduces the technique of zzso on random runs for characterizing zzso zzso and evaluating zzso zzso The analyses were performed on two zzso data sets, which were repeatedly analyzed with support zzso machines, varying the method of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into training and testing zzso zzso sometimes slightly increased zzso zzso zzso other than on the runs increased zzso zzso and the random runs technique allowed us to attribute this improvement to the increased amount of training data, rather than to zzso The impact of the zzso zzso and zzso methods varied so strongly with data set that general recommendations could not be zzso These interactions suggest that, rather than searching for a universally superior set of zzso choices, researchers must carefully consider each choice in the context of each zzso
