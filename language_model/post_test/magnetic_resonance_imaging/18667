We evaluated the imaging features of portal vein aneurysm occurring at the zzso portion and the relation between portal vein aneurysm of the zzso portion and portal vein zzso 

zzso analysis was performed in 18 patients with portal vein aneurysm of the zzso portion of the portal zzso We analyzed the size, shape, and imaging findings of portal vein zzso In addition, we evaluated associated portal vein anomalies, specifically, the branching pattern of the zzso portal vein and the position of the zzso portion of the left portal zzso 

The diameter of the portal vein aneurysm ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and the shape of the portal vein aneurysm was zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging findings of the portal vein aneurysm of the zzso portion were typical for its vascular zzso zzso vein anomalies were seen in eight of 18 patients zzso the right anterior zzso portal vein zzso zzso 7) or the right anterior and zzso zzso portal veins zzso zzso 1) originating from the zzso portion of the left portal vein and a rightward zzso of the zzso portion of the left portal vein zzso zzso zzso 

Due to its vascular nature, zzso diagnostic zzso can enable the detection of portal vein aneurysm of the zzso portion, and there is a close relation between portal vein aneurysm of the zzso portion and portal vein zzso
