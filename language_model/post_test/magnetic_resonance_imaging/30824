zzso zzso imaging zzso is an advanced quantitative form of zzso zzso It could be used to calculate not only the apparent diffusion zzso zzso of average water diffusion for each zzso but also the diffusion zzso index of zzso zzso imaging is used in most of the studies of the brain tumors zzso We used zzso method to measure the zzso fractional zzso zzso and relative zzso zzso values of different tumor zzso and to evaluate the usefulness of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso solid zzso zzso region, zzso region, normal brain zzso and in grading the zzso of cerebral zzso 

Fourteen cases of zzso diagnosed (10 cases of grade 1-2 zzso and 4 cases of grade zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso zzso and zzso values of different tumor tissue were zzso 

When all cases were analyzed as a group, significant differences of zzso were found in enhancing solid tumor zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso compared with normal brain tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso differences of zzso were also found in solid tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso region and zzso region, respectively zzso zzso zzso differences of zzso and zzso were found in solid enhancing region zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso compared with normal brain tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference of zzso and zzso was found in solid tumor (including enhancing and zzso zzso zzso differences of zzso zzso zzso not zzso and zzso were found between grade 1-2 zzso zzso zzso and grade zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso can be used to differentiate normal brain tissue from enhancing solid zzso zzso region, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso can be used to differentiate solid enhancing zzso zzso region, and zzso region from normal brain zzso but can not be used to differentiate solid zzso zzso region, and zzso zzso The zzso values, not zzso and zzso may predict the degree of zzso of zzso zzso
