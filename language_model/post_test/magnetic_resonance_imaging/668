This study examined frontal lobe zzso in 46 normal children and adolescents zzso zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso to assess the effects of age and gender on zzso measures as well as zzso zzso Superior, middle, inferior, and zzso gray, white, and zzso zzso volumes were manually delineated in high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso data to assess possible zzso zzso We report a significant age-related increase in the white matter of the left inferior frontal zzso zzso in boys zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the left zzso was significantly larger in boys compared to girls zzso zzso zzso Boys showed increased gray matter volume relative to girls even after correcting for total cerebral zzso Also, boys were found to have significant Right zzso Left asymmetry patterns with greater right zzso volumes for total cerebral volume, total cerebral white matter, zzso white matter, and zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso Girls showed significant Right zzso Left asymmetry patterns in total cerebral and zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest continued modification of the zzso during normal development in boys, and significant gender differences in zzso gray matter between boys and girls that may be possibly linked to gender differences in speech development and zzso of zzso
