zzso evidence from structural brain imaging studies on individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder zzso has supported links between prenatal alcohol exposure and brain zzso zzso Although global and regional zzso reductions appear relatively zzso the effects of alcohol exposure on cortical thickness and relationships with facial zzso are not yet zzso The structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 69 children and adolescents with zzso and 58 zzso controls collected from 3 sites were examined using zzso to detect cortical thickness changes across the entire brain in zzso and their associations with facial zzso Controlling for brain size, subjects with zzso showed significantly thicker zzso than controls in several zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso conducted within site further revealed prominent group differences in left inferior frontal zzso within all 3 zzso In addition, increased inferior frontal thickness was significantly correlated with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso with previous reports, findings of this study are supportive of regional increases in cortical thickness serving as a zzso for disrupted brain development in zzso Furthermore, the significant associations between thickness and zzso measures suggest that the severity of brain anomalies may be reflected by that of the zzso
