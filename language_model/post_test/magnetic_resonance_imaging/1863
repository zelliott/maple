One drawback of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is that the subject must endure intense noise during zzso We examined the possible role of such noise on the zzso of early visual zzso during visual mental zzso We zzso that noise may require subjects to work harder to pay attention to the task, which in turn could alter the zzso pattern found in a silent zzso To test this hypothesis, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso to monitor regional zzso Blood zzso zzso of six subjects while they performed an imagery task either in a silent environment or in an zzso noisy zzso Both noisy and silent imagery conditions, as compared to their respective zzso resulted in zzso of a bilateral zzso network zzso to spatial zzso a bilateral inferior zzso area zzso to shape zzso and zzso of anterior zzso zzso Among the visual areas, zzso increased in the most zzso part of the zzso cortex, but at level just below the statistical zzso However, blood flow values in the zzso zzso during the silent imagery condition (but not the noisy imagery zzso were strongly zzso correlated with zzso the more challenging subjects found the task, the more strongly the zzso zzso was zzso The subjects made more errors in the noisy condition than in the silent condition, and a direct comparison of the two conditions revealed that noise resulted in an increase in zzso in the anterior zzso zzso zzso in performance zzso and in the zzso area zzso to zzso the verbal cues used in the zzso These results thus demonstrate a zzso effect of zzso zzso noise, resulting in a slight but significant effect on both performance and the neural zzso zzso
