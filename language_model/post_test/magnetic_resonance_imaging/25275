To evaluate the zzso value of apparent diffusion zzso zzso on therapy outcome of combined zzso in patients with primary zzso of the zzso 

Prior to zzso combined, zzso zzso 16 patients with primary zzso of the zzso zzso were examined with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso spin echo zzso images zzso and zzso T 1 zzso spin echo zzso images at zzso zzso were zzso The mean zzso of the tumor region was calculated and correlated with the therapy outcome substantiated by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso occurred in 9 patients zzso zzso and no zzso zzso in 7 patients zzso zzso The mean zzso measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the mean zzso between the groups reached statistical significance zzso zzso zzso 

The mean zzso might be a new quantitative zzso to predict therapy outcome of combined zzso zzso in patients with primary zzso of the zzso
