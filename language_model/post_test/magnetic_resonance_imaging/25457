Despite crucial advances in our knowledge of the zzso mechanisms and the availability of effective diagnostic and treatment zzso coronary zzso remains the most frequent cause of zzso heart zzso zzso disruption with superimposed zzso is the main cause of unstable zzso zzso zzso and sudden zzso New findings have recently introduced exciting concepts that could have major impact on the treatment of the zzso zzso We will discuss the mechanisms that lead to the development of zzso and those responsible for the acute coronary zzso as well as some of the concepts derived from in zzso observations using new imaging technologies zzso high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso
