The zzso cavernous zzso a zzso zzso zzso surrounding the horizontal portion of the zzso artery at the skull base, provides an alternative zzso of zzso zzso drainage by virtue of its connections to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the jugular zzso zzso zzso of the anatomy of this system zzso interpretation of images and might reduce the number of zzso diagnoses of zzso such as zzso or zzso We hypothesized that this circulation could be zzso on zzso zzso zzso MR zzso 

The zzso junctions of 14 patients were scanned using zzso zzso zzso MR sequences and evaluated for visibility of the following zzso zzso zzso cavernous zzso zzso artery zzso zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso internal jugular zzso and the marginal zzso Both the right and left sides were assessed in at least two zzso The zzso diameters were also zzso 

All the evaluated zzso structures were seen routinely in all three planes, with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso known to be zzso present, which was seen only one third of the time in the zzso plane and two thirds of the time in the other zzso The zzso zzso vein also showed the greatest zzso in size and zzso 

The zzso cavernous zzso and most of its associated zzso circulation at the skull base are easily identified on zzso zzso zzso MR zzso The zzso zzso zzso known to be zzso present, was not well seen in the zzso plane and displayed the greatest zzso in size and zzso
