To derive zzso assessments of ejection fraction zzso and left zzso mass zzso from zzso cardiac MR images acquired at single and multiple zzso on different zzso scanner zzso 

Images of 15 healthy volunteers were acquired twice using a zzso zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso and once using a zzso Excite scanner zzso Electric, Milwaukee, zzso zzso over four months, and analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso software, zzso Two physicists independently segmented the zzso borders in order to derive zzso and zzso assessments of zzso and zzso for single and multiple zzso on the same and different zzso 

For zzso the zzso of zzso zzso increased as different observers, multiple zzso and different scanners were zzso The zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso single zzso same zzso to zzso zzso zzso different zzso different zzso For zzso zzso zzso parameters were consistently smaller than zzso zzso The zzso ranged from zzso g zzso zzso single zzso same zzso to zzso g zzso zzso different zzso different zzso 

zzso zzso data can be obtained at single or multiple zzso using different zzso However, zzso is notably susceptible to zzso variation, and this should be carefully considered if similar evaluations are planned as part of zzso or zzso zzso
