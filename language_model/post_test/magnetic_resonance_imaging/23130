Changes in brain structure occur in remote regions following focal damage such as zzso Such changes could disrupt processing of information across widely distributed brain zzso We used diffusion zzso zzso to assess connectivity between brain regions in 9 chronic stroke patients and 18 zzso zzso We applied complex network analysis to calculate zzso a measure of the ease with which information can travel across a zzso zzso individuals based on zzso separated patient and control groups, not only in the zzso zzso but also in the zzso hemisphere, despite the absence of gross structural pathology in the zzso In our highly selected patient group, zzso were zzso to the left zzso zzso zzso We found reduced zzso in patients in regions surrounding the zzso in the affected zzso In addition, zzso was reduced in zzso locations in the zzso zzso for a subset of these zzso We interpret this as evidence for secondary zzso of zzso pathways which occurs in remote regions zzso directly or zzso with the area of primary zzso We also identified regions with increased zzso in patients that could represent zzso plastic changes zzso Network analysis provides new and powerful tools for understanding subtle changes in interactions across widely distributed brain networks following zzso
