zzso hollow zzso oxide zzso zzso were produced by a zzso surface zzso approach, using zzso zzso as an adhesive zzso for cancer targeted delivery of therapeutic zzso and simultaneous diagnosis via magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso immobilized onto the surface of zzso due to the strong binding affinity of zzso to metal zzso as examined by zzso transform infrared zzso and X-ray zzso zzso These zzso were subsequently zzso with a therapeutic zzso zzso zzso to selectively target cancer zzso zzso zzso and MR imaging studies revealed that the surface zzso zzso enabled the targeted detection of cancer cells in zzso zzso as well as the efficient zzso delivery of zzso for zzso gene zzso These zzso are expected to be widely exploited as zzso delivery vehicles for cancer therapy and imaging zzso
