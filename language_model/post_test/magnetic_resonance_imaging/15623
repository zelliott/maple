Between 10 and zzso of patients with normal pressure zzso zzso treated with a shunt will improve but they risk significant zzso from this zzso zzso is treated zzso and it has been assumed that a zzso difference must exist to differentiate which patient will zzso The purpose of this study is to see whether zzso zzso can differentiate which patients will improve post zzso 

zzso patients with zzso underwent zzso with flow zzso measuring the degree of zzso enlargement, zzso zzso white matter disease, total blood zzso zzso zzso zzso aqueduct stroke volume, relative compliance ratio and zzso zzso Patients were followed up after shunt zzso to gauge the degree of improvement and were compared with 12 zzso controls and 12 patients with Alzheimer's zzso 

zzso of patients improved with zzso The zzso were identical to the zzso in all zzso The zzso patients were significantly different to the controls zzso Total blood inflow reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso aqueduct stroke volume increased zzso relative compliance ratio reduced zzso and zzso delay reduced 57% with p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The patient's with Alzheimer's disease values were midway between the zzso and control zzso 

zzso zzso differences were noted between zzso and controls but these were unable to differentiate the zzso from zzso The zzso of Alzheimer's disease makes exclusion of zzso from this disease zzso
