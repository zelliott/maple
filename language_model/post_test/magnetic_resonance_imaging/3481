Small zzso zzso zzso are often conservatively managed and treated only upon zzso Growth is usually reported in zzso but describing the growth of a zzso structure by a single diameter has been zzso As a result, VS growth dynamics should be further zzso In addition, baseline clinical parameters that could predict growth would be zzso In this prospective study the authors aimed to describe growth dynamics in a cohort of conservatively managed zzso They also compared different growth models and evaluated the ability of baseline parameters to predict future zzso 

Between 2000 and 2006, 178 consecutive patients with unilateral de zzso zzso zzso identified among the Norwegian population of zzso million persons were referred to a zzso care center and were included in a study protocol of conservative zzso zzso size was defined by MR zzso volume estimates and was recorded along with clinical data at regular zzso zzso models were used to analyze the relationships between zzso Three growth models were compared using statistical diagnostic zzso a zzso model, a zzso model, and a volume doubling time zzso zzso A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine a zzso for the zzso model for distinguishing growing and zzso zzso 

A mean growth rate corresponding to a zzso of zzso years zzso zzso zzso was zzso Other growth models in this study revealed mean growth rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Volume doubling time was found to be the most realistic growth zzso All baseline variables had p values zzso zzso for predicting zzso 

Based on the actual zzso zzso was the most correct way to describe VS zzso The authors found that a zzso of zzso years provided the best value to distinguish growing from zzso zzso None of the investigated baseline zzso were usable as zzso of zzso
