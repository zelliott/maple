Several methods have been proposed for overcoming the effects of zzso zzso magnetic field zzso in zzso zzso Some of these methods rely at least in part on the ability to independently control magnitude and phase of different drives in either one zzso zzso zzso or in different zzso coils in a transmit zzso The adjustment of these drive zzso and zzso alone to create uniform zzso magnetic zzso fields has been called zzso zzso and has certain limits at every frequency as dictated by possible solutions to Maxwell's zzso Here we use zzso calculations to explore the limits of zzso zzso in the human zzso We found that a zzso array can effectively zzso a single slice at zzso up to 600 zzso and the whole brain at up to 300 zzso while an zzso array can zzso the whole brain at up to 600 zzso
