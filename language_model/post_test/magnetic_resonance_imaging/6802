A method is described for zzso the cellular zzso zzso concentration in human skeletal muscle based on zzso zzso acquisition with relaxation zzso image zzso The zzso zzso were calculated using relaxation rates, zzso zzso spatial zzso and zzso signal zzso from foot muscle and an external zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images of the foot muscles in 11 normal subjects were acquired at zzso T using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PRESS zzso zzso zzso were acquired to verify the measurable zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The mean measured concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso signal zzso averaged over the entire zzso foot anatomy and zzso zzso zzso zzso for a 3 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso image acquisition time was 4 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso concentration can be accurately measured zzso in human muscle from zzso images acquired in short scan times with relatively high spatial zzso
