We compared the influences of the parameters of several pulse sequences using two major commercially available zzso zzso contrast media for MR zzso The phantom of zzso solutions of various concentration zzso - zzso was prepared, and was scanned with a zzso clinical MR unit, using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The signal intensity was measured and the contrast enhancement ratio zzso was calculated and plotted as a function of zzso zzso The results were compared between the pulse zzso and between the contrast media as zzso Both zzso and zzso showed higher zzso than other two zzso showing similar zzso curve zzso There was no significant difference both in zzso value and zzso curve zzso between the two contrast media for each pulse zzso
