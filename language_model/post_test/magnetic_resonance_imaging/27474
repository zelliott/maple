This study aimed to determine the zzso zzso and reliability of the zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging technique at 3 T for zzso and liver iron burden zzso and the relationship between zzso values at 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and 20 healthy subjects were zzso zzso zzso and global zzso values were calculated after developing a correction map to compensate the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso value was determined over a region of zzso The zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso at 3 T was zzso A linear relationship was found between patients' zzso zzso ) values at 3 and zzso zzso zzso correction factors were significantly higher at 3 zzso A conversion formula returning zzso values at zzso T from values at 3 T was zzso A good diagnostic reliability for zzso assessment at 3 T was zzso Lower limits of normal for 3 T zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the global heart, zzso zzso and liver, zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso of iron burden in the zzso zzso global heart, and no zzso zzso resulted to be zzso zzso and reliable at 3 zzso zzso heart zzso analysis at 3 T may be challenging due to significantly higher zzso zzso
