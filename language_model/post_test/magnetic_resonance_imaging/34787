A retrospective case review zzso five patients with zzso tumors involving the zzso zzso 

A zzso referral zzso 

Patients with tumors involving the zzso bone who have satisfied the criteria for being considered zzso 

zzso tumor zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso between zzso and diagnosis of the zzso zzso amount of radiation received, therapeutic interventions, and survival statistics for each zzso 

Five cases of zzso tumors of the zzso bone are presented zzso zzso two zzso and one zzso cell zzso All five zzso bone tumors occurred in individuals that had previously received zzso 5,000 zzso of zzso The initial zzso diagnoses included two zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso There was an average zzso period of 15 years zzso zzso zzso between completion of radiation and diagnosis of the zzso Four patients were treated with zzso plus chemotherapy, and one decided against zzso The prognosis was poor, with survival time of zzso months after the diagnosis of the zzso zzso Only one patient survived zzso 14 months and is currently free of disease, 3 years after diagnosis of the zzso zzso 

Although zzso tumors of the zzso bone occur with a very low zzso their prognosis is extremely zzso The remote possibility of a zzso tumor should be factored in when deciding upon the most appropriate therapeutic zzso for individuals with zzso of the zzso and head and zzso Such considerations are particularly germane when contemplating radiation therapy for a benign zzso zzso zzso zzso acoustic zzso or zzso in an individual with a long predicted zzso
