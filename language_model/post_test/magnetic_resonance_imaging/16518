zzso group box 1 zzso protein is an innate danger signal for the initiation of host zzso and tissue zzso The aim of this study was to zzso serum zzso concentration and its correlation with zzso zzso and functional recovery in patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso examined patients with first-time zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso treated according to current zzso zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed 2-4 days after zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso and was repeated after 6 months for the zzso of residual left zzso zzso zzso was measured 2-4 days after zzso 

zzso group box 1 concentration was related to zzso size and to residual ejection fraction in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso for zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for patients with zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso of zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso area under the curve zzso zzso zzso standard error zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for patients with zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso of residual ejection fraction 6 months after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso group box 1 serum levels represent a highly valuable surrogate marker for zzso zzso and for the prediction of residual left zzso function after zzso
