Since 1991, three separate reports have shown how hearing may be salvaged after zzso zzso of small acoustic zzso The authors submit yet another report of a complete zzso zzso of a zzso zzso acoustic tumor with modest hearing zzso An attempt is made to zzso the steps of the operation and recognize and discuss what particular events may have safeguarded the viability of the zzso With the availability of cochlear zzso there should be added incentive to preserve the cochlear zzso if hair cells cannot be zzso 

The study design was a retrospective case zzso 

The study was conducted at a primary care zzso 

zzso and zzso measures were zzso 

Hearing preservation was zzso 

A 55-year-old woman presented with a zzso hearing loss and a zzso left acoustic tumor completely filling the internal auditory canal zzso reception threshold zzso 30 zzso discrimination zzso zzso A successful zzso zzso of the tumor was performed in November zzso A zzso zzso zzso showed a mixed hearing loss in the left ear with zzso 85 zzso and zzso zzso Average zzso threshold for 500 zzso 1 zzso and 3 zzso was 50 zzso and aided zzso 40 zzso with zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete zzso of the zzso 

An exceptional case of hearing preservation after zzso zzso of a small acoustic tumor illustrates how it may be possible to preserve cochlear hair cells and zzso simultaneously in certain selected zzso A review of the surgical events shows the value of zzso the cochlear duct with bone zzso selectively removing the zzso nerves with the tumor by sharp zzso and safeguarding the zzso segment of the anterior inferior zzso artery by a limited zzso zzso
