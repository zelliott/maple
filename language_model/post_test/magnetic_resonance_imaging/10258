To determine the relation between zzso zzso quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of whole brain structure, and clinical seizure factors reflecting zzso cause, course, and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of total zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso and zzso and zzso volumes and clinical seizure features were examined in relation to summary zzso of cognitive morbidity in 96 patients with zzso lobe zzso zzso volumes were adjusted for zzso volume zzso and cognitive scores were adjusted for age, education, and zzso based on a sample of 82 healthy zzso 

zzso volumes zzso white, and zzso were abnormal in chronic zzso lobe zzso patients compared with controls and were related significantly to zzso zzso especially total zzso zzso modeling demonstrated that markers of total zzso zzso was the primary zzso of the relation between clinical seizure variables and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of overall brain zzso zzso in zzso lobe zzso are clinically meaningful markers that are associated with increased cognitive zzso These zzso appear to mediate the adverse effects of some clinical seizure variables on zzso
