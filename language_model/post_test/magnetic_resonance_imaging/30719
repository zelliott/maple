zzso zzso type 1 zzso syndrome zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso resulting from impaired zzso transport into the zzso In recent years, the increasing number of patients has generated substantial insights into the manifestations and mechanisms of this zzso Current understanding of this novel disorder is zzso and recent advances in diagnosis and treatment are zzso 

The syndrome is now understood to be a complex neurological zzso The clinical spectrum has recently been extended by infants with zzso transient zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso syndrome without seizures, and by adult zzso Other key findings in the last couple of years include zzso the description of electroencephalogram zzso zzso a characteristic cerebral zzso footprint in zzso zzso zzso imaging, and zzso the definition of molecular mechanisms and functional zzso within the zzso zzso type 1 protein by zzso zzso The disease has also shed a new light on the mechanisms and the effectiveness of the zzso diet for seizure zzso 

The syndrome is now well characterized in children and should be considered in any patient with intractable zzso An effective therapy is zzso The clinical spectrum and the molecular basis of the disease are increasingly zzso and indicate complex zzso mechanisms that will ultimately lead to a zzso on clinical, zzso and molecular zzso
