zzso in parts of the human motor system has been shown to correlate with the complexity of performed motor sequences in terms of the number of limbs moved, number of movements, and number of zzso Here, we searched for activity zzso with zzso complexity, in terms of the number of different intervals produced in the zzso using an zzso tapping zzso Our task was divided into three zzso movement selection and initiation zzso zzso of finger tapping with an external auditory cue zzso and continued tapping in absence of the auditory zzso zzso Comparisons between zzso and continuation showed a pattern in keeping with prior zzso studies of paced finger zzso Thus, zzso of bilateral zzso and zzso zzso was greater in continuation tapping than in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed activity zzso with zzso complexity during initiate in bilateral supplementary and zzso motor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso among other zzso During zzso correlated activity was observed in bilateral zzso more zzso zzso and zzso zzso right zzso and right primary motor zzso No correlated activity was observed during continue at zzso zzso cluster zzso though left angular zzso was active at zzso We suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities during initiate may be associated with selection of timing zzso while zzso in zzso prefrontal zzso during both initiate and zzso may be associated with zzso error monitoring or zzso The absence of activity significantly correlated with zzso complexity during continue suggests that, once an zzso timed movement sequence has been selected and zzso there is no further adjustment of the timing control processes related to its continued production in absence of external zzso
