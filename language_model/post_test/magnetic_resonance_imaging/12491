zzso methods for quantitative magnetic resonance zzso are not widely used for magnetic resonance zzso examinations in clinical practice due to the lengthy and difficult zzso In this report, we aimed to investigate whether zzso zzso show zzso with relaxation parameters zzso water concentration zzso and age, using a quantitative magnetic resonance zzso method, which is suitable for a clinical zzso 

We performed 166 single zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso in the white matter and zzso in 47 healthy subjects, aged zzso zzso Whole brain zzso zzso and zzso maps were determined for each subject using quantitative magnetic resonance zzso Absolute zzso zzso were calculated by zzso the zzso magnetic resonance zzso using the quantitative magnetic resonance imaging maps of zzso zzso and zzso 

Absolute zzso in white matter of total zzso and zzso were correlated with age zzso zzso 12 zzso 4 zzso P zzso zzso zzso 23 zzso 9 zzso P zzso zzso suggesting a process of increased zzso density in aging white zzso Moreover, total zzso and total zzso were zzso correlated with the zzso and positively correlated with the zzso of white zzso In addition, the zzso lower bound was biased regarding the zzso zzso suggesting that should not be used as a quality zzso 

The implemented method was fast, zzso and zzso
