The objective was to determine the importance of the zzso shoulder zzso on magnetic resonance zzso images for the diagnosis of zzso zzso nerve roots zzso that are compromised by zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images of 11 patients (6 men and 5 zzso age range, zzso years; average age, zzso zzso with surgically proven zzso which was compromised by zzso zzso were zzso evaluated by two musculoskeletal zzso MR images were evaluated for the presence or absence of the zzso shoulder zzso vertical structure connecting two consecutive nerve roots and zzso disk on the zzso MR zzso The zzso noted the type of accompanying disk zzso and zzso spinal canal changes, as well as other characteristic MR features of zzso the common passage of two consecutive nerve roots through the neural zzso on zzso MR zzso 

The zzso shoulder sign was identified with a mean frequency of zzso by the two observers (in 10 of 11 zzso The common passage of two consecutive nerve roots through the neural zzso on zzso MR images was identified with a mean frequency of zzso (in 7 and 6 out of 11 patients, by observers 1 and 2, zzso Good zzso agreement for the zzso shoulder sign was present zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Observation of the zzso shoulder sign may prove helpful for diagnosing zzso in patients with disk zzso In particular, this sign appears to be useful when there is no evidence of zzso on zzso MR zzso
