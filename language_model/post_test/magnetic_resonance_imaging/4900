zzso zzso imaging zzso is a form of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso that allows examination of the zzso integrity of white matter in the zzso zzso is a neurodegenerative disease, and zzso can provide indirect insights of the zzso characteristics of brains in individuals with different forms of zzso 

To evaluate the value of zzso in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso 

The study included 40 patients (20 zzso patients and 20 zzso zzso and 20 normal controls zzso After routine zzso and zzso fractional zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso zzso values were measured and compared in regions of interest zzso 

Compared to NC and zzso patients, zzso patients had lower zzso values and higher zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the corpus zzso zzso zzso of the corpus zzso zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso Compared to controls and zzso patients, zzso patients had lower zzso values in the anterior frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and higher zzso values in the zzso lobe and zzso 

zzso can be used to estimate the white matter impairment in zzso zzso There were significant regional reductions of zzso values and heightened zzso values in multiple regions in zzso patients compared to zzso zzso When compared with conventional zzso zzso may provide a more objective method for the differential diagnosis of zzso and zzso disease patients who have only mild white matter zzso on zzso zzso
