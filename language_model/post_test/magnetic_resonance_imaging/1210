To evaluate zzso zzso as a potential contrast agent at magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the zzso 

zzso zzso was injected zzso into three zzso at a dose of 5 zzso per zzso of body zzso For comparison, zzso zzso was injected into three other zzso at a dose of zzso zzso per zzso of body zzso zzso three-dimensional MR images were acquired in all six zzso at zzso T before and approximately 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 minutes after contrast material zzso zzso stomach specimens were zzso at zzso zzso In zzso and ex zzso images were evaluated visually and zzso for contrast enhancement of the stomach, and in zzso images were evaluated for the presence of zzso from the zzso 

zzso zzso produced prolonged and selective enhancement of the inner surface of the stomach, in contrast to the more general enhancement seen with zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso could not account for this selective zzso zzso zzso images confirmed that zzso enhancement in the stomach wall with zzso zzso was limited to the inner zzso zzso zzso did not produce selective enhancement of the inner surface of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso enhances the inner surface of the stomach on MR images acquired in zzso and, therefore, may have potential for use as a contrast agent at MR imaging of the human zzso
