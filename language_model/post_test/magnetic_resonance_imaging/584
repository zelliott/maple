The summed activity of multiple zzso of a distributed cortical network supports face recognition in humans, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions, and zzso regions outside zzso Many individuals with zzso zzso impairment in face zzso normal blood zzso zzso zzso zzso in the core zzso zzso These individuals zzso a reduction in the structural integrity of the white matter tracts connecting zzso to anterior zzso and frontal zzso part of the zzso face zzso The impairment in zzso zzso may zzso therefore, not from a dysfunction of the core zzso areas but from a failure to zzso signals between the intact zzso and the extended zzso of the zzso Using the zzso adaptation paradigm with famous and unknown faces, we show that individuals with zzso zzso zzso normal adaptation effects in zzso indicating sensitivity to facial identity, but show no differential zzso for familiar versus unknown faces outside zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso and the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is thus insufficient to zzso intact face recognition, and disrupted information propagation between zzso and the extended face processing network may explain the functional impairment in zzso zzso
