Little is known about the brain systems that contribute to vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder zzso zzso of the zzso patterns of intrinsic functional zzso as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso between groups with and without zzso following a traumatic event can help identify the neural mechanisms of the disorder and targets for zzso 

zzso zzso patients and 72 matched traumatized subjects who experienced the 2008 zzso earthquake were zzso with blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso and analyzed using the measure of regional zzso zzso during the resting zzso 

zzso patients presented enhanced zzso in the left inferior zzso zzso and right superior frontal zzso and reduced zzso in the right middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to traumatized individuals without zzso 

Our findings showed that abnormal brain activity exists under resting conditions in zzso patients who had been exposed to a major zzso zzso in the local functional connectivity of cortical regions are likely to contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying zzso
