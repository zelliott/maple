MR studies of zzso injuries of the knee are performed to obtain a high zzso ratio between the zzso cartilage and such other structures as zzso bone, zzso fat pad and zzso zzso This goal has been achieved with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This kind of sequence yields high spatial contrast resolution because of its zzso thin zzso zzso slices and high contrast resolution between the zzso cartilage, which is strongly zzso and the surrounding structures zzso zzso fluid, zzso zzso which appear zzso From September, 1994, to February, 1995, we submitted to zzso 34 patients, adding the zzso zzso technique after the routine zzso These zzso sections were obtained to image the zzso joint cartilage in 15 patients and to study the zzso compartment in 19 zzso zzso injuries were graded according to zzso and Locker zzso and MR results were compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences permitted accurate zzso thickness evaluation and the depiction of cartilage injuries, especially in advanced injuries zzso 3 and zzso However, in earlier zzso this MR technique tends to overestimate zzso zzso areas in normal thickness zzso This MR pattern needs a close correlation with clinical findings and should be interpreted according to the zzso of other associated zzso zzso
