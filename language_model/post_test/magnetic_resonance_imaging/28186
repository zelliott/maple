Twenty seconds and 3 minutes after starting rapid injection of zzso zzso dynamic zzso images were obtained with the 2 dimension fast zzso shot zzso zzso zzso Four of 5 cervical zzso showed high signal intensity in the early dynamic phase (20 zzso so they were readily distinguished from the zzso that were not enhanced in the same zzso For evaluation of zzso invasion, MD study showed better contrast between the tumor and the zzso than did zzso images because the tumor demonstrated a high signal intensity similar to that of the zzso on zzso zzso MD images were able to scan the entire tumor especially in progressive cases and to evaluate the zzso of the zzso zzso MD imaging seemed to be useful for evaluation of zzso invasion in cervical zzso
