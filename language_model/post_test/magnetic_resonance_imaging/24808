zzso zzso affects spinal stability in zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso are zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso strength of zzso spinal segments following zzso and whether these zzso parameters are affected by disc zzso and bone mineral density zzso 

Ten human zzso zzso spines were obtained (age zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was classified according to zzso and zzso in mild or zzso zzso was defined as high zzso zzso zzso or low zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed either on zzso zzso or zzso zzso Twenty motion segments zzso and zzso were zzso The effects of zzso disc zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso moments to failure zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso showed a typical zzso pattern with an early zzso zzso zzso late zzso zzso zzso and a zzso Following zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its interaction with zzso zzso did significantly affect zzso In the mildly zzso group, zzso decreased zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso following zzso In the severely zzso group, zzso decreased zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso following zzso In segments with low zzso zzso was zzso zzso lower than segments with high zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

zzso affects both zzso zzso and zzso load to zzso In addition, zzso strength is strongly affected by zzso whereas disc zzso affects zzso zzso Assessment of disc zzso and zzso zzso improves the understanding of the zzso effects of a zzso zzso
