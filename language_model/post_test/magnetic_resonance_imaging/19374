The zzso goal in this study was to compare the size of zzso bulbs of patients with schizophrenia and those of healthy zzso 

zzso resonance imaging scans of zzso bulbs were obtained from 26 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy comparison zzso A reliable region of interest procedure was used to measure zzso bulb zzso 

Patients exhibited zzso smaller bilateral bulb volume than comparison subjects, independent of acute clinical, zzso or treatment zzso zzso volume correlated with odor detection sensitivity in healthy subjects but not in patients with zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia exhibit structural zzso deficits as well as functional zzso zzso The zzso system may be a model system in which to study the zzso of the zzso
