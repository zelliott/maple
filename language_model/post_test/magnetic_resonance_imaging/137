zzso monkeys are widely used in order to understand the mechanisms of the human zzso But humans have capacities not found in zzso and their brains differ in important ways, for example in the proportions of different regions and in zzso However, this does not mean that we must abandon the monkey model, only that wherever possible, we should test whether zzso can be zzso One strategy is to use zzso to zzso zzso in humans, and compare these with zzso in zzso Where the results are the same, we can then use information from single unit recording in those areas to suggest the mechanisms by which those areas perform their functions in the human zzso
