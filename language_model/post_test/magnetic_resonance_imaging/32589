zzso decline in gray matter brain volume and cognitive function in healthy adults has been reported in the zzso The goal of the current study is to examine the relationship between age-related changes in regional gray matter volumes and cognitive function in a large, zzso sample of healthy adults across the zzso 

zzso resonance imaging and cognitive assessment were conducted on 148 adults aged zzso zzso Multiple zzso analyses examining the effect of age were performed on magnetic resonance zzso gray matter brain volumes and standardized cognitive summary scores of attention and executive zzso zzso was also performed to test the effect of age, gray matter volumes, and their interaction on the prediction of cognitive zzso 

Age significantly predicted performance on tests of attention zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and executive function zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and gray matter volumes for frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso p zzso regions significantly predicted performance on tests of zzso zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso p zzso and the interaction between age and lateral frontal volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso significantly predicted executive zzso 

The findings confirm zzso decline in cognitive function and gray matter volumes, particularly in anterior cortical brain zzso Furthermore, the association between lateral frontal gray matter volume and the ability to successfully plan, zzso and execute strategies varies as a function of age across the healthy adult zzso
