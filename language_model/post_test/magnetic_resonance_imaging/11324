zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the incorporation of label from zzso zzso initially into C4 of zzso allows the regional zzso acid zzso cycle flux zzso to be determined in the human zzso In this study, a direct zzso MRS approach was used at zzso with zzso enhancement and zzso decoupling with zzso to determine zzso zzso in six zzso The values found in the visual zzso are similar to those reported in previous zzso MRS studies, and consistent with PET zzso of the cerebral zzso rate for zzso zzso In two preliminary zzso studies using light emitting zzso zzso goggles flashing at 8 zzso compared to darkness as control, increases in zzso were found from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These are upper estimates, but they are similar to the increases in zzso reported in PET studies, and strongly suggest, in contrast to these PET studies, that cerebral zzso is zzso zzso even during intense visual zzso This is supported by the observation that very little zzso label is incorporated into zzso zzso as would be expected if zzso were zzso zzso There is evidence for incorporation of zzso into cerebral zzso but this is a relatively minor component of cerebral zzso zzso
