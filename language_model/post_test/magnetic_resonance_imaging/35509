To evaluate the efficacy of zzso weighted imaging zzso in comparison to standard zzso weighted zzso contrast zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Twelve children zzso age, zzso zzso with the diagnosis of zzso and unilateral zzso involvement were recruited zzso and examined with high resolution three zzso zzso and conventional zzso Both zzso and zzso images were evaluated using a zzso scoring system according to six types of imaging findings zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso and gray zzso matter zzso zzso The scores of zzso versus zzso images were then compared for each type of zzso 

zzso was superior to zzso in identifying the enlarged zzso veins zzso zzso zzso abnormal zzso veins zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso and gray zzso matter junction abnormalities zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was better than zzso in identifying enlarged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can provide useful and unique information complementary to conventional contrast enhanced zzso weighted zzso for characterizing zzso zzso zzso should be integrated into routine clinical zzso protocols for suspected zzso
