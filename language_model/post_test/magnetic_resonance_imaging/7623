This article is dedicated to present a zzso zzso resonance zzso based three-dimensional finite element modeling on the zzso manifestations relating to the zzso of zzso zzso An efficient approach for identifying the zzso zzso of zzso has also been demonstrated through tracking the localized zzso zzso distribution or enhanced dynamic zzso The temperature features over the skin surface and zzso domain have been characterized using the zzso simulation and experimental measurement which will help better interpret the zzso zzso mechanisms of the zzso under zzso or zzso zzso Further, zzso simulations on the zzso symptoms of zzso and zzso effects within zzso domain caused by varying breathing zzso in the trachea and zzso in artery and vein were zzso It was disclosed that among all the zzso the zzso volume has the largest effect on the total heat flux of zzso zzso However, zzso contributions caused by varying the breathing frequency and zzso zzso are zzso zzso The present study suggests a generalized way for simulating the close to reality zzso behavior or process of human zzso which is of significance for disease diagnosis and treatment zzso
