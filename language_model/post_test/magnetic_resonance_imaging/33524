zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso is one of the most important methods for zzso evaluating the state of water in the biological zzso It could be useful for evaluation of the early changes of zzso In this study, in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was applied to rat zzso zzso which is a model of the human diabetic zzso and compared with the zzso zzso The relationship between the relaxation times zzso zzso and the water contents were zzso The zzso and zzso values were prolonged and the high intensity area of the lens zzso was enlarged from the early stage of the cataract zzso days after the intake of zzso These changes preceded the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is zzso for the evaluation of zzso agents, for example zzso zzso zzso against human diabetic zzso
