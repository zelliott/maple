To report a case illustrating the value of pattern zzso and pattern zzso zzso in monitoring zzso nerve zzso zzso 

A 15-year-old girl presented with a zzso history of frontal headaches and a zzso history of blurred vision in the right zzso zzso scanning revealed a zzso right zzso nerve extending to the zzso opening of the zzso canal, consistent with an zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso showed a mildly delayed major positive component consistent with zzso nerve zzso The zzso zzso ratio was zzso in keeping with retinal zzso cell zzso Visual acuity decreased over the following 2 years and repeat zzso zzso demonstrated marked deterioration in zzso nerve function despite zzso showing no significant change in the zzso 

zzso zzso and pattern zzso can provide early objective evidence of zzso zzso zzso cell dysfunction in zzso nerve zzso zzso recordings can zzso demonstrate worsening function in the absence of significant zzso zzso
