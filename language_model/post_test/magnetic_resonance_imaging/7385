The recent identification of functional zzso of brown zzso tissue zzso in adult humans has potential implications for the treatment of zzso In order to evaluate new therapies aimed at inducing the production of more BAT or zzso BAT in humans, it will be important to develop zzso methods to assess the functional state of the tissue in zzso In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using zzso zzso imaging to zzso identify functional, activated BAT in an in zzso zzso model, in less than 1 zzso following an infusion of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging was used to monitor BAT zzso conversion of zzso zzso zzso in rats during baseline and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso by zzso injection, can be detected in rats by increased conversion of zzso zzso zzso into its downstream products zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso signal to zzso BAT was validated using zzso zzso zzso 

The radiation-free nature and recent translation into the clinic of the zzso zzso test may potentially facilitate trials of zzso targeting BAT zzso in zzso
