Slow waves are the most prominent zzso feature of zzso eye movement zzso zzso During zzso sleep, cortical zzso zzso approximately once every second between a zzso upstate, when cortical zzso are actively zzso and a zzso zzso when cortical zzso are virtually silent zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings indicate that the origins of the slow zzso are cortical and that zzso connections are necessary for their synchronization zzso and zzso 1995; zzso et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The currents produced by the zzso slow zzso of large populations of zzso appear on the scalp as electroencephalogram zzso slow waves zzso and zzso zzso Despite this cellular understanding, questions remain about the role of specific cortical structures in individual slow zzso Early zzso studies of slow waves in humans were limited by the small number of zzso employed and by the difficulty of relating scalp zzso to underlying brain activity zzso zzso Roth et zzso zzso zzso zzso methods offer exceptional spatial resolution, but lack the zzso resolution to track individual slow waves zzso et zzso 2008; zzso zzso zzso recordings in patient populations are limited by the availability of medically necessary zzso zzso and can be zzso by pathology and medications zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso recordings offers a unique opportunity for zzso sleep slow zzso So far, the results have challenged several of the influential zzso observations about slow waves that had persisted since the original zzso recordings of zzso These recent analyses revealed that individual slow waves are idiosyncratic cortical events and that the negative peak of the zzso slow wave often involves cortical structures not necessarily apparent from the zzso like the inferior frontal zzso anterior cingulate, zzso cingulate, and zzso zzso et zzso zzso In addition, not only do slow waves travel zzso et zzso zzso but they often do so zzso through the areas zzso the major zzso backbone of the human zzso zzso et zzso zzso In this chapter, we will review the zzso zzso recording, and zzso results concerning zzso slow zzso We will also confront a long held belief about peripherally evoked slow waves, also known as zzso namely that they are zzso independent and do not involve cortical sensory zzso The analysis included here is the first to directly compare zzso evoked with three different stimulation zzso within the same subject on the same night using zzso zzso
