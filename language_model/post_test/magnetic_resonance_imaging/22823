To describe and evaluate a fully automated method for characterizing abdominal zzso tissue from magnetic resonance zzso zzso body zzso 

Four MR pulse sequences were zzso SE, zzso zzso and zzso On 39 subjects, each abdomen was traversed by 15 zzso zzso zzso The total abdominal zzso tissue zzso was calculated from thresholds obtained by slice zzso zzso The same thresholds were also used in the manual volume calculation of zzso subcutaneous abdominal zzso tissue zzso and visceral abdominal zzso tissue zzso Image zzso methods, including edge zzso mathematical zzso and zzso curve fitting, were used to automatically separate zzso from zzso in various zzso cases such as those with zzso magnetic fields and movement zzso 

The percentage root mean squared errors of the method for zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso for the four zzso It took approximately 7 and 15 zzso to complete the zzso volume zzso of the three zzso tissue classes using automated and manual methods, zzso 

The results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and zzso Although the separation of zzso and zzso is not always perfect, this method could be especially helpful in dealing with large amounts of data such as in zzso zzso
