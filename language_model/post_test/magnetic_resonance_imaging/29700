Children with zzso spectrum disorders in very rare cases display surprisingly advanced zzso reading zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso we studied the neural basis of this precocious reading ability in a 9-year-old zzso boy who reads 6 years in advance of his zzso During covert reading, he demonstrated greater activity in the left inferior frontal and superior zzso zzso than both zzso zzso and reading zzso zzso zzso in the right inferior zzso zzso was greater when compared to reading zzso zzso These findings suggest that precocious reading is brought about by simultaneously drawing on both left zzso zzso and right zzso visual systems, reconciling the two zzso but seemingly contradictory, single zzso theories of zzso zzso reading is therefore associated with zzso of the left superior zzso cortex, much in the same way as zzso zzso is associated with zzso of this zzso
