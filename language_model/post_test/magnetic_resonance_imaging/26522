zzso transfer of visual information was investigated zzso and with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso 6 months after a zzso of the zzso two-thirds of the corpus zzso On zzso left zzso zzso the patient was severely impaired in reading letters, words and geographical names and moderately impaired in naming pictures and zzso In contrast, zzso transfer of visual motion information, tested by verbal report of the direction of short sequences of coherent dot motion presented within the left zzso was zzso The pattern of cerebral zzso zzso by apparent motion stimuli was studied with zzso and compared to that of normal zzso In normal subjects, apparent motion zzso as compared to darkness, activated strongly zzso and zzso zzso When presented to one zzso only, the zzso zzso region was activated while regions on the zzso zzso including putative area zzso were activated zzso A similar zzso pattern was found in the patient with a zzso zzso zzso unilateral left or right zzso stimulation was accompanied by zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso representation in the zzso visual zzso is believed to depend on zzso zzso Our observation suggests that this is not the case for visual motion representation and that other, probably zzso pathways may mediate visual motion transfer after zzso zzso
