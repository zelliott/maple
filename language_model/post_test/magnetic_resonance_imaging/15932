The pursuit of ever higher field strengths and faster data acquisitions has led to the construction of zzso zzso with high numbers of zzso With the sensitivity zzso zzso technique, it has been shown that the sensitivity of those elements can be used for spatial image zzso Here, a zzso is presented of a method that can be considered an extreme case of the zzso approach, completely zzso from using zzso zzso The resulting sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso data are then not used for imaging, but for determining zzso field zzso zzso The method has therefore been termed zzso zzso zzso In phantom experiments the zzso ability to detect zzso of up to the second order is zzso
