zzso resonance imaging zzso studies have demonstrated large-scale brain abnormalities in cigarette smokers, such as zzso enlargement and zzso zzso lines of evidence point to functional differences between smokers and nonsmokers in specific brain regions, namely the lateral prefrontal zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso we examined these regions for differences in gray matter between smokers and zzso 

zzso otherwise healthy adults (19 smokers and 17 zzso control subjects) underwent three-dimensional zzso zzso acquisition zzso of the zzso Both zzso regions of interest and the computer program zzso zzso were used to assess group differences in regional gray matter volumes and zzso zzso 

Smokers had smaller gray matter volumes and lower gray matter zzso than nonsmokers in the zzso zzso along with smaller volumes in the left zzso zzso and lower gray matter zzso in the right zzso Smokers also had negative associations between zzso smoking history and zzso gray matter zzso 

Smokers and nonsmokers differed in regional gray matter in brain areas previously linked with nicotine zzso These findings might reflect effects of chronic smoking, zzso traits that lead to smoking, or some combination of these zzso
