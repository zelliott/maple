We sought to compare the fetal zzso values head and abdominal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and left and right zzso zzso diameters obtained with zzso zzso and zzso zzso reconstructions in term zzso 

A total of 107 zzso women evaluated as having uncomplicated zzso and scheduled for induction at 42 completed weeks gave their informed consent and underwent zzso and zzso within 3 hours of each zzso Two zzso fast zzso zzso sequences were performed with 7- and zzso slice thicknesses and no zzso A single observer performed zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso A single zzso using a 3- to zzso zzso zzso performed zzso zzso zzso correlation and zzso analysis of differences were zzso 

zzso correlation was poor for both right zzso and left zzso zzso zzso zzso There were moderate zzso correlations for head zzso and abdominal zzso zzso and zzso diameter zzso zzso diameter had fair correlation zzso 

zzso between zzso zzso and zzso reconstructed MR images at late zzso ages shows acceptable correlation between the two techniques for head zzso abdominal zzso and zzso zzso
