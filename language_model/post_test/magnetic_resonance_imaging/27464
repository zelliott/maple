zzso zzso is a rare disease with a poor zzso Early diagnosis and early treatment greatly influence the survival prognosis of this zzso This retrospective study aimed to clarify the clinical features of patients diagnosed with zzso lymphoma, and the diagnostic significance of results from analysis of zzso samples including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso 

We reviewed 217 patients with zzso zzso diagnosed at 25 medical institutions in zzso Together with clinical zzso zzso analysis, determination of the levels of zzso and/or detection of zzso gene zzso were conducted using zzso fluid zzso The results were studied in conjunction with clinical findings of zzso zzso Survival zzso were estimated by use of the zzso zzso 

The subjects comprised 85 men and 132 women, with a mean age at first zzso examination of zzso zzso The mean observation period was zzso zzso During the observation period, 69 patients had onset of zzso in one eye and 148 had onset in both zzso zzso zzso with involvement of the central nervous system zzso was most common, found in zzso % of the patients, whereas zzso zzso without involvement of other zzso was found in zzso % of zzso With respect to onset patterns, zzso % of patients developed primary zzso zzso whereas zzso % developed primary zzso zzso preceding zzso zzso zzso vision and zzso were the most common zzso and zzso symptoms that prompted patients to seek medical zzso zzso zzso was the most common zzso zzso The detection rates of zzso zzso zzso ratio greater than zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso specimens were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, of patients zzso zzso ratio greater than zzso had the highest overall detection rate, and was extremely high zzso zzso in patients with or without zzso zzso The zzso survival rate was zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso biopsy had the highest detection rate for zzso zzso This supplementary diagnostic test should be performed frequently to confirm a diagnosis of zzso zzso
