zzso evidence suggests brain structure zzso may zzso overt cognitive impairment in zzso disease by several zzso Early detection of these zzso holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of preventive treatment zzso 

To compare magnetic resonance imaging zzso of white matter zzso water fraction zzso and gray matter volume zzso in healthy infant carriers and zzso of the zzso E zzso zzso zzso the major zzso gene for zzso zzso 

Quiet magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research imaging center on 162 healthy, typically developing zzso to zzso infants with no family history of zzso disease or other neurological or psychiatric zzso zzso zzso were compared in the zzso zzso carrier and zzso zzso White matter zzso was compared in one hundred zzso zzso to zzso sleeping infants zzso zzso carriers and 102 zzso Gray matter volume was compared in a subset of zzso 6- to zzso infants zzso zzso carriers and 36 zzso who remained asleep during the scanning zzso The carrier and zzso groups were matched for age, zzso zzso birth weight, sex ratio, maternal age, education, and socioeconomic zzso 

zzso zzso compared regional white matter zzso and zzso in the carrier and zzso groups and characterized their associations with zzso 

zzso zzso carriers had lower zzso and zzso zzso than zzso in zzso zzso cingulate, lateral zzso and zzso zzso regions, areas zzso affected by zzso and greater zzso and zzso zzso in extensive frontal regions and zzso were also significant in the subset of zzso to zzso infants zzso differences, zzso after correction for multiple zzso zzso differences, zzso zzso for multiple zzso zzso zzso carriers also exhibited an attenuated relationship between zzso and age in zzso white matter zzso 

While our findings should be considered zzso this study demonstrates some of the earliest brain changes associated with the genetic predisposition to zzso It raises new questions about the role of zzso in normal human brain development, the extent to which these processes are related to subsequent zzso pathology, and whether they could be targeted by zzso prevention zzso
