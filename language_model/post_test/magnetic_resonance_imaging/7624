zzso inflammatory zzso or zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory condition that occurs following an immune response in the central nervous system zzso In cases of spinal disc zzso multiple factors zzso to cause zzso changes in disc zzso To date, no studies have examined the potential relationship between disc zzso and zzso 

To investigate the relationship between cervical zzso and cervical disc zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to examine 85 patients with cervical zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso occurrence rates and zzso and zzso levels were compared between patients with cervical disc zzso and a control zzso The relationship between cervical zzso and cervical disc zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso and a receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging showed that zzso of patients with zzso exhibited disc zzso compared to only zzso of the control zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso levels in patients with zzso were significantly higher than those in the control zzso levels of these inflammatory zzso were even higher in zzso patients with cervical disc zzso than in those zzso 

Our results suggest that patients with cervical zzso have a higher zzso of cervical disc zzso indicating that cervical disc zzso is likely a possible risk factor in cervical zzso zzso Future quantitative studies are required to confirm this zzso
