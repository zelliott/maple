Prior studies report that accidents involving intoxicated drivers are more likely to occur during performance of secondary zzso We studied this phenomenon, using a zzso zzso involving performance of a visual oddball zzso task while driving in an alcohol challenge zzso Previous functional zzso zzso studies of the zzso task have shown zzso in the anterior cingulate, zzso and prefrontal zzso Thus, we predicted zzso decreases in zzso of these areas during zzso zzso 

Forty healthy social drinkers were administered 3 different doses of alcohol, individually tailored to their gender and zzso Participants performed a zzso task while operating a virtual reality driving simulator in a zzso zzso zzso 

Analysis showed a zzso linear decrease in Blood zzso Level zzso zzso during task performance, primarily in zzso anterior cingulate, and zzso prefrontal areas, with the least zzso occurring during the high zzso zzso analysis showed a zzso linear increase in reaction time, with no effects associated with either correct hits or false zzso In all dose conditions, driving speed decreased significantly after a zzso zzso However, at the high dose this decrease was significantly zzso zzso line crossings significantly increased at the high zzso 

These results suggest that driving impairment during secondary task performance may be associated with alcohol-related effects on the above brain regions, which are involved with zzso zzso Drivers with high blood alcohol zzso may be less able to orient or detect novel or sudden stimuli during zzso
