Advances in zzso technology and specialized graphic zzso allow clinicians to virtually interact with anatomical structures contained within sampled zzso zzso A hindrance to the effective use of this technology is the difficult problem of image zzso In this paper, we zzso a recently proposed zzso network called the locally zzso globally zzso zzso network zzso whose ability to achieve fast zzso with local zzso and zzso with global zzso makes it an effective zzso framework for grouping similar features and segregating dissimilar ones in an zzso We extract an zzso from zzso dynamics and propose an zzso scheme for zzso We show results of the zzso to two-dimensional zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso computerized topography zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso In addition, we compare our zzso with other zzso for zzso zzso as well as with manual zzso zzso zzso and architectural properties make it a promising approach for real-time zzso zzso
