To assess in zzso zzso colon wall magnetic resonance imaging zzso feasibility on rabbits using an zzso radio frequency zzso zzso on a zzso clinical zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso was compared to a clinical zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso of rabbit colon walls was performed on six zzso The imaging protocol combined zzso fast zzso zzso sequences with and without fat zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging with steady state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after contrast media zzso Images were compared to zzso zzso zzso tracking using an zzso zzso in addition to external coils was also evaluated on two zzso 

zzso images allow zzso and identification of rabbit colon wall zzso zzso tracking allows a clear zzso and a good positioning of the zzso zzso within the zzso 

Compared to a clinical zzso array zzso a dedicated zzso zzso zzso provides an important zzso increase at the region of interest zzso Very zzso images of in zzso rabbit colon walls were achieved providing detailed information on the different wall zzso This technique could be considered on humans for accurate zzso and inflammatory zzso disease zzso
