When applying zzso zzso models to dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso data it is important to appropriately deal with the enhancement onset time, because errors in the onset time will affect the zzso zzso zzso This paper presents a zzso approach to the zzso of the zzso parameters zzso and zzso that robustly treats the onset zzso This approach involves the zzso of an zzso intractable zzso so two approximate methods are zzso The first uses zzso zzso zzso which produces results accurate to a given zzso and the other a simple approximation with a zzso These approaches are compared with each other, and with the standard zzso zzso zzso The results of a zzso Carlo experiment show that the zzso approach produces biased estimates when zzso is large and zzso is small, whereas both the zzso methods are zzso The two zzso methods produce very similar estimates, but the simple zzso method requires less than half the zzso time of either the zzso or the zzso zzso The standard zzso of the zzso estimates is shown to be larger than either of the zzso estimates, while uncertainty estimates based around a zzso approximation are shown to be too small for all three zzso A more detailed method of assessing the uncertainty of the zzso approach is zzso and the results show that this is a more accurate description of the zzso zzso
