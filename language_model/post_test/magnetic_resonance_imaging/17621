To evaluate the relationship between zzso results and magnetic resonance imaging zzso on in and zzso sequences grading of fat deposition within human zzso 

In and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso echo time zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed in 25 patients, using a zzso clinical MR imaging zzso zzso ratio on zzso and zzso images of the liver was compared with zzso defined degree of zzso The signal intensity in the images was acquired with zzso regions of interest at the same location in both fat and water images and the ratio was calculated by dividing signal intensity of liver in opposed phased sequence on signal intensity of liver in phased zzso zzso ratio and the degree of zzso were compared using linear zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso for diagnosing zzso were defined by zzso zzso Furthermore, a correlation between visual signal intensity variation and the degree of zzso was assessed using zzso correlation zzso 

zzso demonstrated fatty liver zzso in zzso of zzso The percentage of fatty zzso was 28 zzso zzso zzso ratio was significantly correlated with the zzso grading of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The opposed phase MR imaging sensibility and specificity for the diagnosis of zzso zzso were respectively zzso and zzso We obtained a statistically significant correlation between visual zzso and fatty liver grading zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrated a significant correlation between zzso ratio and zzso findings for the detection and grading of fatty zzso
