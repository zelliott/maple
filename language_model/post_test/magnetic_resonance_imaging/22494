To evaluate zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in detection and characterization of focal liver zzso 

In 30 patients (including 20 with zzso with 39 zzso and 25 benign zzso zzso and zzso zzso images with two echo times (75 and 90 zzso zzso and zzso were obtained prior to and following administration of zzso and compared with zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two readers evaluated image quality and reviewed 240 liver segments for sensitivity and zzso zzso ratio zzso and its reduction in liver and zzso after administration of zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso were zzso 

Compared with zzso and zzso zzso reduced scan time by zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The image qualities with zzso and zzso were higher than with zzso and zzso zzso showed higher specificity than zzso and zzso but otherwise there were no significant differences between pulse sequences for sensitivity or zzso The mean zzso and zzso of the zzso with zzso were significantly higher than with the other zzso zzso signal reduction of liver zzso was smallest with zzso 

zzso is faster and more sensitive to zzso than zzso but its sensitivity and specificity were slightly inferior to those of zzso Image quality is a current zzso
