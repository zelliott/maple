The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso location and clinical outcome following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for advanced Parkinson's zzso zzso patients were zzso studied with extensive neurological examinations before and at 6 and 12 months following zzso zzso zzso location was characterized using zzso zzso The position of zzso within the zzso region of the zzso was measured, from zzso to zzso along an axis parallel to the internal zzso To relate zzso position to clinical outcome, zzso multiple zzso analysis was zzso The zzso in outcome measures that was related to zzso scores and zzso volume was first zzso and then the remaining zzso attributable to zzso location was zzso zzso location along the zzso axis within the zzso influenced the zzso in total score on the zzso Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso in the zzso zzso period, and in zzso period zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with greater improvement in zzso period zzso rigidity and zzso period zzso whereas more centrally located zzso correlated with better zzso scores of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Improvement in zzso zzso was zzso related to zzso location, being greater with zzso zzso We conclude that improvement in specific motor signs in Parkinson's disease following zzso is related to zzso position within the zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the known zzso but parallel organization of specific motor circuits in the zzso zzso and may explain the zzso in clinical outcome after zzso and therefore have important therapeutic zzso
