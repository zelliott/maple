zzso and zzso studies have demonstrated a role for the zzso in processing the perceived zzso of faces, but it remains uncertain whether its responses are linear (with the greatest response to the least zzso zzso or zzso (with increased zzso signal for the dimension zzso It is also unclear whether the zzso of the stimuli is crucial or if the same response pattern can be found for faces varying along other zzso In addition, the responses to perceived zzso of zzso regions other than the zzso are seldom zzso The present study addressed these issues using a novel set of stimuli created through computer zzso both to zzso the presence of naturally occurring cues that zzso zzso judgments and to allow systematic manipulation of these zzso With a zzso zzso zzso we investigated neural responses to zzso zzso in the zzso and core zzso regions in the zzso and zzso zzso We asked whether the zzso pattern is specific for differences in zzso or whether it would also track variation along an zzso zzso gender zzso The main findings were zzso responses to changes in both zzso and gender in all zzso These results are consistent with the idea that zzso brain regions are sensitive to face distinctiveness as well as the social meaning of the face zzso
