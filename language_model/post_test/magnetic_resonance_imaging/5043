Skull stripping methods are designed to eliminate the zzso tissue in magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a fundamental step in enabling the processing of brain MR zzso The aim of this study is to develop an automatic accurate skull stripping method based on zzso models and zzso zzso A zzso step is used to find the optimal starting point for the deformation and is based on thresholds and zzso zzso zzso are zzso using comparisons with an atlas, and modeling by zzso The zzso model is based on a zzso mesh and its deformation is controlled by the image local gray levels and the information obtained on the gray level modeling of the zzso Our zzso zzso and zzso Analysis Skull zzso zzso method was tested on the following international databases commonly used in scientific zzso zzso Internet Brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison was performed against three of the best skull stripping methods previously zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso Brain Surface zzso zzso and zzso Watershed Algorithm zzso Performance was measured using the zzso index zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our method showed the best performance and differences were statistically significant zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso
