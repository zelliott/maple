A simple technique is implemented for correction of artifacts arising from zzso zzso zzso of zzso data in fast spin zzso zzso zzso rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced zzso An additional blade with no zzso zzso is acquired to generate the zzso factor used for the zzso zzso from simulations and phantom experiments, as well as in zzso experiments in zzso mice, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed zzso This technique is developed specifically for zzso imaging applications where zzso zzso is zzso
