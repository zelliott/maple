Eleven obese young women with idiopathic zzso zzso were studied with zzso zzso zzso MR imaging to demonstrate increased water content in the brains of such zzso Heavily zzso studies were obtained for 10 patients, and balanced zzso zzso short zzso spin density, zzso zzso pulse sequences were obtained for four zzso We examined the studies of zzso normal zzso white matter and developed a white matter water index to determine if a slight increase in signal was present that could be ascribed to low levels of zzso zzso was made to an zzso control zzso We also examined five patients with sodium MR zzso Two of the 11 patients had focal areas of increased signal in their zzso white zzso Presumably, these are areas of increased zzso above the background that could not be detected on the CT zzso The white matter water index for the normal controls was an average of zzso zzso zzso while that of the zzso zzso group was zzso zzso zzso This indicates an increase in the white matter water zzso We believe this represents a diffuse low level of zzso These findings are consistent with previous estimates of the increase in brain water in patients with idiopathic zzso zzso The patients with zzso abnormal zzso studies demonstrated similar abnormalities on their sodium zzso
