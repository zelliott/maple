To examine structural abnormalities in zzso of the prefrontal zzso in elderly patients with depression, the authors explored differences in gray matter, white matter, and zzso volumes by applying a zzso method based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

zzso elderly patients with major depression and 19 zzso comparison subjects were studied with high-resolution zzso zzso surface zzso tissue zzso and cortical zzso methods were applied to obtain volume measures of gray matter, white matter, and zzso in seven prefrontal zzso the anterior cingulate, zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso superior frontal cortex, middle frontal cortex, and inferior frontal zzso 

zzso significant bilateral volume reductions in gray matter were observed in the anterior cingulate, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso patients also exhibited significant bilateral white matter volume reductions and significant zzso volume increases in the anterior zzso and the zzso zzso Finally, the depressed group showed significant zzso volume reductions in the zzso zzso relative to the comparison zzso None of the other regions examined revealed significant structural zzso 

The prominent bilateral gray matter deficits in the anterior zzso and the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso may reflect zzso modifications of elderly zzso The differential pattern of abnormalities detected in the white matter and zzso compartments imply that distinct zzso mechanisms might zzso the structural cortical changes in these zzso
