With the advance of stem cell transplantation research, in zzso cell tracking techniques have become increasingly important in recent zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso may provide a unique tool for zzso tracking of transplanted zzso Since the initial findings on the stem cell migration by zzso several years ago, there have been numerous studies using various animal models, notably in heart or brain disease zzso In order to develop more reliable and clinically zzso zzso multiple aspects should be taken into zzso In this review, we will zzso the current status and future perspectives of in zzso cell tracking technologies using zzso In particular, use of different MR contrast agents and their detection methods using zzso will be described in much zzso In addition, various cell labeling methods to increase the sensitivity of signals will be extensively zzso We will also review several key experiments, in which zzso techniques were zzso to detect the presence and/or migration of transplanted stem cells in various animal zzso Finally, we will discuss the current problems and future directions of cell tracking methods using zzso
