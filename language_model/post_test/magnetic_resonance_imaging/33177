The aim of this study was to perform a validation study assessing the correlation between magnetic resonance zzso findings of zzso joint zzso disk displacement and zzso and some parameters drawn from zzso zzso recordings of jaw motion, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-one patients with zzso disorders underwent a zzso recording in the same day in which the MR was zzso zzso analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the MR and zzso zzso 

MR findings were not correlated with zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of all zzso variables for diagnosing zzso signs was zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and positive zzso values were far from acceptable levels for all zzso zzso 

The findings do not support the usefulness of zzso devices in dental practices that diagnose and manage zzso zzso
