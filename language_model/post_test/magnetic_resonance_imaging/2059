The occurrence of high signal abnormalities on zzso weighted images is strongly age zzso The diagnostic value of these changes in a younger population with zzso is not currently zzso We studied the potential of high signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso in younger zzso 

High signal abnormalities were zzso using a previously validated scale, from hard copies of zzso weighted zzso images of 102 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ages zzso zzso 

High signal abnormalities were widespread across zzso zzso and zzso Although they were most frequent and most severe in the zzso group only zzso and grade III deep white matter zzso zzso were specific for these zzso 

High signal changes on zzso weighted images on zzso are common across degenerative zzso and zzso and vascular zzso Although zzso and grade III zzso are specific for zzso the low sensitivities zzso for zzso zzso for grade III zzso zzso limit their use as diagnostic markers for zzso High signal changes on zzso should be interpreted with caution in zzso Their presence, even in younger patients, should not deter one from diagnosing zzso or zzso
