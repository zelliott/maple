There is increasing recognition that magnetic resonance zzso imaging and zzso may provide important information in the assessment of patients with acute brain zzso However, optimum care of the acutely head injured patient requires monitoring of zzso pressure zzso Although many monitoring zzso have been integrated into commercially available zzso systems, there have been no reports of commonly used zzso zzso sensors in an MR zzso The authors describe the use of an zzso zzso probe in an MR environment, with a zzso connection that zzso the probe with a commercially available zzso monitoring zzso Phantom studies were performed to demonstrate the safety and zzso of the modified MR system at zzso zzso The safety of the device was assessed in relation to its interaction with the static, zzso and zzso fields used in MR zzso The MR zzso was documented by demonstrating that its performance was unaffected by the operation of imaging sequences and by showing that there was no degradation of the diagnostic quality of imaging data obtained during zzso zzso
