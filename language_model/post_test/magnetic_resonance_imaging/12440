Medical zzso before pulmonary zzso zzso can zzso right zzso zzso function and may improve zzso outcome in high-risk zzso Using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso we determined whether the dual zzso zzso zzso improves RV function and zzso in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary hypertension zzso who waited for zzso 

We hypothesized that medical therapy prior to zzso will be associated with improvements in RV zzso and zzso 

In this pilot study, 15 zzso zzso patients were randomly assigned to either zzso zzso zzso 8) or no zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso for 16 weeks, next to zzso standard of zzso Both before and after treatment, RV stroke volume index zzso RV ejection fraction zzso RV mass, RV zzso relaxation time zzso zzso zzso zzso bowing zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso were determined using zzso 

After 16 weeks, the change zzso from baseline zzso zzso in the studied zzso parameters differed significantly between the zzso group and the zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso vs 1 zzso zzso ; zzso zzso 8 zzso vs zzso zzso zzso RV zzso zzso zzso vs 2 zzso zzso ; zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso ; and zzso zzso 8 zzso vs zzso zzso (all P zzso zzso The change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure zzso zzso vs 5 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso walk distance (20 zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso also differed zzso 

In zzso compared with control, treatment with zzso for 16 weeks was associated with a significant improvement in zzso parameters of RV function and zzso
