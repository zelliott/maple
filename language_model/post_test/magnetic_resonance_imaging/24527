This study aimed to further investigate the effects of zzso on brain zzso in the rats with middle cerebral artery zzso zzso injury using magnetic resonance imaging zzso monitoring and zzso and zzso zzso 

Following surgical induction of zzso for zzso zzso was injected zzso after beginning of zzso and again once daily for the next 3 zzso zzso The events during zzso and zzso were investigated by zzso images zzso serial zzso images zzso calculated apparent diffusion zzso zzso maps and zzso zzso images zzso during zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were analyzed in a blinded and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Evans Blue zzso were performed at the corresponding zzso 

Increased zzso volumes derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all were noted at zzso and peaked at zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were not significantly different from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes at the last imaging time zzso point except for significantly smaller zzso zzso in the zzso model zzso zzso calculation based on zzso zzso also correlated significantly stronger to zzso calculation based on last imaging time point derived on zzso zzso or zzso than zzso zzso At the last imaging time point, a significant increase in Evans Blue zzso and a significant decrease in zzso cells numbers were noted in the zzso zzso injured zzso The zzso volumes derived from zzso zzso zzso and Evans blue zzso as well as the reduced numbers of zzso cells were all significantly attenuated in the zzso rats compared with the control zzso rats zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso has zzso effects against brain zzso on a zzso model after transient cerebral zzso
