To more precisely examine regional and zzso zzso brain changes associated with zzso zzso 

We obtained brain volumes from 29 zzso children, age 12 years, with no ultrasound scanning evidence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the newborn period, and 22 zzso and zzso term control zzso 

zzso male subjects demonstrated significantly lower white matter volumes in bilateral zzso corpus zzso zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, superior and inferior zzso zzso compared with term male zzso Gray matter volumes in prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso and zzso lobe also were significantly reduced in zzso male zzso Brain volumes of zzso female subjects were not significantly different from those of term female control zzso zzso zzso results were not correlated with zzso variables or cognitive zzso Higher maternal education was associated with higher cognitive performance in zzso male zzso 

zzso male children continue to demonstrate abnormal zzso at 12 years of zzso However, brain zzso in zzso female children may no longer differ from that of term female zzso The zzso abnormalities we detected in zzso male subjects appear to be relatively zzso involving multiple neural zzso The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso variables may be zzso by genetic factors, environmental factors, or both reflected in maternal education zzso
