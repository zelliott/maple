In the General Linear Model zzso framework for the statistical analysis of zzso data, the problem of zzso zzso in the residual signal (after zzso has been frequently addressed in the open zzso There exist various methods for correcting the ensuing bias in the statistical testing, among which the zzso strategy, which uses a zzso zzso for rendering the residual signal white zzso without zzso zzso This correction is only exact when the zzso structure of the zzso process is accurately known, and the estimates derived from the zzso data are too noisy to be used for zzso Recently, zzso and co-workers proposed to zzso smooth the noisy zzso estimates, effectively reducing their zzso and allowing for a better zzso In this article, a systematic study into the effect of the smoothing kernel zzso is performed and a method is introduced for choosing this bandwidth in an zzso zzso Several aspects of the zzso strategy are investigated, namely the choice of the zzso estimate zzso or zzso the accuracy of the estimates, the degree of spatial zzso and the order of the zzso model used for zzso the zzso The proposed method is extensively evaluated on both synthetic and real zzso zzso
