The extent of zzso brain zzso zzso associated with zzso is very zzso Many zzso factors have been investigated, but the mechanism of zzso associated with zzso has been unclear until zzso Recently, the zzso blood supply and vascular zzso growth factor zzso have been implicated as zzso factors of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were investigated to identify factors, including type of zzso blood supply and zzso zzso that may influence the development of zzso zzso The type of zzso blood supply was defined by the selective zzso zzso embedded tumor sections were stained with zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso The extent of zzso was estimated by using zzso magnetic resonance imaging as an zzso index zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated zzso and the other 27 did zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed close correlation between zzso and type of zzso supply zzso zzso zzso size of tumor zzso zzso zzso vascular density zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso In zzso with zzso supply, the zzso had increased significantly, just as zzso was strongly expressed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso without a zzso supply developed little or no zzso and less zzso zzso 

The current results suggest that zzso expression contributes to zzso formation in zzso only when a zzso blood supply zzso
