zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso is a sensitive procedure for detection of zzso zzso Although zzso in zzso consumption are not restricted to the area of seizure generation itself, the magnitude and extent of cerebral zzso disturbances induced by zzso zzso can be zzso Despite two decades of zzso research using zzso little is known about the zzso changes during therapy of focal zzso We report on a child with frontal zzso with severe zzso zzso that was nearly completely zzso during drug zzso 

zzso zzso was performed at the onset of zzso and after zzso drug therapy in a 5-year-old boy with behavioral abnormalities and repetitive zzso of frontal origin with zzso zzso zzso slowing for 8 zzso Both scans were zzso zzso initial and zzso zzso metabolism were zzso 

In accordance with the zzso focus as identified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was depicted by zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso was zzso After zzso therapy zzso zzso the boy became seizure free, and his initial behavioral deficits zzso A control PET study after 3 months of therapy showed restored zzso zzso the frontal zzso slowing was zzso 

This case demonstrates that reduction of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso may be a result of zzso zzso dysfunction that zzso with the zzso zzso
