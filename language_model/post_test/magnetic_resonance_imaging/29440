The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of zzso for zzso staging of zzso cell zzso using the 1997 zzso zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of zzso performed in 40 consecutive patients with 42 zzso cell zzso before radical zzso zzso zzso or partial zzso zzso 4) zzso or exploratory zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso between imaging and surgery ranged from 1 to 59 days zzso zzso zzso Imaging was performed with zzso and zzso dynamic zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso staging was performed using the 1997 zzso staging zzso zzso staging was compared with zzso staging as the gold zzso zzso between the two staging methods was assessed using the zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso staging was good for T staging zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 1 and 2 respectively), poor for N staging zzso zzso zzso both zzso good for M staging zzso zzso zzso both zzso and excellent for the assessment of zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso overestimated the T stage in five patients and the N stage in five and underestimated the T stage in three, the N stage in four, the M stage in one, and the extent of zzso zzso in two zzso 

zzso is a reliable method for zzso staging of zzso cell zzso using the 1997 zzso zzso in particular for assessing zzso zzso
