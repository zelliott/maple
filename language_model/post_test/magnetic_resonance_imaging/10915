Given the remarkable progress that has recently been obtained in animal studies, the clinical use of stem and zzso cells to correct or replace defective cell populations may soon become a zzso In order to develop effective cell therapies, the location and distribution of these cells must be determined in a zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso tracking of zzso labeled cells following transplantation or zzso may fulfill this zzso Indeed, a series of recent studies indicate that zzso cell tracking has great potential for further evaluation and zzso of cell zzso Due to its zzso and strong effects on zzso relaxation, iron oxide zzso appear to be the contrast agent of choice, and several methods now exist to shuttle sufficient amount of these compounds into zzso Most of the tracking work has been carried out in disease models of the central nervous system, but, recently, the zzso heart has also received zzso With its excellent spatial resolution and the ability to track labeled cells over prolonged periods of time, MR monitoring of cell therapy is likely to become an important technique in the foreseeable zzso
