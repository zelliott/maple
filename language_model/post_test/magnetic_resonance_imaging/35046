The aim of this study was to reveal the zzso changes in tumor zzso zzso zone, and zzso referred to as the zzso zzso appearing after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 20 zzso zzso zzso To enable prediction of these zzso changes, we provide mathematical expressions that describe the dynamics of the triple zzso Volumes of the three regions on zzso control zzso images were measured for a zzso zzso The delivered dose on the tumor surface was zzso zzso zzso planning and image fusion were performed with zzso Target zzso zzso mathematical and statistical zzso were carried out with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine the volumes, control images with the triple rings were fused with the planning zzso Relative volumes zzso with respect to the volume of reference dose were calculated and plotted in the time zzso First, the mean values of volumes were determined from the patients' measured zzso then, zzso were fitted to the mean values using the zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of our results was verified by zzso the predicted data with the measured zzso The zzso prediction approach proposed here reveals the dynamics of the triple zzso These zzso will assist with zzso designing the best treatment, zzso following the patient's condition, and zzso planning zzso if zzso
