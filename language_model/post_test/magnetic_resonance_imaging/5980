Recent experimental and limited clinical studies have demonstrated the usefulness of delayed enhancement zzso zzso zzso zzso for assessing zzso zzso size zzso and zzso The aim of this study is to compare zzso enhancement patterns immediately after coronary zzso zzso in an acute zzso zzso zzso setting with cardiac magnetic resonance zzso enhancement during the second week zzso 

26 patients admitted for an zzso were evaluated by zzso immediately after zzso without zzso zzso All but three were zzso The same patients had delayed enhancement zzso imaging at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement was considered zzso zzso when involving zzso of zzso zzso zzso (1 - zzso or zzso or normal zzso for the two zzso Two or more zzso enhanced segments were required to define zzso on zzso or culprit zzso zzso A zzso scale score was defined for the 17 left zzso zzso IS was zzso from these zzso 

On segment analysis, sensitivity, zzso zzso positive and negative zzso values of zzso for zzso assessment were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared to zzso On patient analysis, these respective values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso IS assessed by the two methods were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso line did not statistically differ from the identity zzso 

zzso enhancement immediately following zzso without zzso zzso for an zzso is a reliable method for evaluating zzso and zzso This very early evaluation could be an interesting alternative to zzso
