zzso brain injury is common in zzso with zzso of the great arteries zzso The objective of this study is to determine risk factors for zzso brain injury in zzso with zzso 

zzso term zzso with zzso were studied with zzso before cardiac surgery in a prospective cohort zzso Twelve patients zzso had brain injury on zzso zzso and all injuries were focal or zzso None of the patients had birth zzso zzso patients zzso required zzso balloon zzso zzso zzso All patients with brain injury had zzso (12 of zzso risk difference, zzso zzso confidence zzso 41 to zzso zzso As expected on the basis of the need for zzso these zzso had lower systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of injury was not modified by the zzso site for zzso zzso versus zzso zzso or by the presence of a central zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a major identifiable risk factor for zzso focal brain injury in zzso with zzso Imaging characteristics of identified brain injuries were consistent with zzso however, the mechanism is more complex than site of vascular access for zzso or exposure to central zzso zzso These findings have implications for the indications for zzso timing of surgical repair, and use of zzso in zzso
