To characterize patterns of cognitive functioning in a zzso group of patients with zzso zzso left zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sclerosis zzso and to examine zzso outcome in this zzso group following zzso zzso 

zzso functioning in patients with left zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with patients with isolated left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by high-quality zzso zzso Patients were administered a battery of neuropsychology tests as part of their zzso zzso for possible zzso zzso zzso zzso lobe zzso was performed on 10 of the zzso patients and 34 of the isolated zzso zzso zzso cognitive performance was also zzso
