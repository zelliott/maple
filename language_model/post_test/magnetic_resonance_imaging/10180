The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings among a group of patients who presented with zzso zzso zzso due to the neurological complications of a long-term hunger strike zzso 

zzso studies also including the zzso inversion recovery zzso sequence and zzso imaging zzso of six male patients with WE aged from 25 to 38 years zzso age 31 zzso were zzso 

In all subjects, zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a signal zzso within the zzso zzso and surrounding the third zzso In particular, on zzso images, the zzso areas around the third zzso showed a suggestive zzso zzso zzso We observed an increased signal on zzso and zzso images in the zzso bodies of three zzso Four patients demonstrated additional zzso within the zzso region and/or the zzso zzso At least one zzso area in five of six patients demonstrated contrast zzso 

The consistent imaging findings of our study suggest that zzso is a reliable means of diagnosing zzso Acute WE is sometimes zzso yet early diagnosis and treatment of WE is crucial in order to avoid persistent brain zzso zzso including zzso zzso imaging, zzso beneath standardized zzso imaging, and zzso sequences may prove to be a valuable adjunct to clinical diagnosis and to provide additional information in acute and/or zzso zzso
