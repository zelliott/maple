zzso type mild cognitive impairment zzso refers to a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to have a key role in a default network and be involved in the zzso of zzso few studies have investigated zzso functional connectivity of zzso during resting state, or investigated the relationship between abnormal functional connectivity and zzso in cognitive function in zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity analysis was used to examine the zzso correlation between zzso and zzso regions in 30 zzso patients and 26 zzso zzso Further analysis involved evaluation of possible relationships between functional connectivity measures and cognitive zzso zzso of decreased functional connectivity were identified in zzso patients, most notably in zzso cortex, whilst significantly increased functional connectivity was mainly in frontal zzso In addition, functional connectivity of zzso and zzso zzso was associated with the performance of zzso tests in zzso zzso This would be consonant with the recruitment of zzso mechanisms and the process of offset functional zzso appearing as zzso develops, and zzso connectivity zzso of zzso zzso may be a central role in cognitive deficit in zzso zzso
