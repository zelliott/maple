zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso zzso zzso is rapidly gaining clinical zzso Whether doubling of the field strength of zzso and the subsequent increase in zzso ratio zzso leads to a significant improvement of image quality is not automatically zzso 

To evaluate the depiction of fine zzso detail in the zzso zzso focusing on brain nerves, on zzso imaging, and to define the potential advantage of imaging at zzso versus zzso 

In total, 10 zzso nerve pairs of 12 volunteers were identified on zzso MR images of zzso and zzso section thickness acquired at zzso and zzso The MR images were compared for each subject at both field strengths by three independent readers who rated image quality according to depiction of zzso detail and contrast by using a rating zzso 

In general, MR images at zzso were considered more conspicuous and less noisy than images at zzso The zzso value measured was almost zzso With respect to structural identification and contrast according to the rating scale, observer scores were significantly improved both for standard imaging with zzso sections and high-resolution imaging with zzso sections at zzso zzso comparison revealed a significant increase for evaluated image quality criteria and the number of nerves zzso 

The comparison revealed a clear advantage in favor of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso in depicting the roots and course of brain nerves in the zzso zzso
