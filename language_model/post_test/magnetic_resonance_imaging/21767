To present the clinical, surgical and zzso manifestations of zzso intrinsic to the zzso zzso 

zzso study of zzso 

Three private zzso and one university zzso referral zzso 

Six patients with zzso nerve zzso zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging and/or high-resolution zzso zzso for subsequently zzso proven intrinsic zzso of the zzso zzso An additional six cases were identified in the zzso Most patients were female and ranged in age from 5 to 40 zzso 

Total tumor removal via middle zzso and zzso zzso followed by cable graft zzso zzso 

zzso can occur intrinsic to the zzso zzso and produces gradual zzso nerve zzso as its first zzso Other sites of zzso may occur zzso within the zzso bone or along zzso zzso zzso at sites of zzso zzso 

Hearing was maintained in each patient, and zzso zzso grade zzso facial nerve function was zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rarely zzso However, this entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of a slowly progressive zzso nerve zzso especially in young zzso zzso removal and cable graft zzso zzso is the treatment of zzso zzso follow-up should be maintained because of the potential for von zzso zzso
