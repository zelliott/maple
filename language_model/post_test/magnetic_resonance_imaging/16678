zzso in zzso zzso dominant Alzheimer's disease zzso carriers zzso provides an opportunity to detect changes that zzso symptoms or clinical zzso We used automated cortical thickness zzso measurement to compare the zzso matter of such a group with cognitively normal zzso 

9 zzso zzso carriers (4 zzso 5 zzso and 25 healthy, age and zzso controls underwent zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso measurement was performed across the whole brain using a zzso automated zzso Four regions of interest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two control regions zzso and zzso were selected on the basis of imaging data in existing Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso Linear mixed models were used to describe normal zzso in controls and the extent to which mean zzso in cases differed from controls according to time since clinical diagnosis, adjusting for normal zzso 

An accelerating decline in zzso was observed across all zzso in the zzso zzso No such decline was demonstrated in the control regions for the zzso zzso Relative to controls, and adjusting for normal zzso there was evidence zzso zzso zzso of lower zzso in the zzso zzso up to zzso years prior to diagnosis and in the zzso up to zzso years prior to diagnosis in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis is a relatively practical, rapid and effective technique for assessing subtle structural change in zzso There is evidence that cortical thickness is reduced in zzso carriers a number of years prior to clinical zzso
