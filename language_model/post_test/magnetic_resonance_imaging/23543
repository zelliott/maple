zzso and zzso reality environments have been adopted in medicine as a means to enhance the zzso view of the anatomy and facilitate the performance of minimally invasive zzso Their value is truly appreciated during interventions where the surgeon cannot directly zzso the targets to be treated, such as during cardiac procedures performed on the beating zzso These environments must accurately represent the real surgical field and require seamless integration of zzso and zzso imaging, surgical zzso and zzso technology in a common framework centered around the zzso This review begins with an overview of minimally invasive cardiac interventions, describes the architecture of a typical surgical guidance platform including imaging, zzso registration and zzso highlights both clinical and engineering accuracy limitations in cardiac image guidance, and discusses the translation of the work from the laboratory into the operating room together with typically encountered zzso
