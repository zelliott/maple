A zzso imbalance between zzso and zzso might occur zzso in zzso systemic lupus zzso zzso However, there are no published data on levels of zzso factors in the zzso fluid zzso of patients with zzso The present study was undertaken to assess zzso levels of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso in zzso patients with clinically verified zzso involvement and to compare these levels with those in zzso patients without zzso involvement and in healthy zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were assessed in zzso from 94 patients with zzso zzso who had zzso 56 who did not have zzso and 5 who were positive for zzso zzso zzso included in the zzso or zzso zzso and from 53 zzso zzso Patients were evaluated zzso with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, analyses of zzso degradation products in zzso and zzso zzso 

In the group of patients with zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated compared with levels in zzso patients without overt zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso and in healthy controls zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso levels of zzso did not differ zzso zzso levels of zzso correlated significantly with zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso levels were observed in zzso patients who had zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso 

zzso release of zzso is increased in patients with zzso This results in impaired zzso which might contribute to zzso and zzso damage in zzso
