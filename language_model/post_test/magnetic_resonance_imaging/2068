To evaluate the diagnostic advantages of high zzso resolution zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the breast in comparison to standard zzso 

zzso patients with 51 zzso zzso were selected zzso after undergoing bilateral standard zzso zzso zzso thickness 4 zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution 81 zzso Patients underwent high zzso resolution zzso zzso either zzso a two-dimensional zzso sequence zzso thickness 4 zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution 96 zzso or zzso a zzso sequence being used zzso thickness 4 zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution 115 zzso 

zzso revealed 33 zzso and 18 benign zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics were much better zzso with high zzso zzso Additional diagnostic information, however, resulted only in one patient with zzso due to a better zzso of smooth zzso 

High zzso resolution provides better zzso of zzso patterns in comparison to standard dynamic zzso However, a diagnostic advantage is only zzso
