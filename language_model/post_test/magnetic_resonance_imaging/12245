zzso resonance imaging zzso of small animals has emerged as a valuable tool to zzso monitor tumor growth in mouse models of zzso However, imaging of zzso in mouse models is difficult due to the need for high spatial zzso We have demonstrated zzso of zzso in the liver, brain, adrenal zzso and zzso zzso in different zzso mouse models of zzso zzso of mice was performed with a clinical zzso T magnetic resonance scanner and a commercially available zzso receiver zzso The imaging protocol consisted of zzso and zzso zzso spin echo sequences with a spatial resolution of 200 zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso 500 zzso Total acquisition time was 30 zzso per zzso The technique allowed for repetitive examinations of larger animal zzso to observe the development of zzso
