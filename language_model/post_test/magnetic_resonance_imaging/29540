zzso flow and electric currents through model porous media were zzso The transport rates through the individual pathways of the pore network are determined by the local zzso of the pore channels and by the driving zzso The model objects represent zzso two-dimensional random site zzso zzso The calculated design was realized by milling the structure in polystyrene zzso zzso maps of stationary flow and current density maps of stationary currents through the cluster were acquired by magnetic resonance imaging zzso The findings were compared to the results of zzso simulations based on the same zzso Since the difference in the transport patterns of the different driving mechanisms are expected to be more pronounced in smaller pore spaces, ultra deep X-ray zzso has been used for the fabrication of zzso model objects with a spatial resolution of better than 50 zzso and an aspect ratio as large as zzso First results obtained with these objects are zzso
