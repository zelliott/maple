Annual ultrasound screening may detect small, zzso breast zzso that are not seen on zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso may reveal additional breast zzso missed by both zzso and ultrasound zzso 

To determine supplemental cancer detection yield of ultrasound and zzso in women at elevated risk for breast zzso 

From April zzso 2006, zzso women at 21 sites with elevated cancer risk and dense breasts zzso to 3 annual independent screens with zzso and ultrasound in zzso zzso After 3 rounds of both zzso zzso of 703 women who chose to undergo an zzso had complete zzso The reference standard was defined as a combination of pathology zzso results that showed in zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the breast or zzso zzso zzso and 12-month zzso 

Cancer detection rate zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso of zzso performed and zzso cancer zzso 

A total of zzso women underwent zzso mammogram and ultrasound zzso 110 of whom had 111 breast cancer events: 33 detected by zzso only, 32 by ultrasound only, 26 by both, and 9 by zzso after zzso plus zzso 11 were not detected by any imaging zzso Among zzso zzso screens in the second and third years combined, 75 women were diagnosed with zzso Supplemental zzso ultrasound identified zzso zzso per 1000 screens zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso for zzso plus ultrasound was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso alone, sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso all zzso Of the zzso participants, 16 women zzso had breast cancer zzso The supplemental yield of zzso was zzso per 1000 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso plus ultrasound was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso The number of screens needed to detect 1 cancer was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso 234 zzso zzso zzso for supplemental zzso and 68 zzso zzso zzso for zzso after negative zzso and ultrasound zzso 

The addition of screening ultrasound or zzso to zzso in women at increased risk of breast cancer resulted in not only a higher cancer detection yield but also an increase in zzso zzso
