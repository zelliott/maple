zzso differentiation of primitive zzso tumors zzso from other tumors is important for zzso staging, zzso management, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging can provide in zzso assessment of the zzso in zzso mass zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso characteristics of adult cerebral zzso and to compare those values with low and high grade zzso 

Conventional MR images of 12 adult patients with zzso proved cerebral zzso were analyzed and provided a zzso zzso Relative cerebral blood volume zzso zzso and estimates of the vascular zzso transfer constant, zzso derived by a zzso modeling algorithm, were also zzso These results were compared with zzso and zzso values obtained in a group of low grade zzso zzso zzso 30) and a group of high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso by using a Student zzso zzso 

On conventional MR images, zzso were generally zzso zzso masses with solid and zzso zzso little or no surrounding zzso and occasional regions of zzso The zzso of cerebral zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso zzso A comparative group of patients with low grade zzso zzso zzso 30) had significantly lower zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso with a group of high grade zzso showed no statistical significance in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MR imaging shows areas of increased cerebral blood volume and vascular zzso in zzso These results may be helpful in the diagnosis and zzso differentiation between zzso and other zzso mass zzso (such as low grade zzso which have decreased zzso but may sometimes have a similar conventional MR imaging zzso
