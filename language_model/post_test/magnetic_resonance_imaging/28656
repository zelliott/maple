In this study, we performed a zzso zzso rapid acquisition zzso echo zzso zzso sequence with subsequent reconstruction of zzso slices with zzso zzso and zzso thickness in 26 patients with multiple sclerosis zzso to investigate the disease activity going on below the resolution of conventional zzso One hundred three enhancing zzso were detected using zzso zzso reconstructed with zzso zzso 93 using zzso zzso reconstructed with zzso slices and 82 using zzso zzso reconstructed with zzso zzso The detection rate using zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso higher compared with zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we detected five enhancing zzso in 2 of the 12 patients zzso who showed no enhancing zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and one enhancing zzso in 1 of the 10 patients zzso who showed no enhancing zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The increased sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso over the other two reconstruction slice thicknesses was due to improved detection of small zzso located mainly in zzso zzso These data indicate that the size of enhancing zzso in zzso is highly zzso and that a significant proportion of disease activity goes zzso when performing conventional zzso
