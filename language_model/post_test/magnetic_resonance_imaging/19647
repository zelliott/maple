To assess whole brain and central brain zzso as well as their differential relation to memory, cognitive performance, fatigue, depression and quality of life in patients with zzso multiple sclerosis zzso 

A zzso flow compensated zzso recalled zzso zzso was acquired in 45 zzso zzso An automated analysis tool was used to calculate brain zzso fraction zzso and zzso brain fraction zzso All patients were assessed with zzso tests focusing on memory and zzso scales for depression, fatigue and quality of zzso Age corrected partial correlations between brain zzso motor performance, psychological scales and test scores were zzso 

zzso correlated moderately zzso zzso or zzso r zzso zzso with duration of symptoms and disease, the Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso the upper zzso motor performance, and with mental aspects of quality of zzso zzso correlated moderately with zzso upper and lower zzso motor performance and memory zzso Neither zzso nor zzso correlated with fatigue and zzso zzso of several cognitive tests correlated moderately with depression and fatigue, the zzso zzso zzso zzso Test zzso showing the largest zzso 

Memory performance shows a correlation with relative zzso size in zzso patients, indicating the strategic location of the zzso system along the structures of the zzso system and its vulnerability in zzso The zzso and several other cognitive tests show moderate correlations with depression and fatigue, arguing for an zzso relation between the cognitive functioning and the emotional state of zzso However, this relation is independent of measurable brain zzso
