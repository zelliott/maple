zzso resonance imaging zzso of 18 knees of patients with arthritis was performed before and immediately after zzso zzso and zzso volumes were calculated by adding the outlined areas of zzso from a continuous series of zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference between zzso and zzso volumes of zzso joint fluid was zzso zzso median 2 zzso corresponding to zzso median zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane volumes, determined before and after zzso varied zzso zzso median 3 zzso zzso median zzso No significant systematic zzso of the borderline between joint fluid and zzso was zzso We conclude that zzso volumes and in all probability also zzso membrane volumes, can be determined by zzso with a zzso zzso error of approximately zzso The acceptable accuracy of the method encourages further studies of the value of zzso and zzso membrane volumes as markers of the activity and/or severity of joint zzso
