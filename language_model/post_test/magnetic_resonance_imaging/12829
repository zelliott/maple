The Social zzso zzso zzso zzso measures zzso traits that are continuously distributed in the general zzso Based on increased recognition of the zzso nature of zzso traits, the authors examined the neural zzso of these traits in zzso individuals using the zzso and established a novel approach to assessing the neural basis of zzso zzso attempting to directly relate zzso scores to patterns of functional connectivity observed in the zzso anterior zzso cortex, a region commonly implicated in social zzso 

zzso state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 25 zzso zzso All participants provided zzso ratings completed by an informant who had observed them in natural social zzso Whole zzso connectivity analyses were then conducted using zzso scores as a zzso of zzso 

Across participants, a significant negative relationship between zzso scores and the functional connectivity of the zzso anterior zzso zzso with the anterior portion of the zzso was zzso Specifically, low levels of zzso traits were observed when a substantial portion of the anterior zzso showed positive connectivity with the zzso anterior zzso zzso In contrast, elevated levels of zzso traits were associated with negative connectivity between these two zzso 

zzso state functional connectivity of the zzso anterior zzso zzso social network was related to zzso traits in zzso zzso Application of this approach in samples with zzso spectrum disorders is needed to confirm whether this circuit is zzso related to the severity of zzso traits in clinical zzso
