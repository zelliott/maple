zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of stroke in young especially after zzso We induced zzso in rat by topical application of zzso zzso over the exposed superior zzso zzso zzso and pathological changes were monitored on days 1, 2 and zzso zzso weight was estimated and zzso zzso was performed for comparison with zzso zzso zzso weighted signal changes were present in all the study group zzso zzso zzso intensity decreased over the zzso In study group, the apparent diffusion zzso zzso was decreased by zzso on day 1 compared to the zzso There was zzso increase in the zzso value on day 2 compared to day 1 which reached almost equal to control value on day zzso On zzso zzso zzso necrosis and cellular zzso were observed in cortical region after zzso The early decrease in zzso could be attributed to zzso zzso that precedes zzso zzso indicated by zzso of zzso and a decreased zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso induced zzso in the rat produces zzso zzso in early stage followed by zzso zzso which is related to zzso of the superior zzso zzso
