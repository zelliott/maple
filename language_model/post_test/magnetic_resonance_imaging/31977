To compare the patterns of gray matter loss in subjects with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso who progress to zzso disease zzso within a fixed clinical follow-up time vs those who remain zzso 

zzso subjects with zzso were identified from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's research program who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course zzso where the minimum required follow-up time from zzso to last follow-up assessment was 3 zzso These subjects were zzso and zzso to 42 zzso subjects who progressed to zzso within 18 months of the zzso zzso Each subject was then zzso and zzso to a control zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess patterns of gray matter zzso in the zzso and zzso groups compared to the control group, and compared to each zzso 

The zzso group showed bilateral loss affecting the zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso association zzso and frontal zzso compared to zzso The zzso group showed no regions of gray matter loss when compared to zzso When the zzso and zzso groups were compared directly, the zzso group showed greater loss in the zzso and inferior zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso cingulate, zzso anterior cingulate, and frontal zzso than the zzso zzso 

The regions of loss observed in subjects with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso who progressed to zzso disease zzso within 18 months of the zzso are typical of subjects with zzso The lack of gray matter loss in subjects with zzso who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course is consistent with the notion that patterns of zzso on zzso at baseline map well onto the subsequent clinical zzso
