zzso zzso zzso is a traditional Japanese word generation game, and is very familiar to native Japanese zzso The zzso task is expected to more strongly activate zzso zzso regions than conventional word generation to letters because of its characteristic way to make cue zzso 

The aim of this study was to examine the cortical zzso changes in basic brain rhythms during silently performing a zzso zzso 

Using synthetic zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso we estimated the zzso zzso of the statistically significant differences of the power in the alpha and beta frequency bands between the resting and the task zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso in the 8- to zzso band, thought to reflect neural zzso was localized within zzso cortical regions with zzso zzso The significant zzso were estimated in both the frontal and zzso zzso regions encompassing zzso and zzso areas, although previous zzso studies using word generation to letters showed neural zzso predominantly in frontal zzso 

Our results show the potential of SAM analysis for reliable brain mapping of language processing, and suggest that the zzso task might be more suitable for examining the zzso network in the brain than conventional word generation to zzso
