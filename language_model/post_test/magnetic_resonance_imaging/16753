We explored regional and total zzso zzso differences in zzso and their unaffected full siblings relative to typically developing zzso Participants included 94 zzso zzso patients diagnosed with childhood onset schizophrenia zzso 80 related zzso siblings zzso zzso and 110 zzso zzso typically developing participants scanned zzso The sample mean age was zzso range zzso to zzso We performed mixed model zzso to examine group differences in trajectory and zzso The zzso group had smaller bilateral anterior zzso and anterior and total zzso volumes than zzso The zzso group zzso from controls over time in total, left, right, and bilateral zzso inferior zzso zzso did not have any fixed zzso differences relative to controls but differed from controls in zzso zzso of total and right zzso left inferior zzso left superior zzso and superior zzso zzso are consistent with previous zzso findings and several reports of decreased zzso volume in adult onset zzso zzso zzso may represent a trait marker, although the effect size for zzso differences in early adulthood may be zzso
