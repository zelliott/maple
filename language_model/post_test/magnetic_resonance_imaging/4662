zzso human zzso was zzso zzso to rats with transplanted zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso rat zzso cells were transplanted into Fisher 344 rat brain zzso and 1000 units of zzso was zzso at a rate of 100 zzso via an internal carotid artery 1 or 3 weeks after the zzso The effects of zzso were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso Neurological symptoms, zzso zzso appeared after zzso zzso zzso days and all rats died of tumor overloading zzso zzso zzso days after the zzso Single injection of zzso on 7th day after the transplantation induced zzso of the tumor size in one of six zzso The tumors were detected 3 days after transplantation by zzso and they were revealed as zzso intensity mass in zzso zzso intensity in zzso and were enhanced by zzso zzso On zzso days after the zzso the tumor grew approximately zzso zzso in zzso The single 1000 units of zzso were zzso via an internal carotid zzso 3 days after the administration of zzso zzso of the tumor size was seen in one of six rats and decrease of zzso zzso was seen in zzso These effects of zzso were, however, transient and they were not demonstrated on day zzso Single injection of zzso was not effective for large tumors more than 10 zzso in diameter seen 14 days after the zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso should be zzso at an early stage of the tumor growth and several injections are needed to cause zzso in the size of the zzso
