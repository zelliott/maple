zzso evaluation of breast asymmetry surgical treatment should consider not only breast shape but also breast zzso 

For this study, 22 patients with primary breast asymmetry were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso as well as linear zzso preoperatively and 6 months zzso The mean difference between the zzso and zzso linear zzso was graduated from excellent to zzso Breast volume was estimated by zzso from zzso reconstruction for three-dimensional application using the zzso formula and specific zzso 

A strong correlation zzso zzso zzso was found between the zzso and zzso breast volumes, as increased or decreased by the surgical zzso Patients with less zzso volume differences tended to have the best ratings with linear zzso When the same surgical procedure was performed zzso or when only one breast was treated by surgery, greater volume symmetry was zzso 

Linear zzso and zzso are objective methods for evaluating zzso zzso and when used in association, can help plastic surgeons to achieve favorable results in zzso asymmetry zzso
