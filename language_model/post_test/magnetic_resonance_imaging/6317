Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso imaging was employed to study 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso and seven healthy elderly control zzso zzso sections were used to make zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso space, and brain zzso The zzso volume zzso relative to the size of the zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in the zzso group compared to the controls, with no overlap between the two zzso zzso measures of brain zzso and zzso and zzso enlargement also showed significantly different group means, although with overlap between the two zzso zzso zzso did not correlate with either overall brain zzso or zzso severity, although the degree of brain zzso was correlated with zzso zzso These results show that zzso is capable of providing in zzso zzso of diminished zzso size in zzso which is not correlated with overall brain zzso and which may differentiate zzso from normal zzso
