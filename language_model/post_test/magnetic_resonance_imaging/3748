To report the zzso outcomes of cochlear zzso in two patients with severe to profound zzso hearing loss secondary to superficial zzso of the zzso and discuss some programming peculiarities that were found in these zzso 

zzso zzso Data concerning clinical zzso diagnosis and zzso assessment zzso and zzso were collected of two patients with superficial zzso of the zzso 

Both patients showed good hearing thresholds but variable speech perception zzso One patient did not achieve zzso speech recognition, but the other achieved zzso speech recognition in zzso zzso compound action zzso could not be zzso in either zzso zzso parameters showed the need for increased zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso zzso 

The implants were fairly beneficial in restoring hearing and improving communication abilities although many zzso sessions have been zzso The hurdle in programming was the need of frequent adjustments due to the zzso variations in electrical zzso and neural zzso besides the changes in the zzso Patients diagnosed with superficial zzso may achieve limited results in speech perception scores due to both cochlear and zzso zzso zzso counseling about the results must be given to the patients and their families before the cochlear zzso zzso
