zzso zzso activity in the zzso waxes and wanes continuously across widespread spatial and zzso zzso In the human brain, these spontaneous fluctuations are salient in blood zzso zzso zzso signals and correlated within specific brain systems or zzso zzso In zzso recordings, both the zzso dynamics of fast zzso zzso zzso and the scalp zzso per zzso exhibit fluctuations in the same zzso zzso zzso frequency range where the zzso fluctuations are zzso While several lines of evidence show that the zzso fluctuations are correlated with zzso zzso it has remained unclear whether the zzso scalp potential fluctuations in zzso zzso zzso are related to the zzso zzso zzso We used concurrent zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso recordings to address the relationship of zzso fluctuations zzso in scalp zzso and zzso zzso We show here that independent components of zzso recordings are selectively correlated with zzso of cortical zzso signals in specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This brain zzso association indicates that zzso scalp zzso are directly associated with the zzso fluctuations in zzso activity zzso zzso thus yields a zzso zzso resolution window into the dynamics of intrinsic connectivity zzso These results support the view that the slow zzso reflect changes in cortical zzso and shed light on zzso zzso underlying both zzso and behavioral zzso
