To compare two MR sequences at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso sections to determine which image type enables the most accurate assessment of cervical zzso 

Forty consecutive patients zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso cervical zzso were zzso Each MR sequence was assessed for zzso zzso zzso margins, and cancer extent with the consensus of two readers, and zzso margins were rated on a zzso zzso MR findings were correlated with zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso obtained with each image were compared using zzso zzso 

Thirty-one of 40 patients underwent zzso and nine of 40 underwent zzso In 36 patients, zzso were identified on at least one zzso The zzso at stage zzso or higher were detected in zzso on zzso zzso images and in zzso on zzso images zzso zzso margins appeared significantly more distinct on zzso zzso images than on zzso images zzso The zzso obtained using zzso zzso images were significantly higher zzso than those obtained using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging is more useful for assessing cervical zzso than zzso zzso
