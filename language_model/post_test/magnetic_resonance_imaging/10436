The developing brain is traditionally viewed to possess a great zzso zzso Here we ask whether visual processing of zzso displays depicting human walking is compromised in adolescents who were born premature (between 27 and 33 gestation weeks) and suffer early bilateral damage to zzso brain zzso Combining zzso with zzso analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso we found that even relatively small zzso zzso zzso may result in long-lasting breakdown of visual processing of zzso zzso Analysis of receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso revealed higher zzso of the patients' zzso system to camouflage of a zzso zzso The lack of difference in sensitivity between former zzso with normal zzso scan and zzso controls indicates that zzso deficiencies in patients with zzso zzso zzso are not simply due to premature zzso Most importantly, sensitivity in patients even with mild zzso was lower than in both control zzso Display 180 degrees inversion in the image plane, which is known to impair processing of zzso displays, resulted in a substantial reduction of sensitivity so that it no longer differed between the zzso Despite the social and ecological significance of human zzso the capacity of the brain to detect biological motion is substantially modulated by zzso zzso even if they occur very early in zzso The findings point to specific restrictions on the zzso spontaneous zzso plasticity in zzso zzso
