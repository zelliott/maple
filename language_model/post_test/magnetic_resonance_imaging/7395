In this study, we investigated the clinical usefulness of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso groups in patients with locally advanced zzso treated zzso 

Patients who had undergone local treatment for locally advanced zzso between 2001 and 2006 were zzso Response to treatment was defined as a reduction in zzso or zzso by more than 50% from baseline levels at 1 month after the treatment zzso Patients were divided according to their zzso and zzso response: zzso zzso response zzso and zzso response zzso zzso zzso response zzso and zzso response zzso zzso zzso response zzso and zzso response zzso zzso zzso response zzso and zzso response zzso Clinical characteristics and prognosis were compared between zzso 

Patients were subdivided into four groups by the change in the level of the zzso zzso and zzso and the survival outcomes of each group were zzso Among patients with an zzso response, further subdivision by zzso response revealed that those in the zzso group had a longer median zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso compared with those in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso months, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso months, P zzso zzso Combination of zzso and zzso response showed a zzso power for zzso and zzso comparable to zzso criteria and better than zzso response zzso 

In patients with locally advanced zzso the use of a combination of two zzso zzso and zzso appears useful in predicting treatment outcomes through the subdivision of zzso zzso
