To evaluate the zzso of data derived from magnetic source imaging zzso regarding cerebral dominance for language in patients with intractable seizure zzso 

The authors performed functional imaging of the receptive language zzso using a zzso zzso in 26 consecutive zzso patients who also underwent the zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso recordings, patients engaged in a word recognition zzso This task was shown previously to activate language areas in normal adults as well as in patients who undergo zzso language zzso allowing confirmation of zzso zzso Language zzso zzso were formed for both the Wada and the zzso zzso In addition, clinical judgments regarding cerebral dominance for language were made using the two methods by independent zzso 

zzso analysis indicated excellent agreement between the quantitative zzso and Wada zzso zzso judgments showed almost complete agreement as zzso 

zzso is a promising method for determining cerebral dominance for zzso
