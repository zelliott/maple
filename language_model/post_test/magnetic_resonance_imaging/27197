We investigated 17 patients with sporadic zzso lateral sclerosis zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of diffusion zzso images zzso at baseline and after a six-month zzso Compared with 17 healthy controls, ALS patients at baseline showed only minimal white matter volume decreases in the inferior frontal zzso but marked decreases in the gray matter of several regions, especially in the bilateral zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed reduced fractional zzso in the bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortex, and zzso zzso Increased mean zzso was noted zzso in the motor cortex, zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso At the six-month zzso ALS patients showed widespread volume decreases in gray matter, and zzso abnormalities extended mainly into the bilateral frontal zzso while volume changes in the white matter remained minimal but more zzso Our combined zzso and zzso techniques revealed zzso tract zzso zzso mainly in the zzso lobe of ALS zzso In particular, follow-up examinations in these patients showed that zzso zzso changes occurred predominantly in the regions of brain zzso These objective analyses can be used to assess the disease condition of the ALS zzso
