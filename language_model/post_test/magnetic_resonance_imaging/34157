To evaluate the accuracy of zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso resolution, zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso assessment of the depth of zzso tumor zzso which is a major zzso indicator in zzso zzso 

In a prospective study of 28 consecutive patients, zzso MR imaging was zzso The tumor stage according to the zzso zzso system and the measured depth of zzso tumor invasion in matched MR images and zzso slices were zzso 

zzso MR imaging correctly indicated the zzso tumor stage in all 25 patients in whom comparisons were zzso The difference between the depth of zzso tumor measured on zzso MR images and corresponding zzso on zzso slices of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso difference, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating good zzso The zzso zzso and the relation of the tumor to it, could be zzso in every zzso In all five patients with involvement of the zzso zzso margins of zzso zzso extensive zzso invasion was identified on zzso MR zzso 

zzso zzso MR imaging accurately indicates the tumor stage of zzso cancer and depth of zzso tumor zzso It provides valuable information for identifying zzso tumors for zzso zzso therapy in patients who are at high risk of failure of complete zzso
