Patients presenting with zzso pain syndromes are zzso Up to zzso of these conditions may be attributed to zzso zzso Included in several therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, injections directly into the zzso muscle may be zzso Because the muscle lies very close to zzso structures, zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso guidance have been zzso In few studies, an zzso technique was used to inject a local zzso into the zzso muscle without zzso adjacent zzso zzso 

zzso study in healthy human zzso Confirmation of zzso injections by zzso 

In 10 male human subjects, zzso injections of zzso of a local zzso into the zzso muscle were zzso 

Directly after the injection, the subjects were placed in an zzso zzso and the placement of the liquid depot was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso deficits were evaluated after the zzso 

The zzso showed that 9 of 10 of the injections were correctly placed within the zzso zzso The distance of the depot to the zzso nerve decreased over time due to zzso but the nerve itself was not reached in the zzso Only one subject experienced slight, short-term zzso zzso 

zzso confirmed the correct placement of the local zzso within the zzso The zzso of the fluid 30 minutes after the injection could be zzso Moreover, only one subject experienced slight motor deficits without anatomical zzso This zzso method will be further employed in ongoing clinical zzso
