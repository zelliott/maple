A new technique was designed and implemented that increases imaging speed in dynamic imaging in which change is restricted to a fraction of the full field of view zzso The technique is an enhancement of a reduced zzso method first reported by Hu and zzso This enhancement extends the use of the Hu and Parrish method to cases in which there is zzso motion throughout the entire zzso that normally would be zzso into the reduced zzso This method requires the initial acquisition of a number of baseline zzso data sets to characterize the background zzso motion during zzso zzso zzso echoes along both the zzso and the zzso directions are acquired and used to correct for motion outside the reduced zzso Automatic placement or repositioning of the updated fraction of the zzso using zzso also is zzso With this method, when using a zzso rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement zzso zzso zzso updates of zzso 128 zzso 128 zzso images are zzso yielding a fourfold increase in zzso resolution compared to full zzso update zzso
