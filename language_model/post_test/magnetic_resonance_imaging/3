Modular structure is ubiquitous among real-world networks from related proteins to social zzso Here we analyze the modular organization of brain networks at a large scale zzso zzso extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso By using a zzso method, we unveil the zzso of brain zzso and show zzso with a spatial distribution that matches anatomical structures with functional zzso The functional role of each zzso in the network is studied by analyzing its patterns of zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggest that the modular architecture constitutes the structural basis for the coexistence of functional integration of distant and specialized brain areas during normal brain activities at zzso
