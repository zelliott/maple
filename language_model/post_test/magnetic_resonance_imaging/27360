Although individuals vulnerable to psychosis show brain zzso zzso structural zzso underlying different probabilities for later transition are zzso The present study addresses this issue by means of zzso zzso zzso 

We investigated zzso matter volume zzso abnormalities by comparing four zzso groups: individuals with first episode of psychosis zzso and with zzso mental state zzso with either long-term zzso or short-term zzso zzso compared to the healthy control zzso zzso Using three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso we examined 16 zzso 31 zzso clinically followed up for on average 3 months zzso zzso and zzso years zzso zzso and 19 zzso 

The zzso group showed less zzso in the right and left zzso compared to the zzso zzso d zzso and zzso groups zzso d zzso zzso These zzso differences were correlated positively with global functioning in the whole zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with negative zzso in the whole zzso group, and also with hallucinations in the zzso and zzso zzso We found a significant effect of previous antipsychotic medication use on zzso abnormalities in the zzso zzso 

zzso abnormalities in subjects at high clinical risk for psychosis are associated with negative and positive psychotic symptoms, and global zzso zzso in the right zzso are associated with a higher risk for transition to zzso and thus may be related to different transition zzso
