To compare the results of different methods for zzso assessment after zzso repair by magnetic resonance imaging and to evaluate their zzso The zzso results are contrasted to functional parameters of CW zzso zzso pressure zzso and flow zzso in zzso 

54 patients zzso 6 to 36 zzso were assessed by zzso 3 to 31 years after zzso zzso The zzso diameters were compared to zzso normal values and to the diameter of the ascending zzso and descending zzso zzso and their mean values zzso 

Patients after zzso repair had mostly zzso diameters of AA zzso value: zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Compared to the control group, mean zzso of zzso diameters was significantly larger in the patient group zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Degree of zzso varied with the zzso It was similar when using normal values and the diameter for zzso but zzso was smaller when normal values were zzso zzso of the functional zzso to the degree of zzso was zzso The highest correlation zzso zzso zzso was reached when using normal values as the reference with mean zzso zzso from zzso 

The use of normal values as the reference for zzso of residual zzso is more reliable than common zzso Since only one measurement is needed, it seems to be less susceptible to errors and more zzso zzso offers not only a tool for accurate zzso assessment, but with zzso it is also possible to obtain a functional zzso which is superior to zzso pressure zzso and CW zzso
