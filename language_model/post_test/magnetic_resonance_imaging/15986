To determine the zzso basis of verbal memory dysfunction in women with zzso breast zzso This objective was based on previous research suggesting memory and other cognitive deficits in this zzso We attempted to determine if verbal memory zzso were related to the most commonly studied disease parameters including zzso chemotherapy and chronic stress-related disruption of zzso system zzso 

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test our hypothesis that women with breast cancer would show significantly lower brain zzso during verbal zzso memory tasks compared with age and zzso healthy female zzso We also assessed several stress-related variables including zzso cortisol levels to test our hypothesis that women with breast cancer would show higher stress and this would contribute to brain zzso deficits during memory zzso 

Women with breast cancer had significantly lower prefrontal zzso zzso during the memory zzso condition compared with zzso However, the breast cancer group showed significantly greater zzso than controls during the recall condition in zzso diffuse brain zzso There were no significant differences between the groups in stress-related zzso Women who were treated with zzso methotrexate, and zzso chemotherapy showed lower prefrontal zzso zzso during memory zzso 

These results suggest that women with zzso breast cancer may be at risk for verbal memory zzso as a result of altered functional brain zzso zzso These findings may be associated with chemotherapy type and/or other aspects of the breast cancer disease zzso
