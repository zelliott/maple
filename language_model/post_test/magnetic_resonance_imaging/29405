zzso impairment and zzso abnormalities are considered hallmark features of zzso type I zzso Numerous studies have demonstrated zzso deficits in children with zzso but few relations between these deficits and zzso abnormalities have been zzso We compared the functional zzso of cerebral regions involved in the spatial transformation of zzso stimuli in individuals with zzso and healthy control participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Given the prevalence of visual zzso abnormalities and zzso deficits in zzso we hypothesized that less zzso zzso activity would be found in zzso and zzso zzso in this group compared with zzso However, zzso participants relied to a greater degree than controls on zzso zzso (including zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso relative to lateral and inferior frontal regions during zzso zzso This pattern was significantly related to their behavioral performance on the zzso task, which in turn was also positively correlated with reading zzso These findings support evidence of frontal cortical anomalies in zzso and may provide a zzso basis for cognitive deficits in zzso
