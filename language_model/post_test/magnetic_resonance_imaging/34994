As a reflection of poor insight, people with schizophrenia often disagree with zzso and clinicians about whether zzso their experiences are zzso zzso they are mentally ill, and zzso they need zzso 

This study used zzso zzso to identify the associations between total and regional zzso matter volumes and zzso and zzso insight in 52 patients with schizophrenia or zzso zzso Thirty healthy participants were also zzso 

There were positive associations in patients between zzso the ability to zzso experiences as abnormal and the total and right superior zzso zzso zzso matter volumes, zzso awareness of problems zzso zzso and the left zzso zzso matter volume and zzso awareness of symptoms and zzso them to illness and zzso matter volumes in the left zzso zzso zzso and the right inferior zzso and lateral zzso zzso The zzso of the need for zzso dimension did not correlate with total or any regional zzso matter zzso Relative to controls, patients had less total and regional zzso matter volumes in the zzso and middle zzso and superior zzso zzso 

Lower zzso matter volumes in the zzso and zzso regions that have been implicated in zzso working memory and access to internal mental states are associated with poor insight on certain dimensions in zzso
