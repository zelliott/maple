Eleven hips in nine patients with zzso disease were studied by plain zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso intervals over a period of 2 zzso The aim was to clarify the value of zzso in zzso zzso involvement and in predicting zzso of the zzso Signal zzso of the zzso and zzso were visually evaluated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The extent of decreased signal intensity zzso in the zzso was zzso calculated from zzso images and then compared with follow-up zzso The area of zzso zzso corresponding best with zzso zzso was seen by zzso zzso months after the first zzso zzso images obtained earlier usually showed less involvement than the follow-up zzso However, two features predicting extensive zzso necrosis were: zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso images covering over two-thirds of the zzso and zzso diffuse bone zzso zzso of the zzso neck and zzso When zzso images showed a reappearance of high signal intensity patches in the lateral quarter of the zzso no clinically significant zzso was seen during the zzso zzso zzso necrosis can, therefore, sometimes be predicted by zzso even within the first 3 months, but zzso zzso zzso involvement more clearly zzso months after the first zzso
