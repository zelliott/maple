In 15 zzso and six Ewing zzso response to zzso chemotherapy was assessed with magnetic resonance zzso imaging without and with zzso zzso acid zzso enhancement and with dynamic zzso studies, and the results were compared with the zzso zzso All studies were obtained prior to and following zzso zzso zzso MR imaging was of little value for assessment of zzso reduction in signal intensity within zzso masses on the zzso zzso images indicated response with a sufficient degree of accuracy zzso but low sensitivity, whereas an increase in signal intensity after zzso administration indicated zones of viable tissue with low zzso With zzso skeletal zzso the findings in the zzso and zzso zzso were of no value, whereas the findings in the zzso phase allowed the prediction of response with an accuracy of zzso Of all techniques zzso dynamic MR imaging had the highest degree of accuracy zzso and was superior to zzso particularly in patients who were receiving zzso zzso
