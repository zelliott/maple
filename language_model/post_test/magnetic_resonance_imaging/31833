To investigate the association between magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso metabolically abnormal tumor regions and subsequent sites of zzso in data from patients treated with zzso zzso in a prospective clinical zzso 

zzso examinations were performed zzso for 9 patients with newly diagnosed zzso zzso studied in a Phase I trial combining zzso and zzso The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso before treatment and every 2 months until zzso The zzso data were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso as a measure of zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso were evaluated before zzso and at zzso 

Before treatment, areas of zzso zzso zzso or zzso represented zzso of the zzso zzso regions and zzso of abnormal zzso regions outside zzso zzso The presence of zzso was often an early indicator of the site of zzso after zzso In fact, zzso of the zzso within the zzso before therapy continued to exhibit zzso at zzso compared with zzso of the zzso within the zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso The location of new contrast enhancement with zzso corresponded in zzso of the initial zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso active regions represented a small percentage of zzso zzso abnormalities and were zzso for the site of zzso zzso The incorporation of zzso data in the definition of zzso target volumes for selective boosting may be a promising avenue leading to increased local control of zzso
