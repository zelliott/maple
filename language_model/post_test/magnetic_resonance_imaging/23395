This study aimed to examine the association between time to tumor zzso zzso potential and tumor zzso zzso samples were taken from 20 patients with zzso zzso and examined for their zzso potential using an in zzso rat zzso model of zzso Patients were evaluated for tumor contrast enhancement prior to surgical zzso using zzso and they were followed for tumor zzso Patients who had tumors without contrast enhancement had longer zzso survival zzso time to tumor zzso 72 zzso compared to those who had tumors with contrast enhancement zzso 42 zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso results, a high zzso potential was associated with a significantly shorter zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso contrast enhancement and a high zzso potential based on an in zzso zzso zzso zzso were related to a shorter zzso zzso This might have important zzso implications in patients with zzso zzso
