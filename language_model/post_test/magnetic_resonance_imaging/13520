zzso compliance was measured in 70 healthy volunteers, 13 athletes, and 17 patients with coronary artery zzso zzso resonance images were acquired at end zzso and end zzso through the ascending zzso the zzso arch, and the descending zzso zzso Regional compliance was derived from the change in zzso area in a slice of known thickness and from the pulse zzso Total zzso compliance was also measured from the left zzso stroke volume and the pulse zzso In the volunteers, mean zzso regional compliance zzso zzso was greatest in the ascending zzso zzso zzso lower in the arch zzso zzso and lowest in the descending zzso (18 zzso and it decreased with zzso Compliance in the athletes was significantly higher than in their age matched controls (41 zzso versus 22 (11) zzso zzso In the patients with coronary artery disease it was significantly lower (12 zzso v 18 zzso than in age matched zzso Total zzso compliance also fell with age in those with coronary artery disease although there was more zzso The results suggest a possible role for compliance in the assessment of cardiovascular fitness and the detection of coronary artery zzso
