The increasing availability of zzso models of human cardiovascular disease has led to a need to translate zzso imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso from the clinic to the animal zzso The aim of this study was to develop zzso simulating the zzso view of left zzso motion of rats and mice, thus reducing the need for live animals in the development of zzso zzso zzso were zzso from zzso alcohol zzso zzso and attached via stiff zzso tubing to a gear zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso by suitable programming of the zzso zzso zzso scanning was carried out at 7 T and compared with in zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso performance was achieved with zzso for which the zzso material had been subjected to two zzso cycles, resulting in zzso and zzso relaxation time zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the rat phantom operating at 240 beats per zzso zzso the dynamic range of the outer diameter was from zzso to zzso zzso with the wall thickness varying between zzso and zzso zzso zzso figures for the mouse phantom at zzso zzso were outer diameter range from zzso to zzso zzso and wall thickness from zzso to zzso zzso Dynamic cardiac zzso simulating zzso left zzso motion in the zzso view were successfully developed and compared with in zzso zzso The zzso can be used for future development work with reduced need of live zzso
