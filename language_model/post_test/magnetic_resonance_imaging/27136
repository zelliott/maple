Dynamic zzso zzso requires an zzso input function zzso to obtain cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit zzso The current zzso selection criteria discriminate zzso zzso and zzso profiles based on shape and timing characteristics of the first zzso Unfortunately, partial volume effects can lead to shape errors in the zzso passage, including a zzso and higher peak, which might be selected as a zzso zzso In this study, a new criterion is proposed that detects shape errors based on zzso kinetic principles for computing cerebral blood zzso This criterion uses the ratio of the zzso value to the zzso of the first passage, which should result in an equal value for tissue and zzso zzso By using a reference value from zzso partial volume zzso shape errors of the zzso measurement can be zzso Different factors affecting the ratio were investigated using zzso These showed that the new criterion should only be used in studies with zzso zzso zzso In zzso data were used to evaluate the proposed zzso The data showed that the new criterion enables detection of shape zzso although false zzso do occur, which could be easily avoided when combined with current zzso selection zzso
