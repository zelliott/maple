To evaluate zzso MR imaging findings of zzso zzso zzso in correlation with the zzso tumor grades and the tumor zzso evaluated by CT zzso zzso zzso and CT during zzso zzso zzso zzso 

By searching the zzso zzso and zzso reports of our institution between January 1999 and February 2001, we identified 43 patients with 51 zzso confirmed zzso who underwent zzso MR imaging and combination zzso and zzso within two zzso The zzso consisted of 17 zzso 28 moderately zzso and six poorly differentiated zzso The MR and CT were zzso reviewed by two zzso in consensus for signal intensity on MR images and zzso on zzso The zzso rank correlation zzso was calculated to correlate the frequency of tumors with zzso zzso with the zzso tumor grades and the tumor zzso on zzso and zzso 

A total of 45 tumors zzso did not take up zzso and thus showed zzso homogeneous zzso Six tumors zzso ranging zzso zzso in size zzso 11 zzso took up zzso and thus showed zzso mixed intensity, or zzso including five of 17 zzso zzso tumors and one of 28 zzso moderately differentiated zzso Five of the six tumors zzso showed zzso or zzso on zzso or zzso on zzso The frequency of tumors with zzso zzso showed weak correlation with tumor grades zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Although a small number of zzso zzso take up zzso and show zzso mixed, or zzso most such tumors show increased zzso zzso or decreased portal zzso zzso The present results suggest the limitation of zzso contrast imaging, particularly in the diagnosis of small, zzso zzso
