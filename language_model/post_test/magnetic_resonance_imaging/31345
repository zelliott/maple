According to indicator dilution theory tissue zzso zzso have to be zzso with zzso input zzso in order to get valid zzso zzso Our aim was to adapt and validate a zzso method originating from magnetic resonance techniques and apply it to the calculation of dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso The application of a zzso zzso approach for singular value decomposition renders the analysis independent of zzso arrival time to improve the zzso
