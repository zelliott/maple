zzso zzso flow dynamics and zzso collateral pathways can be seen in patients with zzso internal carotid artery zzso zzso or zzso Here we seek to evaluate whether zzso zzso is associated with an increased prevalence of zzso zzso aneurysm relative to carotid zzso zzso 

We combined our experience of three cases with 148 previous publications to form a retrospective series including 132 cases of zzso zzso 33 cases of zzso zzso and 34 cases of carotid zzso zzso 

After excluding cases lacking zzso zzso zzso was more commonly associated with aneurysm zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso A significantly greater overall aneurysm prevalence was seen among zzso zzso patients age 30 years or older zzso zzso than in younger individuals zzso zzso 

zzso zzso aneurysm is more strongly associated with zzso zzso than zzso zzso An increased aneurysm prevalence among older individuals with zzso zzso suggests an acquired zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso is recommended in the initial evaluation of zzso zzso to evaluate for zzso zzso aneurysm, particularly after the third decade of zzso
