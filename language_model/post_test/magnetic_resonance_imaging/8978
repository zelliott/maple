To investigate the outcomes of magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso using zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso in patients with acute middle cerebral artery zzso zzso in 3-6 zzso 

zzso patients zzso with acute zzso stroke in zzso divided into two groups zzso h and 3-6 zzso were treated with intravenous zzso MR was performed before zzso at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after zzso zzso was assessed 24 h after zzso and clinical status was evaluated before zzso treatment, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after zzso by the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso scale zzso was used to assess clinical outcome at 30 and 90 days after zzso 

There was no significant between zzso h and 3-6 h group in length of hospital stay, zzso zzso and favorable outcome at 90 zzso zzso within 24 hours occurred in 9 zzso and zzso in 6 zzso One patient in zzso group and three in zzso group had an zzso zzso zzso zzso within 24 h after zzso zzso zzso with zzso was associated with a better outcome regardless of the time point of zzso zzso zzso with zzso group, zzso was also associated with a lower zzso score at 14 days zzso a lower zzso grade at 7 days zzso and a shorter length of hospital stay zzso 

Our study suggested that zzso zzso using zzso was safe and reliable in patients with acute zzso zzso in 3-6 zzso
