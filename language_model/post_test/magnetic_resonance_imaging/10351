The zzso zzso zzso has two zzso units for selective zzso coordination and one zzso function for selective zzso zzso In zzso solution and in the presence of these metals, the zzso is capable of zzso to form a rigid zzso zzso structure, zzso We report here the zzso characterization of the zzso complex zzso and the zzso zzso with regard to potential zzso contrast agent zzso A combination of pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been used to determine zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and for the complexes zzso and zzso In addition, stability zzso have been measured for the zzso zzso zzso formed with M zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso log zzso zzso zzso log zzso zzso zzso A multiple field, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso study on zzso and zzso yielded the parameters for water exchange and the zzso zzso The zzso chemical shifts are indicative of zzso of the zzso zzso The exchange rates of the two zzso water molecules are very similar in the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), and are comparable to zzso for similar zzso zzso zzso The zzso dynamics of the zzso has been described by means of the zzso approach, which involves separating global and local zzso The difference between the local and global zzso correlation times, zzso zzso 190 zzso 15 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso respectively, shows that the zzso is not completely zzso However, the relatively high value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso describing the restriction of the local motions with regard to the global one, points to a limited flexibility compared with previously reported zzso such as zzso As a result of the two zzso water zzso with their zzso exchange rate, and the limited flexibility, the zzso has a remarkable zzso zzso zzso particularly at high magnetic fields zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 60 and 200 zzso respectively, at 25 degrees zzso It packs six efficiently relaxing zzso zzso into a small molecular space, which zzso to the best of our knowledge, to the highest zzso per molecular mass ever reported for a zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also a prime candidate as a terminal zzso for constructing larger zzso zzso (or zzso zzso or zzso loaded with zzso on the zzso
