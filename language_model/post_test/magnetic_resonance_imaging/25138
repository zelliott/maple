The superior right zzso zzso tract zzso zzso and free wall are common locations of origin for zzso tract zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso unique zzso zzso of pace maps from zzso and zzso sites in the superior zzso could be identified using magnetic zzso mapping for accurate anatomical zzso and zzso this zzso information could help facilitate pace mapping and accurate VT zzso 

In 14 patients with structurally normal hearts who were undergoing zzso for zzso tract zzso a detailed magnetic zzso map of zzso was constructed in zzso rhythm, then pace mapping was performed from zzso zzso and zzso sites along the zzso and free wall of the superior zzso Pace maps were analyzed for zzso zzso in limb leads and transition patterns in zzso zzso zzso R waves in inferior leads for zzso sites were taller zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso vs zzso zzso 15 zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and showed early zzso transition (by lead zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso A positive R wave in lead I also distinguished zzso from anterior zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso in limb leads and zzso transition pattern zzso vs zzso in a retrospective analysis, a blinded reviewer was able to accurately zzso the site of origin of clinical zzso (the successful zzso site on the magnetic zzso zzso in 25 of 28 patients zzso with superior zzso zzso 

Pace maps in the superior zzso region manifest zzso zzso zzso that can help in zzso zzso from zzso locations and zzso from anterior zzso Despite overlap in zzso zzso and zzso in the majority of patients a combination of zzso features can serve as a useful template in predicting accurately the site of origin of clinical zzso arising from this zzso
