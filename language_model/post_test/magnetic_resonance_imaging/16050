Recent zzso in high field magnetic resonance imaging zzso technology (3 T and zzso providing increased signal sensitivity and images with more prominent contrasts intrinsic to the brain, offer new opportunities for assessing brain zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso In this article, the principle benefits of high field zzso for zzso research are described and new findings at high magnetic fields are zzso Several high field zzso zzso including structural zzso imaging of brain iron, diffusion zzso imaging, zzso spin labeling zzso imaging, rotating frame imaging, and magnetic resonance zzso are critically reviewed for their potential roles in studies of zzso
