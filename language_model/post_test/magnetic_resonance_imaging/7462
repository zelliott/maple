The objective of this study was to investigate whether zzso of zzso and zzso (such as zzso can exacerbate irritable zzso syndrome zzso zzso The aim was to better understand the origin of these symptoms by magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso 

A total of 16 healthy volunteers participated in a zzso randomized, zzso crossover study in which they consumed zzso of water containing zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or a zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans were performed hourly for zzso assessing the volume of gastric zzso small zzso water content zzso and zzso zzso Breath hydrogen zzso was measured and symptoms recorded after each zzso 

Data are reported as mean zzso zzso zzso when normally distributed and median zzso when zzso zzso increased area under the curve zzso from zzso of zzso to 71 (23) zzso significantly greater than for zzso at 36 zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso after zzso 33 zzso zzso was no different from that after zzso Adding zzso to zzso decreased zzso zzso to 55 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substantially increased zzso zzso gas to 33 zzso zzso significantly greater than zzso and zzso (both zzso Breath zzso rose more with zzso than with zzso zzso when combined with zzso significantly reduced breath zzso by zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso alone zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso zzso the small zzso with zzso Adding zzso to zzso reduces the effect of zzso on zzso and breath zzso zzso zzso the colon with gas more than zzso but causes few symptoms in healthy zzso
