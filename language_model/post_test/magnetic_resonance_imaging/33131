Current indications for surgery in patients with significant zzso zzso zzso focus on symptoms and left zzso zzso However, prognosis is already reduced by this stage, and earlier identification of patients for surgery could be zzso zzso the zzso may help, but there are limited data on its link with zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso can accurately zzso zzso and we examined whether this was associated with the future need for zzso 

One hundred thirteen patients with zzso moderate or severe zzso were monitored for up to 9 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following a zzso zzso and the progression to symptoms or other indications for surgery was zzso zzso zzso identified outcome with high zzso zzso of the 39 subjects with zzso fraction zzso progressed to surgery zzso within 3 zzso in comparison with zzso of 74 subjects with zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso the area under the curve on receiver operating characteristic analysis was zzso zzso This ability remained strong on zzso zzso survival zzso zzso left zzso zzso volume zzso zzso had good, although lower, zzso ability zzso under the curve zzso but the combination of this measure with zzso fraction provided the best zzso zzso 

High degrees of zzso zzso were associated with the development of symptoms or other indications for zzso zzso zzso showed slightly better zzso ability than zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso This could provide a new paradigm for the timing of surgical intervention but requires confirmation in a clinical zzso
