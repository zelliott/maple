The study investigates the impact of exposure to the stray magnetic field of a zzso 7 T zzso scanner on zzso performance and zzso Twenty seven volunteers completed four sessions, which exposed them to approximately 1600 zzso zzso 800 zzso and negligible zzso field zzso The order of exposure was assigned at random and was masked by placing volunteers in a tent to hide their position relative to the magnet zzso Volunteers completed a test battery assessing auditory working memory, zzso zzso and visual zzso During three sessions the volunteers were instructed to complete a series of standardized head movements to generate additional zzso fields ( approximately 300 and approximately 150 zzso zzso In one session, volunteers were instructed to keep their heads as stable as zzso Performance on a visual tracking task was zzso influenced zzso by zzso per 100 zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a trend for performance on two zzso tests to be decreased zzso No effects were observed on working zzso Taken together with results of earlier studies, these results suggest that there are effects on visual perception and hand-eye zzso but these are weak and variable between zzso The magnitude of these effects may depend on the magnitude of zzso fields and not so much on the zzso zzso While this study did not include exposure above zzso zzso it suggests that use of strong magnetic fields is not a significant zzso in zzso studies of cognitive zzso Future work should further assess whether zzso field may impair performance of employees working in the vicinity of these zzso
