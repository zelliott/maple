zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was carried out on a patient with zzso disease suffering from acute cerebral zzso Though an acute zzso zzso was demonstrated as a high signal area on the zzso image, it was impossible to determine whether it was acute or chronic because of extensive deep white matter zzso zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso However, only the acute zzso zzso was detected on zzso which showed it as a high signal area, suggesting reduced molecular diffusion of zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso a zzso zzso that characterizes the zzso on water in zzso was lower in the acute zzso and higher in the chronic zzso zzso can differentiate acute from chronic zzso which is not possible by conventional CT and zzso
