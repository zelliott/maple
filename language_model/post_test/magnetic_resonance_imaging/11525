zzso zzso zzso is widely prescribed for acute hypertension zzso in children despite reports of zzso complications in zzso We describe two children with zzso events caused by rebound hypertension following zzso zzso 

Patient 1 is a 7-year-old with acute zzso and blood pressure zzso of zzso She received zzso which decreased zzso to zzso When zzso rebounded to zzso she developed severe cortical visual zzso Head CT demonstrated zzso and zzso zzso in the watershed zzso Patient 2 is a 10-year-old zzso transplant recipient who received zzso for a zzso of zzso which resulted in a prompt decrease to zzso Two hours later he developed zzso and zzso zzso His zzso increased to zzso and he developed partial complex zzso Brain zzso showed high signal intensity in the watershed areas with early zzso zzso 

The zzso association of the zzso events with the rebound increase in zzso suggests a possible role for the zzso consistent with its zzso zzso Although the adult literature has focused on the unpredictable decline in zzso after zzso treatment, these cases suggest that rapid increases in zzso following the zzso zzso effect may be associated with impaired cerebral zzso and zzso in zzso These cases underscore the need for frequent blood pressure zzso and therapy to prevent rebound zzso
