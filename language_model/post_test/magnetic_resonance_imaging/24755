zzso zzso zzso have shown increased engagement of reward regions and reduced engagement of executive control zzso There is no report yet on whether these differences can predict zzso This is the first study that investigates whether differences in zzso networks can predict later zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 69 short-term zzso zzso Participants performed the affective zzso task outside of the zzso At zzso zzso participants were grouped as zzso (N zzso 40; age: M zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (N zzso 29; age: M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined baseline zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso showed significantly decreased zzso within both the reward and executive control networks as well as within the visual network zzso zzso zzso Lower zzso in zzso could predict zzso zzso zzso zzso and was significantly correlated with poor zzso control of zzso stimuli zzso zzso zzso and with alcohol use zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that lower zzso during short-term zzso may predict subsequent zzso The association of lower zzso with poorer zzso control suggests that low zzso may constitute a faulty foundation for future responses to external cues, which can be zzso as the inability to inhibit zzso
