zzso data on zzso magnetic stimulation zzso measures of cortical zzso in the elderly is zzso Nevertheless, elderly subjects are included as controls in studies utilizing zzso to investigate disease zzso zzso increased zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso zzso volumes have uncertain significance in zzso zzso Information regarding cortical zzso in zzso intact elderly would augment our understanding of the zzso of aging and assist in the interpretation of zzso studies involving elderly zzso 

zzso healthy elderly subjects underwent zzso testing to determine outcomes of resting motor threshold zzso cortical silent period zzso and central motor zzso time for examination in relation to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Increased zzso and zzso volumes were associated with decreased right and left zzso zzso Smaller zzso volumes were associated with decreased right zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso observed zzso zzso changes are associated with findings consistent with increased cortical zzso 

zzso zzso findings likely reflect changes at a cellular level, and may influence cognitive and motor integrity in the zzso Future zzso studies investigating cortical zzso may wish to consider zzso markers of zzso prior to enrolling elderly subjects as zzso
