zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the hand representation in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso monkeys revealed an zzso hand input zzso by most previous zzso zzso responses had a zzso signature indistinguishable from that of zzso hand zzso We explored the neural mechanisms of the zzso effects using a second zzso analysis of field zzso zzso source density zzso zzso combined with action potential profiles, sampled from area zzso using linear array zzso In contrast to the predominantly zzso zzso response, the zzso zzso response appeared dominated by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may have zzso effects on zzso input zzso Our findings confirm zzso convergence at the earliest stage of cortical zzso processing in zzso They also illustrate the value of combined zzso and zzso analyses in monkeys for defining hidden aspects of sensory function and for investigating the zzso processes generating zzso zzso
