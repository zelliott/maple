We use multiple zzso zzso to measure cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso after zzso in rabbits and to acquire the early zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to assess cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso at different time points within a month after zzso in 15 zzso The functional outcomes were evaluated at 1 and 30 days after zzso The relationships between the quantitative zzso information at different time points and functional outcome at 30 days were zzso The volume transfer zzso (K zzso in the focal zzso area and the zzso zzso area at the acute phase correlated with the functional outcome at 30 days zzso zzso zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso value at 7 days in the focal zzso area correlated with the functional outcome at 30 days zzso zzso zzso and had a trend to correlate at 3 days zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso area, the zzso values at both acute and zzso phase correlated with the functional outcome at 30 days zzso zzso zzso The volume of zzso correlated with functional outcome at 30 days zzso zzso zzso The cerebral zzso assessed by zzso (K zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso assessed by zzso may have zzso zzso
