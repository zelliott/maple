To study the zzso MR zzso findings in zzso disease zzso zzso and zzso 

MR imaging and zzso MR zzso were acquired in two patients with sporadic zzso zzso zzso and one patient with zzso zzso 

The two patients with sporadic zzso demonstrated MR signal change within the zzso zzso and zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso The patient with zzso zzso showed characteristic signal change within the zzso of the zzso and a markedly reduced zzso zzso 

All three patients with zzso demonstrated evidence of reduced zzso zzso ratios on MR zzso These changes imply that zzso loss and/or dysfunction is a consistent finding in established zzso
