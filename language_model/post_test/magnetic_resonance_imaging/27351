zzso is an zzso measure of microscopic magnetic field zzso and is increased by the zzso effect of iron and the zzso effect of zzso zzso may detect features of multiple sclerosis zzso not evident with conventional zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso weighted sequences were obtained from 21 healthy controls zzso men, 12 zzso mean age 36 zzso and 28 zzso patients zzso men, 21 zzso 18 zzso zzso 10 secondary zzso mean age 42 zzso zzso and zzso relaxation time maps were created from the zzso zzso and zzso maps were created using the formula zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured in zzso white matter zzso and in regions of interest in normal appearing white matter zzso and zzso matter in all zzso 

zzso was reduced in zzso in zzso compared with controls zzso vs zzso zzso zzso was additionally reduced in zzso both zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso tended to be higher in the zzso zzso of zzso patients compared with controls, and was significantly higher in the zzso nucleus in secondary progressive zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso volume predicted an increase in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

Reduction in zzso in zzso and zzso is consistent with a decreases in zzso tissue iron and/or zzso Increased zzso zzso in patients with secondary progressive zzso is consistent with increased iron deposition, as zzso by other zzso
