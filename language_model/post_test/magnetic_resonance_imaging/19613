The objective of this study was to characterize and compare the zzso magnetic resonance spectrum of a zzso containing zzso or zzso white matter zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 35 zzso patients (17 zzso and 18 zzso and 17 zzso zzso from an 8 zzso zzso located in the zzso region were obtained with a zzso pulse sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso areas due to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compounds zzso were determined, and results expressed in terms of area in arbitrary units or as zzso zzso With respect to the control group, there were significant reductions in zzso and zzso ratio in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the zzso and zzso zzso These results support the existence of zzso changes in the white matter of zzso and SP patients and suggest that there is zzso damage and/or loss in both clinical zzso Finally, characterization of the zzso region showed no significant differences in the spectral pattern of zzso between zzso and SP clinical courses of zzso
