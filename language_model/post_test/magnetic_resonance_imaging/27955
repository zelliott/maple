A method for measuring regional blood volume and flow is described based on the reduced relaxation time following intravenous injection of zzso The optimal zzso dose and other parameters were first determined using zzso sequences and a dilution zzso A single maximum was found for a zzso concentration of 4 zzso Taking account of normal zzso volumes and in order to stay below this zzso value zzso was injected as a zzso at the rate of 1 zzso From the phantom zzso there appears to be a functional connection between measured signal intensity and zzso zzso The method was applied to 15 patients with cerebral zzso using altogether 26 zzso zzso The results from 4 patients are given as zzso in these, blood volume and flow were calculated for each zzso in a 128 zzso 128 zzso It was found that the zzso injected is sufficient to be shown with certainty in the zzso and white matter and that this is able to demonstrate pathological changes in a functional zzso zzso with zzso doses such as are used for zzso imaging zzso 10 zzso corresponding to zzso zzso body zzso has shown that doses above zzso zzso may lead to distortion of the concentration zzso
