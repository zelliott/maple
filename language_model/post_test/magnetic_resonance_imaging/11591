Based on its ability to provide quantitative information about tissue zzso diffusion zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso might be a valuable approach to improve the reliability of zzso of the various brain zzso In this study, a fully automated and zzso technique based on zzso zzso analysis of zzso derived images was used to segment white and gray matter of the brain from 10 healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso The results obtained with this novel zzso strategy were compared to those achieved by two experienced observers using an zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Visual inspection of the segmented zzso from a third senior observer disclosed that the automated technique worked properly on all images from all subjects and was more accurate than the human zzso in defining zzso white and gray matter portions as well as in tissue zzso at the external brain zzso In addition, this zzso technique resulted in an average zzso matter ratio similar to that reported by zzso zzso The application of the zzso zzso strategy was extremely time-consuming and the two observers achieved poorly zzso zzso zzso brain white and gray matter using information from zzso proved to be an accurate approach with the potential for improving the understanding of the zzso of many zzso zzso
