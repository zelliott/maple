Language processing involves multiple zzso structures in the human auditory zzso Although a variety of zzso and mapping techniques have been implemented to better understand language processing at the level of the auditory cortex, much is unknown regarding how and by what pathways these structures interact during essential tasks such as sentence zzso In this study, the effective and structural connectivity at the level of the auditory zzso were zzso First, blood zzso zzso zzso responses were measured with zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during audition of short zzso Once zzso zzso maps were zzso the effective connectivity between primary auditory zzso and the surrounding auditory regions on the zzso plane and superior zzso zzso zzso were investigated using zzso causality mapping zzso zzso connectivity was observed between the primary auditory zzso and zzso the lateral zzso zzso and anterior zzso and zzso the lateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using diffusion zzso zzso mapping zzso zzso and zzso fiber pathways were detected between regions depicting effective zzso The effective and structural connectivity results of the present study provide further insight as to how auditory stimuli zzso human language) is processed at the level of the auditory zzso Furthermore, combining zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis could provide a novel means to study effective and structural connectivity not only in the auditory cortex, but also in other cortical zzso
