The aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of spinal tap test zzso with cerebral zzso measurement assessed either by zzso zzso or zzso weighted zzso zzso or both, for a better zzso selection of promising candidates for shunt operations in suspected idiopathic normal pressure zzso 

27 consecutive patients were examined with a standard clinical protocol zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as with zzso zzso zzso or additionally by zzso zzso before and after zzso The results of these examinations were compared preoperatively for each patient and correlated with zzso clinical outcome after shunt zzso 

Nine patients showed both, a clinical improvement, and increased cerebral zzso after zzso They underwent shunt surgery with good to excellent zzso In another nine patients increasing cerebral zzso was detected although they did not show a clear clinical improvement after zzso Six of them also received a shunt operation with good to excellent zzso Three patients of the last group could have an zzso Nine patients did not show any clinical improvement or any kind of increasing cerebral zzso after zzso zzso they did not undergo zzso The results of zzso and zzso correlated in 92 % of the patients (11 of zzso 

It is concluded that a combination of clinical assessment with zzso or zzso is helpful in the zzso selection of patients for zzso procedures with suspected zzso zzso This combination is a minimal invasive and objective test zzso that is superior to zzso zzso Further studies are necessary for a comparison of the described imaging techniques with different diagnostic tests in this difficult field of cerebral zzso
