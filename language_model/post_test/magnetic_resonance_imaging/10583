To determine zzso the magnetic resonance zzso findings associated with pedal zzso zzso with and without superimposed zzso and to identify any useful discriminating zzso 

zzso review board approval was obtained and allowed review of records and images without informed zzso zzso compliance was zzso zzso MR images in patients with diabetic zzso zzso of the foot were examined by two zzso in zzso zzso zzso were examined for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of superimposed zzso was zzso A zzso that had undergone MR before infection was evaluated for zzso zzso and zzso tests were used to evaluate the zzso 

Of 128 zzso zzso in 63 patients (24 female, 39 zzso aged zzso zzso 43 had superimposed zzso zzso was common in all zzso zzso but thin rim enhancement was more common in zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and diffuse joint fluid enhancement was more common with infection zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and erosion were seen in both groups, but zzso bodies were more common in zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso soft zzso zzso enhancement, and zzso were common in both zzso zzso collections in the soft zzso were more commonly associated with infected zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and, when present next to an infected joint, were larger than those next to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fat replacement zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and zzso tracts zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso were also more common with zzso In the zzso zzso signal intensity zzso was common in both groups, but the extent was greater with zzso zzso zzso were seen almost exclusively in zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in the zzso of 21 zzso (15 zzso with both zzso and zzso MR zzso 

zzso zzso replacement of zzso fat, fluid collection, and extensive zzso zzso are MR imaging features indicating superimposed zzso Thin rim enhancement of zzso presence of zzso zzso or zzso bodies indicate absence of zzso
