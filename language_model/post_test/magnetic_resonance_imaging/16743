To evaluate the presence and the degree of zzso zzso zzso in patients with unilateral zzso disease zzso as a function of duration of the disease, estimated using a zzso zzso inversion recovery sequence in a zzso magnetic resonance imaging unit, after zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 32 patients (21 male and 11 female subjects, aged zzso zzso zzso 56 zzso participated in the zzso The duration of the disease ranged from 2 months to 10 years zzso 3 zzso with a prevalence of vertigo spells in the last 6 months ranging from zzso to 8 per month zzso zzso 

A zzso solution of zzso (1 zzso diluted zzso in saline was injected in the affected ear through the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using a zzso spinal zzso The patient was kept with the head rotated 45 degrees zzso for 30 minutes after each zzso zzso hours later, a zzso zzso inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging was zzso 

zzso enhancement was evaluated in different portions of the labyrinth as a function of MD zzso 

zzso or absence of enhancement of the zzso occurred zzso and occurred in all subjects at long zzso The prevalence of enhancement abnormalities in the zzso and the semicircular canals was directly zzso to MD zzso At long term, the zzso and the zzso showed a more severe zzso involvement compared with semicircular zzso A statistical significant correlation between enhancement abnormalities and MD duration was observed for most inner ear zzso 

The increased prevalence and severity of zzso with the duration of MD indicates that zzso is a progressive degenerative zzso The frequent zzso in the zzso and, zzso in the zzso is in line with some zzso zzso It remains to be clarified whether zzso changes are related to specific signs and symptoms of zzso
