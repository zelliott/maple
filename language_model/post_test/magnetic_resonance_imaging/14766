zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso is associated with an elevated risk of progressing to Alzheimer's zzso Much less is known about the course of zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso The goals of this study were to determine how the profile of cognitive deficits differs over time between patients with zzso and zzso and control zzso if the type of zzso differs between zzso and zzso in patients who progress to zzso and if zzso is more associated with stroke and white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso than zzso 

The authors undertook a prospective evaluation of an inception cohort of zzso ethnically diverse elders recruited from an urban community-based sample monitored with clinical and zzso testing for an average of zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso A subset of the subjects underwent zzso We compared four groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso with and without executive zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso was less likely to involve other areas of zzso over time and progress to zzso None of the 33 zzso zzso patients progressed to zzso The presence of executive dysfunction in zzso zzso did not increase risk of progression to zzso Patients with zzso zzso with executive dysfunction who progressed to zzso were less likely to have an zzso zzso than zzso patients without executive zzso Patients with zzso were more likely to experience stroke, but not white matter zzso detected via zzso than patients with zzso 

zzso appears to follow a different course, and is less associated with Alzheimer's disease and more associated with stroke than zzso
