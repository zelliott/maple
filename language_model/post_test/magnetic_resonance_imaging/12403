zzso of anatomical structures in medical images is often based on a zzso zzso zzso Deep learning systems, such as zzso neural networks zzso can zzso a zzso representation of images that fosters zzso We propose a novel system for zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso which have a zzso association with the zzso zzso and zzso planes of zzso image, zzso We applied our method to the zzso of zzso cartilage in low field knee zzso scans and tested it on 114 unseen zzso Although our method uses only zzso features at a single scale, it performs better than a state-of-the-art method using zzso zzso zzso In the latter approach, the features and the zzso have been carefully adapted to the problem at zzso That we were able to get better results by a deep learning architecture that autonomously learns the features from the images is the main insight of this zzso
