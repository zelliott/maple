zzso identification of zzso zzso will improve stroke patient selection for zzso therapies and clinical zzso Current magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques have limitations and lack zzso zzso challenge zzso zzso zzso zzso uses oxygen as a zzso to detect tissue zzso with zzso displaying the greatest zzso signal change during zzso zzso zzso zzso was combined with zzso OC to determine zzso status of zzso zzso Permanent middle cerebral artery zzso was induced in zzso male zzso rats zzso zzso injury and zzso deficit were determined by zzso and zzso imaging, zzso At 147 zzso 32 minutes after stroke, zzso signal change was measured during a zzso zzso zzso immediately followed by 125 zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance images were zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso of interest were located within zzso core, zzso zzso equivalent zzso structures, and a region of zzso A zzso signal increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was recorded in presumed zzso which displayed local cerebral zzso zzso values equivalent to zzso zzso zzso signal change was negligible in zzso core, zzso zzso zzso in zzso regions, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso located outside zzso zzso and within the diffusion zzso The results support the utility of zzso to detect viable zzso tissue following zzso
