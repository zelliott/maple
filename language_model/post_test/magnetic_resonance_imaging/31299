The aim of this study was to zzso the contributions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms underlying zzso detection in the context of natural zzso Twenty healthy right-handed native speakers of English participated in an zzso design scan in which natural speech zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso served as standards and zzso within functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso paradigm designed to elicit the mismatch zzso zzso Thus, zzso blocks could involve either a word zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso effect, or a zzso zzso zzso or zzso We zzso an experimental protocol controlling for zzso similar to that used previously when zzso detection was studied in the context of zzso zzso showed that the cognitive and sensory mechanisms of zzso detection were located in the anterior and zzso auditory zzso respectively, as was previously found in the context of zzso The cognitive effect, that was most robust for the word zzso diminished in the zzso zzso In addition, the results indicated that the zzso status of the speech stimulus interacts with acoustic factors exerting a zzso zzso of the extent to which novel sounds gain access to the zzso awareness through zzso zzso Thus, the more salient the zzso stimulus is the more likely it is to be released from the effects of adaptation exerted by the zzso auditory zzso
