To develop a novel approach for high-resolution functional zzso zzso using the conventional zzso zzso 

zzso imaging zzso techniques have generally been used for zzso studies due to their fast imaging zzso However, it is difficult for studying brain function at the zzso level using this zzso In addition, zzso techniques have some zzso such as zzso ghosts and geometric zzso in the reconstructed images, and subsequently require additional zzso to reduce these zzso One way of solving these problems is to acquire zzso data by means of a conventional zzso imaging sequence instead of zzso To provide a fast imaging time, the proposed method combines zzso generalized series zzso imaging with a parallel imaging technique which is called the zzso zzso 

The proposed zzso technique achieves a zzso acceleration in imaging time without the cost of spatial zzso The proposed method was verified through the application of zzso studies on normal zzso 

This study suggests that the proposed method can be used for high-resolution zzso studies without the geometric distortion and the zzso ghost artifacts compared to zzso
