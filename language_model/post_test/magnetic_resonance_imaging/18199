zzso zzso zzso can convert mental states into signals to drive real-world devices, but it is not known if a given covert task is the same when performed with and without zzso zzso Using a zzso likely involves additional cognitive zzso such as zzso attention, and conflict zzso In addition, it is challenging to measure the quality of covert task zzso We used zzso zzso real-time functional zzso to address these issues, because the method provides both zzso maps to examine the neural requirements of zzso and zzso accuracy to zzso the quality of task zzso zzso performed a covert counting task at fast and slow rates to control a visual zzso Compared with the same task when viewing but not controlling the zzso we observed that being in control of a zzso improved task zzso of fast and slow counting zzso Additional zzso control increased subjects' zzso zzso ratio compared with the absence of zzso The neural pattern for control consisted of a positive network comprised of zzso zzso and frontal regions and the anterior zzso of the right zzso as well as an expansive negative network of zzso These findings suggest that real-time functional zzso can serve as a platform for exploring information processing and zzso and zzso network-based regulation of zzso task zzso zzso
