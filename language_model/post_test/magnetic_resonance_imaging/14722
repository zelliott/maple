We aimed to develop an zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso technique to produce a zzso image of zzso 

The zzso model was created from standard two-dimensional zzso zzso sequences to produce an image that is zzso zzso Individual muscle and zzso layers were extracted from zzso sequences and zzso pathology from short zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso to produce two separate zzso These were then fused using zzso software zzso zzso version zzso to generate a zzso zzso 

The final zzso model was incorporated into a zzso file that has an integrated computer aided design zzso viewer, allowing the surgeon to rotate it in any direction during zzso planning or whilst in zzso 

As an adjunct to zzso zzso images and the associated zzso report, this model communicates the zzso anatomy to the zzso more clearly and should be particularly useful in complex zzso
