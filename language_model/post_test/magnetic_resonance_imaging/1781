The first steps in the process of reading a printed word belong to the domain of visual object zzso They culminate in a representation of letter strings as an ordered set of abstract letter zzso a representation known as the Visual Word Form zzso Brain zzso in patients with pure zzso and functional imaging data suggest that the zzso is zzso by a restricted patch of zzso zzso cortex, which is zzso activated during zzso In order to determine whether the operation of this Visual Word Form Area zzso depends exclusively on the visual features of zzso or is influenced by zzso zzso brain zzso induced by words, consonant strings and zzso were compared in normal subjects using functional zzso zzso zzso were presented in the left or right visual zzso The zzso was identified in both a zzso experiment and an zzso experiment as a zzso zzso area showing a stronger zzso to zzso strings than to zzso and zzso for the spatial location of zzso In both experiments, stronger zzso of the zzso to words than to strings of consonants were zzso Considering that the zzso is equally activated by real words and by zzso zzso this result demonstrates that the zzso is initially plastic and becomes attuned to the zzso zzso that zzso letter combination during the acquisition of zzso Additionally, the use of zzso stimulation shed some light on the cerebral bases of the classical right visual field zzso advantage in zzso A left zzso zzso area was found to be activated by zzso letter strings more than by zzso while no symmetrical region was observed in the right zzso Moreover, zzso in the zzso and the left zzso were observed when subjects were reading zzso versus left visual field zzso words, and are likely to reflect the zzso component of the zzso zzso
