To test the hypothesis that flow zzso using continuous zzso spin labeling zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in muscle depend upon transit zzso and examine the zzso of zzso zzso 

A total of 23 healthy subjects underwent zzso imaging of the calf, foot, and zzso with varying zzso delay zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were conducted on a zzso zzso An orthopedic zzso system was employed to create a five-minute period of zzso followed by a transient zzso zzso Imaging commenced two minutes prior to cuff inflation and ended three minutes after cuff zzso 

zzso was found able to well resolve the time course of the zzso flow pattern with an effective zzso of 16 seconds, although we were unable to establish that a plateau had been reached in the flow zzso even at a zzso as long as zzso zzso Peak zzso flow zzso compared favorably with those obtained with zzso zzso zzso following a similar period of zzso zzso zzso repeated zzso varied by approximately zzso over a period of one zzso 

In all zzso regions zzso flow zzso were found to increase with zzso suggesting the prolonged transit delay in zzso
