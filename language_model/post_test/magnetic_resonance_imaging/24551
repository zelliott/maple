zzso zzso disease is a zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso at birth, brain structural abnormalities and zzso zzso To date, few zzso cases have been reported in China where clinical recognition and genetic zzso testing on a research basis are recent zzso Here, we report the clinical and molecular zzso of three zzso disease zzso The patients had different degrees of muscle, eye and brain symptoms, ranging from zzso zzso zzso severe zzso and mental zzso to mild zzso independent walking and language zzso This confirmed the expanding zzso spectrum of zzso disease with varying degrees of zzso zzso and cognitive zzso Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed zzso zzso zzso and characteristic zzso zzso and zzso Four candidate genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were screened, and six zzso zzso (four zzso were identified, including five zzso and one zzso site zzso zzso of the two novel zzso in one patient was confirmed by zzso zzso activity zzso protein expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells harboring this patient's zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso to both the zzso apparatus and zzso zzso We have provided clinical, zzso zzso and genetic evidence of zzso involvement in three unrelated zzso disease patients in zzso The identification of novel zzso zzso and an expanded zzso spectrum contributes to an improved understanding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso the need to consider zzso in Chinese zzso disease zzso
