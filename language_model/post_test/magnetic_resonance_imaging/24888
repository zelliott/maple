zzso flexibility zzso are of clinical relevance for the prognosis of hamstring injury and for monitoring recovery after such zzso The active knee extension test zzso and passive knee extension test zzso are proven to be reliable in healthy zzso zzso has not been determined in patients with acute hamstring zzso 

The purpose of this study was to determine zzso reliability of the zzso and the zzso in patients with acute hamstring zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

Fifty consecutive athletes with acute hamstring injuries confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging were included in this zzso For each subject, 2 testers performed the zzso and the zzso within 5 days after zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso standard error of measurement zzso and minimal zzso difference zzso were zzso 

In the injured leg, the zzso of the zzso was zzso and of the zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso was zzso and of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso of the zzso and of the zzso zzso 

Good zzso reliability was found for the zzso and the zzso in injured zzso Thus, both tests can be reliably used to assess flexibility in injured zzso despite pain and discomfort during zzso
