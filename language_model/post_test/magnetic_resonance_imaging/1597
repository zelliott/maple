zzso zzso zzso zzso has been the preferred investigation to delineate the anatomy of the zzso tract in a patient with a zzso duct zzso after zzso Recently magnetic resonance zzso zzso has been described to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso This paper reports a comparison of zzso with zzso in evaluating patients with an zzso zzso duct zzso 

This was a prospective study of 26 patients who had surgery for a zzso duct zzso after zzso Before operation all patients underwent both zzso and zzso the results of which were compared with the zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso were comparable with regard to image quality, detection of zzso zzso duct zzso assessment of the level of injury and detection of abnormalities such as zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso of liver zzso zzso provided additional information in four patients, including detection of associated fluid collections zzso zzso 3) and portal hypertension zzso zzso zzso In eight patients more than one puncture had to be performed during zzso to delineate the complete zzso 

zzso is an accurate and zzso imaging procedure for zzso evaluation of patients with a zzso duct injury after zzso and is capable of providing additional information which may not be available with zzso
