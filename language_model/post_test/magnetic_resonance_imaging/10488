The formation of cortical object representations requires the zzso of cell zzso correlated by induced zzso bursts above 20 zzso zzso zzso which are characterized by zzso zzso fluctuations around a mean of approximately 300 zzso after stimulus zzso The present electroencephalogram zzso study was intended to uncover to the generators of induced gamma band responses zzso and to analyze zzso between these zzso A standard object recognition task was used to elicit gamma zzso At the scalp surface zzso zzso we found an zzso of induced zzso after the presentation of meaningful zzso as opposed to meaningless zzso zzso which was accompanied by a dense pattern of significant zzso values between distant recording zzso zzso zzso current density zzso compatible with the observed scalp zzso zzso were estimated by means of zzso zzso Resolution zzso zzso In source space brain electrical zzso zzso revealed widespread generators of induced zzso at zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso zzso analysis was calculated between zzso zzso signals based on separate forward solutions of the observed zzso thereby eliminating the possibly zzso influence of activity from areas not under zzso The results support the view that induced zzso signify zzso zzso activity in a broadly distributed network during object zzso The zzso of the generators of zzso zzso zzso evoked gamma activity, and induced alpha activity revealed different sources as compared to the induced zzso and, thus, seem to mirror complementary functions during the present task as compared to induced zzso brain zzso
