To use recently introduced zzso technology to characterize the distribution of zzso in solid tumors, explore the differences between severe zzso and true zzso and evaluate the ability to predict treatment outcomes based on tumor zzso 

zzso zzso trial of patients with advanced head and neck cancer, conducted at an academic zzso 

A total of 63 patients underwent zzso oxygen zzso of their zzso zzso 1 was designed to determine whether a zzso of zzso exists within tumors by examining several series of zzso in each zzso zzso 2 was an analysis of the difference in data zzso incurred when comparing oxygen zzso using oxygen zzso of two different zzso zzso 3 compared the proportion of tumor necrosis to the proportion of very low zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso 4 was designed to explore the correlation between zzso and treatment outcomes after zzso zzso 

No zzso of zzso was found within cervical zzso zzso zzso from head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved with larger (17 zzso zzso displayed smaller zzso than those obtained with smaller (12 zzso electrodes, although this difference failed to reach statistical significance zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between tumor necrosis and the proportion of very low zzso or zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso There was a zzso trend toward poorer zzso control and overall survival in hypoxic zzso 

zzso exists within cervical zzso zzso zzso from head and neck zzso zzso but the hypoxic regions are distributed essentially zzso As expected, zzso of oxygen achieved with larger zzso results in lowered zzso but with no change in overall tumor mean oxygen zzso zzso oxygen zzso are independent of tumor zzso Finally, zzso as an independent variable is incapable of predicting zzso probably reflecting the zzso nature of the biological behavior of head and neck zzso
