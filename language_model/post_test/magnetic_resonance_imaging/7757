Currently, the use of blood zzso for zzso zzso microbes in infected blood products and preventing zzso disease zzso in immune suppressed patients is greater than ever zzso In these systems, dose distribution and uniformity are two important concepts that should be zzso In this study, zzso of the gamma chamber blood zzso model zzso zzso Elan was performed by several dosimeter methods including zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso Carlo simulations using zzso zzso The gel dosimeter was put inside a glass phantom and the zzso zzso were placed on its surface, and the phantom was then zzso for 5 zzso and 27 zzso The dose values at each point inside the zzso were obtained from the magnetic resonance imaging of the zzso For zzso Carlo simulations, all components of the zzso were simulated and the dose values in a fine zzso lattice were calculated using tally zzso This study shows that zzso gel zzso results are in close agreement with the results of zzso zzso zzso Carlo simulations, and the results given by the zzso and the percentage difference between the different methods is less than zzso at different points inside the zzso According to the results obtained in this study, zzso gel zzso is a reliable method for zzso of the blood zzso The major advantage of this kind of zzso is that it is capable of zzso dose zzso
