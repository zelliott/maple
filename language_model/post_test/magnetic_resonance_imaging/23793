The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the diagnosis of facial zzso A total of 14 patients with clinically suspected facial zzso were investigated using high-resolution zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso weighted images were zzso visually and zzso The results of the affected skin portions were compared with the zzso skin and correlated with the clinical zzso The zzso could not be delineated by high-resolution zzso in 9 patients with facial zzso The zzso was not discernible in 6 cases and was zzso in a further 6 zzso The zzso ratio of affected skin portions and zzso skin or clinical severity did not zzso The higher the clinical severity, the more pronounced was the magnetic resonance ratio between zzso and zzso zzso Thus high-resolution zzso is a useful method for objective description of pathological changes in clinically suspected facial zzso
