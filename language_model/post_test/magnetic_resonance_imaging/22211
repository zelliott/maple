It was the aim of this study to zzso the measurement of zzso flow in the zzso artery with the zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso method and combine it with the simultaneous assessment of zzso flow with a zzso ultrasound zzso zzso In seven zzso with a chronically implanted zzso zzso flow probe, zzso flow zzso were made in the zzso artery with a zzso resolution of 32 zzso Mean and zzso flow signal were compared by the simultaneous zzso or zzso measurement of the zzso blood flow signal by both methods zzso and zzso In addition, comparative zzso and zzso flow zzso were made with artificial zzso artery zzso and after the administration of zzso zzso The mean flow data assessed by the zzso zzso flow zzso showed an excellent correlation with corresponding zzso recording zzso zzso zzso The zzso flow signal displayed a zzso of the zzso artery flow profile that was very similar to the zzso flow zzso The zzso changes induced by zzso II or due to zzso artery zzso were also reliably detected by zzso zzso provides a reliable zzso method for the zzso of mean blood flow and the assessment of the zzso flow signal in the zzso artery and proves to be sensitive to zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso the method may be used for studies in physiology that demand a zzso zzso
