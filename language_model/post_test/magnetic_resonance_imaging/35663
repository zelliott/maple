To assess the zzso relaxation time zzso and diffusion zzso D before and following exercise in the zzso anterior muscle and determine whether zzso and D values were zzso 

zzso of zzso and D were performed at 3 T within zzso slices through the calf muscles of six healthy volunteers at 95 s intervals before and for zzso zzso after a zzso exercise to zzso 

The mean zzso standard zzso zzso of zzso and D before exercise were 32 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and after exercise were 43 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso recovery times of the % change in zzso and D after exercise were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and D values showed a significant correlation throughout the experiments zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The increase in zzso of skeletal muscle after exercise is correlated with the increase of the diffusion zzso D and the recovery times appear similar, indicating that any model used to explain zzso increases with exercise must also account for increased diffusion zzso
