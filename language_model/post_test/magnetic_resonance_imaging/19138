Since the discovery in the early 1990s that magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used for functional imaging of the human brain, the technique has been used to examine the contribution of zzso and cortical areas to the human pain zzso In a series of studies in this laboratory, functional zzso zzso of noxious zzso zzso and median nerve zzso zzso demonstrated the involvement of the zzso and multiple cortical areas in zzso The cortical areas identified included the primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso the anterior zzso and the anterior zzso zzso The data also revealed a significant zzso zzso in the zzso of any one of these regions, particularly during zzso and zzso zzso These findings revealed the widespread cortical regions that are recruited by a noxious stimulus and provide clues to the neural zzso of pain that undoubtedly include zzso motor and cognitive zzso
