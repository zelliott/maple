zzso the interaction between the zzso and zzso systems in face recognition is the major aim of this zzso Specifically, we established whether zzso representation of faces contribute to aspects of face recognition that depend on zzso zzso such as identifying zzso or fractured zzso Using face recognition tasks that require zzso or zzso processing, we compared the results of zzso man who has object zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso What is special about face zzso zzso experiments on a person with visual object zzso and zzso but normal face zzso Journal of zzso zzso zzso zzso but normal upright face recognition, to those of zzso man who has zzso but normal object zzso zzso was normal at recognizing faces if zzso processing was zzso but poor at recognizing faces that were modified so as to alter their zzso and require zzso processing zzso et zzso DC was impaired at recognizing upright faces and his performance declined in all tasks involving recognition of modified faces, including those that depend on zzso and on zzso zzso Nevertheless, DC was normal on tasks involving perception of generic faces and face zzso These results show that although zzso face perception can proceed without zzso processing, the reverse is not the zzso Our results suggest that the zzso system is always necessary for face recognition, and appears to support what remains of face identification even in zzso people who have an intact zzso zzso
