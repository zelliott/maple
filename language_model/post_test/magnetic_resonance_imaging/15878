In anterior fusion, we use zzso bone zzso from cervical zzso bodies and zzso screws to prevent graft zzso zzso zzso We report the application of and indication for the zzso method for zzso and present our clinical and zzso zzso 

Using the zzso method, we treated 17 patients with cervical zzso 15 had zzso and 2 had zzso zzso The median follow-up term was 24 zzso The patients underwent anterior zzso and fusion at a single level zzso zzso 8) or at two levels zzso zzso zzso As a control, 17 patients with cervical zzso underwent anterior single-level zzso and fusion using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the cervical spine were obtained in all patients, and the alignment of the whole cervical and fused segment and the height of the fused segment were zzso 

All but one patient experienced zzso of clinical symptoms without deterioration during the follow-up zzso The recovery rate on the zzso score was zzso The patient with zzso zzso suffered zzso neurological deterioration because of a remnant of the upper-level zzso zzso studies confirmed the absence of bone graft dislocation and zzso and of satisfactory bone fusion in all zzso There was no significant difference between the two patient groups with respect to whole spine alignment and the alignment and height of the fused zzso 

The zzso method is useful for treating not only cervical zzso but also cervical zzso zzso at one or two zzso
