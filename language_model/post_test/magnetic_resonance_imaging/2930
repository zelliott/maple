The purpose of this report is to compare zzso bone zzso zzso zzso to high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso imaging using a novel zzso fast spin echo zzso pulse sequence in identifying and characterizing patients with large zzso aqueduct zzso Sixteen patients with zzso hearing loss and a CT diagnosis of large zzso zzso underwent high-resolution fast spin echo magnetic resonance imaging with zzso zzso phased array receiver coils centered over the external auditory zzso zzso resonance imaging parameters included zzso and zzso zzso fast spin echo with an effective slice thickness of 1 zzso zzso zzso patients with 76 normal inner ears who underwent MR imaging using this technique had their zzso duct zzso MR alone identified the enlarged zzso zzso seen along with the large zzso duct in all zzso Three cases (five inner zzso with enlarged zzso zzso zzso on CT showed no evidence of zzso duct or zzso enlargement on zzso MR alone identified a single case of mild cochlear anomaly in conjunction with an enlarged zzso duct and zzso In the normal population the size of the normal zzso duct at its zzso measured from zzso to zzso zzso zzso high-resolution fast spin echo MR imaging of the inner ear may be superior to CT in the evaluation of patients with the large zzso aqueduct zzso
