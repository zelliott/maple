A retrospective comparative zzso 

To investigate natural course and zzso factors in patients with mild forms of cervical zzso zzso zzso focusing on zzso increased signal intensity zzso on zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso natural course of mild forms of zzso especially with zzso on magnetic resonance imaging, remains zzso 

Patients with zzso who visited our institution between 1992 and 2004 and did not undergo surgery at first visit were zzso zzso The inclusion criteria were as zzso zzso motor function Japanese zzso Association scores of 3 or more in both upper and lower zzso and zzso cervical spinal zzso zzso with zzso on zzso magnetic resonance zzso There were 45 patients, with a mean follow-up period of 78 months zzso zzso We investigated long-term natural history by setting the timing of conversion to surgery due to neurological deterioration as an end zzso We further compared zzso parameters between patients who converted to surgery and those who continued to be followed up zzso 

Sixteen patients gradually deteriorated and underwent zzso surgery, whereas 27 patients did zzso Apart from these, 2 patients with acute spinal zzso injury after minor trauma underwent zzso zzso survival analysis revealed that zzso or zzso of patients did not require surgery 5 or 10 years after the initial treatment, zzso As for zzso factors, Cox zzso hazard analysis revealed that total cervical range of motion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the maximum zzso segment zzso zzso zzso and local slip zzso zzso zzso were statistically zzso 

zzso percent of patients with clinically mild zzso with zzso had not deteriorated or undergone surgery at 10 zzso Large range of motion, zzso zzso and instability at the zzso canal were considered to be adverse zzso zzso
