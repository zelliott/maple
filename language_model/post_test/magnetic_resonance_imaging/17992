There has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso a recent addition to imaging analysis zzso The technique analyzes ongoing zzso fluctuations in the blood oxygen zzso zzso Through patterns of spatial zzso these fluctuations can be used to identify the networks within the zzso Multiple brain networks are present zzso and the relationships within and between networks are in constant dynamic zzso zzso state zzso functional connectivity analysis is increasingly used to detect subtle brain network differences and, in the case of zzso subtle abnormalities in illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease zzso The sequence of events leading up to zzso has been hypothesized to begin many years or decades before any clinical symptoms zzso Here we review the findings across zzso studies in the spectrum of zzso zzso to clinical zzso In addition, we discuss evidence for underlying zzso zzso mechanisms, including an important relationship between resting state functional connectivity and brain metabolism and how this results in a distinctive pattern of zzso plaque deposition in default mode network zzso
