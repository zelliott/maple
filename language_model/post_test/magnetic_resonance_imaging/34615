The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso oxygen tension zzso zzso directly over zzso zzso and zzso in between laser zzso 

zzso or zzso was applied to avascular rabbit zzso to produce grade II zzso On the day of the oxygen zzso a zzso of zzso was placed into the zzso zzso space over the zzso area of zzso and the zzso zzso was measured in zzso animals using zzso magnetic resonance zzso To determine the zzso directly over laser zzso small zzso droplets were placed over large zzso 4 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso areas of treatment zzso area approximately zzso of the treated retinal surface zzso To determine the zzso in between laser zzso a large zzso zzso was placed over a field of scatter zzso zzso area approximately zzso of the treated retinal surface zzso The theoretical basis for this approach is zzso 

zzso eyes had a zzso zzso of 22 zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso The zzso zzso was significantly higher over zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso P zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso However, at that time, zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso values zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso P zzso zzso The zzso space in between laser zzso generally showed no significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso over controls on zzso days 1, 5, 14 and zzso The only exception was in the zzso group of eyes, in which a significant increase in zzso over zzso or zzso eyes occurred on zzso day 5 (41 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso P zzso zzso Over zzso zzso in this study, zzso produced a greater increase in zzso zzso compared to control values than did zzso 

These results support the use of zzso as an alternative to zzso for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases in which zzso is suspected to play a zzso
