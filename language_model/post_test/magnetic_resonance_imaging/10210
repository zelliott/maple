To assess the value of zzso magnetic resonance zzso with zzso zzso for the detection and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Between October 2002 and December 2004, 7 patients with suspected zzso duct leaks after trauma zzso zzso 2) or surgery zzso zzso 5) requiring zzso evaluation were zzso zzso examination included single shot fast zzso echo zzso weighted and zzso echo zzso weighted images prior to and 112 minutes in average after IV administration of zzso zzso The results of contrast enhanced MR zzso were correlated to surgery zzso zzso zzso clinical course zzso zzso 3) and zzso drainage zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging showed zzso zzso in collections in 6 patients zzso whereas the combination of zzso weighted images and zzso zzso enhanced images revealed zzso collections in 7 patients zzso The zzso between zzso duct and collection was zzso in 4 patients zzso before zzso zzso zzso and in 3 patients zzso after zzso In one patient the zzso was visible only after zzso Combination of both zzso and post injection MR correctly depicted the origin of zzso leak in 5 cases zzso 

zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso is a non invasive technique that can successfully detect the presence of zzso duct zzso The combination of zzso weighted MR zzso and zzso zzso zzso weighted MR zzso increases the sensitivity in detection and zzso of the site of zzso zzso
