zzso function in healthy people zzso with structural features of both the zzso bulb and higher order zzso processing areas, but we do not yet know how zzso zzso affects these latter zzso In order to examine this question closer, we acquired zzso weighted magnetic resonance images from 17 subjects with zzso zzso and from 17 zzso and zzso zzso We compared white and gray matter volumes as well as cortical thickness between both zzso We found subjects with zzso zzso to exhibit larger gray matter volumes in the left zzso and zzso zzso Further, they had thicker zzso zzso zzso Their left zzso zzso was also thicker than that of zzso These findings are in contrast to those observed in acquired zzso where reduced zzso function is associated with reduced volumes and zzso However, they fit well with observations from other sensory systems, zzso vision, where zzso sensory loss is associated with a thicker primary zzso This finding has been attributed to reduced or absent synaptic pruning as a result of missing peripheral sensory zzso Our findings suggest that similar mechanisms take place in the zzso zzso
