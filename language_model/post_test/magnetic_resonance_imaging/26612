We zzso that zzso zzso tumors zzso may be safely removed without interference with the zzso chain via a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and clinical zzso 

zzso referral zzso 

All 17 patients between 1989 and 2009 with zzso without involvement of the zzso of the jugular zzso 

We used a modified zzso zzso Our technique is a modification of the one first published by zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso were modeled in a linear mixed model evaluating hearing threshold for air and bone zzso and zzso gap at 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 zzso In an effort to preserve the normal sound conducting apparatus and hearing, we used a zzso approach, exposing widely the jugular bulb, the carotid artery, the zzso and even the zzso part of the zzso tube via a zzso Three zzso and one zzso zzso bones were dissected step by step under the operating microscope to demonstrate the approach in zzso zzso 

To evaluate if zzso can be completely zzso without interference with the zzso chain to improve zzso hearing zzso 

We found a substantial improvement of hearing threshold after surgery at all zzso in air zzso For bone zzso there was only a slight gain within random zzso The zzso gap decreased significantly after zzso 

Our approach demonstrated a safe avenue for complete tumor removal without interference with the continuity of the zzso zzso
