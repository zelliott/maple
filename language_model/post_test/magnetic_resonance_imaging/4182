A novel magnetic resonance imaging technique zzso based on zzso zzso spin labeling using a single shot acquisition method is described for zzso zzso The method is similar to zzso in using zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso technique for zzso zzso labeling of zzso blood, but uses a zzso single shot zzso zzso zzso sequence for data acquisition instead of zzso imaging zzso Our preliminary studies show that zzso permits zzso imaging to be performed without many of the artifacts encountered with other imaging methods based on zzso zzso The novel method not only provides similar zzso information to that obtained by zzso as demonstrated in the functional brain imaging study, but also eliminates magnetic zzso artifacts and image distortion commonly observed in zzso zzso Furthermore, this technique can be readily implemented in MR systems without zzso zzso
