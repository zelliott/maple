zzso between task sets involves detection that the current task set is zzso initiation of a change in set, and application of the new task set while zzso to zzso adjust to the demands of the zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of cognitive flexibility consistently report zzso of the anterior zzso zzso and/or adjacent zzso motor regions zzso zzso zzso areas zzso suggesting that these cortical regions are involved in switching task zzso In the current study, our objective was to probe whether zzso zzso would decrease for a number of trials following a switch in task set, zzso longer-term involvement in zzso zzso By measuring zzso when switching between word reading and color naming in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed when actively countering the influence of the irrelevant task set, and this zzso decreased as a function of the number of trials since a task zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions also displayed a decreased response over successive trials after task zzso These findings suggest that the zzso are not only involved in generating a new course of action, but are also involved (along with zzso zzso in zzso operations that resolve competition between task sets over subsequent repetitions of the same zzso
