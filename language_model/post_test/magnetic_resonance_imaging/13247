In comparison to zzso and 3 zzso MR zzso imaging at 7 T benefits from zzso ratio zzso gain and increased spectral resolution and should enable mapping of a large number of zzso at high spatial zzso However, to take full advantage of the zzso field strength, severe technical challenges, zzso related to very short zzso relaxation times and strict limitations on the maximum achievable zzso field strength, have to be zzso The latter results in a considerable decrease in bandwidth for conventional zzso modulated radio frequency zzso zzso and thus to an zzso large zzso displacement zzso zzso zzso can overcome this problem; but to achieve a sufficient zzso long pulse zzso are required that lead to zzso long zzso in the presence of short zzso relaxation zzso In this work, a new magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso scheme zzso induction zzso acquisition localized by outer volume suppression, zzso is introduced that enables zzso data acquisition with minimal zzso loss due to zzso relaxation and thus for the first time mapping of an extended zzso profile in the human brain at 7 zzso To overcome the contradictory problems of short zzso relaxation times and long pulse zzso the free induction zzso zzso is directly acquired after zzso zzso zzso in the second and third dimension and skull zzso suppression are based on a zzso and zzso outer volume suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enable a zzso of the zzso displacement zzso in the presence of strict limits on the maximum zzso field zzso The variable power zzso zzso with zzso relaxation delays zzso water suppression zzso which is zzso with zzso zzso eliminates zzso side bands and strong baseline zzso Third order zzso is based on the accelerated zzso automatic zzso routine zzso zzso The striking zzso and spectral resolution enable zzso zzso and mapping of 12 zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso The high zzso is also the basis for highly zzso resolved zzso zzso
