This review outlines the rationale for the use of zzso zzso or magnetic source imaging zzso a zzso functional imaging technique, and the features that any imaging method should display to make a substantial contribution to cognitive zzso After a brief discussion of the basic experimental approach used in the zzso studies, the use of early sensory components of brain magnetic responses is reviewed to address issues of the functional organization of the primary sensory zzso followed by a comment on the clinical use of these zzso Second, zzso studies focusing on the late components of magnetic responses for establishing the zzso and reliability of zzso maps of the zzso zzso in normal subjects are zzso Third, the zzso investigations of fine zzso features of brain zzso zzso specific to receptive language and to reading, are zzso Fourth, experience with zzso mapping of the zzso zzso in neurosurgery candidates and in patients undergoing the zzso procedure is summarized followed by a comment on the perfect agreement of the zzso maps with those derived by more direct invasive brain mapping zzso zzso zzso evidence of often dramatic, functional reorganization of brain areas zzso both simple sensory and linguistic functions is summarized along with comments on the use of zzso as a means for investigating brain zzso Finally, in the sixth section of this review, the authors relate their experience with the use of zzso in zzso brain zzso profiles during silent reading of real words and zzso that are specific to dyslexic zzso The review concludes with a discussion on the further use of zzso in zzso among other issues, the effectiveness of intervention strategies designed to improve reading zzso in dyslexic zzso
