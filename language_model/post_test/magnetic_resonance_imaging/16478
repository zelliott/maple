The anterior prefrontal zzso zzso exhibits zzso during some cognitive tasks, including episodic memory, reasoning, attention, zzso task sets, decision making, zzso and processing of zzso zzso However, the zzso part of anterior zzso is part of the default mode network zzso which shows zzso during various zzso cognitive tasks compared to a resting zzso One possible factor for this pattern is that activity in the anterior zzso zzso zzso is affected by dynamic allocation of zzso resources depending on task zzso We investigated this possibility using an event related zzso with a face working memory zzso 

Sixteen students participated in a single zzso zzso They were asked to form a task set to remember the faces zzso memory zzso or to ignore them (No face memory zzso then they were given 6 seconds of preparation period before the onset of the face zzso During this zzso period, four single digits were presented one at a time at the center of the display, and participants were asked to add them and to remember the final zzso When participants formed a task set to remember faces, the anterior zzso exhibited zzso during a task preparation period but zzso during a task execution period within a single zzso 

The results suggest that the anterior zzso plays a role in task set formation but is not involved in execution of the face working memory zzso zzso when zzso resources are allocated to other brain regions during task execution, the anterior zzso shows zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso in the anterior zzso are affected by dynamic allocation of processing resources across different zzso of zzso
