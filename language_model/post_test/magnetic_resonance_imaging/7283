The aim of this study was to zzso compare zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients and assess the confidence and degree of zzso and zzso agreement in zzso zzso zzso 

Fifty patients referred for staging with known zzso underwent zzso with zzso CT for zzso correction immediately followed by zzso imaging with 2-point Dixon zzso zzso zzso scans were obtained according to standard protocols zzso zzso 20 zzso after injection of an average zzso zzso of zzso 150 zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with 5 zzso zzso Three zzso nuclear medicine zzso identified the zzso and assigned each to an exact zzso zzso The image quality, zzso and confidence in zzso zzso of zzso were scored on a scale of 1-3 for zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by comparing the standardized zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso and the zzso zzso test were used to assess zzso and zzso agreement in image quality, zzso and confidence in zzso zzso for the 2 zzso 

Two hundred zzso zzso zzso were identified in 50 zzso Of these, 225 were correctly identified on zzso and 227 on zzso imaging by all 3 zzso The confidence in zzso zzso improved by zzso when using zzso imaging, compared with zzso The mean percentage zzso agreement was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso imaging, and zzso agreement in zzso zzso across the 2 zzso was zzso There was zzso zzso zzso improvement in local staging with zzso imaging, compared with zzso 

In this first study, we show the effectiveness of zzso zzso imaging in zzso There is no statistically significant difference between zzso imaging and zzso in respect of confidence and degree of zzso and zzso agreement in zzso zzso zzso The PET data on both zzso were zzso however, the observed superior zzso resolution of MR imaging in head and neck, zzso and zzso zzso and of CT in lung and zzso zzso disease points to future tailored use in these zzso
