zzso zzso zzso coated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are regarded as one of most attractive zzso which hold great potential in future cancer zzso The current general synthetic strategy for such promising structures includes the extraction of zzso molecules in the final zzso Here, in this article, we focus our interest on probing the potential influence of zzso acid extraction on zzso zzso zzso MR sensitivity zzso and the optical intensity weakening of zzso coated zzso zzso Control experiments provide evidence of inner core damage, zzso zzso release and residual zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Our investigation shows that: zzso the small zzso zzso could be fragile and sensitive to the zzso zzso and zzso treatment zzso and zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso not only provokes the concerns of potential zzso but also interfere with the contrast imaging tests of zzso zzso providing possible erroneous information on the determination of the zzso zzso of given zzso
