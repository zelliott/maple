zzso zzso and zzso protein expression are most abundant in zzso and zzso zzso Our initial report on mice lacking zzso zzso demonstrated a loss of zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso More recently, however, observation of the zzso zzso into old age revealed significantly lower body zzso as compared with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso mice may have problems with zzso metabolism and/or zzso zzso To test this hypothesis directly, we placed a cohort of zzso and zzso zzso mice on a high fat zzso Interestingly, despite being zzso zzso zzso mice show overt resistance to zzso zzso As predicted, zzso from zzso zzso zzso mice lack zzso zzso Early on, a lack of zzso selectively affects only the female zzso zzso fat pad and results in a near complete zzso of the zzso fat zzso There are also indications of generalized zzso tissue zzso With increasing age, a systemic zzso in zzso zzso occurs resulting in dramatically smaller fat zzso zzso reduced zzso cell diameter, and a poorly zzso white zzso zzso To gain zzso insights into this zzso we show that, although serum insulin, zzso and cholesterol levels are entirely normal, zzso zzso mice have severely elevated zzso and free fatty acid levels, especially in the zzso zzso However, this zzso of zzso zzso low density zzso is not due to zzso zzso zzso activity, a major culprit of isolated zzso The lean body zzso and zzso defects observed in zzso zzso mice are consistent with the previously proposed functions of zzso and zzso in zzso Our results show for the first time a clear role for zzso in systemic zzso zzso in zzso and place zzso as major factors in zzso and zzso
