There are concerns of potential growth zzso after zzso reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in zzso immature zzso The authors used magnetic resonance zzso imaging to evaluate growth zzso and associated zzso abnormalities after index zzso 

We zzso reviewed the follow-up MR imaging studies of 43 patients who underwent zzso reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using a zzso graft at the mean age of zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso Mean time from surgery to follow-up MR imaging was 16 months zzso 6 to 36 zzso Bone tunnel to growth plate zzso area ratios were calculated as zzso zzso growth disturbances were assessed in the follow-up MR images in terms of zzso zzso the presence of a focal bone bridge, an zzso growth arrest line of Harris, and zzso extension of zzso zzso zzso angles with respect to the zzso axes of the corresponding bones were measured in zzso MR images and compared with those measured in follow-up zzso zzso zzso closure was assessed using the zzso zzso growth plate as an internal zzso zzso growth disturbances were assessed with physical examinations regarding standing pelvic heights and alignments of the lower zzso 

The bone tunnel to growth plate ratio was zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso A focal bone bridge was observed in 5 zzso at the zzso zzso and 1 at the zzso zzso zzso angles did not change significantly during follow-up in either the zzso or zzso zzso Earlier zzso closure than other zzso was observed in 2 zzso zzso zzso there were no perceived growth zzso 

MR imaging revealed that focal zzso disruption developed after index procedure in 5 of 43 adolescent patients zzso without a perceived clinical growth zzso The results suggest that zzso reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament may not be a benign procedure that can be applied safely to younger children with substantial growth zzso
