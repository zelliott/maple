We compared zzso of zzso blood flow zzso in the superior zzso zzso zzso obtained by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and quantitative zzso of cerebral blood flow zzso obtained by zzso CT, in zzso patients and normal volunteers, to assess the clinical usefulness of zzso for determination of zzso zzso zzso were obtained in 15 zzso patients and 3 normal zzso zzso zzso was performed using the direct zzso imaging technique with a zzso zzso system near the point of zzso on a zzso MR zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso CT and correlated with zzso flow zzso We also examined the effect of surgical zzso of a zzso or zzso in 3 patients, zzso in 5 patients and zzso in 4 patients by performing zzso zzso The peak zzso flow zzso during the entire cardiac cycle was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal volunteers and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso flow zzso increased after zzso Mean zzso peak flow zzso increased by zzso and zzso at 10 zzso after administration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso peak flow zzso showed significant linear correlations with both cerebral cortical zzso zzso zzso and zzso flows zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso flow zzso reflects zzso and that zzso assessment of zzso flow provides a simple method for assessing and monitoring global changes in cerebral zzso
