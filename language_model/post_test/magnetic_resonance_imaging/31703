zzso inappropriate behavior and thoughts is an essential ability for humans, but the regions responsible for zzso processing are a matter of continuous zzso This is the first study of zzso zzso tasks using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Fifteen subjects zzso two different types of zzso task, zzso zzso Movement and zzso Count, to compare with previous studies using visual zzso tasks, and confirm whether the zzso processing is dependent on sensory zzso Go and zzso stimuli were presented with an even zzso Our data indicated that the response zzso network involved the zzso zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso motor area zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso junction zzso which were consistent with previous results obtained using visual zzso zzso These activities existed in both Movement and Count zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that the network for zzso processing is not dependent on sensory zzso but reflects common neural zzso In addition, there were differences of zzso intensity between Movement and Count zzso trials in the prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso processing would involve two neural networks, common and uncommon regions, depending on the required response zzso
