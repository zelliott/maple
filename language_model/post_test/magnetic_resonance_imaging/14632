We use functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to analyze neural responses to natural auditory zzso We characterize the zzso time series through the shape of the zzso power spectrum and find that the zzso of neural dynamics vary along a spatial zzso with faster dynamics in early auditory zzso and slower dynamics in higher order brain zzso The zzso zzso is observed through the zzso zzso of the power zzso of individual zzso both in the presence and absence of a zzso and is enhanced in the zzso component that is shared across zzso Moreover, zzso faster dynamics occur in areas that respond zzso to momentary stimulus features, while the zzso slower dynamics occur in areas that integrate stimulus information over longer zzso These observations connect the zzso of intrinsic neural dynamics to the zzso of information processing, suggesting a zzso organizing principle for neural zzso across the cerebral zzso
