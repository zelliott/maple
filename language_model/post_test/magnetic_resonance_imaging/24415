The rising proportion of elderly people worldwide will yield an increased zzso of zzso cognitive zzso imposing major burdens on zzso zzso growing interest emerged to evaluate new strategies to delay or counteract cognitive decline in zzso Here, we assessed immediate effects of zzso zzso direct current stimulation zzso on zzso and previously described zzso changes in brain activity attributable to zzso Twenty healthy elderly adults were assessed in a crossover zzso design using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and concurrent zzso zzso administered to the left inferior frontal zzso zzso on performance and zzso brain activity were evaluated during overt semantic word generation, a task that is zzso affected by advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessed zzso changes at the network level independent of zzso Twenty matched younger adults served as zzso During sham zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that enhanced bilateral prefrontal activity in older adults was associated with reduced zzso zzso revealed enhanced anterior and reduced zzso functional brain zzso zzso significantly improved performance in older adults up to the level of younger zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso in bilateral prefrontal zzso the anterior zzso zzso and the zzso and induced a more zzso connectivity pattern during zzso Our results provide zzso evidence from behavioral analysis and two independent functional imaging zzso that a single session of zzso can temporarily reverse zzso effects of aging on zzso and brain activity and zzso These findings may translate into novel treatments to zzso cognitive decline in normal aging in the zzso
