Within one hour following zzso in zzso heavily zzso zzso MR images exhibited a zzso zzso in the gray matter and zzso zzso of the zzso side over normal zzso This zzso correlated with zzso and zzso zzso increases in peak areas from MR surface zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no significant zzso in signal intensity from the zzso zzso within several hours zzso Using a zzso MR contrast agent, zzso together with heavily zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso MR imaging, zzso deficits resulting from zzso were detected as a relative zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso cerebral zzso in the zzso zzso Evidence of these deficits was observed within minutes of zzso and zzso correlated well with the zzso seen on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was superior to conventional zzso zzso in the detection of early zzso zzso In contrast to surface zzso zzso both techniques mapped regions of jeopardy throughout the brain, which later showed zzso zzso and lack of vital zzso zzso
