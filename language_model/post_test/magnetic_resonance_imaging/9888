To study the efficacy and clinical and anatomical results of zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso syndrome zzso with severe zzso zzso with poor zzso function zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso proven zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso height and zzso were measured preoperatively and zzso 

All patients showed an excellent reduction in zzso with a single intervention resulting in a clear visual zzso zzso zzso height improved from mean zzso zzso zzso zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value zzso Four patients underwent additional surgery because of zzso issues with zzso height zzso All patients showed a zzso consistent, and lasting improvement in zzso going from mean zzso zzso zzso zzso preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value zzso This improvement could be attributed to the presence of a very long and thin tendon, as well as a zzso muscle zzso This zzso zzso zzso the zzso muscle from having sufficient impact on the vertical zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso performed in patients with zzso not only results in good zzso appearance in terms of zzso reduction in the majority of cases but also in a significant increase of the zzso zzso zzso zzso An anatomical zzso was found to explain these zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of a marked increase in zzso in zzso due to zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso of the muscle zzso
