A method is developed to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso doped zzso zzso zzso using zzso to prevent irreversible particle zzso during conversion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso or zzso The zzso on the outer surface of zzso also provided an zzso tag for zzso This method is also employed to zzso zzso magnetic zzso zzso with zzso zzso as the core and zzso as a zzso These magnetic zzso zzso have relatively high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) and magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ), providing them with large zzso zzso The magnetic properties for separation and controlled release in flow, their optical properties for cell zzso deep tissue imaging, and their zzso - and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso are zzso The magnetic zzso zzso display both strong zzso dual zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso 204 zzso zzso ), and bright zzso under 1 zzso chicken breast zzso
