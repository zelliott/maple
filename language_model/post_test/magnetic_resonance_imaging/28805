Classical zzso or zzso zzso is a human brain zzso that consists of diffuse zzso and zzso Two genes associated with classical zzso have recently been zzso from zzso zzso and zzso (also called zzso from zzso 

We performed zzso analysis in children with zzso associated with zzso of different zzso 

We compared the zzso especially brain imaging studies, in a series of 48 children with zzso including 12 with zzso syndrome zzso which is associated with large deletions of zzso and other genes in the region, 24 with isolated zzso sequence caused by smaller zzso deletions or zzso and 12 with isolated zzso sequence caused by zzso zzso 

We found consistent differences in the zzso patterns, with the zzso more severe zzso in individuals with zzso zzso and more severe zzso in individuals with zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso are associated with a zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso of zzso are associated with an zzso zzso We also confirmed differences in severity between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso proved to be more common with zzso zzso 

It is often possible to predict the gene zzso from careful review of brain imaging zzso
