One of the deficiencies of zzso zzso zzso for N staging in lung cancer is a zzso result caused by concurrent zzso Recently, zzso magnetic resonance imaging has been reported to be able to image tumors of body zzso The aim of this study is to examine the usefulness of zzso magnetic resonance imaging for N staging of zzso cell lung cancer compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging were zzso used in 88 patients before surgical intervention for zzso cell lung cancer to examine zzso zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic results of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging were zzso The diameters of the zzso zzso within zzso zzso were measured on zzso and zzso sections to compare the zzso size of zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

The accuracy of N staging in the 88 patients was zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging, which was significantly higher than the value of zzso obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso because of less zzso in the zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso stations examined zzso 36 had zzso and the other zzso did zzso Although there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of the 36 zzso zzso zzso stations between the 2 methods, zzso magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate for diagnosing the zzso zzso stations than zzso zzso zzso zzso because of fewer zzso results zzso zzso zzso The zzso size of zzso zzso within zzso zzso was 4 zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging can be used in place of zzso zzso zzso zzso for N staging of zzso cell lung cancer with fewer zzso results compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso
