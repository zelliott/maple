Dynamic zzso is routinely used in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors to supplement zzso zzso The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic value of dynamic zzso using the zzso of total tumor enhancement expressed as per cent zzso and the tumor enhancement rate zzso expressed as per cent per minute zzso and to make a comparative analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of both zzso 

The material consisted of 45 patients (30 zzso 15 zzso zzso The age of the patients was zzso zzso The zzso was done using an zzso zzso unit, applying zzso echo zzso The zzso of total contrast enhancement zzso and the tissue enhancement rate zzso were zzso The limit values were determined for dividing the tumors into zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso were calculated and compared using both zzso 

Dynamic zzso with calculation of zzso and zzso makes it possible to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso was a more sensitive than zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of soft tissue zzso
