We present a surgical guidance system that incorporates zzso image information zzso zzso with zzso ultrasound zzso imaging to detect and correct for brain tissue deformation during zzso neurosurgery zzso Many interactive zzso zzso employ zzso images as a guide to the surgeons throughout the zzso However, when a zzso is involved, tissue movement during a procedure can be a significant source of error in these zzso By incorporating zzso US imaging, the target volume can be scanned at any time, and two-dimensional US images may be compared directly to the corresponding slice from the zzso zzso zzso points may be mapped from the zzso to the zzso image space with an accuracy of better than 2 zzso enabling the surgeon to use this information to assess the accuracy of the guidance system along with the progress of the procedure zzso extent of zzso zzso at any time during the zzso zzso features may be identified on both the zzso and zzso images and used to generate a deformation map, which can be used to zzso the zzso image to match the zzso US zzso System validation is achieved using a zzso zzso imaging zzso and preliminary clinical results are zzso
