The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso images, maximum intensity projections and three-dimensional zzso images for zzso of semicircular canal zzso In 26 patients with zzso of the superior and/or zzso semicircular canal and 26 control patients, zzso images were obtained with two different resolutions and maximum intensity projection zzso and zzso zzso images zzso All images were evaluated by two zzso in consensus regarding the zzso of anatomical structures and zzso of the semicircular zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm or exclude zzso zzso of the semicircular canals was delineated on zzso MR images and on zzso zzso images, but not on zzso zzso The number of false positive cases was reduced from 3 to 0 with an increase in zzso rendering results similar to those obtained with zzso zzso of the semicircular canals can be assessed on high resolution MR zzso zzso zzso images allow for immediate perception of the location of defects in semicircular canal zzso These images may facilitate understanding of the extent and location of the zzso
