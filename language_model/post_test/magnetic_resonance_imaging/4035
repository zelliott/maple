We describe our initial experience with the zzso zzso International, zzso David, zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso fusion software in eight patients with zzso zzso zzso data are zzso integrated into the zzso treatment planning zzso Since zzso is superior to CT in identifying zzso zzso we evaluated the precision and feasibility of this new zzso zzso Patients initially underwent CT simulation from C2 to the most superior portion of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this area was then zzso Patient positioning was duplicated utilizing a head cup and bridge of nose to forehead angle zzso First, a gross tumor volume zzso was identified utilizing the CT zzso The CT and zzso scans were subsequently fused utilizing a point pair matching method and a second zzso zzso was contoured with the aid of both zzso The fusion process was uncomplicated and completed in a timely zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso to be larger than the zzso in all eight zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso by CT zzso This translated into a zzso increase in the zzso tumor volume by zzso A simulated zzso zzso in two patients revealed that marginal portions of the zzso as identified by CT and zzso were not included in the high dose treatment volume as contoured with the use of CT zzso Our initial experience with the fusion software demonstrated an improvement in tumor zzso with this zzso Based on these patients the use of CT alone for treatment planning purposes in central nervous system zzso zzso is inadequate and would result in an unacceptable rate of marginal zzso The zzso of zzso data into three-dimensional treatment planning is therefore crucial to accurate tumor zzso The fusion process zzso and improves precision of this zzso
