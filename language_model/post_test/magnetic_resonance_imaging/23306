Analysis of zzso interactions between distributed brain areas is of fundamental importance for understanding cognitive information zzso However, zzso dynamic zzso interactions between brain regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso poses several unique zzso For one, zzso measures Blood zzso Level zzso zzso signals, rather than the underlying zzso zzso zzso Second, regional variations in the zzso response function zzso can significantly influence zzso of zzso interactions between zzso Third, zzso interactions between brain regions can change with experimental context over zzso To overcome these problems, we developed a novel zzso zzso zzso Systems zzso model to estimate intrinsic and zzso zzso zzso interactions between multiple brain zzso A zzso zzso framework is then used to estimate the parameters of zzso as applied to zzso zzso We show that zzso accurately takes into account regional variations in the zzso and estimates dynamic zzso interactions at the level of zzso zzso We develop and compare two zzso procedures using maximum likelihood zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches for zzso model zzso Using extensive computer simulations, we demonstrate that, compared to zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso exhibits superior performance for a wide range of signal to noise ratios zzso sample length and network zzso Our simulations also suggest that zzso fails to uncover zzso interactions when there is a conflict between the direction of intrinsic and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso using zzso methods is more robust and performs significantly better at low zzso and shorter time series than zzso with zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso of zzso provides a robust method for zzso and interpreting zzso network interactions in zzso zzso
