The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso parameters and left prefrontal volumes in both patients with schizophrenia and healthy zzso zzso MRS parameters and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso data were collected in the left prefrontal region in 10 patients with schizophrenia and 10 healthy subjects of comparable age, zzso sex, educational level, and parental educational zzso No correlations were found between any MRS zzso and zzso matter volumes in the combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso matter volumes, however, were both correlated zzso with zzso zzso were found to be zzso and calculated zzso zzso zzso was found to be increased in the patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy subjects after adjusting for left prefrontal zzso and white matter, total brain volume, and zzso These findings suggest that cortical zzso and white manner volumes are not directly related to zzso and zzso abnormalities in schizophrenia zzso
