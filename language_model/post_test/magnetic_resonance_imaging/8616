The development of zzso techniques has made possible the characterization of cerebral function throughout the zzso cycle in normal human zzso Indeed, human brain activity during sleep is zzso within specific cortical and zzso areas in relation to the sleep stage, sleep zzso events and previous waking zzso This approach has allowed sleep zzso theories developed from animal data to be confirmed, but has also introduced original concepts about the zzso mechanisms of sleep, dreams and memory in zzso In contrast, at present, few zzso studies have been dedicated to human sleep zzso The available work has brought interesting data that describe some aspects of the zzso and neural consequences of disorders such as insomnia, sleep zzso and zzso However, the interpretation of many of these results is restricted by limited sample size and zzso resolution of the employed zzso The use of zzso in sleep medicine is actually restrained by concerns resulting from the technical experimental settings and the characteristics of the zzso Nevertheless, we predict that future studies, conducted with state of the art techniques on larger numbers of patients, will be able to address these issues and contribute significantly to the understanding of the neural basis of sleep zzso This may finally offer the opportunity to use zzso in addition to the clinical and zzso zzso as a helpful tool in the diagnosis, zzso treatment and monitoring of sleep disorders in zzso
