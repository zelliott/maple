A method employing directional correlation of the diffusion zzso zzso weighted relative zzso zzso was developed to improve the accuracy of estimated relative zzso zzso The zzso directional correlation was established on the same zzso between two zzso acquired diffusion zzso images, and the correlation zzso derived from zzso dot product was employed as the weighting factor applied in the calculation of zzso The effect of noise influence was reduced since the random noise between repeated scans is not zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were examined on rat brains in zzso The background noise alters the direction of zzso and the magnitude of zzso The zzso angle between repeatedly obtained zzso representing the extent of directional zzso of zzso depends on the tissue zzso as well as the zzso ratio zzso of the source zzso Current results demonstrate that the zzso zzso improves the accuracy of zzso zzso increases the relative contrast of gray and white matter, and avoids the partial volume effect commonly seen in the zzso zzso
