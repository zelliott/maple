zzso zzso artifacts at the zzso zzso on MR images are often seen when a fast zzso inversion recovery zzso technique is zzso We investigated the influences of four optional zzso sequence parameters on the high-intensity zzso zzso 

A total of 377 patients (age range, 1 week to 91 years; mean zzso years; 186 female, 191 zzso were examined with zzso zzso images obtained zzso zzso with a zzso system during 6 zzso The effects of the optional addition of inferior inflow zzso zzso 80 zzso section flow compensation, and tailored zzso zzso zzso plus the choice of zzso acquisition factors of 2 or 3, were evaluated for the presence of high-intensity zzso artifacts on the zzso zzso Two zzso independently reviewed the zzso images in 76 zzso afterward, a single observer reviewed the remainder of the zzso 

The zzso agreement rate in 76 cases was more than zzso The use of zzso and/or three zzso acquisitions resulted in a substantial reduction in the zzso of high-intensity zzso artifacts from about zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Z zzso zzso inflow zzso and section flow compensation did not significantly improve image quality zzso zzso The results were consistent with the image quality ranking obtained in five healthy zzso 

The appropriate choice of sequence parameters in zzso imaging reduces the zzso of high-intensity zzso artifacts that are frequently encountered in the presence of rapid zzso zzso
