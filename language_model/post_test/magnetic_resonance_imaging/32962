zzso magnetic resonance imaging using dedicated zzso zzso zzso at zzso T zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso coils primarily using silver and copper as conductors with zzso and zzso zzso were built to establish which zzso zzso produces the best zzso Image quality was zzso using zzso ratio and signal variation over regions of zzso zzso was conducted using zzso diameter zzso as this size is comparable to an established zzso of the same zzso Our zzso coils were compared directly to each other, from which we deduce performance as a function of conductor material and zzso A variety of materials and conductor zzso allowed us to choose an optimal design, which we used to image a kidney section at zzso zzso We applied zzso zzso to achieve zzso zzso
