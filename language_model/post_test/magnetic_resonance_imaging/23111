Brown zzso tissue zzso is a highly specialized zzso tissue and has profound effects on body weight, energy balance, and zzso zzso Body temperature regulation depends on the integrated activities of the zzso nervous system, which is centered predominantly in the zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction of brain and the zzso of BAT by analyzing differences in brain metabolism between patients with and without activated zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso of BAT and brain zzso After reviewing zzso zzso scans, we zzso collected 42 patients, 21 with activated BAT and 21 matched controls without activated zzso We used the method of defining regions of interest zzso to examine differences in metabolism between their zzso and zzso zzso zzso statistical zzso mapping to analyze the whole zzso Compared with controls, patients with activated BAT had a significant zzso area in the right inferior zzso zzso zzso area 40) and significant zzso areas in the left zzso zzso area zzso and right zzso however, there were no zzso differences in the zzso zzso Our findings illustrate the close relationship of cold temperature zzso zzso in the right inferior zzso zzso and activated zzso They also support the hypotheses that the zzso and zzso regulate zzso functions, which are important for controlling BAT zzso within the central zzso
