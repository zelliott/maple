Wilson's disease zzso is characterized by impaired zzso copper zzso and subsequent copper zzso in many zzso predominantly liver and brain, secondary to loss of function zzso in the copper transport protein zzso If the disease is recognized too late or treatment is not adequate, brain copper zzso leads to progressive zzso with a variety of clinical zzso The zzso zzso system seems rather zzso zzso zzso however, has not been recognized as one of the prime features of patients with zzso Here we report zzso of zzso diameter in 41 patients with zzso Data were correlated to the severity of neurological symptoms and the integrity of zzso zzso measured via zzso zzso zzso For control, we measured zzso diameter in 18 patients with no evidence for zzso dysfunction and 5 patients with progressive zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso had a reduced zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients without neurological symptoms had zzso diameter that were not different from controls zzso zzso zzso zzso while patients with neurological symptoms showed zzso zzso similar to patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso There was a strong and significant correlation between zzso zzso and the severity of neurological symptoms zzso zzso p zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding correlated significantly but was less pronounced zzso p zzso zzso In zzso we were able to show, that zzso diameter is an easy to perform zzso of zzso induced by brain copper zzso and that other structures than zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to contribute to zzso zzso in zzso
