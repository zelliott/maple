To investigate the relationship between zzso white matter zzso identified on magnetic resonance imaging and gait and balance problems in older zzso 

zzso resonance imaging scans of the brain in 27 zzso older patients zzso 75 years of zzso who had zzso and objective abnormalities of gait and balance of unknown cause were compared with those of 27 zzso and zzso control zzso The zzso intense zzso of the zzso white matter were graded on a scale of 0 to zzso 

zzso zzso 

The patient had significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) more severe zzso white matter zzso on magnetic resonance imaging than did the control zzso Patients fell more frequently than did the control subjects and had slower motor responses and prolonged reaction times compared with the control zzso 

zzso white matter zzso identified on magnetic resonance imaging are associated with gait and balance dysfunction in ambulatory older zzso These zzso probably interfere with central processing of zzso signals leading to impaired zzso zzso
