zzso or zzso therapy is an alternative method for local tumor zzso Until recently, it was mainly applied in China and was relatively unknown in the Western zzso This study examines the feasibility and effectiveness of applying zzso therapy in liver zzso of zzso zzso in an animal zzso 

Liver zzso were implanted in 47 zzso rats by zzso injection of cells from a zzso strain zzso The success rate of zzso and the size of the tumors were determined after 3 weeks by MR imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation time 1,800 zzso echo time 80 zzso The zzso therapy was applied by one platinum zzso placed in the center of the tumor and four at the periphery of the zzso zzso therapy parameters were established in a pilot study by comparing four different methods of zzso therapy with a control zzso The methods varied with respect to the zzso polarity and the applied zzso In a second series of zzso tumor growth was monitored by MR imaging 3 and 5 weeks after zzso 

The tumor zzso rate was zzso at a tumor cell concentration of 8 zzso zzso The most effective therapy method was achieved by placing an zzso at the center of the tumor and four zzso at the zzso with an applied charge of 80 zzso Complete tumor necrosis was observed in zzso of zzso In the follow-up zzso the mean tumor diameter was zzso zzso at 3 weeks after therapy and zzso zzso at 5 weeks after zzso In comparison with the control group zzso and zzso zzso respectively), this represented a significant reduction in tumor growth zzso 

This study is the first to demonstrate an zzso effect of zzso therapy on liver zzso of zzso cancer in zzso
