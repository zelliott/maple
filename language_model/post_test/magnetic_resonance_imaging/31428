To zzso assess sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance zzso imaging after chemotherapy and radiation therapy for predicting tumor invasion of the zzso zzso zzso in locally advanced primary zzso cancer, by using results of zzso examination and surgery as the reference standard, and to determine zzso MR imaging criteria for zzso zzso 

The Ethical Committee of University Hospital zzso approved this study and zzso informed zzso Two observers independently scored zzso MR images in 64 patients with zzso cancer zzso male zzso age, 60 zzso and 26 female zzso age, 64 zzso zzso for zzso tumor invasion with a confidence level scoring system defined by zzso zzso In a subsequent consensus reading session, zzso MR criteria for invasion were defined by comparing zzso changes with zzso zzso These criteria were evaluated and compared with the zzso criteria by comparing areas under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso MR imaging for predicting zzso tumor invasion were zzso and zzso for observers 1 and 2, zzso The following four types of zzso tissue patterns at MR imaging were associated with whether or not zzso invasion was present at zzso examination: zzso development of fat pad larger than 2 zzso zzso in no zzso with and in four zzso without zzso zzso development or persistence of zzso zzso in no zzso with and in 22 zzso without zzso zzso development of diffuse zzso zzso tissue zzso in 21 zzso with and in 32 zzso without zzso and zzso persistence of diffuse zzso or zzso tissue zzso in 19 zzso with and in two zzso without zzso zzso of zzso MR imaging for predicting zzso invasion on the basis of zzso criteria was zzso There was no significant difference between the performance of zzso and zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging findings have moderate accuracy for predicting tumor invasion of the zzso related to the limitation in zzso between diffuse zzso tissue with and that without small tumor zzso zzso other types of zzso patterns at MR imaging can highly predict a zzso or invaded zzso
