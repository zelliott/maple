zzso cognitive impairment zzso is a zzso condition associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease zzso and other zzso This study aimed to identify areas of initial zzso in zzso conversion to zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to compare baseline cerebral zzso in converted zzso and zzso zzso patients and normal zzso zzso zzso patients were recruited for brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso detailed zzso testing, zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso periodic follow-up to monitor progression to zzso zzso We processed zzso images with zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso software and performed zzso statistical zzso mapping zzso Thirty-nine of 49 zzso patients were included in our zzso Nine patients were diagnosed with conversion to zzso on average zzso months after initial zzso Compared with normal controls, converted zzso patients demonstrated zzso deficits in both zzso zzso and right zzso and zzso zzso patients demonstrated zzso in the left zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso patients, converted zzso patients demonstrated significant zzso in both zzso zzso and right zzso Our study suggests that using brain zzso to identify initial zzso in patients with zzso may be helpful for predicting zzso patients likely to develop zzso
