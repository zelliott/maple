This paper presents the theory of the zzso zzso zzso wound on an zzso zzso zzso A zzso transformation of the zzso to a circular geometry is used to derive the optimal sampling of the continuous surface current distribution to produce uniform magnetic fields within an zzso zzso The analysis is rigorous for zzso of any aspect ratio and shows how to produce zzso operation of the zzso zzso with a conventional hybrid zzso Insight gained from the transformation is also used to analyze field zzso find the optimal zzso shield shape, and specify component values to produce the correct current distribution in zzso zzso and images from a zzso zzso zzso zzso at both low and high zzso show good zzso performance, zzso and zzso
