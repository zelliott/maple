zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is presently either performed using blood zzso zzso zzso contrast or using cerebral blood flow zzso measured with zzso spin labeling zzso zzso The present zzso study aimed to provide practical hints to zzso one method over the zzso It involved three different acquisition methods during visual zzso stimulation on nine healthy zzso 1) zzso contrast obtained from zzso 2) zzso contrast extracted from zzso and 3) zzso contrast from Echo zzso zzso Previous findings were zzso zzso no differences between the three zzso were found in the location of the activated zzso zzso differences were found in the zzso characteristics of the signals and zzso zzso has significantly higher sensitivity than zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso when the investigation demands for zzso and task related signal zzso zzso zzso is more suitable in conjunction with fast event related zzso
