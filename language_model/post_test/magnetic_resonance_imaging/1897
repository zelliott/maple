Although there is evidence that acoustic stimuli are processed differently during sleep and zzso little is known about the underlying zzso zzso In the present study, the processing of an acoustic stimulus was investigated during different non rapid eye movement zzso sleep stages using a combined zzso approach in healthy human zzso A text stimulus was presented to sleep-deprived subjects prior to and after the onset of sleep, and zzso silent zzso were zzso We found significantly different blood zzso zzso zzso contrast responses during sleep compared to zzso During zzso sleep stages 1 and 2 and during slow wave sleep zzso we observed reduced zzso in the auditory zzso and a pronounced negative signal in the visual zzso and zzso zzso stimulation during sleep was accompanied by an increase in zzso frequency components in the low delta frequency zzso zzso that zzso zzso is not altered during sleep, the negative zzso zzso response which is most pronounced during zzso sleep stages 1 and 2 reflects a zzso predominantly in the visual zzso suggesting that this decrease in zzso activity protects the brain from the zzso effects of external stimulation during sleep not only in the primary targeted sensory zzso but also in other brain zzso
