This study compared one routine zzso fast spin echo zzso sequence with a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence of the female pelvis for image quality, zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal intensity zzso zzso consecutive women zzso age zzso zzso were zzso at zzso T with one high-resolution routine zzso sequence and one zzso zzso sequence in the zzso plane as part of comprehensive pelvic magnetic resonance zzso The different image sets were rated separately for imaging characteristics zzso image quality, zzso anatomy definition, zzso zzso and free fluid zzso and then compared side by zzso The image sets were also compared for artifacts zzso zzso zzso and chemical shift zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso ratios were calculated for the different zzso zones, zzso zzso free fluid, zzso zzso muscle, and zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated for zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were detected in 20 patients and included zzso (13 zzso zzso (7 zzso benign zzso zzso (6 zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and pregnancy (1 zzso zzso zzso was superior or equivalent to zzso for overall image quality in zzso patients zzso zzso anatomy definition in zzso patients zzso and zzso detection in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso performed less well than zzso for free fluid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was equivalent to or less affected than zzso for zzso artifact in zzso patients zzso and blurring artifact in zzso patients zzso zzso and chemical shift artifacts were not problematic for either image zzso zzso and zzso were higher for all zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso For the zzso zzso zone, zzso and zzso these differences were statistically zzso There were no statistically significant differences for zzso between the two image sets, although zzso zzso values for zzso zzso and abnormal zzso were higher than those calculated for zzso All pathology detected with zzso was detected on zzso zzso despite the zzso zzso inherently poorer spatial resolution compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be able to replace zzso for some zzso applications with a substantial time zzso
