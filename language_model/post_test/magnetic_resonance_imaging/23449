The zzso removal of third zzso zzso zzso has been developed as an alternative to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

To examine the value of zzso technique by reviewing the large number of zzso treated patients with long-term follow-up in 2 zzso zzso 

A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients admitted for zzso of a third zzso zzso zzso to the zzso University zzso Medical Centre zzso The zzso and the zzso Henri zzso zzso zzso between 1994 and zzso Both clinical and zzso symptoms and operative results were zzso 

zzso clinical follow-up was available for 85 patients over a mean period of 4 years 3 zzso Permanent morbidity occurred in 1 patient zzso zzso memory zzso zzso imaging of 80 zzso patients showed that total or nearly total zzso removal was possible in 46 individuals zzso zzso zzso was present in 34 patients zzso and 6 required repeated zzso surgery for symptomatic zzso zzso zzso were mainly seen within the first 2 years after zzso 

It is debatable whether the higher numbers of zzso or residual zzso can be justified by the slightly lower complication rates achieved with zzso zzso However, results have been improving over the zzso Moreover, the modifications observed on control magnetic resonance images justify the need for regular control imaging for at least the first 2 years zzso
