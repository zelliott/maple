zzso resonance imaging zzso enables accurate in zzso zzso of human muscle volumes, which can be used to estimate zzso muscle force zzso An important consideration is the amount of zzso and zzso tissue in the muscle zzso which will influence force zzso We zzso age-related differences in the proportion and distribution of zzso and zzso tissue in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and lateral heads of zzso muscles, and examined how well these volumes can be estimated from single zzso zzso zzso zzso of the left leg for 12 young zzso age 27 zzso and 12 older zzso zzso healthy, active adults were used to zzso muscle zzso zzso tissue distribution along the leg was characterized by mathematical functions to allow volume prediction from zzso zzso area zzso zzso Compared to young, older adults had less zzso volume and a greater proportion of zzso zzso In both age groups the proportion of zzso tissue increased zzso with the smallest proportion near the maximum compartment zzso A single zzso measurement predicted zzso volume with zzso error, with older adults in the higher end of this zzso Using multiple slices improved volume estimates by roughly zzso with average errors of about zzso These results demonstrate significant age-related differences in zzso tissue for the zzso and zzso zzso Although estimates of zzso volume can be obtained from single zzso zzso multiple slices are needed for increased accuracy due to zzso variations in muscle volume and zzso
