zzso represents a valuable tool for studying the amount and physical status of water in plants and agricultural products, for example, mushrooms zzso zzso zzso in zzso images originates from the mixed influence of the fundamental zzso zzso amongst others, zzso zzso and zzso relaxation zzso zzso of these parameters contain valuable anatomical and zzso zzso They can, however, be severely zzso depending on the combination of zzso settings and anatomy of the object under zzso The influence of the tissue structure of mushrooms, for example, tissue density zzso zzso and cell shape on the zzso zzso and zzso images is zzso This is achieved by vacuum zzso of the cavities in the zzso zzso structure with zzso solutions and acquiring zzso zzso Echo zzso It is demonstrated that the intrinsic long zzso values in the cap and outer zzso tissue strongly relate to the size and geometry of the highly zzso cells in these zzso zzso All observed zzso values are strongly affected by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso tissue is shorter than zzso of the cap and outer zzso probably because these cells are less zzso and smaller in zzso The calculated zzso images are not directly influenced by zzso zzso as long as the observed relaxation times remained sufficient zzso They reflect the water distribution in mushrooms best if short echo times are applied in a zzso echo imaging sequence at low magnetic field zzso
