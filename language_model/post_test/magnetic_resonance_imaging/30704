Participation of the primary motor zzso zzso in motor imagery was addressed using functional magnetic resonance imaging at zzso T and 2 zzso 2 zzso 4 zzso resolution in six right-handed zzso zzso comprised visually cued execution and imagination of a sequential zzso opposition task (12 zzso contrasted with motor rest and visual imagery (18 zzso zzso Motor execution activated zzso as well as other parts of the motor system including supplementary motor area zzso and zzso areas zzso In contrast, motor imagery did not lead to zzso in zzso except for zzso subjects but involved zzso and PM zzso as well as the anterior zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso analysis revealed a weak initial zzso signal increase in zzso in zzso zzso This novel finding of a transient response reflecting the onset of imagination which does not lead to sustained zzso zzso may explain previous contradictory zzso
