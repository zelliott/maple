One theory of normal cognitive aging asserts that decreases in simple processing speed mediate the age-related decline of fluid zzso Another possibility is that age-related zzso changes in frontal brain structures undermine the functioning of executive abilities, thereby producing the same zzso In this study, we used principal components analysis to derive a measure of zzso intelligence in 197 normal adults between 20 and 92 years of zzso zzso of zzso comparison speed, working memory, and executive ability, as well as regional brain volumes based on high resolution magnetic resonance imaging were obtained from a zzso of 112 zzso We then conducted a series of zzso multiple zzso analyses to test whether zzso the processing speed theory, zzso zzso theory, or zzso some combination of these best accounted for age-related variation in fluid zzso The results showed that zzso comparison speed, executive ability, and frontal lobe volume each made significant contributions to a zzso equation that explained 57% of the zzso in fluid zzso These findings suggest that both the processing speed and zzso theory of cognitive aging are partially correct and complement one zzso
