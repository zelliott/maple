The aim of this report was to determine the feasibility of fetal zzso during MR imaging and the safety of zzso MR imaging on the basis of fetal heart activity and fetal zzso 

Fetal zzso is feasible during MR imaging using modified standard zzso The use of zzso MR imaging appears to be safe and to have no negative short-term effects on the heart rate or movement zzso of healthy zzso fetuses under our experimental zzso
