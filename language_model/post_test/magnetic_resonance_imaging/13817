To obtain detailed zzso information on the zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle from magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso measures of the zzso of the zzso muscle at rest and during speech activities were zzso 

Prospective study using zzso of adult subjects with normal zzso mechanisms to determine zzso and zzso parameters of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso muscle was zzso at rest and during speech activities consisting of zzso and zzso sounds mixed with zzso zzso or both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Ten normal healthy adults (five men, five zzso between 21 and 53 years of age and free of zzso zzso 

zzso spin echo zzso images and dynamic fast zzso echo images of the zzso muscle in both the zzso and zzso zzso 

On average across female zzso and male zzso zzso distance between zzso muscle origin points, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso angle of zzso muscle origin at rest, zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso length of the zzso muscle at rest, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso muscle at lateral margin of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso muscle angle of origin and length became progressively smaller from rest, zzso zzso low zzso high zzso and zzso for both female and male zzso Across all subjects, there was a zzso reduction in length of the zzso muscle from rest position to zzso zzso 

zzso is an effective method of imaging and measuring the zzso muscle and related structures in living zzso zzso the normal tissue distribution and zzso of the zzso muscle provides important information for development of a functional zzso model of the zzso and for improved surgical zzso
