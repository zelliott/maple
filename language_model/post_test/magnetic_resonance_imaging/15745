Dynamic networking of brain regions is suggested to be one of the key factors involved in various brain zzso Central executive function typically requires instantaneous coordination among the zzso prefrontal regions and other distant regions, depending on the zzso task zzso In human zzso zzso zzso the zzso prefrontal area is estimated to be the current source of the zzso rhythm, while there is no direct evidence that the zzso rhythm is involved in the dynamic networking of central executive zzso Here we zzso that the central executive circuit over the prefrontal and zzso zzso is zzso linked by zzso zzso By using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso we zzso cortical circuits emerging with zzso phase synchronization during free pacing repeated zzso zzso phase synchronization in the scalp zzso was found to emerge at two major clusters of zzso pairs, between the right frontal and left zzso sites and between the frontal and right zzso zzso The phase synchronization of two clusters is accompanied by zzso responses in the cortical regions responsible for central executive function, working memory, visual imagery and cognitive action zzso Here we report the first evidence that zzso phase synchronization zzso coordinates the central executive zzso including the zzso prefrontal zzso and relevant cortical zzso
