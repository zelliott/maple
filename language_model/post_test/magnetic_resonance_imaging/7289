zzso zzso is considered to be one of the major factors causing zzso instability zzso zzso zzso is widely used to assess the severity of zzso zzso Additionally, in current literature, different quantitative parameters are recommended to distinguish between a normal zzso and a zzso zzso In order to achieve a more objective evaluation of the zzso the aim of this study was to evaluate whether specific zzso of the zzso zzso can be assigned to the qualitative zzso system of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso scans of 80 knees with symptomatic zzso and varying severity of zzso zzso were classified according to zzso zzso A to zzso For all zzso scans, quantitative zzso with parameters as described in the literature were zzso The values were then allocated to zzso zzso In addition to the zzso analysis, zzso analysis was also performed zzso type A against type zzso zzso on the zzso values, zzso sensitivity and zzso index for each zzso was zzso 

The allocation resulted in the following zzso type A zzso zzso zzso zzso 25, type B zzso zzso 23, type C zzso zzso 18 and type D zzso zzso zzso In descriptive statistics, none of the zzso proposed in the literature could be assigned to the zzso zzso system of zzso For the zzso analysis at the zzso sensitivity ranged from 75 to 86 % and specificity from 76 to 84 % for lateral zzso zzso zzso facet asymmetry and depth of zzso zzso All other zzso showed a poor sensitivity ranging from 49 to 67 % and specificity from 40 to 72 zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the measured parameters was fair to moderate zzso values zzso in high-grade zzso zzso zzso and substantial to almost perfect zzso values zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have shown to be of limited value for the assessment of zzso zzso None of the quantitative zzso of the zzso on zzso images could be assigned to the zzso descriptive zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso could not be reliably performed in high-grade zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso facet asymmetry and depth of zzso groove may help to distinguish between zzso and high-grade zzso
