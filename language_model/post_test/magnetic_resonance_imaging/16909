To determine the most useful findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso focal zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso of their zzso 

zzso or clinically proven 39 zzso from 25 patients and 79 zzso zzso from 51 patients were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in all cancer zzso zzso differences measured between zzso and zzso images for zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso findings zzso shape, signal intensity on zzso and zzso images, enhancement pattern on dynamic images, and target appearance on zzso zzso were compared between two groups via zzso zzso test as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values of two observers for zzso two groups were assessed before zzso 1) and after zzso 2) recognition of zzso 

Mean size difference zzso zzso in zzso between the two images was significantly greater than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso margin and zzso on zzso images were independently significant zzso findings zzso zzso zzso for zzso the two zzso All observers achieved a higher diagnostic accuracy in session 2 zzso and zzso than session 1 zzso and zzso with statistical significance in observer 2 zzso zzso zzso All observers had significantly higher sensitivities zzso and negative zzso values zzso zzso in session 2 than in session 1 zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

With the size change, an zzso margin and zzso on zzso images are the most useful findings for zzso zzso from zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso
