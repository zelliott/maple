zzso knife zzso zzso may be an alternative to open surgery for zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso but zzso and the zzso mechanisms of zzso are zzso zzso of visual field defects zzso after zzso may provide evidence of the extent of a zzso fixed zzso zzso occur in zzso of patients following open surgery for zzso 

This zzso prospective trial of zzso enrolled patients with unilateral zzso sclerosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were zzso to low (20 zzso or high (24 zzso doses delivered to the amygdala, zzso head, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained at 24 months after zzso Visual field zzso ratios zzso were calculated to zzso the degree of zzso zzso were contrasted with age, zzso dose and 50% zzso volume, peak volume of zzso change at the surgical target, quality of life zzso and seizure zzso 

No patients reported visual changes and no patients had abnormal bedside visual field zzso Fifteen zzso of 24 patients had zzso zzso all zzso superior zzso None of the zzso were consistent with injury to the zzso nerve or zzso Clinical diagnosis of zzso correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with seizure zzso had smaller (more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No other variables had significant zzso 

zzso appeared after zzso in proportions similar to historical comparisons from open surgery for zzso The nature of zzso was consistent with zzso of the zzso zzso The findings support the hypothesis that the mechanism of zzso involves some degree of tissue damage and is not confined entirely to functional changes in zzso
