To evaluate the zzso value of tumor zzso and pelvic zzso status assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in patients with zzso cervical cancer treated with radiation zzso 

zzso patients with intact zzso cervical zzso zzso treated with a combination of external zzso and zzso zzso therapy were zzso zzso zzso survival zzso pelvic control rate zzso and distant zzso rate zzso were analyzed by tumor diameter, volume, and pelvic zzso status assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso (AP) and lateral zzso tumor diameter significantly affected zzso The zzso zzso was zzso for patients with zzso 40 zzso in zzso diameter zzso and zzso for zzso or zzso 40 zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso Whereas PC was not zzso zzso was significantly affected by zzso tumor zzso zzso volume did not significantly affect any zzso Patients with enlarged pelvic zzso had significantly poorer outcome compared to those with none on PC, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tumor diameter and pelvic zzso zzso status assessed by zzso were the significant zzso factors in zzso cervical cancer treated with zzso zzso value of tumor volume should be zzso zzso with an appropriate imaging zzso zzso tumor diameter predominantly affected the zzso of distant zzso and zzso zzso status affected both pelvic control and distant zzso
