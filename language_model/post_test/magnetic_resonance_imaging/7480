This study aimed to assess zzso patterns and the zzso response to zzso stimulation in migraine with aura patients compared with zzso 

It has been proposed that altered visual motion processing in zzso and zzso visual areas is present in migraine patients and might play a role in the zzso of the zzso Besides zzso a large visual network, zzso stimulation in particular has been shown to provoke symptoms associated with zzso 

In this study, we examined the response to visual stimulation in 18 migraine with aura patients compared with 18 healthy controls by using functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional zzso zzso thereby assessing the zzso pattern of the visual areas zzso as well as the zzso zzso of the zzso cerebral zzso For zzso we used a vertically rotating zzso drum with complex colored zzso 

Group analysis of zzso with aura vs controls revealed different zzso patterns in functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the zzso right zzso with a significantly increased zzso in the left zzso complex, the left area zzso and the right zzso zzso Analysis of the visually evoked flow response of the cerebral blood flow zzso in the zzso cerebral artery showed a larger zzso of the offset zzso zzso and a reduced zzso of the decreasing slope on the left side zzso 

Combining examinations with a good structural zzso magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resolution is a novel approach to migraine zzso Our findings of an altered pattern of zzso by zzso visual stimulation with zzso in visual areas activated by motion perception zzso and zzso further strengthen the concept of an zzso zzso deficit in zzso This is zzso by the slower zzso of the visually evoked flow response after stimulus offset in migraine with aura zzso
