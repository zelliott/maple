Extremely zzso infants commonly show brain injury with long-term structural and functional zzso zzso zzso rat zzso share some similarities in terms of cerebral development with the very zzso infant (born at zzso weeks of zzso The aim of this study was to assess zzso the cerebral structural and zzso changes resulting from a moderate zzso hypoxic zzso injury in the zzso rat pup using zzso zzso zzso zzso and localized zzso H magnetic resonance zzso zzso The rats were scanned zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that the percentage of cortical loss in the long term correlated with size of damage 6 h after zzso male zzso being more affected than zzso The zzso profiles revealed an acute decrease of most of zzso zzso and an increase in zzso 24 h after zzso followed by a recovery phase leading to minor zzso changes at zzso in spite of an abnormal brain zzso Further, the increase of zzso concentration at zzso correlated with the cortical loss at zzso giving insight into the early prediction of long-term cerebral zzso following a moderate zzso insult that could be of interest in clinical zzso
