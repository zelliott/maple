We investigated the in zzso effects of a novel zzso 4 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in a mouse model of focal cerebral zzso using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso with zzso significantly reduced brain zzso associated with brain zzso as reflected by percentage of brain swelling volume zzso zzso zzso zzso in the treated group, compared to zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso and in the size of cortical zzso as reflected by the percentage of zzso zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso in the treated group, compared to zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso The study indicated the potential pharmacological use of zzso zzso in reducing brain zzso associated with focal zzso
