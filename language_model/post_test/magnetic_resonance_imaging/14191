As MR imaging allows evaluation of zzso structures not previously possible with imaging techniques, we undertook a preliminary study to evaluate the effects of a popular form of exercise zzso on the zzso The specific question prompting our investigation was, does repetitive impulse loading produced by zzso cause acute structural changes within the knee that are visible by MR zzso The knees of 10 healthy subjects were examined on a zzso MR system before and immediately after 30 zzso of continuous zzso The same zzso was examined each time, and the imaging sequences and photographic technique zzso zzso were identical for both zzso zzso developed in five of 10 subjects after zzso In addition, five of 10 subjects had subtle increased signal intensity within their zzso These results suggest that zzso frequently leads to acute changes in the knee that are visible on MR zzso The significance of these changes is zzso
