The aims of the present work were to build a zzso zzso heel pad model based on the anatomy revealed by MR imaging of a zzso heel pad, and to compare the zzso responses obtained from this model with those obtained from a zzso device used on the zzso heel zzso A 30 year-old European healthy female zzso zzso was enrolled in this zzso Her left foot underwent both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso model of the heel region was developed based on a zzso zzso solid model obtained by MR zzso The zzso fat pad tissue was described with a zzso model, while a zzso zzso model was formulated for the zzso zzso analyses were performed to interpret the mechanical response of heel zzso Different loading conditions were assumed according to experimental zzso The heel zzso showed a zzso zzso behavior and the zzso zzso followed a characteristic zzso zzso The energy dissipation ratios measured by experimental tests zzso at low strain rate and zzso at high strain zzso were comparable with those evaluated by finite element analyses zzso at low strain rate and zzso at high strain zzso The zzso and efficacy of the investigation performed was confirmed by the interpretation of the mechanical response of the heel zzso under different strain zzso The mean absolute percentage error between experimental data and model results was zzso at low strain rate and zzso at high strain zzso
