The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso for the minimally invasive treatment of liver zzso with regard to survival rates and local tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso under local zzso was carried out in zzso consecutive patients aged zzso zzso age zzso with a total of zzso liver zzso The major groups were liver zzso from zzso cancer zzso zzso and liver zzso from breast cancer (20 zzso as well as zzso of zzso primary tumors zzso zzso A total of 1048 laser applications were carried zzso zzso survival times were calculated using the zzso zzso All of the patients tolerated the procedure under local zzso well, and no severe complications or side effects were zzso During the follow-up period, 29 of the zzso patients treated zzso The mean survival time was 35 months in the zzso cancer group, 30 months in the breast cancer group, and 34 months in the group with zzso primary zzso The statistical assessment of the equality of survival distribution showed no significant differences between the three groups zzso test P zzso zzso zzso test P zzso zzso These results suggest that in patients with liver zzso local tumor destruction using minimally invasive zzso zzso under local zzso results in improved clinical zzso independently of the type of primary zzso
