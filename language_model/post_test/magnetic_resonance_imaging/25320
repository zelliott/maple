Patients with zzso disease zzso have more zzso activity on conventional zzso and increased focal zzso zzso zzso density zzso in delta and zzso zzso This activity concurs with zzso and reduced zzso and zzso rates, particularly in zzso zzso The relationship between functional and structural measures and their zzso capability to improve the diagnosis of zzso were assessed in this zzso 

zzso zzso recordings were obtained in 15 patients in whom the diagnosis of zzso had been made and in 16 healthy control subjects during a resting zzso MR imaging zzso data were also zzso these included global zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso in the delta and zzso bands was enhanced in the zzso group compared with the healthy control zzso zzso activity differed significantly between the groups in the zzso regions of both zzso Left zzso volume was correlated with left zzso and zzso delta zzso and left zzso zzso zzso A combination of left zzso volume and left zzso zzso zzso enabled correct zzso in zzso of the patients with zzso or control zzso 

zzso support the zzso role of zzso zzso as defined by zzso and zzso structural deficits shown on MR images in patients with zzso A multidisciplinary perspective of different techniques may improve our understanding of the disease and our diagnostic zzso
