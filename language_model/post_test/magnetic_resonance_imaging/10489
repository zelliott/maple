In contrast to the wealth of data describing the neural mechanisms underlying classical zzso we know remarkably little about the mechanisms involved in acquisition of explicit contingency zzso zzso zzso acquire contingency awareness in classical conditioning zzso in which they are able to describe the zzso relationship between a zzso cue and its zzso Previous studies have implicated the zzso and prefrontal zzso in the acquisition of explicit knowledge, although their specific roles remain zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to track the zzso acquisition of explicit knowledge in a concurrent trace and delay conditioning zzso We show that activity in bilateral middle frontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the accuracy of explicit contingency awareness on each zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso with zzso responses zzso by skin zzso responses zzso These results demonstrate that brain regions known to be involved in other aspects of learning and memory also play a specific role, reflecting on each trial the acquisition and representation of contingency zzso
