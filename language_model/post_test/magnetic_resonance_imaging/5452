The ability to detect and process errors made by others plays an important role is many social zzso The capacity to process errors is typically found to rely on sites in the zzso frontal zzso However, it remains to be determined whether responses at these sites are driven primarily by action errors themselves or by the affective consequences normally associated with their zzso Using an experimental paradigm that zzso action errors and the zzso of their affective consequences, we demonstrate that sites in the zzso frontal zzso zzso including the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso motor area zzso respond to action errors independent of the zzso of their zzso The strength of this response was zzso correlated with the zzso concern zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate a main effect of zzso by showing that errors committed by friends and zzso zzso significantly different zzso responses in a separate region of the middle anterior zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the way we look at others plays a critical role in determining patterns of brain zzso during error zzso These findings may have important implications for general theories of error zzso
