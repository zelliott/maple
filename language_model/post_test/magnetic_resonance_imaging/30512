The aim of this study was to evaluate the different zzso diagnoses in the early and late zzso period after zzso transplantation with dysfunctional zzso 

Due to unknown transplant dysfunction, 49 patients zzso 19 zzso received a total of 74 zzso zzso According to the date of examination all zzso studies were divided in an early zzso or zzso 60 days, zzso and a late zzso time period zzso 60 days, zzso All zzso studies were performed on zzso T zzso systems using a zzso imaging protocol consisting of a zzso zzso and zzso enhanced T zzso and T zzso zzso zzso a vascular zzso zzso zzso and a zzso part zzso zzso zzso zzso of diagnoses in zzso and zzso and diagnoses within each transplant time period were zzso 

zzso zzso studies were performed in zzso zzso in zzso In total 80 diagnoses were zzso Renal artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rejection zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), urinary zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso pathology zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Renal artery zzso was the most prevalent diagnosis in zzso and a more frequent finding in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso Renal zzso defects were more frequent in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso vascular diseases zzso zzso were more frequent zzso zzso zzso than zzso diseases zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that vascular diseases are a more frequent occurrence in the early zzso course after zzso transplantation than zzso zzso However, a transplant follow-up zzso study needs to contain a zzso vascular and functional imaging part to answer combined clinical zzso
