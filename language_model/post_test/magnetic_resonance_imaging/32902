The purpose of this paper is to describe imaging techniques and findings of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso is acquired by combining acceleration techniques with motion and signal suppression zzso The zzso findings should be interpreted based on coronary artery supply, zzso distribution, and comparison with zzso zzso In acute zzso diseases, such as acute zzso zzso and zzso the zzso is larger than zzso zzso whereas the zzso can be smaller than the zzso in some types of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso identifies zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso or intervention in the zzso and provides information complementary to zzso zzso
