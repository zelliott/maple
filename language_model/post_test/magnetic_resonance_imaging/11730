zzso zzso are usually associated with anatomical and possibly functional changes in the walls of small blood vessels zzso zzso The functional effect varies and is accompanied by cerebral zzso zzso zzso contrast, originated in the zzso (especially with ultra high magnetic fields) zzso in the end, on zzso changes and is useful for exploring patterns of cerebral zzso using zzso 

To compare the zzso zzso of the zzso signal and the distribution of zzso between a group of patients with no functional zzso following a stroke and a control group, by using zzso at zzso 

The stroke group showed a smaller number of zzso zzso but this was not statistically zzso The patterns of zzso size of the sensor motor area zzso or zzso and index of zzso were similar in both zzso In zzso the zzso response was zzso slower zzso zzso and zzso less (not statistically zzso 

We found no differences in the patterns of zzso of the two zzso This may be explained by the minimal zzso of the stroke group, which were insufficient to produce zzso changes or by the great variety of zzso The zzso response of the zzso response was different in the stroke group, probably as a result of the zzso in the zzso response in relation to the underlying processes which damage the functional properties of the vascular zzso This difference in the zzso response should be interpreted with caution, and borne in mind when interpreting zzso in persons with vascular zzso Further studies are necessary for better understanding of its zzso
