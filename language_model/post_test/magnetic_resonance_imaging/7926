The zzso is increasingly recognized to contribute to zzso functions, including zzso and zzso Although fear conditioning has been studied for zzso the zzso of anxiety, the putative role of the zzso is still zzso Fear conditioning could also be important in the zzso of chronic abdominal pain which often zzso with zzso zzso in this exploratory analysis, we investigated zzso anticipatory activity in the zzso in a visceral aversive fear conditioning paradigm using functional magnetic resonance zzso We extended and zzso a previous zzso for different learning zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso utilizing an advanced zzso method of the zzso In 30 healthy humans, visual zzso stimuli zzso were paired with painful zzso zzso as zzso stimuli zzso while other visual stimuli zzso were presented without zzso During zzso all zzso were presented without zzso whereas during zzso a single, zzso US was zzso During zzso zzso zzso areas including zzso I, zzso II, and zzso and parts of the zzso nucleus were activated in response to the zzso compared to the zzso During zzso zzso related to zzso presentation was detected in zzso I, zzso II, IV, zzso zzso zzso IX, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were found in zzso I, zzso II, IV, zzso and zzso We could show for the first time that the zzso is involved in abdominal zzso zzso learning zzso Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of the zzso in aversive learning and memory processes relevant to the zzso of chronic abdominal zzso
