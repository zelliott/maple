Cellular zzso with a reporter gene offers the opportunity to track small numbers of tumor cells and to study zzso processes in their earliest zzso stages in the target zzso of zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the MR reporter zzso for the zzso imaging and zzso of zzso melanoma cells in the zzso zzso zzso of living zzso A zzso zzso melanoma cell line expressing human zzso heavy chain zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso was constructed to allow the detection of cells by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso melanoma cells was feasible and showed no cellular zzso In addition, zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso yielding significant changes in zzso relative to control zzso In zzso nude mice, the presence of zzso and zzso zzso melanoma cells in zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated as areas of low zzso on zzso but the same zzso were not visible by zzso imaging because the light was unable to penetrate the zzso Furthermore, the zzso volume of each zzso which was assessed by cumulative zzso analysis of the zzso zzso data, correlated well with tumor burden, which was determined by zzso zzso zzso This study is the first to use zzso and an MR reporter gene for both the zzso and zzso of zzso cancer cells in zzso
