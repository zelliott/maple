A zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence is implemented on a clinical scanner to acquire multiple images with zzso contrast of the knee zzso of six healthy human zzso The zzso sequence produces images with zzso contrast with an additional factor of intrinsic zzso zzso which zzso direct measurement of zzso A method is presented to compensate the zzso data with regard to zzso in an effort to accurately calculate zzso zzso maps in a feasible experimental zzso The zzso zzso zzso maps produced errors in the measurement of zzso in healthy zzso cartilage of approximately zzso compared to the gold standard measurement of zzso acquired with zzso zzso pulse zzso The zzso sequence has potential as an important clinical tool for the acquisition of zzso zzso images and/or quantitative zzso zzso zzso
