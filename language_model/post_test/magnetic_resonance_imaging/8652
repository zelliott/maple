Patients with zzso syndrome have an increased risk of cardiac death caused by zzso zzso Consensus has not been reached about the best method to image the zzso in this zzso 

This present study zzso zzso to evaluate zzso and abdominal zzso dimensions by two-dimensional echo zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso to assess agreement between zzso and zzso zzso 

Among 75 zzso proven zzso syndrome patients, 59 zzso zzso age: 22 zzso 7 zzso underwent a zzso and an zzso study of the zzso and zzso abdominal zzso The zzso root zzso the zzso zzso junction zzso the first part of the ascending zzso zzso zzso the zzso arch zzso the descending zzso zzso zzso a few zzso below the zzso and the abdominal zzso zzso were zzso The zzso and Altman method and Lin's zzso correlation zzso were zzso to compare zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso feasibility of zzso imaging by zzso was identical at zzso level, but lower when measuring zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso level versus zzso The zzso and zzso showed a very slight difference between zzso and a high zzso correlation zzso at the level of zzso and zzso correlations were weaker at the other zzso zzso Absolute differences calculated at each measurement level showed that zzso zzso as differences within 1 zzso between zzso and zzso absolute zzso was highest at zzso zzso and zzso zzso level and lowest at zzso zzso zzso The zzso overestimated zzso arch diameters in approximately zzso of cases, whereas at the remaining zzso levels zzso zzso were usually 1 zzso higher compared to the corresponding zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso was found to be very good at the zzso and zzso zzso Because the risk of zzso complication is higher when zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso may be considered a useful method to screen for zzso disease and a good choice to follow zzso zzso dimensions over time in zzso syndrome zzso
