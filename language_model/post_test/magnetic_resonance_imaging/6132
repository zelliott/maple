This paper presents an evaluation of a zzso diffuse optical zzso zzso zzso zzso women with 18 breast zzso (10 invasive zzso 2 zzso and 6 benign zzso diameters zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso A substantial fraction of the original 36 recruited patients could not be examined using this zzso due to technical zzso A region of interest zzso was drawn at the zzso position as derived from zzso and at the mirror image site in the zzso healthy zzso zzso were assessed zzso and zzso by two observers independently in two separate zzso zzso and zzso agreements were calculated using zzso statistics zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso values for presence of zzso were determined by receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso agreements were excellent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso agreements were good to excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values for presence of zzso were zzso and zzso for quantitative and qualitative zzso analysis, zzso This zzso system has the potential to discriminate zzso from benign breast tissue in a zzso qualitative and quantitative zzso Important technical improvements are required before this technique is ready for clinical zzso
