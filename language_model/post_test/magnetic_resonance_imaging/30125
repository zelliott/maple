The purpose of our study was to compare the detection rate of bone manifestations of multiple myeloma in zzso zzso compared with zzso and to assess accuracy in zzso 

zzso patients with zzso confirmed myeloma were zzso examined with a zzso zzso protocol and zzso zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso protocol consisted of zzso zzso and STIR zzso For data analysis, the entire skeleton was divided into 61 regions per zzso Image evaluation was performed in a consensus reading by two zzso blinded to the patients' history, with separate evaluation of each zzso The patients were staged by zzso and zzso data separately according to the zzso and zzso PLUS staging zzso 

On zzso 15 patients showed no zzso In 26 patients, zzso regions were zzso 21 patients were stage I, two were stage II, and 18 were stage zzso On zzso 19 patients showed no zzso In 22 patients, zzso regions were zzso For the detection rate, zzso was statistically superior to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signed rank zzso According to zzso 25 patients were stage I, seven were stage II, and nine were stage zzso In 21 patients with involvement detected on both methods, zzso showed more extensive disease than zzso Eleven patients were zzso with zzso compared with zzso which was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso leads to a significantly lower detection rate and staging in patients with multiple zzso
