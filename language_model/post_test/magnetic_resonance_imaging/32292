To establish a protocol for zzso minimally invasive surgical access to the zzso joint zzso 

This study involved 2 patients with zzso pain and zzso motion zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso was obtained and loaded into an zzso navigation system to guide joint space zzso With a zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso G-F 20 was directly injected into the superior and inferior joint spaces under navigation zzso 

With the assistance of an zzso navigational system, the zzso zzso images were zzso in 3 dimensions and enabled guiding a needle into the superior and inferior joint spaces for therapeutic zzso The treatment outcome for both patients was satisfactory with improvement in pain score and zzso zzso 

A protocol for zzso minimally invasive surgical access to the zzso was zzso This could provide the technical basis for evaluation of accurate joint space intervention as a form of treatment of appropriate zzso zzso
