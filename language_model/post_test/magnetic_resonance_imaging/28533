To determine the reliability and the measuring agreement between two zzso in the identification of relevant structures of prostate anatomy in patients with prostate zzso 

15 patients with prostate zzso proved by zzso underwent MR Imaging on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were used in the depiction of important zzso structures for diagnosing prostate zzso 5 sequences of every patient were evaluated for 5 times by each zzso zzso was proved by the zzso correlation zzso and the measuring agreement was proved by Cohen's zzso zzso 

Only the zzso sequence was of sufficient sensitivity to reach a moderate reliability zzso zzso zzso and a moderate measurement agreement between the two readers zzso zzso zzso 

For the evaluation of MR images in staging prostate zzso besides the zzso and the measuring agreement, the reliability of the zzso is the important zzso
