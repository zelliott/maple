To establish normal values for the different parameters that characterize the zzso fluid zzso flow dynamics in the aqueduct of zzso zzso flow, volume per cycle, and zzso zzso obtained from zzso MR images using a reliable and zzso zzso zzso The zzso semiautomatic method eliminates zzso zzso and zzso errors due to low zzso movements, zzso and the partial volume zzso 

We studied 42 healthy subjects without neurological or cerebrovascular disease or disturbances in zzso zzso Images were acquired on a zzso T MR scanner using a zzso zzso All images were acquired during the same time frame zzso to zzso to avoid zzso zzso 

we obtained normal values for each of the parameters that characterize zzso dynamics in the aqueduct zzso zzso and zzso zzso mean zzso maximum zzso and zzso flow, mean flow, production rate, and stroke zzso Although trends were noted, neither sex nor age zzso 25, zzso zzso years old) had a statistically significant effect on any zzso zzso or zzso 

Although zzso of zzso flow dynamics zzso are sensitive to various factors zzso and spatial resolutions of the MR zzso zzso zzso age, sex, and MR equipment zzso an zzso zzso method enables reliable and zzso values and ranges for normal subjects to be zzso
