zzso disease is a rare disorder characterized zzso by zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso Our goal was to describe the CT, zzso and zzso zzso PET findings in a series of patients with this zzso 

We zzso reviewed the imaging studies of 10 patients with zzso confirmed zzso disease who were treated in our institution between January 2004 and December zzso 

We found the following areas of general zzso three zzso seven head and neck, and three zzso with some patients having more than one zzso zzso sites of involvement included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso 3; neck zzso zzso zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso zzso zzso 3; zzso zzso zzso 1; skin, zzso zzso 1; spinal zzso zzso zzso 2; zzso body, zzso zzso 1; and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of the involved areas were generally zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion zzso to gray matter, and intensely enhancing with zzso zzso contrast zzso CT images generally showed the zzso were zzso to gray matter and intensely zzso zzso PET showed variable zzso with zzso and zzso disease generally being zzso avid and other sites zzso 

zzso disease has a zzso imaging appearance but most frequently presents as neck zzso The disease is frequently zzso and a diagnosis in one area should prompt suspicion that other sites may be involved zzso
