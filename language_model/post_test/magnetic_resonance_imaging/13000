To investigate the diagnostic value of MR imaging in cervical spinal canal zzso combined with spinal zzso zzso 

From August 1998 to May 2008, 41 patients with cervical spinal canal zzso and spinal zzso injury were treated, including 34 males and 7 females aged zzso years zzso zzso years, 27 patients being older than 60 zzso zzso zzso data were zzso zzso zzso was caused by falling from height in 8 cases, traffic accident in 19 cases, crush due to heavy objects in 3 cases and other reasons in 11 zzso The time from injury to operation ranged from 2 hours to 3 zzso There were 12 cases of anterior spinal zzso injury syndrome, 23 of central spinal zzso syndrome and 6 of zzso zzso zzso score of spinal zzso function was zzso points zzso zzso zzso 

MR imaging diagnosis before operation showed abnormal signal changes within the spinal zzso in 37 cases (41 zzso anterior and zzso zzso ligaments and discs zzso injury in 28 cases (30 zzso and signal of zzso and zzso signals in anterior surface of cervical spines zzso in 34 cases zzso zzso Diagnosis during operation revealed zzso raises, zzso tears of zzso soft tissue in 18 cases (20 zzso appendix fracture in 6 cases (7 zzso formation of zzso in 20 cases zzso zzso zzso injury in 34 cases (44 zzso zzso instability without the zzso of ligament and zzso disc in 7 cases (10 zzso zzso difference was evident between the zzso diagnosis before operation and the zzso discoveries zzso zzso zzso 

The MR imaging diagnosis before operation do not zzso to the zzso zzso indicating that zzso diagnosis fails to make a relatively comprehensive and accurate zzso So it is zzso to make a diagnosis based on clinical zzso
