The clinical assessment of the response of zzso to zzso treatment is usually defined using zzso evaluation zzso For zzso zzso zzso isolated limb zzso with zzso and zzso zzso yields high response zzso Based on our experience, we assume that zzso zzso response criteria are insufficient to assess the degree of zzso after zzso 

The clinical response of 35 zzso to zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso anatomical criteria, and zzso were identified according to the established zzso The same tumors were investigated for pathological response according to the zzso zzso scale zzso zzso and reviewed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

None of the clinical response criteria were able to reliably identify the zzso zzso The extent of size changes showed no association with the pathological degree of zzso The number of clinical zzso was low compared with the number of pathological zzso zzso N zzso 1, WHO N zzso 3, zzso N zzso 3, pathology N zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso and/or zzso zzso was more frequently observed in zzso zzso zzso and was associated with an increase in tumor size after zzso Furthermore, we identified the zzso zzso of zzso to be more significantly strongly associated with zzso shrinkage than zzso 

zzso clinical response evaluation is insufficient to assess clinical response in zzso zzso The size changes of tumors after therapy reflect the type of zzso rather than the extent of zzso
