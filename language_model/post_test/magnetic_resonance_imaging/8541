To compare the contours and zzso zzso zzso of the tumor and zzso at risk zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in cervical cancer zzso 

Ten patients underwent both zzso and CT after zzso zzso The dose received by at least zzso of the volume zzso the minimal target dose zzso the volume treated to the prescription dose or greater for tumor for the high-risk zzso and zzso zzso clinical target volume zzso and the dose to zzso zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso for the zzso were zzso A standardized approach to zzso on CT zzso was developed, implemented zzso and zzso and compared with the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and total volume zzso as determined by either CT or zzso were not significantly different compared with the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso differed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso this resulted in statistically significant differences in the volume treated to the prescription dose or greater zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the zzso zzso values on zzso zzso zzso differed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso and CT zzso values of the dose to zzso zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso for the zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso scans at zzso are adequate for zzso zzso zzso However, CT tumor contours can significantly overestimate the tumor zzso resulting in significant differences in the zzso zzso and volume treated to the prescription dose or greater for the zzso compared with that using zzso zzso remains the standard for zzso zzso
