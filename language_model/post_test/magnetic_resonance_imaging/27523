zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a vascular zzso agent known to mediate its effects primarily on tumor blood zzso zzso has previously been shown to induce a significant increase in mean zzso blood pressure and in zzso concentration in zzso In the present study, we examined whether this is associated with a general leakage of water into certain zzso or with changes in zzso water zzso zzso rats received either zzso (30 zzso body zzso or saline zzso as a zzso zzso One hour later, zzso concentration and mean blood pressure increased zzso zzso showed no significant changes in tissue water content following zzso zzso However, urine output and salt zzso increased 1 h after zzso treatment, without changes in urinary and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso levels in kidney inner zzso did not change 1 h after zzso treatment, but zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution within the collecting ducts of zzso rats compared with the characteristic zzso zzso in control zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso cause disruption of zzso and a weaker zzso labeling of zzso in collecting duct principal cells within 1 zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that water escapes from the vascular system after zzso treatment, and it may take place primarily through a zzso zzso The zzso increase in urine output seems to be a local effect in the collecting ducts due to reduced zzso trafficking to the zzso plasma zzso
