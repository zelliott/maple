The authors report the results of zzso testing and initial clinical application of a zzso iron oxide specifically prepared as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the gastrointestinal zzso MR imaging was performed at zzso and zzso T in 15 zzso Images of the upper abdomen and pelvis were obtained before and after zzso of the contrast material at doses of zzso zzso of iron in zzso zzso Two readers scored the zzso zzso of contrast material into the zzso and zzso small zzso with obvious loss of signal intensity zzso zzso was achieved in all zzso zzso images showed improved zzso of the head and tail of the zzso anterior margins of the zzso and zzso zzso The contrast agent did not generate artifacts, an improvement over zzso zzso evaluated previously in zzso Except for a brief episode of zzso in five subjects, the agent was well zzso Use of this contrast agent improved the diagnostic quality of abdominal MR images by enabling the distinction of the zzso from zzso structures at zzso that did not produce image zzso
