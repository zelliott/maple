Novel word learning is central to the flexibility inherent in the human language zzso Word learning may partially depend on long-term memory formation during the assembly of zzso representations from zzso zzso In the present study, zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso examined the contributions of zzso zzso component of the verbal working memory zzso zzso assembly and word zzso zzso were scanned while making syllable decisions about visually presented familiar zzso and novel zzso and zzso words, a task that required retrieval and analysis of existing zzso codes or the assembly and analysis of novel zzso zzso revealed that left inferior prefrontal zzso zzso and bilateral zzso zzso were zzso engaged during the processing of novel words, suggesting that this circuit is recruited during zzso zzso A subsequent memory analysis that examined the relation between zzso signal and the zzso ability to later remember the words (a measure of effective memory zzso revealed that the magnitude of zzso in zzso bilateral superior zzso and left inferior zzso zzso was positively correlated with later zzso Moreover, although the magnitude of the subsequent memory effect in zzso zzso was not significantly affected by word type, this effect was greater in zzso zzso for novel zzso than for familiar zzso zzso In the course of zzso the assembly of novel word zzso the zzso zzso control component of the zzso system appears to play a central role in the zzso of novel words into long-term zzso
