The aim of the present study was to examine quantitative differences in zzso cerebral cortical volumes in a healthy adult zzso zzso zzso zzso of whole brain, cerebral and zzso volumes was performed in a zzso analysis of 97 normal volunteers, with segmented zzso zzso zzso and zzso cortical volumes measured in a zzso of 60 subjects, 30 male and 30 female, matched for age and zzso The right cerebral zzso was larger than the left across the study group with a small zzso but significant difference in symmetry zzso No difference was found between volumes of right and left zzso zzso zzso cerebral cortical asymmetry zzso larger than left) was found to be significant across all zzso except zzso Males had greater zzso zzso and cerebral cortical zzso volumes than zzso zzso male cerebral cortical volumes were seen in all zzso except for left zzso zzso had greater left zzso to left cerebral zzso and smaller left zzso to left cerebral zzso zzso There was a mild reduction in cerebral volumes with age, more marked in zzso This study confirms and zzso past work indicating underlying structural zzso in the human brain, and provides further evidence that brain structures in humans are zzso sensitive to the effects of both age and zzso
