We used zzso to establish whether attention to touch enhances zzso cortical zzso zzso received zzso and visual stimulation and were instructed to attend selectively to one zzso during alternating stimulus detection periods zzso with rest periods during which no stimulus was zzso The maximum signal change for each task versus rest was measured in zzso defined regions of interest for each zzso zzso touch produced greater signal change than unattended touch in primary zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the conclusions of some previous studies, we found that the enhancement of zzso with attention was at least as great in zzso as in zzso The zzso effect was unilateral in zzso and bilateral in zzso and the zzso zzso
