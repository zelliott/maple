The assessment of three-dimensional zzso zzso valve geometry in patients with chronic functional zzso zzso valve zzso zzso has been hampered by a lack of adequate imaging zzso The study aim was to use a clinically zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique to assess the 3-D zzso zzso leaflet and zzso muscle geometry in pigs with chronic zzso 

Ten pigs with moderate chronic zzso induced by zzso zzso of the zzso artery, were examined using cardiac zzso The reconstruction of 3-D data from two-dimensional cardiac zzso scans allowed the zzso zzso and leaflet zzso to be zzso Using 3-D zzso scans, the spatial position of the zzso zzso muscle zzso relative to the anterior zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso Using dedicated software for image analysis, data were transferred to a Cartesian coordinate system zzso for geometric zzso Ten healthy pigs served as zzso 

Compared to controls, at zzso in the chronic zzso group the zzso was significantly displaced zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso 2 versus 23 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 versus 36 zzso 1 zzso and zzso (41 zzso versus 33 zzso 1 zzso There was no significant zzso zzso displacement (20 zzso 2 versus 20 zzso 1 zzso The zzso area zzso zzso 90 versus zzso zzso 90 zzso zzso distance zzso zzso 2 versus 26 zzso 1 zzso zzso distance zzso zzso 2 versus 33 zzso 1 zzso mean zzso height (8 zzso 1 versus 5 zzso 0 zzso maximum zzso height (10 zzso 1 versus 7 zzso 0 zzso zzso volume zzso zzso 400 versus 1,500 zzso 200 zzso and zzso leaflet area zzso zzso 110 versus zzso zzso 70 zzso were each significantly zzso 

This clinically zzso cardiac zzso zzso permitted a detailed geometric insight to be made into the zzso zzso leaflet and zzso zzso that cause zzso Such a reliable tool for geometric zzso valve analysis has previously been demonstrated only by using invasive zzso zzso this approach holds promise for further clarifying the zzso of chronic zzso and improving zzso surgical zzso
