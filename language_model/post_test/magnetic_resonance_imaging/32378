Cases of infected zzso zzso are scarce and detailed surgical anatomical descriptions are hardly found in zzso The clinical, zzso and surgical findings in four cases of an infected zzso zzso located at the lower spine are presented to zzso the pathological anatomical zzso 

The first case showed two zzso zzso with a parallel course zzso and zzso ending in a zzso of cavities connected to the zzso In this case, as well as in the fourth case, the signs and symptoms were those of zzso The second case presented with meningitis and a zzso zzso while the third case presented with an zzso zzso at the junction between the zzso and the zzso This child probably showed signs and symptoms of zzso involvement as early as during zzso 

The anatomy of the nervous elements in this zzso anomaly is heavily zzso more particularly in case of infection, due to extensive zzso zzso The latter renders dissection zzso and recognition of anatomical details difficult, resulting in complete zzso of a zzso zzso in less than half of the zzso Despite their zzso in zzso most cases of an infected zzso zzso show similar characteristic zzso
