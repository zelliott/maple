zzso speech is a zzso highly zzso zzso but it preserves the zzso envelope of zzso Listeners vary considerably in their ability to adapt to this zzso speech zzso Here, we zzso that individual differences in adaptation to zzso speech should be predictable by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We tested 18 zzso participants in a short-term zzso zzso paradigm zzso to 100 zzso zzso zzso auditory skills were assessed using zzso zzso zzso rate discrimination, where zzso rates were zzso on the zzso rate of 4 zzso Working memory capacities were evaluated zzso span and zzso zzso and structural zzso scans were examined for anatomical zzso of zzso speech learning using zzso zzso Listeners who learned faster to understand zzso speech also showed smaller thresholds in the AM discrimination zzso This ability to adjust to zzso speech is zzso reflected zzso in increased zzso matter volume in an area of the left zzso zzso that is strongly connected to the auditory and prefrontal zzso Thus, individual zzso auditory skills and left zzso zzso matter volume can predict how quickly a listener adapts to zzso zzso
