zzso in zzso imaging zzso have been commonly described in transient global zzso zzso We investigated a possible relationship between brain zzso and zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso and carotid zzso zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso within 24 hours of zzso onset (including zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso was repeated at 48 to 96 hours (21 zzso and 30 days (18 zzso 

zzso zzso were observed in 16 patients zzso and were not attributable to zzso zzso zzso zzso or underlying zzso zzso zzso performed between 12 and 72 hours showed the highest frequency of zzso zzso zzso No pathological findings were observed at 30 zzso 

These results suggest that zzso is not related to cerebral zzso zzso
