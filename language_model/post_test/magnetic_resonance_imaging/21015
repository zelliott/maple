Multiple channel zzso zzso zzso are being used in magnetic resonance imaging to investigate a number of active research topics, including transmit zzso and zzso zzso zzso the cost and availability of multiple channel zzso restricts their use to relatively few zzso This paper describes the development and testing of a relatively inexpensive transmit system that can be easily duplicated by users with a reasonable level of zzso hardware design zzso The system described here consists of 64 channels, each with 100 W peak output zzso The hardware is modular at the level of four channels, easily accommodating larger or smaller channel zzso zzso aspects of the system include the use of zzso zzso to replace more complex zzso direct digital zzso 100 W zzso zzso amplifiers with partial zzso matching networks, and the use of digital zzso to replace more complex and costly zzso zzso to control the zzso and phase of each zzso Although mainly designed for zzso zzso the system is capable of dynamic zzso necessary for transmit zzso by replacing the digital zzso controlling the zzso zzso with commercially available analog output zzso The system design is discussed in detail and bench and imaging data are zzso demonstrating the ability to perform phase and zzso control for zzso zzso as well as dynamic zzso for zzso complex zzso zzso
