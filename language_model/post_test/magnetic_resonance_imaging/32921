zzso zzso zzso to tones that are zzso are reduced in their magnitude in comparison with zzso to tones that are zzso zzso This phenomenon has been taken as evidence for an zzso copy of the motor command acting to suppress the sensory zzso However, zzso provides a strong zzso cue for the stimulus which might also contribute to the zzso suppression for zzso zzso The current experiment sought to investigate the suppression of zzso tones by zzso zzso and also whether the addition of zzso enhanced this zzso Lastly, the experiment sought to investigate the zzso of the zzso suppression via presenting these zzso tones to each ear zzso We examined source zzso extracted from the zzso auditory zzso and measured the zzso of the zzso and zzso components by zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the zzso of either the zzso or the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant zzso effect on the zzso being significantly larger zzso to the ear of zzso There was no interaction between zzso and side of the zzso cue or side of zzso suggesting that the effects of zzso and zzso zzso are equal zzso We conclude that a significant proportion of zzso suppression by zzso is a result of inherent zzso zzso
