The functional specificity of the brain region known as the Visual Word Form Area zzso was examined using zzso We explored whether this area serves a general role in processing symbolic zzso rather than being selective for the processing of zzso Brain activity was measured during a visual zzso task to English words, meaningful symbols zzso zzso zzso digits, words in an unfamiliar language zzso and geometric control zzso Mean activity in the functionally defined zzso as well as a pattern of zzso activity identified using a zzso technique, did not differ for words and zzso but was distinguished from that seen with other zzso However, functional connectivity analysis of this region identified a network of regions that was specific to words, including the left zzso left lateral zzso and left prefrontal zzso zzso support the hypothesis that activity in the zzso plays a general role in processing abstract zzso however, the left zzso is part of a unique network of brain regions active only during the word zzso These findings suggest that it is the neural zzso of the zzso zzso the broader activity distributed in the brain that is correlated with zzso that is specific for visual word zzso not activity in this brain region per zzso
