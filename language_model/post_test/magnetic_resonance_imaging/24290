Motor intentional disorders zzso are characterized by dysfunction in the preparation, zzso zzso and termination of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated zzso whether patients with right zzso strokes zzso and left zzso strokes zzso differ in the frequency of delayed action initiation zzso and motor zzso zzso whether there is a directional or zzso component of zzso or motor zzso zzso whether there is an association between the presence of zzso neglect and tests for zzso and zzso the location of injury associated with zzso 

zzso patients with acute unilateral stroke (21 with zzso and 11 with zzso and 12 zzso healthy controls participated in the zzso To determine the presence and severity of directional and spatial zzso and zzso we used a new apparatus, the zzso Movement Tester zzso While being tested with the zzso the participants held a zzso bar located either in the right or left zzso using either their right or left hand and upon stimulus onset pushed the bar either zzso or rightward and maintained a given force for 10 zzso 

The frequency of zzso and zzso was higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group, but there were no zzso directional or spatial zzso The zzso group did demonstrate left zzso directional zzso but there were no spatial zzso of zzso Signs of zzso neglect were not associated with these measures of zzso Participants with frontal or zzso zzso were significantly more likely to demonstrate zzso and zzso than those with zzso zzso
