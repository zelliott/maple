The aims of this study were to zzso determine carotid zzso zzso type and distribution and to evaluate the zzso of determining zzso types in zzso patients with moderate zzso and moderate carotid artery zzso zzso using zzso 

zzso zzso patients with moderate CA zzso underwent bilateral carotid zzso in a zzso scanner using a protocol that generated 4 contrast weightings zzso zzso zzso density, and zzso time of zzso zzso American Heart Association criteria were used to evaluate zzso types at 3 locations zzso and internal CA zzso and zzso zzso and CA zzso and at the minimum zzso zzso Two identical MR scans were conducted to evaluate zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso types were obtained from 230 zzso Type III zzso occurred most commonly, followed by types zzso zzso zzso zzso VI zzso and zzso zzso Type III was more commonly distributed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Type zzso was more commonly distributed in the zzso zzso zzso and at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were available at the site of minimum zzso zzso type III zzso zzso zzso VI zzso and zzso zzso There was good agreement of zzso types between both zzso scans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso can determine zzso types zzso as well as the distribution of zzso in zzso patients with moderate CA zzso A wide range of zzso types, including advanced zzso were found in these zzso
