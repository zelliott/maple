A challenge for cognitive zzso is to determine how the prefrontal zzso zzso contributes to the cognitive control operations that oversee thought and zzso We studied the effects of damage to the lateral zzso in two types of zzso zzso zzso performed a choice reaction time task that required attention switching and processing zzso The performance of individuals with zzso or zzso zzso damage was compared with that of zzso and young control zzso zzso to the lateral zzso did not significantly impair the switch from attending to one color to attending to zzso zzso damage did, however, significantly increase the effects of zzso zzso implicating the lateral zzso in processing zzso Individual subjects' performance suggested that the left inferior zzso zzso was the most critical for processing zzso Our data are consistent with the view that the lateral zzso contributes to the zzso control of the information flow along pathways from sensory input to motor zzso
