We zzso zzso zzso for acquisition of biological information at different object levels, zzso in zzso detection and ex zzso validation for characterizing tumor zzso Fluorescent magnetic zzso zzso were zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and fluorescent zzso acid through an zzso process, is capable of zzso and maintaining a high zzso fluorescent intensity in zzso zzso zzso can be used as a fluorescent zzso that simultaneously and efficiently encapsulates zzso to exhibit fluorescent and magnetic properties as well as maintaining high zzso zzso we proved that our biologically zzso zzso were prominent zzso imaging zzso by showing not only excellent MR sensitivity but also high zzso intensity with strong signal strength under short exposure time of zzso light from the extensive imaging studies of in zzso and ex zzso using zzso and zzso mice zzso
