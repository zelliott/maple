The increasing number of zzso plate systems used to treat zzso radius fractures carries with it the problem of determining the optimal fixation for unstable zzso Our goal was to analyze the clinical and zzso outcomes of patients with zzso unstable zzso radius fractures treated with a zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso clinical study; retrospective zzso 

Level 1 university trauma zzso 

Over a mean zzso period zzso 12 to 27 zzso 141 consecutive patients were treated for an unstable zzso displaced zzso radius fracture of which 114 or zzso were followed for 1 year or zzso 

Open reduction and zzso internal fixation with a zzso plate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for surgical treatment was the inability to obtain or maintain fracture or zzso alignment after initial closed zzso 

In a follow-up period, which had to be longer than 12 months, objective and zzso functional results zzso range of zzso zzso Disabilities of the zzso zzso and Hand zzso zzso visual analog scale zzso Green and O'Brien zzso and zzso assessment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fracture zzso were zzso zzso for complications were given special zzso 

In the 114 patients followed for a minimum of 12 months, there were 21 men and 93 women with a mean age of 57 years (17 to 79 zzso zzso were classified according to the zzso zzso system as type zzso zzso zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso zzso C1 zzso zzso 24), C2 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The modified Green and O'Brien zzso revealed 31 excellent, 54 good, 23 fair, and 6 poor zzso Active wrist motion averaged 54 degrees extension zzso as compared with the zzso zzso and 46 degrees zzso zzso as compared with the zzso zzso The average zzso was 81 degrees zzso as compared with the zzso zzso and the average zzso was 82 degrees zzso as compared with the zzso zzso Mean grip strength at final follow-up was zzso of the zzso zzso Low residual pain values in the wrist were zzso 81 patients zzso were pain free, 17 patients zzso had mild pain, 10 patients zzso had moderate pain, and 6 patients zzso had severe zzso The DASH score averaged 13 points zzso 0 to 39 zzso zzso union was achieved in all zzso A mean loss of zzso tilt of zzso degrees zzso 0 to 8 zzso zzso inclination of zzso degrees zzso 0 to 2 zzso and of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 0 to 6 zzso was zzso The overall complication rate was zzso zzso The most frequent problems were zzso and zzso zzso irritation zzso of the total number of zzso including 2 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tendon, 2 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tendon, 4 cases of zzso zzso zzso and 9 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso tunnel syndrome was observed in 3 patients, and complex regional pain syndrome occurred in 5 zzso In 2 cases, loosening of a single screw was zzso Delayed fracture union occurred in 3 patients, and zzso zzso screw displacement was recognized in 1 zzso Neither clinical outcome nor complication rate were dependent on fracture type zzso versus zzso 

zzso of unstable zzso displaced zzso radius fractures with a fixed angle plate provides sufficient stability with minimal loss of zzso Nevertheless, very zzso zzso plate position can interfere with the zzso zzso system, too long screws can penetrate the zzso zzso and zzso screws in zzso fracture patterns can cut through the zzso bone and penetrate into the zzso zzso Mindful of these problems, we consider that the complex fracture pattern of an unstable zzso radius fracture cannot be treated by a single plate system and zzso
