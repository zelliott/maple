We investigated the association of 2 markers of zzso dysfunction, tissue zzso zzso zzso and Von zzso factor zzso with cerebral blood flow zzso in zzso older participants at high risk for cardiovascular zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were measured at zzso Participants underwent 2 successive brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, first at baseline and the then after a mean follow-up of 33 zzso Total zzso was determined in each scan and also standardized for brain zzso zzso At zzso higher zzso was associated with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, higher levels of zzso were associated with a steeper decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no association between zzso and decrease in zzso These associations were independent of zzso and cardiovascular zzso In conclusion, elevated markers of zzso dysfunction are associated with lower zzso in older adults at risk for cardiovascular zzso
