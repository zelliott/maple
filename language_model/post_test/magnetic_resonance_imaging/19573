To determine whether brain zzso have different signal zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images in 56 zzso normal patients (27 male and 29 female zzso age range, zzso years; mean age, 47 zzso were evaluated zzso zzso signal zzso in the amygdala, zzso zzso zzso zzso area, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lobe were graded relative to cortical signal intensity in the frontal zzso zzso ratios were compared for each cortical zzso 

Increased signal intensity was frequently seen in the amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso area, regardless of patient zzso Signal zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar to that of frontal cortex, and signal intensity of the zzso was slightly higher than that of frontal zzso There were no significant differences with respect to sex and zzso whereas significant differences were found among cortical regions zzso zzso The zzso ratios of the amygdala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso area were significantly greater than those of all other gray matter structures zzso zzso 

On zzso zzso images, high signal zzso of zzso of the zzso lobe are frequently seen in zzso normal zzso These findings should not be considered zzso
