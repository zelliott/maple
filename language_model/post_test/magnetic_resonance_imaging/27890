Twelve patients with growth zzso zzso zzso were investigated to evaluate correlations between magnetic resonance zzso appearance and tissue zzso zzso expansion, zzso tumor extension, and tumor zzso MR imaging could detect zzso with a characteristic enhancement delay of zzso acid in the surrounding normal zzso zzso zzso and giant tumors appeared on zzso images as mostly high intensity, while varied greatly on zzso zzso The signal zzso of growth zzso zzso were more homogeneous zzso than those of other functioning and zzso zzso on zzso zzso However, there was no typical MR imaging for the tissue characteristics of the growth zzso zzso and no particular correlation with zzso extension or zzso zzso MR findings showed that the zzso approach was superior for total or zzso removal of large tumors, especially with zzso extension up to the upper third zzso The zzso approach can achieve a satisfactory zzso effect on the zzso zzso but more radical removal is required to achieve a normal hormone zzso
