Human zzso virus zzso infection generally zzso zzso For targeted treatment a better understanding of its development is zzso The utility of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso is zzso 

The present study presents a way to zzso the zzso tissue architecture in zzso and to inspect modifications associated with the zzso 

zzso zzso scans with surface coils were performed on the calf and at the zzso region of three groups of zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso patients without zzso and healthy zzso All patients underwent a clinical zzso In addition, dual energy X-ray zzso zzso zzso were zzso On the zzso scans zzso tissue thickness and zzso zzso size were zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled identification of a clear disorganization of zzso tissue in patients with zzso In addition, these patients presented a very small zzso tissue thickness on the calf and a very small zzso zzso 

led to the hypothesis that zzso tissue disorganization appears before changes in zzso zzso or clinically visible zzso 

zzso zzso enabled zzso in zzso of precise changes in tissue organization due to zzso zzso This imaging technique should be very zzso for better monitoring of the zzso
