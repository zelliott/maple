To assess the utility of a zzso zzso data imaging combination zzso on zzso iron oxide zzso liver magnetic resonance imaging zzso using a 3 T zzso 

Fifty patients underwent zzso zzso at 3 T using zzso zzso zzso echo zzso sequences zzso imaging with steady zzso repetition time zzso time zzso 126 zzso zzso flip angle, zzso and zzso zzso zzso data image zzso sequences zzso 186 zzso zzso flip angle, zzso Three zzso independently reviewed the images in a random zzso The sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of focal zzso zzso (a total of 76 zzso in 33 zzso 48 solid zzso 28 zzso zzso were compared by zzso the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso Image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and motion zzso zzso zzso and overall image quality were evaluated according to a zzso zzso 1, poor; 2, fair; 3, good; 4, zzso The zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso of the zzso were zzso 

Image zzso were more frequent with zzso zzso zzso The mean scale of image quality assessment for flow, zzso zzso and motion zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall image quality was significantly zzso better with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso and zzso of the zzso were significantly zzso higher on zzso zzso and zzso zzso images than on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso detection accuracy and sensitivity were not significantly different between the two zzso Mean zzso and sensitivities were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

At 3 zzso the zzso zzso data image combination sequence performs comparably to the zzso zzso zzso sequence for zzso zzso with good overall image quality and a decrease in zzso zzso
