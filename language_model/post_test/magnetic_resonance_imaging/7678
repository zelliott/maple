zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso may cause zzso of the zzso zzso 

To compare the zzso of the zzso zzso using anatomical landmarks and zzso in the clinical setting in patients with structural zzso zzso the central zzso 

We analyzed the zzso and zzso data of 68 consecutive patients zzso tumors, 15 zzso zzso 11 focal cortical zzso zzso who underwent zzso to assess the relationship of these zzso to the zzso zzso zzso data was analyzed on conventional two- and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso was performed with block design zzso or lip movement paradigm and general linear model was used for detecting the activated zzso zzso was considered as a valid method for identifying the zzso zzso based on previously reported zzso 

The zzso zzso could not be identified with anatomical landmarks in zzso zzso zzso zzso detected zzso in areas different from that predicted by anatomical landmarks in zzso zzso zzso This occurred in zzso zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso value for zzso between zzso and zzso landmarks was zzso overall, zzso for tumors, zzso for zzso zzso and in none of the patients with focal cortical zzso 

In patients with zzso that obscure normal cerebral landmarks, zzso supplies the information that is not available from the zzso zzso In patients with landmarks that can be zzso the location of the zzso zzso may be zzso in some cases if functional imaging is not zzso zzso landmarks may not correlate with the area of functional zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso the risk of a zzso zzso zzso from surgery is likely to be more reliable with functional imaging than with conventional zzso zzso
