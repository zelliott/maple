In order to assess zzso response to zzso exposure during MR procedures at the tissue level, simple zzso solutions to the zzso zzso zzso equation were obtained using the Green's function zzso Two zzso models appropriate for zzso exposure were zzso In the first model, the temperature field at the periphery of an idealized volume zzso zzso was zzso The zzso solution reveals that tissue response to zzso heating is characterized by an zzso time and zzso Both parameters are zzso related to tissue zzso and vary for the zzso considered between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso investigated increase in temperature more than zzso degrees C for each zzso of power zzso zzso a homogeneous tissue solution was derived that predicts the zzso course to an MR examination with zzso specific zzso rates zzso Since zzso limits indicated in current MR safety standards relate to running zzso averages zzso over an appropriate period of time, an expression was formulated that gives an upper limit for the temperature rise averaged over the same period of time, as a function of both the upper limit of running zzso averages and the duration of the MR zzso The analysis revealed that the zzso zzso limits indicated in the zzso standard may not guarantee under all circumstances compliance with the basic restrictions concerning temperature zzso
