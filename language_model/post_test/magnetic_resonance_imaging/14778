zzso zzso zzso accounting for zzso of zzso heart disease can be successfully zzso zzso results, however, have revealed decreased life expectancy associated with abnormal zzso zzso an assessment of zzso is the key factor in treatment decisions and successful long-term zzso In this study, zzso zzso whole heart zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso data were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso were reconstructed using zzso zzso X-ray zzso were used to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso fluid dynamics models in three patients were created to simulate zzso and zzso situations using the zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the inlet zzso profile zzso zzso zzso with a focus on the peak zzso pressure zzso and wall zzso stress zzso zzso show that zzso flow at the zzso inlet can significantly affect the assessment of pressure drop and zzso zzso plug inlet zzso profiles significantly zzso zzso zzso overestimate the pressure drop in zzso and zzso zzso and significantly zzso zzso zzso underestimate zzso zzso We conclude that the use of the zzso correct but zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso profile in zzso studies may be an important step towards a zzso analysis of zzso zzso
