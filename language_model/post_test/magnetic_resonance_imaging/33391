We zzso compared MR imaging, MR zzso and CT zzso to determine the sensitivity of each technique in detecting zzso zzso tears and in determining whether the zzso is detached or zzso 

Thirty patients zzso years old zzso 27 years old) who had either signs and symptoms of shoulder instability or shoulder pain of unexplained origin were referred for diagnostic zzso Each patient underwent MR imaging, followed by MR zzso after zzso injection of 25 zzso of a dilute solution of zzso zzso zzso of thirty patients underwent CT zzso after zzso injection of air and zzso contrast zzso Each patient also underwent zzso or open zzso 

At surgery, zzso tears were found in 28 zzso a detached zzso was found in 26 zzso The zzso was found to be zzso in zzso A zzso tear was detected on MR images in 26 zzso of 28, on MR zzso in 27 zzso of 28, and on CT zzso in 19 zzso of zzso A detached zzso zzso was detected on MR images in 12 zzso of 26, on MR zzso in 25 zzso of 26, and on CT zzso in 13 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was detected on MR images in two zzso of 18, on MR zzso in 10 zzso of 18, and on CT zzso in four zzso of zzso MR zzso was the best of the three imaging techniques for showing the inferior part of the zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso 

MR zzso and MR imaging both showed zzso tears with greater sensitivity than CT zzso zzso MR zzso was the most sensitive of the three techniques for detecting a detached zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, MR zzso afforded the best zzso of the inferior part of the zzso and the inferior zzso zzso MR imaging and MR zzso also enabled direct zzso of rotator cuff disease and other zzso associated zzso
