A human zzso model was used to evaluate balloon zzso in traumatic zzso zzso 

To assess the feasibility and safety of balloon zzso followed by calcium zzso cement zzso to prevent zzso zzso 

Failure after zzso zzso fixation for the treatment of zzso fractures is probably caused by a zzso of disc material through the fractured zzso into the zzso body, causing a decrease in anterior column zzso This lack of support can give rise to instrument breakage and zzso zzso after removal of the zzso Restoration of the zzso zzso could prevent these zzso 

zzso traumatic fractures of zzso zzso were zzso All fractures were distracted and fixated with zzso zzso screws and zzso zzso introduced inflatable bone zzso and subsequent injection of calcium zzso cement were used to restore the zzso zzso analyses of magnetic resonance images obtained at three time points were used to evaluate the zzso of the zzso body and zzso After slicing all zzso zzso examination was performed to detect leakage of cement or bone displacement in zzso zzso 

No technical problems were encountered during the zzso The balloon zzso resulted in a significant zzso zzso zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso No cement leakage or zzso bone displacement could be detected zzso or zzso 

The present study suggests that balloon zzso may be a safe and feasible procedure for the restoration of traumatic zzso zzso zzso
