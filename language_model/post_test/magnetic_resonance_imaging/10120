While the advantages of parallel acquisition techniques for zzso imaging zzso are well documented for studies affected by magnetic field zzso this work focuses on the costs in functional zzso of brain regions without artifacts due to zzso zzso For a visual stimulation paradigm and relative to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the use of parallel acquisition at a reduction factor of 2 decreased the mean number of activated zzso by zzso at 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso resolution zzso and by zzso at 3 zzso 3 zzso zzso resolution zzso The loss of sensitivity reflects both a decreased zzso ratio of the native images due to a lower number of contributing zzso echoes and a decreased zzso zzso sensitivity due to the coverage of a smaller range of zzso
