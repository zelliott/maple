Currently, little is known about the pathology of zzso in spinal zzso disease due to the technical challenges of specifically measuring zzso content zzso zzso zzso allows zzso of the zzso water zzso which is related to zzso zzso However, conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques require zzso long acquisition times, lack spatial coverage, and are sensitive to artifacts common in spinal zzso zzso zzso driven equilibrium single pulse observation of zzso and zzso zzso offers a promising alternative to conventional zzso zzso zzso The goal of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of zzso for obtaining high spatial resolution spinal zzso zzso water fraction data covering the entire cervical spinal zzso zzso water fraction values were found to be highly zzso between subjects and over time but varied considerably along the length of the zzso Other relaxation characteristics that relate to tissue structure and health were also reliably zzso
