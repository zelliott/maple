This study explored defensive response zzso as well as zzso responses during sustained exposure to zzso zzso To test the specificity of affective physiology and brain zzso neutral and other affective stimuli were zzso zzso startle zzso was maintained and zzso responses even increased during sustained zzso zzso Viewing of zzso pictures also resulted in increased zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso This effect, however, was not fear specific because other affective materials evoked comparable signal strength in the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was specifically increased during sustained zzso exposure in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso of the zzso in zzso studies primarily indexes the detection of zzso relevant stimuli whereas the zzso might be more specifically linked to defensive response zzso
