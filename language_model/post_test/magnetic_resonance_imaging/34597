Currently, zzso is being investigated as a method for producing contrast in magnetic resonance images of the brain, solid tumors, and the zzso However, the underlying zzso mechanisms involved in this type of contrast are still not completely zzso For example, under what conditions would dissolved plasma oxygen contribute to the zzso zzso Using the eye as a model system, we varied the level of dissolved plasma oxygen and observed different patterns of contrast in the zzso The observed contrast changes were consistent with tissue oxygen zzso by zzso at an zzso zzso of 200 zzso zzso and dissolved oxygen zzso at zzso zzso zzso 350 zzso zzso These data demonstrate that dissolved plasma oxygen does not become an important contrast mechanism until the zzso oxygen tension exceeds approximately 350 zzso zzso The implication of this result to studies in other zzso is zzso
