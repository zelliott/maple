zzso zzso syndrome, an zzso zzso disorder characterized by distinct clinical, zzso and genetic zzso is characterized by severe short zzso the zzso of which is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso E zzso gene leading to loss of four zzso acids zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein has been associated with the zzso 

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical, zzso and zzso features of children with genetically proven zzso zzso 

Six children from four independent Middle Eastern zzso with clinical features of zzso syndrome were confirmed to have the previously reported zzso zzso in zzso zzso and were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain and standard zzso function zzso 

zzso zzso in all children showed severe zzso of the anterior zzso and corpus zzso with decreased white matter zzso Four of five children tested had zzso zzso and cortisol responses to zzso and plasma zzso concentration was low in all six zzso zzso response to zzso was zzso in one of three patients zzso Male children zzso zzso 3) had clinical features suggestive of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso appear to be associated with zzso syndrome and may contribute in part to the short zzso Our data support the need for longer term monitoring for evolving zzso hormone deficiencies and raise the possibility that zzso may play a role in development of the anterior zzso corpus zzso and white matter in addition to the zzso zzso
