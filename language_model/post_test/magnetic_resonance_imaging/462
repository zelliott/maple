To compare differences in dose to the target volume and zzso at risk zzso for ring and tandem zzso using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso three-dimensional treatment plans for each application vs plans based on a single scan for all zzso 

The study was carried out in 10 patients with zzso of the zzso zzso treated with external beam zzso and five zzso of high dose rate zzso Planning was carried out using zzso for the first fraction and zzso zzso for each of the four subsequent zzso The zzso plan was taken as the reference and the zzso procedure was calculated by using the weights from the reference plan to calculate the dose distribution for each subsequent zzso zzso zzso The high-risk clinical target volume zzso and zzso were delineated as per zzso zzso Total doses from external beam zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso to a 2 zzso fraction zzso 

The mean zzso for the zzso was zzso zzso when using one plan and 84 zzso when using individual treatment zzso Similarly, the mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso vs zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso for the zzso Ring rotation was identified in three patients, resulting in a change in dwell positions, which otherwise could have led to either a high zzso dose or zzso coverage of the zzso 

Our study has shown that a zzso procedure achieved acceptable zzso in most zzso However, the zzso plan improved zzso by accounting for variations in zzso geometry and the position of critical zzso
