To assess the clinical usefulness of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso patients with zzso negative zzso 

In total, zzso oral SCC patients with zzso negative neck were zzso evaluated with zzso zzso zzso and their visual zzso zzso analysis was used as the gold standard for assessment of these imaging zzso 

Thirty-five zzso of our zzso patients were found to have neck zzso On a zzso basis, the sensitivity of zzso PET for zzso zzso was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso v zzso zzso P zzso zzso Visual correlation of zzso PET and zzso yielded slightly higher sensitivity and specificity than zzso PET alone zzso v zzso P zzso zzso zzso v zzso P zzso zzso zzso On a zzso basis, the sensitivity of zzso PET for neck zzso was zzso and increased to zzso after visual correlation with zzso The probabilities of zzso neck zzso after using zzso PET were zzso in zzso tumors, zzso in zzso tumors, zzso in zzso tumors, and zzso in T4 tumors and decreased to zzso in zzso tumors and to zzso in zzso tumors after visual correlation with zzso 

zzso PET was superior to zzso for detecting zzso zzso neck zzso of oral zzso Because zzso PET could reduce the probability of zzso neck zzso to less than zzso in zzso to zzso tumors, it should be indicated for evaluation of these zzso
