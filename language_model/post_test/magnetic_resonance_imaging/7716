Positive number zzso is based on combining and separating sets of items, with systematic differences in brain activity in specific regions depending on zzso In contrast, zzso with negative numbers involves manipulating abstract values worth less than zero, possibly involving different zzso relationships in these zzso Use of procedural zzso knowledge, including transformative rules like zzso a negative is plus a zzso may also differ by zzso zzso Here, we examined whether the activity evoked in negative number zzso was similar to that seen in positive problems, using region of interest analyses zzso to examine a specific set of brain zzso zzso problems demonstrated a zzso effect of operation in the inferior zzso zzso with more activity for zzso than addition, as well as increased activity across zzso Interestingly, while zzso problems demonstrated the expected addition zzso zzso activity difference in the angular zzso negative problems showed a reversed effect, with relatively more activity for zzso than zzso zzso zzso problems may be understood after translation to addition via rule, thereby zzso more zzso zzso zzso analyses showed increased right zzso activity for zzso problems across operation, indicating a possible overall increase in usage of procedural zzso zzso with negative numbers may thus shows some zzso relationships similar to positive numbers, but may also be affected by zzso This study examines the flexibility of the mental number system by exploring to what degree the processing of an applied usage of a difficult, abstract mathematical concept is similar to that for positive zzso
