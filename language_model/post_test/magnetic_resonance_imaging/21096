zzso zzso zzso zzso forms an integral part of a critical zzso network, which has been implicated in various clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits seen in zzso Despite its functional zzso the relatively few studies that have investigated the structural changes in the zzso report inconsistent findings concerning the nature and zzso of these zzso We employed a zzso automated zzso procedure to measure cortical zzso surface area and the degree of cortical folding of the two distinct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 57 patients with schizophrenia and 41 controls using high-resolution magnetic resonance zzso Within the zzso we observed more pronounced zzso changes in zzso zzso compared to angular zzso in zzso While zzso zzso in patients showed reduced zzso contracted surface area and zzso the zzso changes in angular zzso were largely confined to a reduction in surface zzso zzso zzso asymmetry was observed in the zzso of the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that in addition to abnormalities in the zzso processes that contribute to regional surface area and cortical zzso a specific zzso in cortical zzso especially affecting the left hemisphere, is likely to occur in zzso
