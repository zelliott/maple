We aimed to evaluate zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with dynamic zzso row zzso zzso zzso and to discriminate between zzso and zzso 

Eighty-six zzso diagnosed as zzso or zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso were compared with respect to their diagnostic ability for zzso zzso and detection sensitivity for zzso zzso The ability of zzso images of zzso zzso to discriminate between these zzso was zzso We also calculated the zzso enhancement ratio of the zzso 

For zzso zzso the diagnostic ability of zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso for tumors less than 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in the detection of zzso zzso between zzso phase images of zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso whereas the detection sensitivity of zzso tumors by zzso zzso was significantly higher than that by dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso enhancement ratios were decreased in parallel with the degree of differentiation in zzso and zzso although there was no difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The diagnostic ability of zzso zzso for zzso zzso less than 2 zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso For zzso tumors, the detection sensitivity of zzso phase images of zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of dynamic zzso zzso and dynamic zzso It was difficult to distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso enhancement zzso
