zzso cortical thinning and neural resource allocation changes emerge during zzso however, little is known of how zzso changes influence neural response to cognitive zzso This study used a novel zzso imaging registration technique to examine the relationship between brain structure and function during zzso 

156 healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso participants underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso surface reconstruction was performed via zzso and neural zzso was measured from a blood oxygen level dependent zzso contrast during visual working memory zzso via zzso zzso Surface zzso aligned segmented zzso and functional zzso to a common template zzso zzso linear zzso determined the effect of cortical thickness on zzso zzso contrast in brain regions that activated during the zzso task, controlling for age, zzso development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Power analyses suggest this study was able to detect small effect zzso However, in no region was cortical thickness related to zzso zzso zzso zzso Gender did not moderate zzso 

zzso zzso although variable across individuals, was not related to zzso response, suggesting that structural and functional maturation do not have the same zzso trajectory during early zzso These findings are important, as imaging studies that report group differences in regards to cortical thickness should not necessarily assume zzso behavioral or functional zzso The methodology used in this study could be of interest to other zzso zzso researchers using zzso imaging to understand adolescent brain zzso
