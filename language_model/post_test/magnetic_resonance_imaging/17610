There are many kinds of artifacts in image series of functional zzso such as head motion artifacts, zzso motion artifacts, blood flow artifacts, ghost artifacts and zzso zzso These artifacts which are zzso with the neural activities, have so severe affects on the analysis of functional zzso data that they not only reduce the sensibility and reliability of functional zzso but also make the zzso locating and visualizing of the functional active regions more zzso The mechanism and the effect of artifacts in functional zzso are discussed here, the methods of correcting artifacts are zzso and research prospects are discussed zzso
