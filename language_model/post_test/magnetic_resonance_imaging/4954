The rubber hand illusion zzso offers the opportunity to systematically manipulate the experience of zzso which is here used to describe the zzso integration of an external object into one's body zzso Among the cortical regions involved in the processing of body perception, the zzso zzso zzso seems to be crucial in the integration of zzso zzso However, it is not known if the perceived zzso of the zzso is a trait or a state zzso In the present study, we varied the setup of the zzso to test the stability of zzso The illusion was induced in two different zzso with either a horizontal or vertical displacement of the rubber hand in respect to the real zzso Further, the zzso was induced twice with an zzso of at least six months and long-term changes on the zzso and behavioral level were zzso Finally, we measured the long-term stability of cortical activity during the induction of a vertical zzso using functional magnetic resonance zzso We found that a vertical setup induced higher ratings of zzso zzso of the rubber hand than a horizontal setup, but the responses to both zzso were significantly zzso There was high zzso long-term stability of the zzso perception of zzso zzso but a lower stability on the behavioral zzso The functional magnetic resonance imaging data suggest temporally stable zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that dynamic changes in perceived limb ownership by the induction of the zzso are zzso
