zzso resonance imaging zzso has been frequently used to determine a zzso treatment plan for zzso zzso However, the MR accuracy for staging an zzso cancer is not satisfactory based on the old zzso staging zzso 

To evaluate MR accuracy for staging zzso cancer using the new zzso staging zzso 

Between January 2005 and May 2009, 199 women underwent surgery due to zzso zzso In each patient, an zzso cancer was staged using MR findings based on the old zzso staging system and then repeated according to the new zzso staging system for zzso zzso findings were used as a standard of zzso 

The accuracy of zzso in the staging of zzso zzso stage I, II, III, and IV using the old zzso staging system were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, when using the new zzso staging zzso The overall MR accuracy of the old and new staging systems were 51% zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso has become a more useful tool in the zzso staging of zzso zzso using the new zzso staging system compared to the old one with increased zzso
