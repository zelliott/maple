To prove that zzso M zzso provides superior contrast enhancement and zzso image characteristics of primary and secondary brain zzso compared with zzso M zzso thereby providing superior diagnostic zzso 

Brain zzso was performed in two separate examinations in patients scheduled for zzso Independent injections of zzso M zzso and zzso M zzso at doses of zzso zzso zzso body weight were administered per patient in zzso zzso zzso was performed in an off-site blinded zzso 

Fifty-one patients in the full analysis set zzso were eligible for efficacy analysis and 44 for the zzso zzso For the primary efficacy variable zzso in contrast enhancement for one contrast agent or the zzso the rate of zzso zzso was estimated at zzso (95 % confidence zzso zzso zzso showing significant superiority of zzso over zzso zzso zzso contrast and the results of all qualitative secondary efficacy variables were also in zzso of zzso Keeping a sufficient time delay after contrast application proved to be essential to get optimal image zzso 

Compared with zzso M zzso zzso M zzso was proven to have significantly superior contrast enhancement characteristics in a routine zzso protocol of primary and secondary brain zzso
