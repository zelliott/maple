zzso single center natural history studies have shown that times to reach disability milestones and ages at which they are reached are similar in primary zzso and secondary zzso progressive multiple sclerosis suggesting that they may be zzso variations of the same zzso 

Here we compared zzso disease activity in zzso and zzso in the context of international zzso clinical zzso 

We analyzed all objective outcome measures that were systematically collected over 2 years for all subjects zzso to zzso arms in one zzso and one zzso clinical trial over the last zzso Conventional and exploratory definitions of clinical disease activity were zzso Disease activity was analyzed in 3 different categories intermittent activity, zzso and zzso Conventional zzso measures and one patient reported outcome measure of quality of life were included when available for zzso Heat maps were drawn for all results followed by zzso zzso 

There were 101 outcome variables from 206 zzso subjects and 79 outcome variables from 135 zzso zzso The comparison revealed that zzso and zzso subjects exhibited similar disease activity over 2 years in all but two of the variables in common worsening in the zzso sensory system was more common in zzso while worsening on the 9 hole zzso was more common in zzso zzso activity was the most common pattern of disease activity in zzso and zzso Clinical worsening and improvement occurred at similar frequency in zzso 

zzso disease activity was nearly identical in zzso and zzso subjects in the context of the two zzso international clinical trials we zzso
