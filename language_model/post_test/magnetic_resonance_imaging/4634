In a phase zzso trial the specific contrast enhancement of benign liver tumors, especially zzso and zzso versus zzso liver tumors such as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated using the zzso iron oxide zzso 

57 patients were zzso investigated using zzso and zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso and fat suppressed zzso sequences before and after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso in zzso slice orientation on a zzso zzso zzso zzso 63 zzso In 8 patients an in zzso zzso correlation 30 minutes after zzso was zzso In 12 patients benign primary liver tumors zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso zzso zzso 1) were zzso zzso zzso liver tumors zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso were found in 29 zzso 11 patients with liver zzso due to Wilson's disease and 5 with zzso due to other reasons were zzso 

zzso studies allowed detection of more zzso in 19 of 41 patients with liver zzso zzso liver tumors showed significant loss of signal intensity of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors showed only minimal signal zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso tissue demonstrated significant signal loss of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In ten patients and 13 zzso of zzso a capsule was seen in zzso plain and zzso zzso zzso tissue was found in zzso plain, zzso zzso In the patient with zzso capsule with contrast enhancement was seen, but no zzso was zzso whereas in patients with zzso a capsule was seen in three cases zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso showed a statistically significant difference in signal loss between benign and zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The use of zzso iron oxide zzso allows differentiation of benign and zzso liver tumors on the basis of contrast enhancement, existence and specific enhancement of capsule or zzso In zzso correlation show some limitations of in zzso zzso
