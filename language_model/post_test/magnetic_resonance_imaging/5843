To use functional zzso zzso methods to zzso a network of auditory and zzso brain regions associated with processing an zzso zzso We compare a passive listening zzso story paradigm to an zzso zzso version including online performance monitoring and a sparse acquisition zzso 

Twenty children zzso zzso zzso completed zzso and zzso story processing zzso The zzso version presented alternating 30-second blocks of stories and zzso the zzso version presented story zzso comprehension questions, and zzso tone zzso with zzso acquisitions between zzso zzso data was analyzed using a general linear model approach and paired zzso identifying significant group zzso 

Both tasks showed zzso in the primary auditory cortex, superior zzso zzso zzso and left inferior frontal zzso zzso The zzso task demonstrated more extensive zzso including the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of effect size in each paradigm showed a larger effect for the zzso paradigm in a left inferior frontal zzso zzso 

zzso patterns for story processing in children are similar in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in extent and magnitude of zzso in the zzso task are likely associated with memory and attention resources engaged across acquisition zzso
