The distribution of the lowest vertebra zzso to the zzso notch and the lowest zzso disc zzso above the zzso was determined on magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The method is illustrated in seven patients undergoing upper zzso spinal reconstruction to define a surgical approach without zzso or zzso 

The relation of the zzso notch to zzso zzso was examined by zzso to estimate the zzso level zzso zzso without zzso 

Upper zzso spine zzso zzso is considered zzso The zzso zzso that can be zzso zzso without zzso is zzso 

The zzso level zzso to the zzso notch and the lowest zzso disc zzso in its entirety above the zzso was determined from 106 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso The method was evaluated in seven patients to illustrate application of a low zzso lateral zzso or zzso approach to performing upper zzso zzso 

The zzso of the zzso vertebra is often above the zzso zzso whereas the trajectory of the zzso zzso disc is usually zzso to the zzso All four patients with disease above the zzso notch on zzso underwent a low left zzso approach, whereas three others were treated with a lateral zzso or zzso zzso No patient worsened zzso and all zzso independently after zzso 

Upper zzso zzso can be exposed without zzso or zzso by a low left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can identify the zzso zzso above the zzso thereby determining whether a low zzso approach is zzso Otherwise, a lateral zzso or zzso approach can be used to avoid zzso or zzso
