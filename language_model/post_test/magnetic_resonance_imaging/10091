zzso zzso is a selective zzso at the zzso site of the zzso zzso The safety and efficacy of zzso were studied in two phase III zzso zzso clinical trials of acute zzso stroke patients within 6 h from onset [The zzso zzso in zzso zzso International and zzso Americas zzso A planned zzso zzso within these trials investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso 

Patients enrolled in the zzso trials at designated zzso zzso sites were eligible if they had a zzso acute cortical zzso on zzso zzso of at least zzso zzso diameter or 5 zzso Final zzso assessment was performed on zzso zzso at month zzso zzso image analysis was performed zzso The primary hypothesis was that zzso would zzso zzso growth from baseline relative to zzso 

A total of 106 patients were eligible, 75 zzso zzso 41 zzso of whom had month 3 scans zzso analysis zzso No effects of zzso on zzso volume were observed in the primary or other zzso However, significant associations of zzso volume to clinical severity and outcomes were zzso zzso zzso volume decrease was zzso of substantial clinical zzso 

zzso with the clinical outcomes in the zzso trials, no effects of zzso on zzso zzso was zzso zzso of results of the clinical outcome trials with those of this zzso volume zzso as well the associations of zzso volume to clinical outcomes further support the potential role of zzso volume as a marker of outcome in dose finding and proof of principle acute stroke zzso
