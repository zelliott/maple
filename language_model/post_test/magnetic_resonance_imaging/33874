The aim of this work was to study the ability of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging in zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso Eleven patients with zzso proved zzso zzso six with focal zzso zzso and one with a single zzso zzso were examined by zzso and zzso zzso sequences before, 1 h after, and 24 h after intravenous injection of zzso (5 zzso zzso analysis including enhancement and zzso zzso ratio, and qualitative analysis including the presence of a central area and a capsule were done on zzso and zzso zzso Enhancement was observed in all the tumors with significant improvement zzso zzso zzso in zzso ratio 1 h after, and 24 h after intravenous injection of zzso There were no significant differences in the mean enhancement and the mean zzso ratio zzso between benign and zzso zzso No enhancement was seen within internal areas observed in 7 zzso zzso and in 5 focal zzso zzso and within capsules which were observed in 9 zzso zzso In our study, zzso increased zzso of both benign and zzso tumors but did not enable differentiation between benign and zzso tumors of zzso zzso
