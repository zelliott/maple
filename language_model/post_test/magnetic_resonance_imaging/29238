zzso imaging of the zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso may provide greater insight into the response of zzso to cholesterol-lowering zzso zzso plaque was studied in zzso by zzso in rabbits undergoing dietary cholesterol zzso Thirty-one rabbits underwent zzso balloon injury and zzso diet for 4 months and then were assigned to zzso versus continued zzso diet for up to an additional 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso of the abdominal zzso was performed at 4, 12, and 20 months and compared with zzso zzso demonstrated a significant reduction in % area zzso in rabbits placed on zzso diet zzso zzso at 20 months versus zzso at 4 months, zzso In contrast, % area zzso increased in rabbits maintained on zzso diet zzso at 20 months versus zzso at 4 months, zzso Similarly, plaque thickness decreased significantly in the zzso group zzso zzso at 20 months versus zzso zzso at 4 months, zzso with a trend toward increase in the zzso group zzso zzso at 20 months versus zzso zzso at 4 months, zzso Thus, in rabbits undergoing dietary cholesterol zzso zzso detected zzso of zzso zzso plaque in zzso zzso progression was seen with maintenance of zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso technology for directly imaging zzso and its response to therapeutic zzso
