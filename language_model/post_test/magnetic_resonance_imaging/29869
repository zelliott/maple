We measured the shape of the head of the zzso nucleus with a new approach based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso personality disorder zzso subjects in whom we previously reported decreased zzso nucleus zzso We believe zzso shape analysis zzso traditional zzso volume zzso 

zzso resonance imaging scans were used to measure the shape of the zzso nucleus in 15 right-handed male subjects with zzso who had no prior zzso exposure, and in 14 matched normal comparison zzso With zzso processing tools, we measured the head of the zzso nucleus using a shape index, which measured how much a given shape deviates from a zzso 

In relation to comparison subjects, zzso zzso zzso subjects had significantly higher (more zzso head of the zzso shape index scores, zzso to the right zzso Additionally, for zzso subjects, higher right and left head of the zzso zzso scores correlated significantly with poorer zzso performance on tasks of zzso memory and zzso working memory, zzso 

These data confirm the value of measuring shape, as well as volume, of brain regions of interest and support the association of intrinsic pathology in the zzso nucleus, unrelated to zzso medication, with cognitive abnormalities in the schizophrenia zzso
