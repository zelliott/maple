To develop and partially characterize a new class of potential blood pool magnetic resonance zzso contrast zzso 

Various zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were prepared with differing molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso as zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso content of the zzso zzso was determined by atomic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was measured at zzso zzso and compared with zzso zzso MR zzso zzso was performed in rabbits comparing zzso with zzso zzso 

The zzso content of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso on weight zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso in the zzso ranged from about 150 to about zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values for the different zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso with the lowest zzso for the zzso prepared with the zzso zzso The zzso complexes resulted in moderately higher zzso zzso with zzso in zzso showed markedly greater vascular enhancement relative to an equivalent dose of zzso zzso enhancement was much more sustained with the zzso agent and confined to vascular space; zzso no appreciable background tissue zzso reflection of distribution into zzso fluid zzso zzso 

Relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes provided moderate increases in zzso but markedly greater efficacy during in zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies of zzso showed only an approximately 50% increase in zzso zzso compared with zzso The zzso complex's lack of rigidity may have diminished the effect of spin diffusion on relaxation, thereby accounting for this modest zzso The greater efficacy of zzso during in zzso zzso may reflect zzso within the vascular space and possibly enhanced relaxation of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are promising agents that merit additional zzso
