This prospective study was performed to assess whether zzso zzso zzso zzso including recording of the pain response, or the MR signal intensity of the disks are reliable zzso of the outcome of zzso 

zzso patients, 44 females and 47 males aged zzso years zzso zzso treated at 99 disk levels were zzso All had plain CT, MR imaging, zzso and zzso performed prior to automated zzso zzso with the zzso R zzso 

zzso zzso of the patients responded well to treatment within 3 zzso Due to zzso the success rate at 1 year was reduced to zzso Except for better results following zzso in patients with similar and identical pain as the presenting complaint provoked at zzso no association was demonstrated between zzso zzso or loss of signal on zzso and the zzso Better results were also seen in patients with a short history of disk disease, but not in patients with predominantly zzso and focal zzso compared to those with predominantly zzso pain and diffuse zzso zzso 

The results do not justify routine use of zzso prior to zzso in patients with zzso disks demonstrated by zzso methods and zzso zzso zzso
