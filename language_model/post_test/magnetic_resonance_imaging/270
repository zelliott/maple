The aim of our study was to determine regional cerebral blood flow zzso abnormalities in different types of zzso 

Among the patients with genetically determined zzso 3 patients had zzso and 11 had different types of zzso from which 10 had zzso zzso zzso and 1 patient had zzso zzso Besides the mentioned 14 patients, 1 had zzso zzso and another patient had zzso zzso The further distribution of the zzso patients' group was the zzso patients had zzso with zzso zzso 5 had zzso disease zzso zzso zzso from which 1 had zzso zzso zzso zzso in all patients were performed cerebral zzso and zzso examination 10 zzso after intravenous administration of 20 zzso 99 zzso 

Fourteen out of 16 zzso findings were zzso showing decreased focal zzso cerebral blood zzso zzso zzso the 3 patients revealed zzso signs from the zzso patients' zzso Among them the zzso zzso zzso zzso female patient with zzso zzso caused by zzso stroke at 10 zzso showed right sided zzso zzso and left frontal zzso nearly 6 years after the cerebral vascular zzso This finding might be resulted because of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the four patients with zzso and zzso zzso showed focal zzso in the zzso region, while the zzso was normal in the zzso deficient patient and in 2 zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso In the remaining 1 zzso patient zzso zzso was zzso In all patients there were non specific structural abnormalities detected by zzso cortical and zzso zzso and scattered zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso the zzso showed cerebral zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso showed right frontal and zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso The patient with zzso sclerosis showed bilateral zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images demonstrated zzso zzso changes in 14 out of all 16 zzso zzso Regional zzso zzso was detected by zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso giving high zzso value about the cerebral zzso
