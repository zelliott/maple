zzso zzso is a specific reading and spelling deficit affecting zzso to zzso of the zzso Advances in understanding its origin support a core deficit in zzso processing characterized by difficulties in zzso spoken words into their minimally zzso speech segments zzso sounds, or zzso and zzso of left superior zzso zzso A suggested but unproven hypothesis is that this zzso deficit zzso the ability to map speech sounds onto their zzso visual letters, which in turn prevents the zzso of fluent reading zzso The present functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study investigated the neural processing of letters and speech sounds in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso audiovisual zzso conditions as a function of reading zzso Our data reveal that adult dyslexic readers zzso superior zzso zzso for the integration of letters and speech zzso This reduced audiovisual integration is directly associated with a more fundamental deficit in auditory processing of speech sounds, which in turn predicts performance on zzso zzso The data provide a zzso account of zzso zzso in which zzso processing deficits are linked to reading failure through a deficit in neural integration of letters and speech zzso
