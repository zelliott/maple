The goal of this study was to determine and compare imaging zzso in pediatric patients who underwent successful or failed zzso third zzso zzso To this end, the authors measured zzso size changes and the presence of zzso fluid zzso flow void in both groups of children following zzso 

Images obtained in children with zzso immediately before and at least 30 days after having undergone zzso were reviewed by four independent observers zzso blinded and two zzso Each observer independently measured the frontal and zzso horn ratio zzso a reliable and valid measure of zzso zzso and provided a zzso assessment of the presence of a flow void at the zzso site, the degree of zzso zzso and the amount of zzso over the cerebral zzso There were 29 children whose mean age was zzso years at the time of zzso and who had a mean zzso follow-up period lasting zzso zzso zzso the mean reduction in zzso size (as measured using the zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in cases that were deemed failures zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in clinically successful cases (21 zzso This reduction was significantly greater in cases of clinical success compared with those that were deemed failures zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no substantial differences between blinded and zzso zzso zzso void was present in zzso of successes and absent in zzso of failures zzso zzso zzso zzso exact zzso The other zzso assessments were not significantly different between the groups of successes and zzso 

zzso size appears to be somewhat reduced in both groups of patients who underwent clinically successful and failed zzso however, the reduction is significantly greater among clinically successful zzso The presence of a flow void also appears to correlate with clinical success and its absence with clinical zzso
