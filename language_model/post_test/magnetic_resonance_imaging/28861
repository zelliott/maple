zzso projections for visual processing that originate from the zzso zzso are organized into two zzso The zzso stream projects to the zzso region and the zzso stream to the inferior zzso zzso One hypothesis is that the zzso stream processes visual spatial information, and the zzso stream processes visual object zzso Although recognition of human faces or common objects has been shown zzso to activate the zzso zzso the issue of when such processing starts to engage the zzso or the zzso stream is not zzso The question explored in this study is whether processing of visual form per zzso without evoking the brain mechanisms that are associated with recognition of human faces or common objects is sufficient to activate the zzso stream more significantly relative to the condition when only visual spatial processing is zzso zzso magnetic resonance images were acquired while subjects performed a delayed comparison task in which either visual spatial or visual form information was zzso zzso areas that were zzso activated in visual spatial or visual form processing showed not only zzso zzso but also zzso zzso The results extended previous findings by showing that preferential zzso in the zzso zzso is not contingent upon such powerful stimuli as faces and common zzso zzso of simple visual form information is cause enough for such zzso to be zzso A strong left zzso dominance in visual form recognition was also zzso The observed zzso may be a reflection that the left zzso is more important in symbolic and/or semantic coding of visual form zzso
