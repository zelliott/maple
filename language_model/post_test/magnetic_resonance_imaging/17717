We present a zzso child with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, zzso zzso and zzso at left and right zzso artery were zzso zzso agents, zzso and pulse zzso therapy were started and a zzso was inserted in the left zzso zzso Two months later, brain magnetic resonance zzso resonance imaging zzso showed acute zzso area of the left zzso lobe and middle cerebral artery zzso We found bilateral peripheral zzso persistent zzso and elevated zzso level and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment was zzso In conclusion, our observation suggests that in patients with systemic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso are probably associated with greater zzso zzso The investigation of the zzso levels and zzso zzso as a zzso zzso effect might also be considered for determining patients with zzso at risk for severe zzso zzso
