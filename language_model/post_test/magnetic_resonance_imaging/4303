Several studies have shown the feasibility of zzso zzso and zzso in imaging of zzso damage in stroke, multiple zzso cerebral tumors and zzso These studies indicate that zzso allow zzso of brain pathology related to inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Until now, it is not clear if zzso zzso occurs in the core of zzso or in the zzso zzso in the present study, we compared zzso with functional parameters such as cerebral zzso zzso using zzso oxygen metabolism zzso using zzso and cerebral zzso zzso using zzso in PET and with the anatomical zzso zzso 

zzso patients (11 zzso 6 zzso age 43 to 84 zzso zzso with middle cerebral artery zzso stroke, as proven by CT or zzso were examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in one session zzso days after zzso zzso of zzso were defined by zzso being smaller than zzso or zzso below zzso of the zzso value and were subsequently superimposed on the zzso zzso To compare the zzso zzso with the zzso a realignment program was used that matches the zzso with the zzso zzso Clinical status was established using the zzso stroke scale at admission and at discharge (at least 6 weeks after zzso and the zzso zzso 

Eight patients showed a positive zzso scan and were used for further zzso It appeared that Co accumulates in areas with a diminished oxygen metabolism and with a preserved zzso We found zzso in only a part of the zzso enhanced brain tissue with a tendency to be located peripherally or outside the zzso demarcated brain zzso 

The results of the present study suggest that Co accumulates into zzso brain tissue with a rather preserved flow independently of zzso barrier zzso
