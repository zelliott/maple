zzso function is a powerful predictor of survival in patients with heart failure zzso However, studies characterizing gated zzso zzso PET for the assessment of the cardiac function are zzso The aim of this study was to zzso compare gated zzso zzso PET and cardiac zzso for the assessment of zzso volume and ejection fraction zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with diagnosed zzso who underwent both gated zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso within 3 days were included in the zzso Left zzso zzso zzso volume zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso were obtained from gated zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso measured by zzso were significantly lower than those measured by cardiac zzso (both zzso In contrast, the corresponding values for zzso zzso for zzso were comparable, and zzso zzso was underestimated with borderline significance compared with cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso and cardiac zzso showed no significant differences, whereas the corresponding values for zzso were lower than for cardiac zzso zzso The correlations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between gated zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso were excellent for both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso analysis revealed a significant systemic error, where zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were underestimated by zzso 

Despite the observation that gated zzso zzso zzso were well correlated with cardiac zzso for assessing zzso function, variation was observed between the two imaging zzso and so these imaging techniques should not be used zzso
