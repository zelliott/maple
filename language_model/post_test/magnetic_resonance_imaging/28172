zzso hypertension and stagnant zzso in the human spinal zzso are poorly zzso We report a case in which a partial zzso syndrome resulted from obstruction of zzso drainage on one side of the spinal zzso Neurological deterioration and eventual recovery paralleled the formation and clearance of zzso The clinical and zzso findings support the contention that spinal zzso injury arising as a result of obstruction to zzso zzso occurs primarily in the white matter, spreading zzso to the zzso matter, and observations that obstruction of zzso flow in the high cervical spinal zzso results in changes in the lower cervical zzso
