Although the zzso nucleus is the most frequently used target for surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease, the criteria on which it can be identified on zzso images have never been clearly zzso This study was conducted to characterize the precise zzso distribution of zzso zzso in the zzso region and to correlate this zzso with iron content in the zzso zzso 

The zzso MR imaging acquisitions of 15 patients with Parkinson's disease were fused with a digitized version of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The MR signal intensity within the zzso limits of the zzso nucleus was zzso An zzso zzso obtained at autopsy was used to evaluate iron zzso 

In all patients, the zzso nucleus was zzso on both sides in the anterior half of the zzso At more zzso levels of the nucleus, zzso was less frequently observed zzso zzso was never observed at the most zzso zzso Iron was present in the zzso part of the nucleus but absent at the most zzso zzso 

The zzso signal intensity located lateral to the red nucleus and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with the presence of iron and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso It can therefore be used as a landmark for zzso zzso in patients with Parkinson's zzso It should, however, be emphasized that although zzso was always present in the anterior half of the zzso nucleus, the zzso part of the nucleus was not visible in most zzso
