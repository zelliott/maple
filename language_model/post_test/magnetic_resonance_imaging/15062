Stem cells have been proposed as a promising therapy for treating zzso While several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of stem cells, the exact mechanism remains zzso zzso imaging provides the possibility of the visual representation of biological processes at the cellular and molecular zzso In order to facilitate research efforts to understand the stem cells therapeutic mechanisms, we need to further develop means of monitoring these cells zzso zzso and zzso Because of tissue depth and the zzso barrier zzso in zzso imaging of stem cells therapy for stroke has unique zzso In this review, we describe existing methods of tracking transplanted stem cells in zzso including magnetic resonance imaging zzso nuclear medicine imaging, and optical imaging zzso Each of the imaging techniques has advantages and zzso Finally, we describe zzso imaging strategies as a more comprehensive and potential method to monitor transplanted stem cells for zzso
