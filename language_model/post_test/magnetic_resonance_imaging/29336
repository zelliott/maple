We examined whether the inverse relation between zzso evoked zzso primary response and zzso zzso during a zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso magnetic zzso reflect activity of zzso zzso in the human zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso holds for interference zzso 

zzso evoked fields zzso from 14 subjects were measured following electric median nerve stimulation at the wrist with, and without, concurrent brushing of the palm and zzso zzso were recorded with a wide zzso zzso zzso and then zzso and zzso zzso were separated by subsequent zzso zzso 300 zzso and zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso 

The zzso decreased dramatically in zzso during interference zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso moderately increased in number of zzso 

These results demonstrate the presence of an inverse relation between zzso and zzso zzso for interference zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso represent a localized activity of zzso zzso zzso of layer 4, characterized by a zzso spike burst zzso zzso without adaptation, and that the continuous interference stimulation zzso zzso zzso of the zzso leading to a zzso of responses to the coherent zzso zzso zzso by the median nerve stimulation zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of the zzso zzso caused directly by interference stimulation along with an enhanced zzso zzso from the zzso will lead to a decrease of zzso zzso
