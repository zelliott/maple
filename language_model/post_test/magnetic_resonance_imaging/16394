zzso analysis of zzso imaging and clinical data from patients undergoing cervical expansive zzso for cervical zzso 

To investigate zzso parameters that predict the floating status of the spinal zzso at the anterior elements of the cervical spine in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to evaluate the association between clinical outcome and spinal zzso zzso 

zzso US has been used to evaluate the status of the spinal zzso after cervical zzso for cervical zzso Few studies have evaluated the zzso zzso parameters for zzso US zzso 

Imaging and clinical outcome data were collected from 101 consecutive patients who underwent cervical expansive zzso for cervical zzso at zzso zzso zzso Hospital, Japan, from April 2004 to April zzso The zzso parameters associated with spinal zzso floating in zzso US and zzso MR images were zzso zzso parameters for the rate of recovery according to the Japanese zzso Association score for cervical zzso at each follow-up session were also zzso 

zzso parameters for spinal zzso floating after zzso in zzso US were the cervical zzso 2 to 7 zzso zzso alignment in the standing neutral position on zzso plain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso for spinal zzso floating in zzso zzso was the zzso beak angle in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso Japanese zzso Association score and spinal zzso floating at anterior elements of the cervical spine in zzso US were zzso parameters for clinical zzso 

zzso US was more useful than zzso zzso for predicting the clinical outcome of cervical expansive zzso zzso of the zzso parameters for spinal zzso floating after cervical expansive zzso could help evaluate the limitations of zzso zzso
