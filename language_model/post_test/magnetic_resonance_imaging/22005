To determine whether zzso and zzso sequences contribute to the MR imaging diagnosis of zzso zzso 

21 patients with zzso of the zzso were zzso examined with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso using the following zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso spin echo zzso and fat suppressed zzso zzso sequences before and after zzso The sequences were evaluated separately for the presence of zzso zzso Image quality and diagnostic confidence were classified on a scale of zzso zzso zzso were compared to the results of the zzso zzso 

zzso specificity and diagnostic accuracy were highest for zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences with zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed no improvement compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly worse than zzso With similar image quality zzso zzso zzso diagnostic confidence was higher on zzso than on any of the other sequences zzso zzso zzso 

Considering the zzso of the examination, for the MR diagnosis of zzso invasion the use of zzso zzso sequences can be abandoned in zzso of zzso zzso zzso
