A sterile inflammation in the cavernous zzso was hypothesized to zzso cluster headache zzso zzso inflammation is accompanied by the zzso of plasma proteins in the surrounding zzso We tested the hypothesis of an inflammatory process in the cavernous zzso in zzso patients using zzso serum zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Six patients with episodic zzso were zzso After baseline imaging, zzso attacks were induced by IV injection of zzso The patients remained zzso for 20 zzso A second zzso was performed after successful zzso Region of interest zzso analysis was performed on the basis of zzso zzso zzso There was no statistical difference between the zzso zzso in the zzso cavernous zzso before and after induction of an acute zzso zzso There was no evidence for zzso zzso in the cavernous zzso during the active episode as compared with the zzso zzso Our results do not support the hypothesis of an inflammation in the cavernous zzso
