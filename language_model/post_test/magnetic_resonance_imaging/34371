zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso are promising methods for evaluating zzso and zzso zzso or zzso The aim of this study was to compare the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso and surgical exploration in the assessment of zzso zzso or zzso complicating Crohn's zzso 

Twenty-two patients with Crohn's disease, seven men and 15 women of mean age 38 zzso zzso years, were included in this prospective zzso All patients underwent AES zzso probe 7 zzso zzso and operative zzso 

AES and zzso demonstrated 14 and nine zzso respectively, whereas 11 zzso were confirmed by surgical exploration in ten zzso The sensitivity of AES and zzso as means of evaluating zzso zzso was 100 and 55 per cent zzso The agreement per patient was 86 per cent (19 of zzso for AES and 59 per cent zzso of zzso for zzso AES and zzso demonstrated 26 and 14 zzso respectively, whereas 27 zzso were confirmed during surgical exploration in 16 zzso The sensitivity of AES and zzso was 89 and 48 per cent zzso The level of agreement per patient was 82 per cent (18 of zzso for AES and 50 per cent (11 of zzso for zzso 

AES with a linear probe is more accurate than zzso in detecting zzso zzso complicating Crohn's disease, and much more accurate in the evaluation of complex zzso
