The human brain responds to recognizable signals for sex and for rewarding drugs of abuse by zzso of zzso reward zzso Does the brain respond in similar way to such reward signals even when they are zzso zzso presented in a way that prevents their conscious zzso Can the brain response to zzso reward cues predict the future affective response to recognizable versions of such cues, revealing a link between zzso processes inside and outside zzso 

We exploited the fast zzso resolution of zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to test the brain response to zzso zzso cocaine, zzso aversive and neutral cues of 33 milliseconds duration in male cocaine patients zzso zzso zzso Two days after zzso the affective zzso for visible versions of each cue type was determined using an affective bias zzso zzso We zzso for the first time, zzso brain zzso by zzso drug and sexual cues of only 33 zzso zzso zzso increased activity in an large interconnected zzso zzso cluster to the zzso cocaine cues strongly predicted future positive affect to visible versions of the same cues in subsequent zzso testing, pointing both to the functional significance of the rapid brain response, and to shared brain zzso for zzso motivation within and outside zzso 

These findings represent the first evidence that brain reward zzso responds to drug and sexual cues presented outside zzso The results underscore the sensitivity of the brain to zzso reward signals and may represent the zzso primordial signature for zzso The zzso brain response to reward cues outside awareness may represent a potential vulnerability in disorders zzso the zzso for whom zzso zzso motivation is a central zzso
