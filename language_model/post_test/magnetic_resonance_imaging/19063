To study the diagnostic usefulness of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso magnetic stimulation zzso in detecting central zzso deficits in early multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso responses evoked by zzso are accepted as a sensitive diagnostic tool in multiple zzso Recently, zzso evoked by zzso has been introduced as a new paradigm to test the function of zzso zzso zzso both hand associated motor zzso 

zzso zzso of the motor zzso was performed in 50 patients with early zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso motor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and duration of zzso stimulation effects were zzso 

zzso disclosed abnormalities of zzso zzso responses in zzso and of zzso in zzso of the zzso 

The assessment of zzso allows the discovery of zzso within the zzso white matter that were not accessible by zzso techniques zzso This new paradigm increases the sensitivity of zzso with which to detect central zzso deficits in early multiple zzso
