To examine the effects of early zzso in the visual zzso on visual zzso and to identify early zzso indicators of visual zzso 

The visual function of 37 infants with zzso brain zzso on magnetic resonance imaging was assessed using zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso visual zzso was observed in most infants with large bilateral zzso zzso but all the infants with associated zzso zzso involvement had abnormal visual zzso Visual abnormalities were also present in six infants with isolated zzso zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso zzso may have an integral role in human visual development and that their presence on zzso zzso could be an early marker of abnormal visual zzso
