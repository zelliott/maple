Prior to surgery or zzso therapy for the lower zzso zzso veins or deep zzso zzso zzso zzso provides useful zzso But it depends on the operator's technique, each image is limited to a small field of view and interpretation may be zzso On the other hand, magnetic resonance zzso imaging is now available with several zzso techniques using zzso to demonstrate the gross and objective zzso of these zzso less zzso than the conventional ascending zzso As zzso MR zzso fat suppressed three-dimensional zzso zzso balanced zzso field echo zzso is mainly applied in the zzso zzso The zzso veins on the muscle zzso are easily recognized on volume rendering and the zzso veins can be identified on maximum intensity projection zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid attenuated inversion zzso is added when zzso joint zzso or zzso masks the zzso For zzso direct zzso imaging zzso using fat suppressed zzso zzso inversion zzso blood suppressed zzso echo sequence is zzso However, the signal intensity of zzso depends on the zzso age on zzso and is sometimes confusing on zzso After zzso administration, blood shows higher signal intensity than clots regardless of the age and zzso can be easily depicted as filling defects on the zzso zzso and summarized on the soap zzso
