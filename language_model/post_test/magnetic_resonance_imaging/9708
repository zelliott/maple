The zzso of zzso zzso is a crucial step in several statistical zzso Especially when using few samples of a high zzso representation of shapes, the standard maximum likelihood zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can be far from the truth, is often rank zzso and may lead to unreliable zzso In this paper, we discuss zzso by prior knowledge using maximum a zzso zzso zzso We compare zzso to zzso using a number of zzso and to zzso zzso We evaluate the zzso estimates on both synthetic and real data, and we analyze the zzso influence on a zzso reconstruction task, where high resolution vertebra and cartilage models are reconstructed from incomplete and lower zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that our methods outperform the traditional zzso method and zzso zzso
