zzso zzso status is a major zzso factor and a criterion for zzso therapy in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso procedure has emerged as a possible alternative to systematic zzso The aims of this study were to determine the detection rate and the zzso rate of the zzso zzso and its contribution to the staging of women with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso cancer underwent the zzso zzso procedure followed by pelvic zzso zzso were detected with a dual or single zzso method in 39 and 7 cases, zzso All zzso were zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso were identified in 40 patients zzso whose mean number of zzso was zzso zzso zzso The zzso detection rate was significantly lower with the single label than with the dual label zzso zzso zzso Ten women zzso had a positive zzso on final zzso zzso there were no false zzso A correlation was observed between zzso zzso involvement and both zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso space involvement zzso zzso zzso The stage predicted by magnetic resonance zzso imaging correlated poorly with the Federation International of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among the ten women with a positive zzso three of the four women with a grade 1 zzso at biopsy had grade 2-3 disease on final zzso Seven of the ten women with a positive zzso underwent external pelvic zzso based solely on their zzso zzso 

The zzso procedure can reliably determine zzso zzso status in women with zzso zzso Given the limited capacity of MR imaging to detect zzso invasion, and of biopsy to determine zzso grade, our results support the systematic use of the zzso procedure in women with zzso cancer, including those with presumed zzso disease and/or zzso zzso
