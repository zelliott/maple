The natural history of the zzso zzso Type I zzso is incompletely zzso The authors report on the outcome of a large group of patients with zzso that were initially selected for zzso zzso 

The authors identified 147 patients in whom zzso was diagnosed on MR imaging, who were not offered surgery at the time of diagnosis, and in whom at least 1 year of clinical and MR imaging follow-up was available after the initial zzso zzso These patients were included in an outcome zzso 

Patients were followed clinically and by MR imaging for a mean duration of zzso and zzso years, zzso Of the 147 patients, 9 had new symptoms attributed to the zzso during the follow-up zzso During this time, development of a spinal zzso zzso occurred in 8 zzso 5 of these patients had a prior diagnosis of a zzso state or a zzso central zzso zzso resolution of a zzso occurred in 3 zzso Multiple zzso flow studies were obtained in 74 zzso Of these patients, 23 had improvement in zzso flow, 39 had no change, and 12 showed worsening zzso flow at the zzso zzso There was no significant change in the mean amount of zzso zzso zzso over the follow-up zzso Fourteen patients underwent surgical treatment for zzso There were no differences in initial zzso zzso zzso or zzso flow at the zzso zzso in those who ultimately underwent surgery compared with those who did zzso 

In patients with zzso that are selected for zzso management, the natural history is usually benign, although spontaneous improvement and worsening are occasionally zzso
