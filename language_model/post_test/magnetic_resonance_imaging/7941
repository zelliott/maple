To evaluate the additional value of zzso stress testing in patients with repaired zzso of zzso zzso by relating stress imaging parameters at baseline to relevant parameters of clinical condition and right zzso zzso size during a serial zzso 

We zzso included 27 patients zzso zzso 4 years at zzso who were studied twice with a zzso zzso Patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to assess RV zzso and zzso function at rest and during zzso zzso zzso response to zzso was defined as a decrease in RV zzso volume, and a increase in RV ejection fraction zzso during zzso Exercise testing and zzso were performed to determine peak oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso corrected for heart rate zzso zzso RV volumes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased significantly from baseline to zzso peak zzso tended to decrease (95 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Response to zzso was normal in 26 of 27 patients and remained stable during the follow-up zzso increase in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A smaller relative increase in zzso during stress at baseline related to a larger relative decrease in peak zzso during the follow-up zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No significant associations were found with the relative increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso or RV zzso volume during a zzso zzso 

In a young zzso population, response to zzso stress was normal and remained stable during the zzso zzso A smaller increase in zzso during stress at baseline was zzso for a larger decrease in peak zzso during the zzso zzso
