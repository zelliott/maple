This work evaluated the feasibility of dynamic MR zzso zzso to zzso structural changes in bovine zzso cartilage induced by selective zzso zzso The ability of the technique to zzso the zzso response of normal cartilage to zzso in the zzso range was also zzso zzso cartilage plugs of 8 zzso in diameter were used for this zzso The zzso zzso zzso of each cartilage plug was measured before and after 16 zzso of zzso treatments by dynamic zzso at zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to selectively affect the collagen and zzso contents of the zzso Additionally, normal cartilage plugs were tested by dynamic zzso at zzso of zzso zzso Measured zzso of cartilage plugs showed a significant decrease zzso P zzso zzso after zzso treatment and a significant decrease zzso P zzso zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso increase zzso zzso zzso in the speed of zzso wave propagation with zzso frequency was observed in cartilage, indicating that wave speed is dominated by zzso zzso These experiments suggest that dynamic zzso can provide a sensitive quantitative tool to characterize the degradation process and zzso behavior of zzso
