zzso or zzso following zzso zzso is a rare but potentially devastating complication unless diagnosed zzso In order to diagnose spinal zzso involvement, the currently recommended imaging test is magnetic resonance imaging zzso Despite this, no previous studies have been performed to define typical zzso findings following zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this pilot study was to compare magnetic resonance images before and after zzso injection to define the characteristic appearance of zzso following an zzso zzso steroid zzso 

Ten patients were zzso enrolled and received an zzso study before and after an zzso injection of steroids plus local zzso for chronic low back pain using a loss of resistance to air zzso The magnetic resonance images were reviewed by 2 zzso who were blinded as to whether the scan was performed before or after the zzso zzso 

Review of 20 zzso studies revealed no fluid collections, zzso or mass effect on the zzso zzso A needle track and a small amount of zzso air was seen in the majority of zzso scans, but did not cause zzso of the zzso zzso in any zzso None of the findings observed by the zzso in the zzso scans were considered clinically zzso 

The results of this pilot study demonstrated that after zzso zzso injection in otherwise healthy patients, there were no new zzso findings on zzso zzso Further zzso studies in large populations and in different clinical situations should be performed to confirm these preliminary zzso
