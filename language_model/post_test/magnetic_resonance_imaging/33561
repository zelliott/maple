The purpose of this article is to review reliability and zzso of imaging diagnosis of zzso joint zzso zzso and zzso are basic imaging techniques for assessment of the zzso zzso These can be used for evaluation of zzso disease and as a baseline for zzso In patients with symptoms from the joint, zzso and zzso are rarely zzso and evaluation of the soft zzso is frequently zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging have all been used for evaluation of the zzso components of the zzso zzso studies of these techniques have demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for magnetic resonance zzso zzso is relatively insensitive for detection of zzso and lateral zzso zzso resonance imaging accurately depicts both hard and soft zzso and this technique is emerging as the prime diagnostic imaging technique in patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of a disorder of the zzso zzso The most frequent findings when patients with clinical symptoms of zzso joint disorders are zzso are different forms of disc displacement and degenerative joint zzso Studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of different forms of disc displacement in patients, although these abnormalities are also seen in some zzso zzso Future research should further refine imaging techniques to come closer to an understanding of the association between zzso zzso and patient zzso
