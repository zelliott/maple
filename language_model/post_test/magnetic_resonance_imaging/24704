To analyze the magnetic resonance zzso imaging findings of invasive zzso zzso of the zzso 

MR images were zzso evaluated in 14 patients (age zzso zzso mean age: 49 zzso with zzso confirmed invasive zzso zzso of the zzso The enhancement type zzso shape, margin, contrast enhancement, and zzso curve pattern on the dynamic study were correlated with the zzso zzso Associated findings, such as zzso zzso change, skin change and enlarged zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

The most common features of the masses were irregular shape (12 of 14 patients, zzso and irregular or zzso margin (11 of 14 patients, zzso The contrast enhancement was zzso in 11 patients zzso rim enhancement in 2 cases zzso and homogeneous in one patient zzso The zzso kinetic pattern was rapid increase zzso of 14, zzso in the initial phase and zzso (11 of 14, zzso in the delayed zzso Associated zzso like enhancement was shown in 4 patients, representing zzso zzso in zzso MR imaging helped detect additional sites of cancer other than the index zzso in 3 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in 7 of the 14 patients zzso 

zzso zzso zzso appears as a mass with an irregular shape, irregular or zzso margin and zzso enhancement on MR zzso Though these findings are not specific and are also observed with other breast zzso invasive zzso zzso frequently showed multiple zzso accompanying zzso enhancement and zzso zzso zzso zzso
