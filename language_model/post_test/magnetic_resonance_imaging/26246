The authors analyzed the cases of zzso patients with zzso to assess the appropriate surgical zzso 

Depending on the zzso factors and treatment considerations the series was classified into three zzso Group I were cases where there was no zzso zzso zzso zzso Group II cases had zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and Group III consisted of cases where the zzso was secondary to an obvious zzso such as a mass zzso either in the zzso zzso zzso or in the spine or a severe zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso in association with zzso zzso were not zzso 

We concluded that for Group I cases zzso zzso is the ideal form of zzso In Group II cases zzso zzso zzso zzso is satisfactory and zzso Good results were obtained even in cases where either a zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with a zzso shunt was zzso Only zzso shunt (without a zzso zzso zzso in Group II cases was found to produce poor zzso Group III cases should be treated for the primary zzso zzso Only zzso drainage procedure without treatment of zzso in these cases produced poor zzso It was observed that clinical outcome rather than zzso improvement is the reliable indicator of the surgical zzso
