zzso has demonstrated clinical zzso and improved diagnostic capability in the musculoskeletal system to a degree rivaling its success in the zzso zzso For certain regions such as the zzso the superficial nature of these structures is ideal for the application of localized zzso zzso enabling considerably improved zzso spatial resolution, and zzso zzso The zzso capability is often invaluable in assessing such regions as the zzso surfaces of the zzso It has been shown to be the most sensitive single test for diagnosing avascular zzso and has yielded very high resolution images of the internal architecture of the zzso and soft zzso in an entirely zzso manner and without the need for the administration of zzso contrast zzso Short TE images are quite useful in evaluating fatty background regions of interest, such as the bone zzso and subcutaneous zzso whereas long zzso and TE studies are frequently more suitable for soft tissue zzso The lack of zzso radiation and the continued failure of intensive research to disclose any deleterious effects at the levels used for clinical diagnostic imaging make this tool especially appealing for application to the pediatric zzso With the continual development of new pulsing zzso contrast agents, and further advances in zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging of the musculoskeletal system is ensured of a solid role in the clinical diagnostic evaluation of the pediatric zzso
