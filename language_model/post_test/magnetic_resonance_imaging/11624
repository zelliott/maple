zzso zzso may play an important role in acute cerebral zzso Recent technological advances in zzso systems provide a feasible diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso by clearly visualizing flow conditions and vessel zzso A zzso man with chronic zzso failure underwent duplex zzso ultrasound in which zzso plaque on carotid zzso wall was zzso Color zzso imaging showed that the plaque shoulder at the zzso site was hit by forward flow to the brain and zzso zzso flow in the inner space of the plaque was zzso zzso zzso at the corresponding site of zzso plaque revealed the space within the plaque similarly zzso A magnetic resonance imaging of brain performed after identifying plaque zzso revealed small cerebral zzso at the cerebral zzso zzso zzso could be demonstrated by color zzso imaging at the zzso edge of plaque and zzso flow in the zzso space may have released small zzso to vessel zzso zzso zzso of the carotid artery may play an important role in the development of small cerebral zzso
