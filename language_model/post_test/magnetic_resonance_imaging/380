The changing trends in the management of zzso zzso zzso in our practice over the last two decades as well as the current status are presented zzso 

The observations are based on the experience of 559 consecutive cases of VS operated by the first author between 1987 and 2008, zzso of which were operated by zzso and 139 by gamma knife zzso zzso (18 of which were previously operated by the zzso A detailed analysis of zzso managed patients in two different periods zzso consecutive patients each before 1993 and zzso were compared to see the changing trend and document current zzso 

In the initial experience zzso the emphasis in zzso was preserving life, total zzso of tumor and preservation of function in that zzso In the 21 zzso century, the emphasis in zzso has been all about functional zzso In 100 consecutive cases of VS zzso zzso that were treated zzso between zzso there were four small tumors zzso zzso 14 zzso tumors zzso zzso and 82 large tumors zzso zzso The total zzso rate was zzso The facial nerve anatomical preservation rate was zzso and function was Grade III zzso zzso or better in zzso Both the total zzso rate and facial function of Grade II HB or better were zzso in cases with tumor size less than three zzso zzso hearing preservation was achieved in ten zzso There was no operative zzso 

Total zzso of zzso though aimed at, is no more pursued at the cost of facial zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and observation are all valid options in the management of VS and choosing the correct zzso helps in achieving optimal zzso
