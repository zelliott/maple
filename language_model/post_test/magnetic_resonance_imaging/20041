Although liability to psychosis is thought to have its origins in cerebral zzso expressed as cerebral zzso and white matter loss, less is known about the degree to which such vulnerabilities impact on functional zzso in particular altered stress zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Davis, zzso Buchanan, zzso zzso zzso Munson, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso on plasma zzso acid in zzso zzso to prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reported that lower prefrontal zzso volume was associated with altered zzso stress response, but this finding has never been zzso 

Thirty-one patients with psychosis underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging scanning and a zzso stress paradigm zzso zzso zzso condition versus zzso zzso that yielded information on plasma zzso acid zzso zzso Total cerebral tissue volumes were derived from automated zzso zzso zzso between zzso stress and tissue volumes (as well as their zzso on the one hand, and plasma zzso level on the other, were investigated using zzso random zzso zzso 

Analysis revealed a significant increase in plasma zzso over time in the zzso zzso The increase in zzso in the stress condition was stronger in patients with lower zzso and white matter zzso There was no significant interaction between zzso stress and zzso zzso 

Lower zzso and white matter volumes in schizophrenia are associated with a zzso zzso zzso stress zzso These findings may support the hypothesis that zzso in zzso connections affect psychosis zzso through an altered stress zzso
