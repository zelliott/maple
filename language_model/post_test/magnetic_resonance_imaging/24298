zzso zzso are often associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso correction requires accurate evaluation of the presence and position of such zzso zzso is currently the chosen zzso for the detection of zzso The role of zzso is zzso 

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of MR versus zzso zzso in the zzso evaluation of infants with zzso zzso 

We conducted a pilot study of infants requiring zzso zzso for initial management of zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso of the pelvis was acquired during introduction of saline into the zzso zzso zzso were compared among MR zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Eight children were zzso Median age at zzso was 15 weeks, zzso range zzso zzso all were zzso There was full agreement among MR zzso zzso zzso and surgical zzso 

The pilot data suggest that MR zzso is promising in the zzso evaluation of children with zzso zzso
