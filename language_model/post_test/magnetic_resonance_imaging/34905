There have been no reports indicating zzso variations in zzso at different portions of each zzso zzso Eight zzso healthy volunteers between 22 and 29 years old had zzso of their zzso spine, twice on the same day (in the morning and zzso Forty zzso discs were studied and the signal intensity change was measured from three portions of each disc (a total of 120 zzso No visible changes could be detected between scans by blinded zzso However, the calculated signal intensity changes showed an average loss of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso Height loss of the disc showed an average loss of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso An increase of disc zzso at zzso level zzso was zzso but zzso level was less than zzso Loss of body height averaged a loss of 7 zzso zzso of body zzso There was no correlation between reduced signal intensity and height loss at the zzso portion zzso zzso zzso but there was a close relation at the zzso portion zzso zzso zzso zzso change of the disc zzso was not correlated with reduced signal intensity zzso zzso zzso or height loss zzso zzso zzso zzso fluid change was not necessarily influenced by the disc height loss, and height loss did not necessarily have an effect on disc zzso But zzso change showed a trend that was reflected in reduced signal intensity, height loss, and an increase of disc zzso which was more apparent from the zzso portion to the post, portion on moving down to the lower zzso Loss of disc height was one factor in the reduction of body zzso These changes occurred randomly throughout 5 zzso disc levels in each zzso
