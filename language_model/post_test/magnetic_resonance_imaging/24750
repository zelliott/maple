Recent theories propose that the prefrontal zzso zzso is organized in a zzso fashion with more abstract, higher level information represented in anterior regions and more concrete, lower level information represented in zzso zzso This zzso organization zzso flexible adjustments of action plans based on the zzso zzso models suggest that such zzso organization in the zzso is achieved through interactions with the zzso zzso zzso wherein the zzso gate relevant contexts into the zzso Here, we tested this proposal using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Participants were scanned while updating working memory zzso with 2 levels of zzso zzso zzso with zzso abstraction proposals, higher level context updates involved anterior portions of the zzso zzso zzso whereas lower level context updates involved zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso models were only partially supported as the zzso were sensitive to higher, but not lower level context zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the opposite zzso zzso examining changes in functional connectivity confirmed zzso roles of the anterior zzso during higher level context updates and zzso zzso during lower level context zzso These results suggest that zzso contexts are organized by distinct zzso and zzso zzso
