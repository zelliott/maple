zzso research has been hindered by the inability to zzso measure zzso tumor growth in a zzso efficient zzso Recently, the zzso gene has been zzso into cancer lines to obtain cells that express the zzso zzso which zzso zzso in a reaction that releases zzso energy that can be measured zzso by zzso imaging zzso zzso The authors describe a mouse model of zzso zzso that uses this novel zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and selected with zzso These cells were zzso implanted at skull base and cerebral zzso locations in nude zzso Animals were zzso for zzso zzso and 5 mice underwent magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso were harvested for zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso cell lines were successfully implanted zzso in zzso The tumor induction rate for zzso skull base tumors was zzso zzso of 40 zzso zzso analysis of zzso skull base tumor volume measured on MR imaging correlated with the results of zzso showed an R value of zzso The tumors exhibited characteristics of aggressive zzso by zzso along zzso planes and invading zzso 

zzso zzso was successfully used to image zzso zzso in zzso The tumors grew in a fashion similar to that of aggressive zzso in humans, and exhibited the zzso zzso and zzso features characteristic of zzso This animal model overcomes the main obstacle in studying zzso zzso by enabling sequential zzso tumor measurement in a cost-effective zzso
