We present a case of zzso attributed to a zzso zzso zzso web at zzso The zzso fluid pressure zzso to the web was higher than the zzso fluid pressure zzso to the zzso causing a zzso in the zzso and cervical spinal zzso above the zzso 

A 43-year-old man presented with zzso and a burning pain in his left upper back and zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a zzso zzso that terminated relatively abruptly at zzso Because of the abrupt termination of the zzso at T4 and the slight zzso displacement of the spinal zzso at this level, a zzso zzso web was zzso 

A T4 zzso was zzso zzso ultrasound before opening of the zzso zzso showed a pulsating zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was opened and the web zzso thus widely zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso dramatically decreased in size and the patient's pain improved but did not resolve zzso 

In patients with presumed idiopathic zzso imaging studies should be closely inspected for the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso web with zzso can result in resolution of the zzso and improvement in neurological zzso zzso formation in patients with these zzso may occur in the area of the spinal zzso where there is lower zzso fluid pressure, which may be either zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso We evaluate this hypothesis by comparing our case with other published zzso
