A large variety of cardiac zzso sequences have been introduced for heart zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish a zzso and robust examination protocol for standard zzso systems applying zzso echo sequences with zzso and zzso zzso 

Fifty-one patients received zzso zzso of the heart with zzso preparation, comparing three zzso and three zzso sequences with a zzso zzso spin echo reference zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso and cavity and the extent of flow and motion artifacts were zzso 

The zzso and left zzso cavity were depicted best with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso spin echo zzso The zzso zzso sequences produced marked artifacts and therefore were of poor diagnostic zzso The zzso haste sequence was best suited for fat zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence with zzso imaging proved to be most appropriate for zzso zzso 

zzso depiction of heart zzso with comprehensive evaluation of signal changes can be achieved using zzso spin echo and zzso spin echo sequences with zzso For rational imaging of zzso and heart chamber zzso zzso and zzso sequences should be zzso
