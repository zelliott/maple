We report on a method for the zzso follow-up of individual white matter zzso zzso and on its application to the study of zzso natural evolution in a cohort of zzso elderly over a zzso zzso 

For each subject, automated zzso detection was performed on zzso MR images acquired both at baseline and at follow-up after registration in a common zzso The detection zzso was designed both to track zzso previously existing at baseline and to identify newly formed zzso 

The average annual change in zzso load was found to be zzso zzso zzso of this change being attributable to newly formed zzso zzso analyses showed that change in zzso was mainly explained by progression of zzso and zzso zzso while the load of zzso in the deep white matter zones was found stable over 4 years of the zzso zzso zzso mapping confirmed these spatial zzso change zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso High blood pressure was not a significant predictor of the annual change in zzso 

This study proposes a new scheme for the zzso study of zzso change by zzso worsening of zzso zzso from surfacing of new zzso and may thus contribute to help understanding and characterizing the neurological and zzso bases of these two processes and their potential zzso
