To compare ultrasound zzso zzso index contrast enhanced US zzso and zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

From January to June 2006, 110 patients (65 zzso 45 zzso mean age 62 years; range zzso with suspected zzso zzso from zzso cancer were zzso evaluated with zzso zzso and zzso by two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a follow-up up for at least 6 months by using zzso or zzso zzso was considered the gold zzso zzso test was zzso 

zzso standards revealed 430 zzso in 110 zzso On a zzso analysis, zzso improved US sensitivity from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso On a zzso analysis, zzso improved the sensitivity of US from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity increased from zzso to zzso No significant differences in sensitivity or specificity between zzso and zzso were zzso zzso US was significantly more sensitive than baseline US in the detection of zzso smaller than 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso with an increase in sensitivity from zzso to zzso no significant statistical difference was identified when compared with zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso is significantly more accurate than US and highly comparable with zzso in the detection of liver zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the evaluation of patients with suspected zzso zzso from zzso zzso US examination must be performed after contrast zzso
