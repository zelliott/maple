Whole zzso volumes of patients and controls were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and zzso volumes and results zzso A zzso of patients were zzso after weight zzso 

Total white matter and several regional white matter volumes were significantly reduced and total and regional zzso volumes were significantly increased in patients versus controls whereas gray matter was not significantly zzso Total and regional zzso volumes were significantly decreased in patients upon weight zzso whereas white and gray matter volumes zzso 

These changes in brain tissue may be related to a variety of zzso zzso We zzso that zzso growth zzso may be zzso
