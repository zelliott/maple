zzso processes involving the recruitment of additional cerebral areas can limit cognitive impairment caused by brain damage as revealed by zzso Multiple sclerosis zzso is characterized by frequent cognitive deficiencies and diffuse brain zzso zzso the missing or disturbed processes resulting in cognitive compensation failure is a major challenge in zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso zzso zzso and 20 healthy controls underwent an zzso paradigm based on zzso task with increasing complexity and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

To perform all the zzso conditions, patients with zzso exhibited supplementary cerebral recruitment compared to zzso For the most complex condition, patients presented both collapse of additional cerebral recruitment and significant lower cognitive performance compared to zzso In patients, both response times and diffuse tissue damage were correlated with zzso frontal zzso zzso connectivity analysis demonstrated strong correlation between zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso frontal region zzso 

High cognitive demand causes beneficial cerebral recruitment failure, leading to cognitive impairment in patients with zzso zzso zzso mechanisms preserving good cognitive performances operate by a new cerebral strategy involving zzso prefrontal regions zzso instead of zzso regions seen in zzso This new recruitment is diffuse tissue zzso Missing zzso involvement argues for an inability to generate zzso cognitive automation processes in patients, directly leading to recruitment of high-level decision-making zzso zzso zzso of cortical regions could explain the limiting effect of the cognitive load on the cognitive zzso phenomena in patients with zzso
