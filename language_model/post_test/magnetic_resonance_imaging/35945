The quantitative nature of phase contrast magnetic resonance zzso is zzso and a technique of blood flow measurement that is independent of system and patient parameters is zzso Phantom and patient studies demonstrate that quantitative flow zzso by phase contrast zzso can be routinely obtained with good accuracy despite zzso sensitivity profiles, blood flow zzso and zzso changes in system zzso The zzso method requires the acquisition of only two flow images and thus can be performed as part of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of any flow profile can be accomplished with this zzso The solutions for plug flow and zzso flow are zzso
