zzso mouse models of prostate cancer provide an opportunity to conduct genetic tests of the molecular mechanisms underlying initiation and progression of zzso They also allow assessment of the effects of various pharmacological zzso However, one limitation that has zzso full exploitation of these models is the lack of in zzso imaging procedures of sufficient sensitivity and resolution to detect and follow tumors at early stages of zzso We have addressed this problem through the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso A transgenic mouse model zzso of prostate cancer was used to show that zzso can detect tumors zzso zzso in zzso zzso enhanced zzso contrast results from a zzso difference in apparent diffusion zzso between benign and zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso Clinical application of zzso may offer advantages over current zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso
