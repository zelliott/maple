zzso joint zzso zzso is noted only when it interferes with smooth zzso zzso These zzso zzso clicking sounds and jerky zzso zzso result from zzso dislocation in front of the zzso at wide mouth zzso or alternatively in front of the zzso disc zzso disc zzso The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso of zzso persons are positioned more zzso to the crest of the zzso during maximum mouth opening than those of persons without zzso zzso zzso zzso disc displacement was also zzso Nine persons with symptomatic zzso and nine control persons free of internal zzso were included, their diagnoses being based upon zzso movement zzso zzso positions during maximum mouth opening were zzso on magnetic resonance images with two slightly different methods, showing the degree to which the zzso are displaced around the zzso No zzso disc zzso were found in any of the magnetic resonance zzso After excluding an zzso and using both measurement methods, a small difference in zzso position was found between the two groups of zzso The zzso of all zzso persons zzso beyond the zzso however, so were the zzso of nearly half of the zzso The large overlap between both groups suggests that zzso position alone is not a good predictor for symptomatic zzso zzso It is probably the combination of zzso location in front of the zzso with a particular line of action of the zzso muscles, which gives rise to functional signs of zzso
