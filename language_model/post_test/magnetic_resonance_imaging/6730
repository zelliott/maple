To determine whether the apparent diffusion zzso zzso can be used to distinguish between tumor tissue and zzso brain tissue in cerebral zzso 

Twenty-two patients with 44 zzso were enrolled in this zzso zzso maps calculated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence were zzso with conventional MR zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers were used for correlation with the zzso zzso zzso values and zzso ratios of the different sequences were calculated and compared for tumor tissue and zzso brain zzso A zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic value of the zzso zzso 

The zzso values and ratios demonstrated a large overlap between tumor tissue and zzso zzso Group comparisons revealed a significantly zzso lower zzso ratio in tumor tissue zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso whereas the absolute zzso values did not differ zzso In the zzso zzso analysis, the zzso ratio of the zzso zzso zzso sequence was the most valuable predictor of the presence of tumor zzso The zzso value and ratio were not identified as significant zzso 

The zzso is not helpful for distinguishing tumor tissue from zzso brain tissue in zzso
