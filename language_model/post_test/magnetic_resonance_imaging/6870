zzso therapy is the standard therapy in zzso zzso patients, however its efficacy after entire zzso replacement is zzso The aim of this study was to describe the influence of zzso entire zzso replacement and zzso therapy on blood pressure and wave reflections in zzso zzso 

Four zzso patients zzso age zzso zzso and 8 age matched control subjects were zzso Blood pressure and wave reflections zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied by means of magnetic resonance imaging, continuous zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso zzso Patients were studied with zzso zzso and without zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, zzso zzso pressure zzso vs zzso zzso pulse pressure zzso vs zzso zzso wave speed zzso vs zzso m zzso and reflection zzso zzso vs zzso were significantly increased compared to zzso There was no difference in zzso pressure between various medications in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and without zzso therapy zzso zzso Higher reflection zzso were seen in patients with zzso compared to discontinued medication zzso vs zzso and also the zzso index was higher with zzso compared to zzso and discontinued medication zzso vs zzso vs zzso zzso 

Our results describe increased pulse pressure, zzso pressure, wave speed and wave reflections in four zzso patients after entire zzso zzso The use of zzso or zzso did not decrease zzso pressure and with zzso increased wave reflections were zzso zzso the beneficial effect of zzso in these patients is zzso
