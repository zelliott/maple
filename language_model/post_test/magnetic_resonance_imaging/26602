The zzso model with 7 specified zzso represents a theoretical construct of functionally zzso divisions of the zzso zzso based on integrated zzso zzso Under this zzso we aimed to investigate the functional specialization of the human zzso zzso by analyzing the zzso functional connectivity zzso of each zzso from a network zzso In 20 healthy subjects we systematically investigated the zzso patterns of the bilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso anterior zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that each zzso zzso was specifically integrated in the zzso functional networks and showed zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso were involved in an affective network and zzso with the zzso and cognitive networks, while the zzso also correlated with the zzso network and zzso with the visual zzso In the zzso cortex, however, the zzso was correlated with the cognitive and zzso networks and zzso with the zzso affective and zzso networks, whereas the zzso only correlated with the zzso network and zzso with the cognitive and visual zzso The zzso and zzso involved in the zzso network and zzso with the zzso cognitive and visual networks, in contrast, the zzso was mainly correlated with the zzso and zzso Based on a strong hypothesis driven approach of anatomical partitions of the zzso cortex, we could confirm their segregation in terms of functional zzso as suggested earlier by task studies or exploratory zzso zzso
