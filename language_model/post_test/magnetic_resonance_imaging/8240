zzso with an At zzso Mental State zzso have a very high risk of developing a psychotic disorder but the basis of this risk is zzso We addressed this issue by studying gray matter volume in this group with magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Thirty-five individuals with an zzso 25 patients with first episode zzso and 22 healthy volunteers were studied using a zzso zzso zzso Twelve zzso of the zzso group developed schizophrenia in the 2 years subsequent to zzso 

There were significant zzso differences between the three groups in the left zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In these regions, the volume in the zzso group was smaller than in volunteers but not significantly different from that in the first episode zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso and control groups revealed additional areas of reduced volume in the left zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso group, those subjects who later developed psychosis had less gray matter than subjects who did not in the right zzso inferior frontal and superior zzso zzso 

The zzso was associated with reductions in gray matter volume in areas that are also reduced in zzso suggesting that these are a correlate of an increased vulnerability to zzso zzso differences within the zzso group may be related to the subsequent onset of schizophrenia in a subset of those at high zzso
