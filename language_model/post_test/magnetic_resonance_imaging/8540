The systemic temperature is meticulously regulated to zzso degrees zzso zzso systems zzso zzso system, zzso have a considerable potential to regulate the zzso for zzso regulation, physical activity, or zzso While the regulation of the systemic temperature zzso degrees zzso is quite zzso the tolerance and regulation potential with respect to local heat is more zzso Laboratory studies provided the relationship between zzso doses and zzso zzso zzso damage for short-term zzso (in the range of minutes) is only possible for temperatures above 50 degrees zzso zzso radiation is zzso in cancer therapy, inducing local tissue temperatures in the range of zzso degrees C for zzso zzso During local zzso (with heated volumes zzso zzso specific zzso rates zzso of zzso W zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and tumor temperatures of zzso degrees C are zzso zzso no side effects or damage in the normal zzso such as muscle or skin, have been zzso During regional zzso zzso of zzso W zzso are found in heated volumes of 10 L with temperatures of zzso degrees C in zzso measurement zzso Then the zzso average zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso value 8 zzso zzso Local temperatures even for higher zzso are regulated to values of not more than zzso degrees zzso For these temperatures no damages in normal zzso have been found after regional zzso in hundreds of zzso We conclude that the zzso potential for the whole body or large body regions is limited by the cardiac zzso which can at least double the output from 5 to 10 L zzso Even higher is the potential to compensate in smaller zzso Here the zzso in muscle can be increased from the zzso value of 2-4 zzso zzso more than zzso
