Studies on the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso have largely been conducted in the adult zzso zzso the results may not always be zzso to pediatric zzso Moreover, studies involving the pediatric population have largely comprised small- zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For large zzso 10 zzso zzso in children, sparse zzso results are zzso The current study was conducted to further clarify the role of zzso in the treatment of pediatric zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed of data obtained in 105 pediatric patients zzso 18 years of zzso with cerebral zzso treated by zzso zzso surgery zzso between 1993 and zzso For statistical comparison the authors studied data acquired in zzso adult patients with zzso treated during the same zzso The patients underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm the obliteration of the zzso 

In pediatric patients, the zzso obliteration rate at 48 months after a primary zzso was zzso zzso zzso in those in whom primary treatments failed further zzso some zzso for an overall obliteration rate of zzso The efficacy of zzso correlated with the size of the zzso zzso for small, zzso for zzso and zzso for large zzso The treatments were associated with an zzso morbidity rate and zzso zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso occurred in 4 zzso of 105 zzso zzso rates at 48 months of small and extremely large zzso 20 zzso zzso were similar in the pediatric and adult groups, whereas zzso between 3 and 10 zzso responded less zzso in children zzso zzso zzso The zzso with volumes ranging from 10 to 20 zzso were also associated with a lower obliteration rate in children at 48 months, but statistical significance was not reached zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso surgery is an effective and safe treatment alternative for pediatric zzso The medium zzso and large zzso zzso tend to respond less zzso than those of comparable size in zzso
