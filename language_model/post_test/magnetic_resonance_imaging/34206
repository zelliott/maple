This study was undertaken to determine whether zzso of the ascending zzso is a predictor of long-term zzso events and zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso has been recently considered a significant predictor of zzso events and peripheral zzso but not of long-term zzso 

zzso follow-up (a total of zzso zzso was conducted of zzso consecutive patients zzso or zzso years old who underwent cardiac zzso zzso of the ascending zzso was assessed zzso zzso zzso and patients were divided into four groups according to severity zzso mild, moderate or zzso zzso artery disease was evaluated zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso zzso analysis was performed to assess the independent effect of zzso on zzso events and zzso 

A total of zzso events occurred in zzso patients zzso events 92, zzso mortality zzso Independent zzso of long-term zzso events were: hypertension zzso zzso zzso ascending zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso The independent zzso of mortality were advanced age zzso zzso zzso left zzso dysfunction zzso zzso zzso ascending zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hypertension zzso zzso zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso There was zzso increase in the zzso of both zzso events and mortality as the severity of zzso increased from zzso to moderate, and a greater than zzso increase in the zzso of both as the severity of zzso increased from zzso to zzso 

zzso of the ascending zzso is an independent predictor of long-term zzso events and zzso These results provide additional evidence that in addition to being a direct cause of cerebral zzso an zzso ascending zzso may be a marker of generalized zzso and thus of increased morbidity and zzso
