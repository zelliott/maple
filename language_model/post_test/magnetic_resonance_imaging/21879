zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging of the orbit has become widely accepted as a valuable diagnostic zzso However, there are a number of artifacts and pitfalls associated with zzso MR zzso Chemical shift artifacts may be induced by zzso fat or silicone oil used to treat retinal zzso Motion artifacts are caused primarily by unavoidable globe motion during zzso zzso due to a zzso magnetic field are particularly noticeable at zzso zzso but may also be caused by incomplete fat zzso or highly magnetic materials near the zzso zzso errors may cause artifacts such as zzso phase zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This information can be used to improve zzso image quality and avoid zzso of image zzso Use of fat zzso silicone zzso and careful patient screening for metal near the eyes and instruction to reduce motion can help reduce the occurrence of zzso In addition, optimal imaging technique is essential and should include use of proper surface zzso plane of section, and pulse zzso
