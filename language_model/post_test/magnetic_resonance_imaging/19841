In contrast to traditional anatomical and pathological methods, magnetic resonance zzso of the brain allows the zzso study of zzso changes in brain zzso and the correlation of brain zzso with brain zzso zzso resonance zzso has thereby recently emerged as one of the most promising fields in clinical zzso This review covers the last 3 years, which have witnessed remarkable progress in this alluring new zzso 

Next to the detection of structural differences in zzso and white matter in a number of brain diseases, a very important recent finding of magnetic zzso zzso is the discovery of the zzso ability to alter its shape within weeks, reflecting structural adaptation to physical and mental zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso promises to be a powerful method to study disease states of the brain and to track the effects of novel zzso 

Despite these fascinating zzso the results of zzso studies are still dependent on the properties of the individual magnetic resonance zzso which renders pooling of data almost zzso It is also not known what the structural plasticity is based on at the zzso or cellular zzso Once these obstacles are zzso magnetic zzso zzso will become a powerful method for zzso and therapeutic trials of several brain zzso
