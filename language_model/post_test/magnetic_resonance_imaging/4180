Present techniques for functional zzso rely on detecting changes in zzso that result as a consequence of brain zzso It would be useful if zzso techniques could be developed that enable imaging of a zzso directly related to zzso zzso zzso of calcium into zzso is necessary for release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can enter cells through zzso calcium channels and zzso is zzso zzso zzso in brain due to zzso should alter relaxation times offering an approach to sensitize zzso to calcium influx in the zzso To test this idea, zzso zzso was obtained from the rat brain in the presence of a continuous intravenous infusion of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso rat brain, signal enhancement was detected in regions corresponding to zzso zzso of the brain with zzso led to increase in zzso signal intensity in the brain to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso This increase in signal was dependent on the presence of zzso and was not due to changes in blood zzso It was necessary to break the blood brain barrier with zzso to make zzso accessible to the active sites for efficient zzso Enhancement of zzso signal in the brain was also detected with decreasing zzso and with zzso zzso Due to the slow clearance of zzso from the zzso region of the brain, zzso enhancement could also be detected after stimulation that occurred on awake, behaving rats outside the zzso These data indicate that zzso shows potential as a zzso contrast agent that is directly sensitive to brain zzso
