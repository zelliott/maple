In zzso zzso spin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are used to actively control the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso also induce zzso transfer zzso effects in the adjacent zzso In this work, we investigated how zzso zzso alters tissue signal in zzso zzso and, consequently, zzso zzso 

Seven volunteers were studied at zzso using a zzso FAIR sequence and zzso zzso with background zzso zzso zzso were used and the spacing between zzso zzso was varied to zzso zzso zzso Computer simulations were designed to mimic zzso signals at multiple zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was found to reduce tissue zzso and zzso values by up to 42 and 50% zzso leading to a reduction of up to zzso in the effectiveness of background suppression and, therefore, increased sensitivity to motion for the longest zzso zzso In addition, greater zzso effects were associated with reduced zzso matter zzso estimates of up to zzso 

The zzso effect associated with the zzso pulse train has a significant effect on tissue zzso It is recommended that zzso effects are zzso and both background suppression and zzso schemes are accordingly zzso to reduce the effects of zzso on accuracy and precision of zzso zzso
