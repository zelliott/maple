To evaluate the zzso enhancement dynamics of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in normal healthy zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers were evaluated with both agents by magnetic resonance zzso imaging at zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative signal intensity zzso differences between the common zzso duct zzso and liver zzso were measured before and 10, 20, 30, 40, zzso zzso and 300 zzso after contrast medium zzso 

zzso enhancement was obvious 10 zzso zzso for zzso and was noted at 20 zzso for zzso At 40 zzso zzso zzso reached its peak zzso enhancement, but at neither 30 nor 40 zzso delay was there any significant difference compared with that of zzso At later delays, the contrast between zzso and liver continued to increase for zzso whereas it decreased for zzso 

The earlier onset and longer duration of a high contrast between zzso and liver for zzso zzso examination of zzso zzso zzso zzso may provide adequate zzso imaging within a shorter time span than zzso and facilitate scheduling at the MR zzso Further studies in patients are required to compare the imaging advantages of zzso and zzso in clinical zzso
