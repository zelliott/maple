The present paper describes the detection of a magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent by zzso laser zzso zzso imaging mass zzso zzso The contrast agent was analyzed in both frozen and zzso mouse zzso zzso after its in zzso administration, and its identity was confirmed by fragmentation zzso Moreover, a zzso analysis was performed, evaluating its content in zzso from mice sacrificed at different zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a zzso analysis of zzso contrast agents and the first time that results obtained by zzso are validated by both an in zzso zzso and an ex zzso zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shown in the present paper demonstrate the possibility of using zzso for drug zzso zzso Obviously, this application is particularly interesting in the case of zzso compounds, which cannot be detected by any of the other imaging zzso
