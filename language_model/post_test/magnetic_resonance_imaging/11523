When primates passively observe other subjects perform specific gestures or actions, zzso and motor cortical areas involved in the internal representation and actual execution of those actions exhibit zzso zzso This mirror mechanism matches zzso zzso and execution, zzso internal motor rehearsal, zzso recognition of actions by others and their zzso and social zzso zzso patients have deficits in processing affect displayed by other people's faces, which likely relates to the poor social adaptation and functioning seen in the zzso We hypothesized that, when correctly performing zzso tasks requiring facial affect processing, schizophrenic patients would show relative increased activity in brain areas involved in social learning and in the internal representation of facial expressions when compared to zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenic patients and normal controls to detect relative changes of blood flow in cortical areas related to the representation of facial expressions while the subjects performed simple zzso tasks with facial emotion zzso or color circles as zzso We found that, when the task cues were facial expressions in contrast to color circles, the schizophrenic group exhibited increased zzso of the face movement areas in motor and zzso zzso
