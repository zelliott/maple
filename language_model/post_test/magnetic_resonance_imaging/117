The aim of this study was to use zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times and zzso imaging zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the evaluation of healthy cartilage and cartilage repair tissue after zzso zzso zzso transplantation zzso of the ankle zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers zzso age, zzso zzso and 12 patients who underwent zzso of the ankle joint zzso age, zzso zzso were zzso In order to evaluate possible maturation effects, patients were separated into short-term zzso zzso and long-term zzso zzso follow-up zzso zzso was performed on a zzso magnetic resonance zzso scanner using a new dedicated zzso zzso zzso Using high-resolution zzso zzso the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue zzso score was zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso analysis was performed within native cartilage of the volunteers and control cartilage as well as cartilage repair tissue in the patients subsequent to zzso 

The overall zzso score in patients after zzso was zzso zzso relaxation times zzso 50 zzso zzso relaxation times zzso 16 zzso and the diffusion constant for zzso zzso zzso were comparable for the healthy volunteers and the control cartilage in the patients after zzso The cartilage repair tissue showed no significant difference in zzso and zzso relaxation times zzso zzso or zzso zzso compared to the control zzso however, a significantly higher zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was noted in the cartilage repair zzso 

The obtained results suggest that besides zzso zzso and zzso MR techniques, such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso may also deliver additional information about the zzso of cartilage and cartilage repair tissue in the ankle joint using zzso zzso a dedicated zzso zzso and sophisticated zzso
