Human speech carries both linguistic content and information about the speaker's identity and zzso While zzso has been used extensively to study verbal memory, there has been little attention to the neural basis of memory for zzso Evidence from studies of zzso and auditory zzso suggests that voice memory may rely on zzso distinct areas in the right zzso and zzso zzso regions, but there is little data on the broader neural systems involved in voice zzso The present study tested the hypothesis that the neural systems involved in voice memory are functionally distinct from the systems involved in word recognition and are primarily located in the right cerebral zzso zzso performed zzso tasks in which they were required to alternately remember the voices speaking zzso zzso and the words they produced zzso zzso A tone memory condition was also included, as a zzso zzso The contrast between the Voice and Word conditions revealed greater zzso effects in left zzso right frontal and right zzso zzso areas, while the zzso effects appeared in left frontal and bilateral zzso zzso These findings map out a partially zzso zzso network associated with voice memory, which can be distinguished from predominantly zzso regions associated with verbal working zzso These results provide further evidence that distinct neural systems are associated with the carrier waves of speech and word zzso
