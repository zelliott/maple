zzso identifies patients with eye muscle involvement in zzso zzso zzso 

To identify clinical parameters that could eliminate the need for magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the activity of inflammation in the eye muscles of GO patients with zzso 

In 43 patients with GO with recently developed zzso zzso ultrasound and zzso were zzso Muscle diameters and zzso zzso relaxation times were measured, and the amount of zzso zzso tissue was calculated from zzso scans and compared with ultrasound readings, zzso grades, degree of zzso zzso pressure, tear production, zzso levels and hormonal parameters of zzso zzso 

No correlation was found between diameters of 233 zzso muscles measured by zzso and by zzso For each of the four muscles, there was a diameter above which ultrasound was always zzso zzso data were used in further zzso Of the muscles zzso the inferior zzso were the most frequently enlarged - at least one, in zzso of zzso zzso lateral and superior zzso were enlarged in zzso 37% and zzso of the orbits zzso The pattern of muscle involvement of the two orbits tended to be zzso zzso zzso particularly for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with the sum of the muscle diameters for a given eye zzso eye: zzso zzso left eye: zzso zzso but it failed to correlate with the amount of zzso zzso zzso In zzso of the patients, normal zzso relaxation times were found in all eight zzso There was only a weak correlation between muscle thickness and zzso relaxation time zzso zzso indicating that muscle enlargement alone is not a sign of disease zzso The severity of zzso was independent of zzso relaxation zzso The amount of zzso zzso tissue showed a negative correlation with the greatest zzso relaxation time for a given eye zzso zzso zzso this suggests that disease types exist that have zzso muscle involvement and zzso zzso tissue zzso No correlation between zzso tissue expansion and zzso zzso grade, muscle thickness or disease duration was found - that is, zzso tissue expansion is not a major factor in zzso Both muscle and zzso tissue findings were independent of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso eye muscle diameter readings do not zzso because of the inherent inaccuracy of zzso zzso Muscle enlargement alone does not mean zzso swelling and active zzso Neither zzso nor any combination of 11 clinical and laboratory parameters provided the degree of information on muscles and zzso tissue that was zzso by zzso In unclear cases of recently developed zzso before zzso zzso surgery, in the case of treatment failure or if, for any other reason, imaging is needed in zzso zzso is the method of zzso
