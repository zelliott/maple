zzso of tumor recurrence from zzso changes may be difficult with conventional MR imaging when newly enhancing zzso zzso Our aim was to determine the value of zzso zzso MR imaging for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty patients in whom new enhancing zzso developed within zzso regions were examined zzso with zzso zzso MR zzso Twelve of them also underwent zzso zzso zzso 201 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso ratios and zzso indexes were evaluated to determine whether the new enhancing zzso were zzso or zzso Five instances of tumor recurrence and one of radiation necrosis were verified zzso in the others, tumor recurrence was distinguished by zzso that progressively increased in size on serial MR examinations over at least 5 months, and zzso zzso tissue was distinguished by zzso that disappeared or decreased in size on serial MR studies over at least 9 zzso 

When zzso zzso ratios were higher than zzso or lower than zzso enhancing zzso were either zzso zzso zzso 5) or zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso tissue had a low zzso index, whereas three of four zzso zzso had a high zzso 

An enhancing zzso with a zzso zzso ratio higher than zzso or lower than zzso may suggest tumor recurrence or zzso zzso zzso zzso In these cases, further examination with zzso may not be zzso However, when the zzso zzso ratio is between zzso and zzso zzso may be useful in making the zzso
