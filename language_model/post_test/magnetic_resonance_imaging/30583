In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the usefulness of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and air enema magnetic resonance imaging with slice adjustments in patients with zzso zzso 

The subjects were patients with zzso cancer from June 1997 to September 1999 who were examined with a zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was administered both zzso and zzso to reduce motion zzso Imaging sequences were obtained for zzso zzso zzso weighed and zzso zzso zzso Slice thickness was 5 zzso and zzso gap 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and air enema technique were performed with slice zzso Images were interpreted according to the criteria of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed as positive when the zzso zzso exceeded 5 zzso in zzso zzso and magnetic resonance findings were zzso and diagnostic accuracy was zzso 

zzso consecutive patients were included in this study zzso male, 17 zzso There were 10 early cases and 44 advanced cases of zzso zzso Images with an zzso zzso were obtained in 4 zzso Fifty patients underwent air enema zzso The depth of tumor invasion was accurately diagnosed in all 4 patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso On air enema study, magnetic resonance imaging correctly staged the depth of invasion in 41 of 50 patients zzso zzso was seen in 8 of 50 patients zzso however, only one patient zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso study, accurate diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso was obtained in 3 of 4 zzso zzso On air enema study, an accurate diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso was obtained in 36 of 50 zzso patients, yielding zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging findings of zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso diagnostic zzso yielding sensitivity of zzso zzso and specificity of zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso enhanced zzso zzso and air enema magnetic resonance imaging is promising for zzso evaluation of patients with zzso zzso
