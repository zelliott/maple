zzso zzso zzso sampling zzso best discriminates between the two causes of zzso zzso syndrome, zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, when sampling is not available, zzso diagnostic tests might be zzso zzso tumors may zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso 

The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of serum zzso CT, zzso or zzso values to distinguish CD from zzso 

We conducted a prospective pilot study at a clinical research zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in six patients with zzso zzso diagnosed by zzso 25 CD patients, and 11 patients with zzso proven zzso 

Nine zzso patients zzso had at least one value above the reference range, including zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Of nine zzso CD patients with one or two abnormal values, seven had increased zzso only, one had increased zzso only, and one had increased zzso and zzso zzso had a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso other markers showed less zzso On zzso magnetic resonance imaging, no zzso patient had an zzso whereas 21 of 25 patients with CD had a zzso 

These preliminary results suggest that an abnormal zzso and normal zzso magnetic resonance imaging favor the diagnosis of zzso but normal tumor markers do not exclude the zzso
