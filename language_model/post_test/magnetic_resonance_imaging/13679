To assess the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the early prediction of response in patients with relapsed zzso germ cell zzso undergoing salvage high-dose zzso The role of zzso zzso zzso was compared with established means of zzso response assessment such as CT zzso and serum zzso marker zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was compared with a current zzso score which zzso three zzso groups with zzso survival rates ranging from zzso zzso zzso of zzso from germ cell zzso as well as CT scans and serum zzso marker were acquired after 2-3 cycles of induction chemotherapy but before the start of high-dose chemotherapy and CT zzso zzso marker were compared with the baseline examinations in 23 patients with relapsed germ cell zzso To evaluate the zzso of early response prediction by zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring and serum zzso marker decline, zzso response after zzso of residual masses and/or the clinical course over 6 months after the end of treatment zzso vs freedom of zzso were zzso Overall, 10 patients zzso achieved a zzso partial zzso three zzso a zzso partial zzso five zzso a disease stabilization and five zzso progressed during zzso Nine patients zzso remained zzso over 6 months following treatment, whereas 14 zzso zzso The outcome of high-dose chemotherapy was correctly predicted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marker in zzso Eight patients with a zzso predicted outcome by CT scans plus serum zzso marker but a positive zzso zzso zzso prior to high-dose chemotherapy, failed zzso This results in the following zzso for the prediction of failure of high-dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring zzso serum zzso marker zzso The positive and negative zzso values of zzso zzso zzso were 88 and zzso zzso As compared with the zzso score, zzso zzso zzso was correctly positive in all patients of the three risk groups who failed zzso In addition, a negative zzso zzso zzso correctly predicted a zzso outcome in the good and intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging can be used to assess response to chemotherapy in patients with relapsed germ cell zzso early in the course of treatment and may help to identify patients most likely to achieve a zzso response to subsequent high-dose zzso In patients with response to induction chemotherapy according to CT scans or serum zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to add information to detect patients with an overall zzso zzso It may also be a valuable addition to the zzso model particularly in the good and intermediate group for further selection of patients who will profit from high-dose zzso
