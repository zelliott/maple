During the treatment of zzso liver zzso evaluation of treatment efficacy is of the utmost importance for decision zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the ability of zzso imaging zzso to detect experimental liver zzso Nine male zzso rats underwent a zzso with zzso injection of zzso tumor zzso On days 7, 10, and 14 after tumor zzso sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans were acquired of each zzso At each time point, three rats were zzso and the zzso in the liver were documented zzso zzso the liver was divided into eight segments and the image findings were compared on a zzso basis with the zzso zzso zzso liver segments were zzso 20 of which contained tumor zzso The overall sensitivity of zzso CT, and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the detection of tumors with a zzso diameter exceeding 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso the sensitivity of zzso CT, and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The overall specificity of zzso CT, and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study showed encouraging zzso and sensitivity for zzso imaging of small liver tumors and provides valuable information on the imaging techniques for designing future zzso
