zzso moving table zzso zzso is a new method that is capable of generating zzso seamless, large zzso zzso images by acquiring zzso along the patient zzso axis as the subject is translated through the zzso For applications that require zzso images, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso of the legs, a major challenge is to match the MR data acquisition and patient table motion with the dynamics of blood flow in the region of interest zzso Instead of restricting the CMT to predetermined constant table speeds, we adopted a more general approach in which the table motion is zzso from the zzso zzso In our approach the table moves zzso and in response to zzso feedback obtained from viewing real-time preview (or zzso zzso This zzso is accomplished by zzso high zzso resolution zzso of the table position with real-time zzso filling and image zzso Experimental results obtained using our zzso interactive CMT zzso system on a peripheral vascular phantom and five healthy volunteers demonstrate the feasibility of this robust and rapid imaging method for acquiring zzso zzso continuous images with zzso zzso table motion zzso
