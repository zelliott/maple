New zzso iron oxide zzso were developed by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with ammonium hydroxide and zzso of the resulting zzso with sodium zzso followed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of several molecular weights ranging from 146 ( zzso to 579 zzso was tested as a coating to boost the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso were characterized by zzso dynamic light zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the particles were zzso 6 zzso in diameter, while zzso showed that their surfaces were zzso with zzso The interaction of zzso iron oxide zzso with zzso culture medium was verified by zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cells zzso and human zzso stem cells zzso were labeled with zzso iron oxide zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the presence of zzso iron oxide zzso inside the zzso Cellular zzso was very high (more than zzso for zzso zzso that were coated with zzso zzso weight 388 zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso zzso per zzso of zzso The cellular zzso of zzso iron oxide was facilitated by its interaction with the zzso charged cell surface and subsequent zzso zzso The zzso of zzso labeled with zzso iron oxide and the amount of iron in the cells were zzso zzso iron zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and in zzso after zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of the adult rat zzso The implanted cells were visible on magnetic resonance zzso images as a zzso area at the injection site and in the zzso In comparison with zzso zzso modified with zzso of an optimum molecular weight demonstrated a higher efficiency of zzso zzso by zzso zzso
