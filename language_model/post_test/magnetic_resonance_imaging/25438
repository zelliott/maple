zzso zzso is a known complication of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, most of the data in the literature refer to spontaneous or zzso occurrence of zzso zzso regarded as either a favorable or an zzso zzso Little is known about this phenomenon as a consequence of the surgical management of zzso The present study was carried out to evaluate the significance of zzso zzso zzso in children with zzso zzso zzso who have been treated with zzso and wide zzso of the zzso zzso 

Between 1980 and March 2002, 104 children were operated on for a zzso at the zzso zzso Unit of the Catholic University Medical School in zzso Six patients zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso developed a zzso zzso zzso which required further zzso According to zzso zzso 4 children had a Type III zzso and 2 children a Type II zzso All the patients had previously been submitted to open zzso of their zzso zzso and extensive removal of the zzso zzso In 5 patients zzso III zzso 4 zzso Type II zzso 1 zzso acute or zzso symptoms and signs of increased zzso pressure zzso developed at a zzso distance, varying from 5 days to 1 month zzso zzso zzso zzso All these children needed surgical treatment for the zzso A zzso zzso shunt was implanted as the first step in 3 patients zzso III zzso 2 zzso Type II zzso 1 zzso In the remaining 2 patients of this group zzso III zzso medical therapy was initially attempted zzso 24 zzso without any improvement in clinical zzso on these grounds an external spinal zzso drainage was zzso but led only to the transient clearance of zzso The direct drainage of the zzso collection zzso shunt in 1 patient and temporary external zzso drainage in the zzso was followed by complete clinical recovery in both zzso The last patient in this series showed a zzso increase in head circumference during the 1st month after surgery for his zzso cyst, followed by a subsequent zzso A CT scan documented a zzso zzso which first of all increased in size, but stabilized 2 months after zzso No surgical treatment was performed in this zzso At a mean follow-up of zzso years zzso 1 month; zzso 5 zzso all the patients are in excellent clinical zzso Complete zzso resolution of the zzso was observed in 2 of the 4 zzso patients, who have both been submitted to shunt removal (2 and 3 years after the implant zzso 

It is our opinion that a wide opening of the external membrane of zzso may zzso the zzso fluid to accumulate within the zzso space, where its zzso is zzso A ball mechanism created by zzso zzso may further increase the zzso fluid zzso Secondary distortion and zzso at the level of the zzso zzso may also contribute to the persistence of the zzso fluid zzso Clinical manifestations may be zzso but frequently have a progressive course and the drainage of the zzso collection is, though zzso required in most zzso On these grounds we suggest the selective opening of the zzso zzso associated with a limited zzso of the outer zzso walls in order to limit zzso access to the zzso zzso
