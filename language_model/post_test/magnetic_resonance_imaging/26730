In permanent magnetic resonance imaging zzso systems, zzso zzso fields induce strong zzso currents in the conducting structures of the magnet zzso The zzso field for image zzso is zzso by these zzso currents leading to MR image zzso This paper presents a comprehensive finite element zzso analysis of the zzso current generation in the magnet zzso In the proposed zzso model, the zzso characteristics of zzso materials are considered and a zzso zzso zzso model is zzso The developed zzso model was applied to study zzso zzso induced zzso currents in a zzso T permanent zzso zzso The simulation results demonstrate that the approach could be effectively used to investigate zzso current problems involving zzso zzso With the knowledge gained from this zzso current model, our next step is to design a passive magnet structure and active zzso coils to reduce the zzso current zzso
