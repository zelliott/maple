To evaluate and zzso qualify zzso zzso as a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of improved tumor zzso using a double zzso zzso marker zzso 

zzso echo images were acquired from mice bearing zzso zzso zzso with the zzso marker zzso to zzso tumor zzso during air zzso With the mouse remaining positioned within the magnet zzso the gas supply was switched to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during which a second zzso marker, zzso was administered via an zzso line, and an additional set of identical zzso echo images acquired to zzso any changes in tumor zzso zzso fraction was zzso zzso using zzso detection of zzso and zzso zzso formation from the same whole tumor zzso zzso changes in tumor zzso were further validated using the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso challenge significantly reduced mean tumor zzso from 116 zzso 13 zzso to 97 zzso 9 zzso zzso This was associated with a significantly lower zzso zzso area zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant correlation was observed between zzso and zzso fraction zzso zzso Mean tumor zzso during zzso breathing significantly increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The combined use of intrinsic zzso magnetic resonance imaging with a double zzso marker approach corroborates zzso zzso as a zzso imaging zzso of increased tumor zzso
