zzso delivery of imaging agents can enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of current imaging zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso cells to disease sites increases the efficacy of zzso cell therapy while reducing the number of cells zzso Currently, targeting can be achieved via chemical zzso to specific zzso which typically results in the loss of zzso functionality and in severe cell zzso An ideal zzso technique should ensure retention of zzso activity and functionality of the targeted biological zzso 

To develop a zzso zzso highly zzso and zzso zzso method using the zzso zzso zzso A zzso for the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso to zzso and cells for molecular imaging and cell zzso in cardiovascular zzso This zzso specifically binds to activated zzso which play a pivotal role in zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso procedure involves chemical and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was successfully zzso to iron oxide particles zzso agents for magnetic resonance zzso and to model zzso zzso efficiency ranged between 50% and zzso and zzso of the zzso after zzso was zzso The targeting of zzso cells and zzso to activated zzso was strong and specific as demonstrated in in zzso zzso zzso zzso in a flow chamber system, in mouse zzso zzso and in in zzso magnetic resonance imaging of mouse carotid zzso 

This unique zzso approach provides a versatile and broadly zzso tool for zzso targeted zzso cell therapy and targeted molecular imaging in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases and zzso
