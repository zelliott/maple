To zzso investigate the effect of zzso management on clinical and anatomical outcome of disc zzso in previously magnetic resonance imaging zzso disc zzso of the cervical and zzso zzso 

Private zzso 

zzso patients with zzso and symptomatic disc zzso of the cervical or zzso zzso A prospective clinical case zzso 

All patients were evaluated before zzso of zzso care by zzso scans for presence of disc zzso zzso evaluations also included clinical examination and visual analog zzso Patients were then treated with a course of care that included zzso zzso zzso spinal manipulative therapy, zzso and zzso zzso All patients were re-evaluated by zzso follow-up zzso scans, clinical examination and visual analog zzso Percentage of disc shrinkage on repeat zzso resolution of clinical examination findings, reduced visual analog pain scores and whether the patient returned to work were all zzso 

zzso zzso of the patients studied had a good clinical outcome with zzso visual analog scores under 2 and resolution of abnormal clinical examination zzso zzso after repeat zzso scans, zzso of the patients studied revealed a reduced size or completely zzso disc zzso There was a statistically significant association zzso zzso zzso between the clinical and zzso follow-up zzso zzso percent of the patients were able to return to work in their zzso zzso 

This prospective case series suggests that zzso care may be a safe and helpful zzso for the treatment of cervical and zzso disc zzso A random, controlled, clinical trial is called for to further substantiate the role of zzso care for the zzso clinical management of zzso disc zzso
