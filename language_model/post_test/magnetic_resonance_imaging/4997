zzso in the zzso 5 gene zzso have been recently zzso cause limb zzso muscular zzso zzso and zzso muscular zzso 

Clinical findings of four unrelated patients are zzso zzso detection was performed by direct sequencing of the zzso zzso 

We identified four novel zzso in the zzso zzso In one patient, a novel zzso zzso zzso In three patients, the zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso is combined with other zzso to form a compound zzso state: in two cases, novel zzso site zzso in zzso 5 zzso and in zzso 14 zzso and in one case, a novel zzso zzso in zzso 4 zzso 

The cases reported here should help to better understand the important role of zzso screening in the zzso gene in patients with adult onset muscular zzso and very high zzso zzso
