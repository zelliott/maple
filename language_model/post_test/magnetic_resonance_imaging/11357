The relationships between in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and in zzso markers of zzso capacity zzso zzso were determined in 27 women with varying levels of physical zzso Following zzso zzso zzso zzso exercises, calf muscle zzso function was determined from the zzso zzso recovery time constant, the zzso zzso zzso recovery time constant, the rate of change of zzso during the initial 14 s of recovery, and the apparent maximum rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso Muscle fiber type distribution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso c zzso zzso activity were determined from a biopsy sample of lateral zzso MRS markers of zzso function correlated moderately zzso zzso zzso with the percentage of type zzso zzso fibers zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso to zzso but only zzso with zzso activity zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso These results support the use of MRS to determine zzso function in zzso
