Changes to the zzso structure have been reported as consistent structural abnormalities in schizophrenic patients and have been related to the learning and memory deficits in such zzso Although many magnetic resonance zzso imaging studies have focused on the zzso volume, local structural changes were difficult to discriminate from normal zzso zzso zzso shape deformation analysis of the brain structure may reflect localized schizophrenic zzso A zzso model, evolved from the zzso to zzso surface, with zzso zzso was developed to analyze the left and right zzso shapes in 22 schizophrenic patients and 22 healthy age and gender matched zzso One of the most critical issues in the shape analysis is the determination of zzso points between two zzso To determine more accurate corresponding points, an alignment zzso consisting of coarse and fine steps, following a deformation process, was zzso The performance of the alignment process was tested using artificial data, to get the alignment error to within 3 degrees for each zzso A volume analysis indicated the zzso volume to be zzso reduced in schizophrenic patients compared to the normal controls, with a shape analysis showing a zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso inward zzso in the anterior and zzso zzso and a unilateral outward zzso in the right anterior zzso were observed, zzso
