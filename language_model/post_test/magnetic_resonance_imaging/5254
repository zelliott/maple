zzso plaque characteristics influence future risk of stroke zzso However, the severity of zzso does not accurately reflect plaque burden in patients with expansive zzso zzso 

To determine the therapeutic outcome of symptomatic carotid zzso zzso with vulnerable plaque based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

We studied 25 zzso zzso zzso 23; age, zzso zzso zzso zzso of 29 consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid zzso zzso zzso and both zzso plaque and expansive zzso on zzso zzso The remaining 4 were excluded because of impending zzso A single zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso stroke was treated with dual zzso We considered carotid zzso when recurrence was zzso to aggressive medical zzso 

During a zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 of the 25 patients developed a total of 30 zzso zzso events zzso per zzso The patients' characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups with and without recurrence zzso zzso 11 and zzso zzso 14, zzso Seven of 11 patients in the recurrence group treated with carotid zzso remained free of zzso events during a zzso follow-up of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso carotid zzso with vulnerable plaque confirmed by zzso was associated with a high rate of stroke recurrence that was zzso to aggressive medical zzso However, carotid zzso was safe and effective for such zzso zzso characterization by zzso has the potential for more accurate stroke risk zzso in the management of carotid zzso zzso
