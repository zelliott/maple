Low zzso fluid pressure zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso We measured the zzso nerve zzso space zzso zzso as a surrogate for zzso zzso in patients with primary zzso glaucoma zzso with normal and high pressure and a control zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

The study included 39 patients with zzso 21 patients had normal pressure zzso pressure zzso 21 zzso and 18 patients had high pressure zzso zzso zzso 21 subjects formed the control zzso 

By using magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso fast recovery fast spin echo zzso zzso zzso we determined the zzso at 3, 9, and 15 zzso zzso to the zzso 

The zzso and zzso nerve zzso 

At all 3 measurement locations of 3, 9, and 15 zzso the zzso was significantly zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than in the zzso group zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or the control group zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and control groups did not vary significantly at 3, 9, and 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso At all 3 measurement locations, zzso was zzso in the zzso group compared with the zzso and control groups after adjustment for zzso nerve diameter zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso nerve zzso space measured at 3, 9, and 15 zzso behind the globe, respectively, was significantly (all zzso associated with zzso after adjustment for zzso nerve diameter and visual field zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso space in patients with zzso with normal pressure compared with high pressure suggests a lower zzso zzso in patients with zzso with normal zzso
