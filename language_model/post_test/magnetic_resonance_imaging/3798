Although breast cancer screening with zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso is recommended for breast zzso gene zzso zzso carriers, there is no current consensus on the optimal screening zzso 

The authors used a computer simulation model to compare 6 annual screening strategies zzso zzso zzso digital zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso and zzso zzso and alternating zzso or zzso at zzso zzso beginning at ages 25 years, 30 years, 35 years, and 40 years, and 2 strategies of annual zzso with delayed alternating zzso versus clinical surveillance zzso Strategies were evaluated without and with zzso breast cancer risk using 2 models of excess relative zzso zzso parameters were obtained from the medical literature, publicly available databases, and zzso 

Without radiation risk effects, alternating zzso starting at age 25 years provided the highest life expectancy zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso When radiation risk was included, a small proportion of diagnosed zzso was attributable to radiation exposure zzso zzso zzso zzso With radiation risk, alternating zzso at age 25 years or annual zzso at age 25 zzso alternating zzso at age 30 years was the most effective, depending on the radiation risk model zzso zzso zzso starting at age 25 years also produced the highest number of zzso screens per woman zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Annual zzso at age 25 zzso alternating zzso at age 30 years is probably the most effective screening strategy in zzso zzso zzso zzso benefits, associated risks, and personal acceptance of zzso results should be considered in choosing the optimal screening strategy for individual zzso
