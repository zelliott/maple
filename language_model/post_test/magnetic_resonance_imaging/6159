One of the main difficulties in obtaining quantitative zzso values from dynamic zzso zzso resonance imaging is a correct zzso input function zzso zzso as partial volume effects can lead to an erroneous shape and zzso of the zzso zzso blood flow and volume scale zzso with the area under the zzso but shape changes of the zzso can lead to large, zzso zzso Current manual and automated zzso selection procedures do not guarantee the exclusion of partial volume effects from zzso zzso This study uses a zzso model, validated by phantom experiments, for predicting the optimal location for zzso zzso in the vicinity of the middle cerebral artery zzso Three different sequences were investigated and evaluated on a zzso basis by comparison with the ground zzso zzso the predictions were evaluated in an in zzso zzso The findings are zzso zzso zzso should be performed in zzso completely outside the artery, here a linear relation should be assumed between zzso and the concentration contrast agent, the exact optimal location differs per acquisition type, and zzso including a small zzso yield also correct zzso zzso for segmented echo zzso imaging when a short echo time was zzso
