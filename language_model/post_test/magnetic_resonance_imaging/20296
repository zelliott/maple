zzso in zzso primary motor zzso zzso are broadly tuned to arm movement zzso Recent evidence suggests that human zzso contains zzso tuned zzso but it is unclear which other areas are part of the network coding movement direction and what characterizes the responses of zzso populations in those zzso Such information would be highly relevant for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in paralyzed zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to identify which areas of the human brain show directional selectivity and the degree to which these areas are affected by the type of motor act (to press vs to zzso After adapting participants to one particular hand movement direction, we measured the release from adaptation during occasional test trials, zzso varying the angular difference between adaptation and test zzso We identified multiple areas broadly tuned to movement direction, including zzso zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso and the zzso reach zzso Within these areas, we observed a zzso of directional zzso with highest directional selectivity in the right zzso reach region, for both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, directional selectivity was modulated by the type of motor act to varying degrees, with the largest effect in zzso and the smallest zzso in the zzso reach zzso These data provide an important extension of our knowledge about directional tuning in the human zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that the zzso reach region might be an ideal candidate for the zzso of zzso in paralyzed zzso
