zzso medications are commonly used in treating zzso zzso However, technical details of their correct administration are zzso 

A three-dimensional model of zzso cavity was constructed from the magnetic resonance imaging scans of a healthy human zzso zzso cavities corresponding to moderate and severe zzso obstruction were derived from the healthy nose by enlarging the inferior zzso zzso which can be documented by approximately one third reduction of the minimum zzso area in the moderate and two thirds in the severe zzso The discrete phase model based on zzso fluid dynamics was used to study the gas particle zzso The percentage of discrete particles that pass through the minimum zzso area in the zzso valve zzso region is zzso as the percentage of zzso penetration zzso 

The percentage of zzso penetration is 10 to 20 times higher when zzso spray is accompanied by an zzso zzso than no flow, which can be as low as zzso to zzso in the healthy model, and zzso in moderate and severe zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso there is no significant difference in the percentage of zzso penetration zzso among different head tilt angles zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso 

When using an zzso medication, it is zzso to have an zzso flow to improve drug zzso Various suggested head positions do not improve drug penetration significantly, even in the presence of uniform quiet zzso Further studies that consider turbulence and unsteady zzso are needed to investigate the deposition distribution of discrete particles inside various zzso zzso
