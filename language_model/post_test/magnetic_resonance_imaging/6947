zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso transplantation has been shown zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso and zzso To advance this technique into a clinical setting it is important to be able to follow the fates of transplanted cells by zzso zzso Previous studies, using complex modification processes to enable zzso of contrast agents, have shown that cells labeled in zzso with zzso contrast agents transplanted into zzso zzso can be zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso from the culture medium by fluid phase zzso After transplantation into focal areas of zzso in adult rat spinal zzso both transplanted zzso zzso and zzso produce a signal reduction using zzso zzso in zzso rats that persists for up to 4 zzso Although signal reduction was zzso after transplantation of zzso cells, this is nevertheless distinguishable from that produced by transplanted labeled zzso The region of signal reduction in zzso cell recipients zzso closely with areas of zzso Because the retention of functional integrity by labeled cells is paramount, we also show that zzso zzso and zzso are able to zzso normally after transplantation into focal areas of zzso These studies demonstrate the feasibility of zzso imaging of transplanted zzso and zzso and represent a significant step toward the clinical application of promising experimental zzso
