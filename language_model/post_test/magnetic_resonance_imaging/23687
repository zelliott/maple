zzso studies were performed to evaluate the usefulness of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the screening of bone zzso The fast short zzso inversion recovery sequence was the most suitable method because of its minimal image distortion and uniformity of fat suppression in a large field of zzso In 4 cases of zzso zzso the zzso of all 8 bone zzso detected with bone zzso zzso could be clarified with zzso Furthermore, zzso with fast STIR alone could depict 4 zzso zzso by zzso and zzso combined with contrast enhancement could depict 5 such zzso
