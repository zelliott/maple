To study the correlation between the degree of zzso zzso as detected in zzso by magnetic resonance zzso imaging and the auditory and zzso function in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

zzso referral center for balance zzso 

In this prospective study, 41 patients who fulfilled the criteria for zzso unilateral zzso disease according to the American Association of zzso and Neck Surgery and who showed a zzso zzso potential ratio of greater than zzso on zzso were zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso MR imaging of the inner ear was performed using a zzso zzso Recovery zzso Spin Echo zzso The degree of zzso zzso was graded on a zzso scale zzso in the zzso and by zzso zzso space ratio in the zzso The degree of zzso was then analyzed with respect to its correlation with zzso hearing levels, zzso zzso ratios of zzso evoked zzso zzso degree of horizontal semicircular canal zzso on caloric irrigation, and disease zzso 

The degree of hearing loss and the disease duration correlated significantly with cochlear zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso dysfunction was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant correlation between horizontal semicircular canal zzso and zzso zzso 

In patients with clinically and zzso confirmed zzso zzso disease, the degree of MR zzso zzso severity zzso significantly with impairment of hearing function and zzso zzso
