To combine functional zzso studies across subjects, anatomical and functional data are typically either transformed to a common space or averaged across regions of interest zzso However, if there are zzso anatomical variations within the subject pool (as in clinical or aging zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity within a typical zzso or, zzso more zzso than subjects, neither spatial transformation of the data to a common space nor averaging across all subjects' zzso is suitable for standard zzso zzso To solve these problems, we describe a zzso method that uses zzso statistics representing zzso activity zzso within zzso to establish combinations of zzso that zzso differentiate tasks across all zzso The method involves zzso zzso from multiple zzso within each subject, zzso linear zzso analysis across all subjects and validation with zzso zzso When applied to experimental data from healthy subjects performing two motor tasks, the method detected some brain regions, including the supplementary motor area zzso that participated in a distributed network zzso active between zzso However there was not a significant difference in zzso activity when this region was examined in zzso We suggest this method is a practical means to combine zzso statistics within zzso defined zzso across zzso
