In past decades, much effort has been invested in developing therapies for spinal zzso Lack of zzso of clinical zzso measures, however, makes direct comparison of experimental therapies zzso zzso and therapeutic effects in zzso are routinely evaluated using rather zzso behavioral zzso Here we show that zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can be used to examine the extent of damage following spinal zzso injury zzso in mice in zzso zzso of zzso solution into the zzso fluid leads to zzso zzso into the spinal zzso Furthermore, after injury zzso quantitative measures correlate closely with clinical locomotor zzso zzso locomotion due to treating the zzso effects of zzso with an established therapy zzso of zzso is reflected in an increase of zzso zzso into the injured spinal zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is a sensitive and objective tool for in zzso zzso and zzso of damage and functional improvement after zzso Thus, zzso can serve as a zzso surrogate measure of the clinical status of the spinal zzso in mice, potentially becoming a standard approach for evaluating experimental zzso
