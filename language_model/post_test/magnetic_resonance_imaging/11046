To explore a potential means for the early diagnosis of zzso disease, we studied the relationship of resting zzso signal and zzso zzso memory zzso The rat model with zzso zzso and spatial memory deficit was established by bilateral zzso injection of zzso zzso Then, the zzso zzso between resting zzso signal and spatial memory retention was assessed with blood zzso level dependent zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study and Morris Water zzso test, and Western zzso was employed to confirm zzso zzso The analysis showed following zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso was significantly increased in zzso rats as detected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso An zzso spatial memory retention zzso was induced at 24 h after zzso zzso zzso A sensitivity threshold of resting zzso signal intensity, which separated the zzso rats from vehicle control, was obtained by applying linear zzso analysis, and an estimated sensitivity statistical threshold was at zzso These results suggest that resting zzso signal may serve as a zzso quantitative marker in predicting zzso spatial memory deficits and zzso zzso
