To document the signal characteristics of zzso zzso zzso at evolving stages on zzso images zzso by comparison with conventional MR zzso 

In our retrospective study, 38 patients with zzso underwent a set of imaging sequences that included zzso zzso zzso imaging, and zzso inversion recovery zzso In 33 and 10 patients, respectively, conventional and zzso zzso zzso images were also zzso According to the time zzso between symptom onset and initial zzso five stages were zzso zzso zzso acute zzso early zzso zzso late zzso zzso and chronic zzso We investigated the signal intensity and apparent diffusion zzso zzso of zzso and compared the signal zzso of zzso at zzso and on conventional MR zzso 

zzso showed that zzso were zzso at the zzso and late zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso early zzso and chronic zzso zzso focal zzso was observed within a zzso zzso At the zzso acute and early zzso zzso zzso rims that corresponded with zzso surrounding the zzso were zzso The mean zzso ratio was zzso at the zzso stage, zzso at the acute stage, zzso at the early zzso stage, zzso at the late zzso stage, and zzso at the chronic zzso 

zzso showed that the signal intensity of an zzso may be related to both its zzso value and the magnetic zzso zzso In patients with acute stroke, an understanding of the characteristic features of zzso seen at zzso can be helpful in both the characterization of zzso zzso zzso and the differentiation of zzso from zzso
