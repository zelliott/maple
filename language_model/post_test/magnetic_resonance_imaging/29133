Although abnormal zzso are frequently observed at or around the zzso radiation in elderly subjects, no previous reports have mentioned the clinical significance and zzso changes of these zzso We evaluated the zzso patterns of the zzso radiation and its surrounding structures on zzso MR images and compared these findings with zzso observations and visual field zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MR images of 102 consecutive patients zzso years old) were evaluated zzso for the presence and zzso of zzso of the zzso radiation zzso zzso and its surrounding zzso zzso specimens were obtained from 25 other patients zzso years old) who had died of zzso zzso The zzso changes of the zzso radiation and its surrounding structures were evaluated and correlated with the MR zzso Finally, MR findings and visual field zzso were correlated in 46 elderly volunteers zzso years zzso 

zzso of the zzso radiation or its surrounding structures or both were observed on 125 sides zzso of 67 patients zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso radiation and the zzso was the characteristic zzso Eleven zzso of 25 zzso specimens exhibited zzso of three zzso layers (the external zzso stratum or the zzso radiation, the internal zzso zzso and the zzso No subjects with zzso of the zzso radiation had visual field zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso radiation and zzso on zzso images is common in elderly subjects, and may reflect differences in the internal structures and in the water content of three zzso zzso zzso of this region did not cause visual field abnormalities in a group of elderly zzso
