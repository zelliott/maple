To explore the zzso cortical responses to natural moving tactile stimulation in adult subjects using zzso 

We measured cortical zzso magnetic evoked fields zzso to moving tactile stimuli by a brush over the right thumb once every zzso s in seven zzso Electric zzso with various intensity or simulated jitter were used for zzso 

zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso consisted of two zzso zzso and zzso Electric zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was only zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso and zzso were of about the same zzso With increased jitter or decreased intensity, zzso of electric zzso was more clearly found in early zzso than late zzso 

Natural moving tactile stimulation produced simpler cortical zzso zzso in comparison with electric zzso partly related to less sharp intensity and stimulation jitter with moving tactile zzso We propose that of all the zzso fibers conveying the early zzso the low threshold components participate the generation of the late zzso
