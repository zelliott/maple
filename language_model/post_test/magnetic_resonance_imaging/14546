Spinal zzso zzso is an important step in the analysis of neurological diseases such as multiple zzso Several studies have shown correlations between disease progression and metrics relating to spinal zzso zzso and shape zzso Current practices primarily involve zzso the spinal zzso manually or zzso which can be inconsistent and time-consuming for large zzso An automatic method that segments the spinal zzso and zzso fluid from magnetic resonance images is zzso The method uses a zzso zzso and zzso constraints to produce results that are robust to noise and zzso The method is designed to be easily extended to new data with different zzso resolutions, and fields of zzso zzso was performed on two distinct zzso The first consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso centered only on the cervical zzso zzso The second consists of zzso zzso that covers both the cervical and portions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be highly accurate in comparison to manual zzso A pilot study was carried out to demonstrate the potential utility of this new method for research and clinical studies of multiple zzso
