To evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso in patients with wrist zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso of the wrist joint were zzso evaluated in zzso patients over a three-year zzso Imaging findings were correlated to surgical results zzso zzso zzso or clinical course in an at least zzso zzso 

For tears of the triangular zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of more than zzso Only the positive zzso value was superior for zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso was superior for functional diagnosis of zzso ligament tears zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ligament defects were demonstrated more exactly by zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly zzso fractures zzso zzso zzso and avascular necrosis zzso zzso 17), were better diagnosed using zzso 

For suspected zzso of the triangular zzso complex, zzso is slightly more reliable than zzso However, zzso was found to be highly accurate in diagnosing zzso tears, and is superior to zzso in detecting traumatic and vascular zzso of the zzso
