zzso MR imaging is a method which generates images of diffusion and zzso in zzso Until now, zzso incoherent motion zzso images have been obtained using zzso sequences with zzso zzso resulting in long acquisition times (typically 2 zzso 8 zzso 32 zzso A new method is proposed here, using zzso free zzso zzso which allows zzso images to be obtained in a couple of zzso Phantom studies showed that the sensitivity of zzso to zzso is much greater than that of spin zzso In zzso images are zzso
