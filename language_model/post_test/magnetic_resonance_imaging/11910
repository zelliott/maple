The zzso zzso filtered zzso zzso and zzso zzso is applied to the joint zzso of rabbits for selective zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso selectively filters zzso zzso arising from the zzso zzso interaction of the zzso water in these zzso The zzso creation time dependency of the zzso signal intensity is determined by the molecular environment of the zzso zzso zzso each tissue has a unique creation time at which the zzso signal reaches its maximum intensity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior cruciate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have presented the zzso zzso images of the zzso zzso foot, and knee zzso Compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso MR images, zzso ligaments, zzso and zzso cartilage were more clearly seen in the zzso MR zzso All these zzso were distinctly zzso from each other by their creation zzso zzso MR images of foot and knee zzso can selectively demonstrated zzso ligaments, and cartilage, which make it easier to understand the complicated zzso structure of zzso Because the zzso zzso signal intensity and zzso are sensitive to the order structure of the zzso water, it might be possible to introduce the zzso zzso of zzso zzso MR images as a new tool for analyzing the changes in the ordered structure of the zzso
