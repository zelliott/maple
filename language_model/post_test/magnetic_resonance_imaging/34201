The utility of three-dimensional zzso contrast zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso a method sensitive to zzso fibers and their zzso was investigated in the clinical setting using a zzso MR imaging system based on a General Electric zzso zzso The study focused on healthy volunteers and patients with common structural central nervous system disorders, namely chronic zzso zzso cavernous zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso images were first zzso Three primary colors were each assigned to a zzso image, respectively, and the images were subsequently combined into a zzso image in zzso spectrum zzso MR zzso zzso zzso definition in the cerebral zzso of the zzso of healthy volunteers showed zzso variation, with two general patterns zzso dispersed zzso of zzso and compact zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the fiber tracts were readily identified in cases involving zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as illustrated in the cases of chronic zzso zzso of major zzso such as the zzso zzso or zzso zzso as well as fiber zzso was also easily recognized in cases of mass zzso As an imaging method uniquely capable of providing information regarding zzso zzso zzso MR zzso appears to have promising potential for routine clinical zzso
