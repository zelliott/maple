zzso resonance imaging provides a zzso method to study the fate of transplanted cells in zzso 

We studied the fate of embryonic and zzso stem cells labeled with iron oxide zzso zzso and human zzso cells labeled with magnetic zzso zzso in rats with a cortical or spinal zzso zzso 

zzso were grafted zzso zzso to a cortical zzso zzso or injected zzso 

During the 1st week after zzso transplanted cells migrated to the zzso and were visible in the zzso on MR images as a zzso zzso zzso for more than 30 zzso In rats with a zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso we observed an increase in functional recovery and hind limb sensitivity after zzso of zzso zzso stem cells or a freshly prepared zzso fraction of bone zzso cells or after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the center of the zzso showed an increase in white matter volume in zzso zzso zzso blue zzso confirmed a large number of zzso zzso cells, and the zzso were considerably smaller than in control zzso 

These studies demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging of grafted adult as well as embryonic stem cells labeled with iron oxide zzso is a useful method for evaluating their migration and fate in zzso
