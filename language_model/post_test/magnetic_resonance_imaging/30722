The zzso control and relay to higher brain sites of visceral sensory information within the central nervous system is zzso via discrete sites in the zzso zzso characterization of these sites in humans has been limited due to the invasive nature of such zzso The present study employed 4 zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to characterize zzso sites involved in zzso control in the zzso Eight subjects performed tasks that activate the general visceral (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or special visceral sensory systems zzso administration to the zzso zzso of the nucleus of the solitary tract and zzso nucleus was consistently observed with all general visceral zzso zzso gray area zzso was observed during the zzso inspiration and zzso maneuver conditions and zzso zzso was present in response to zzso zzso and zzso inspiration zzso The zzso in the nucleus of the solitary tract was consistently more zzso in the zzso during zzso administration than during performance of the other experimental zzso This finding is consistent with what has been previously demonstrated in zzso This is the first study to image the human zzso with respect to visceral control and demonstrates the feasibility of using high-resolution zzso to study the functional organization of the human zzso
