zzso of zzso craving with brain stimulation techniques is a growing area of attention in addiction zzso This investigation aims to guide these studies by assessing individual zzso in the location of peak cortical activity during zzso zzso 

Twenty-six zzso individuals performed a zzso craving task in a zzso zzso scanner while zzso signal data was zzso The task included epochs of smoking cues, neutral cues, and zzso The location of peak activity during smoking cues relative to neutral cues zzso zzso was isolated for each zzso The spatial zzso of the 26 zzso hot spots (1 per zzso was zzso via zzso zzso 

When viewing nicotine cues all 26 participants had at least one cluster of significant prefrontal zzso activity zzso cluster zzso Only zzso had peak activity in the zzso prefrontal zzso cluster (including zzso of the zzso In zzso of the participants peak activity was located in either the left lateral prefrontal zzso or left zzso zzso Peak activity in the remaining zzso was dispersed throughout the prefrontal zzso 

There is considerable individual zzso in the location of the zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso Men appear to have a more uniform location of peak zzso response to cues than zzso zzso acquiring individual functional imaging data may be advantageous for either tailoring treatment to the individual or filtering participants before enrollment in zzso
