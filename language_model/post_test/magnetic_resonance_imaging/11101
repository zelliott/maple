zzso cognitive impairment zzso often represents an early form of zzso disease zzso In both zzso and zzso characteristic zzso changes may zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso may help to examine zzso changes in early disease by studying signal zzso to pharmacological zzso In this study, zzso patients zzso mean age zzso mini mental state examination zzso zzso were scanned during task performance in a zzso trial under three different medication zzso at baseline zzso no zzso zzso after a single oral dose of zzso zzso and after prolonged exposure zzso state: zzso Memory tasks included an episodic zzso task and a zzso zzso back working memory zzso zzso zzso in brain zzso patterns before and after treatment were analyzed for both tasks using zzso statistical zzso zzso increases in brain zzso from zzso were observed after prolonged exposure zzso For face zzso zzso these involved left prefrontal areas, the anterior zzso zzso left zzso areas, and left zzso zzso For working memory zzso increased zzso was found in right zzso and right middle frontal zzso coinciding with increased accuracy scores after zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso challenge produces zzso in brain zzso patterns in elderly zzso patients that can be detected with zzso This should encourage further functional imaging studies to examine the status of neurotransmitter systems in zzso
