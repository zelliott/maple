zzso learning is regarded as a manifestation of zzso plasticity in the sensory systems, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain zzso We measured the dynamics of performance on a visual task and brain zzso in the human primary visual zzso zzso across the time course of zzso zzso Within the first few weeks of training, brain zzso in a zzso zzso corresponding to the trained visual field zzso and task performance both zzso However, while performance levels then saturated and were maintained at a constant level, brain zzso in the corresponding areas decreased to the level observed before zzso These findings indicate that there are distinct zzso zzso in the time course of zzso learning, related to differential dynamics of zzso activity in visual zzso
