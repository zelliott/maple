The development of new zzso magnetic resonance zzso contrast media as zzso injection increased the choice of zzso contrast agents available in MR of the central nervous system zzso The purpose of our paper was to compare at the dose of zzso zzso zzso the safety of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso patients were enrolled with 143 patients in the zzso group, 132 patients in the zzso group and 276 patients in the zzso zzso Safety was assessed by recording the adverse events up to 24 hours after the zzso One or more adverse events were recorded in zzso of the zzso patients, in zzso of the zzso patients and in zzso of the zzso zzso These reactions were related to the contrast media in zzso zzso and zzso of the cases zzso Their intensity was defined as mild in zzso of the patients in the zzso group, in zzso of the patients in the zzso group and in zzso of the patients in the zzso zzso No severe reaction or death were zzso An zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso has been observed in zzso of the cases although an adverse event other than local reactions zzso zzso zzso has been noticed in 57% of the zzso No significant statistical difference was observed between the zzso zzso is a safe and effective contrast agent in zzso of the zzso in comparison with zzso and zzso currently in routine zzso
