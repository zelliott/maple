To compare zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the lung with standard zzso lung ventilation zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of 15 subjects who underwent zzso zzso and zzso lung ventilation zzso zzso zzso sections were acquired after a single inhalation of zzso gas, and standard zzso zzso lung ventilation zzso was performed during continuous breathing of zzso zzso The first breath zzso of each patient was compared with a composite MR image composed of the sum of the individual MR images and with the individual zzso MR zzso zzso defects on the two imaging zzso were compared for size, zzso and zzso in presence and zzso Assessment was done separately for each of four lung zzso 

Comparing the composite zzso MR images with zzso zzso ventilation zzso size, zzso and zzso were the same in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing the individual zzso MR image sections with the zzso ventilation zzso there was zzso between the ventilation defects in zzso zzso of zzso More defects were identified on the individual zzso MR images in zzso zzso of zzso 

There was good agreement between composite zzso MR image and first breath zzso zzso images, supporting the widely held assumption that zzso zzso likely depicts first breath lung zzso
