zzso is currently considered the best technique to study the zzso zzso in zzso Most studies are performed with the knee zzso out or slightly zzso which position is mandatory with contemporary MR zzso Recently, however, the MR equipment for limb studies and the larger tunnels of total body magnets have permitted partially dynamic knee studies, up to zzso degrees zzso this joint excursion cannot be zzso In 1996, zzso and zzso demonstrated that dynamic zzso can be useful to study cruciate ligament injuries, some types of zzso injuries, all zzso conditions and, mostly, cruciate ligament zzso We used an open magnet MR unit for thorough functional dynamic knee studies, acquiring the images at zzso degrees zzso The open magnet MR unit permits free joint zzso We examined 25 zzso 10 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso This technique schedules zzso zzso or zzso images, according to the diagnostic suspicion, suitably directed with the patient in lateral zzso and with the knee zzso to maximum joint zzso Dynamic MR findings are easily transferred to an X-ray film, so that the zzso can send them to the zzso with no need of any videotape or TV zzso The current zzso MR programs display the dynamic images of the moving joint on an MR zzso but this option is not yet widely zzso The quality of dynamic MR studies is exactly the same as that of conventional images, with a particular emphasis on the small diagnostic details of the zzso We report our preliminary experience with this technique, indicating some possible clinical applications of dynamic zzso which permits thorough studies of knee zzso
