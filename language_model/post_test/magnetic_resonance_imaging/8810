We evaluated short echo time two-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso with the zzso spatial selection zzso protocol in zzso lobe zzso zzso patients with negative magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings and described the characteristics of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with negative conventional zzso findings and 10 healthy controls were studied by zzso A zzso prolonged zzso zzso method was used as the standard for zzso focus zzso to evaluate zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso ratios in patients with negative zzso zzso The zzso showed that zzso patients and all healthy controls had stable zzso and good zzso zzso Compared with the healthy controls, 32 patients showed abnormal zzso + zzso ratios in the zzso and, in 25 of these patients, focus zzso agreed with the zzso It is concluded that short echo time zzso with the PRESS protocol can help find abnormalities in zzso of zzso zzso in patients with negative zzso zzso
