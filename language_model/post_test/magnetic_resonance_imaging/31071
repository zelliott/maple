To characterize the frequency and severity of incidental findings in brain zzso of young and older adult research volunteers, and to provide an evaluation of the ethical challenges posed by the detection of such zzso 

The authors reviewed 151 research zzso scans obtained zzso from subjects recruited to studies as healthy zzso zzso findings were classified into four zzso no zzso routine, zzso or immediate zzso p zzso for significance were zzso from zzso tests of zzso 

Of 151 studies, the authors found an overall occurrence of incidental findings having required referral of zzso By age, there were more findings in the older cohort zzso zzso zzso than in the younger cohort zzso zzso zzso and in more men than women in the older cohort zzso zzso zzso Three of four zzso findings in the younger cohort were classified in the urgent referral zzso zzso of the findings in the older cohort were classified as routine zzso zzso zzso 

The significant presence but different characteristics of incidental findings in young and older subjects presumed to be zzso healthy suggest that standards of practice are needed to guide investigators in managing and zzso their zzso
