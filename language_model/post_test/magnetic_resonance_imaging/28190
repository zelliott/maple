Twenty volunteers were examined by means of zzso and zzso time of flight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The possible diagnostic applications of zzso were also evaluated in 6 patients with zzso zzso zzso examinations of the zzso arteries were performed with a zzso T zzso magnet zzso zzso and circular body zzso Ten volunteers were studied with zzso zzso sequences zzso 25 degrees, zzso 40 zzso TE 7 zzso ST 1 zzso Ma 256 zzso zzso zzso zzso the images were acquired on the zzso plane and were zzso in zzso and target zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The other 10 volunteers were studied with zzso zzso sequences zzso 18 degrees, zzso 300 zzso TE 8 zzso ST 4 zzso overlap 1 zzso Ma 256 zzso zzso zzso zzso the images were acquired on the zzso and zzso planes and were zzso in zzso and target zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso segments zzso zzso were always easily identified with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso segments zzso zzso were also clearly demonstrated in 11 cases with zzso zzso and in 16 cases with zzso zzso zzso The zzso and branch vessels of the zzso arteries were easily depicted with zzso zzso sequences in 7 cases zzso Combined zzso and zzso zzso images permitted the thorough evaluation of the zzso zzso In zzso diseases, zzso and zzso zzso images clearly demonstrated zzso and zzso of the zzso segment zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences only permitted the zzso of a case of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibits good zzso as a zzso screening technique for the evaluation of zzso zzso
