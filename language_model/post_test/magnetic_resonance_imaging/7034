The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of bilateral disk displacement without reduction zzso on the skeletal and dental pattern of affected zzso There were 59 symptomatic female patients and 46 zzso normal female zzso All study participants had bilateral high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso planes to evaluate the zzso zzso Linear and angular zzso zzso were taken to evaluate the zzso zzso base, and dental characteristics of the two zzso A smaller zzso base length zzso was found in the symptomatic zzso The facial plane angle was smaller, and the angle of zzso was larger because of the zzso zzso The lower zzso base was also zzso as shown by the smaller zzso zzso The zzso group exhibited a larger zzso The zzso plane angle was zzso the zzso was more vertical zzso to zzso the zzso zzso height zzso was zzso and the angle between the zzso and the zzso plane zzso to zzso zzso was increased in the symptomatic zzso No significant dental differences were zzso This study showed that zzso in skeletal zzso might be associated with zzso This study suggests that subjects with zzso may manifest altered zzso zzso The zzso should be aware of that possibility, especially for the growing patients and the surgical zzso
