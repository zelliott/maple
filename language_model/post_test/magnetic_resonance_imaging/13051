A zzso connectivity analysis approach combining principal component analysis zzso and zzso analysis is proposed to detect functional connectivity between the brain zzso By first using zzso to identify clusters within the zzso of zzso time series, more energy and information features in the signal can be maintained than using averaged values from brain regions of zzso Then, zzso analysis can be applied to the extracted principal components in order to further investigate functional zzso Finally, zzso is applied and the patterns with zzso zzso than a threshold are considered as functional connectivity zzso The zzso and reliability of the presented method were demonstrated with both simulated data and human zzso data obtained during behavioral task and resting zzso Compared to the conventional functional connectivity methods such as average signal based correlation analysis, independent component analysis zzso and zzso the proposed method achieves competitive performance with greater accuracy and true positive rate zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and motor network results of zzso zzso data indicate that using zzso may improve upon application of existing zzso analysis methods in study of human brain functional zzso
