To evaluate the utility of zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the zzso arteries in the evaluation of potential zzso zzso 

Fifty consecutive patients underwent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso arteries as part of their evaluation as possible zzso zzso All imaging was performed on a zzso system with use of a torso zzso zzso Conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fast zzso imaging was performed to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso was performed during zzso injection of 40 zzso of zzso with use of a zzso sequence requiring a zzso of approximately 30 zzso zzso reconstructions were obtained of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso All studies were zzso evaluated by a single zzso experienced with body zzso zzso findings were used as the reference standard in 35 zzso To evaluate zzso zzso each examination was evaluated for image quality, zzso artery number, and anatomy by two zzso experienced with zzso and blinded to the other's interpretations and surgical zzso 

zzso percent of all zzso were graded as diagnostic quality zzso value zzso zzso P zzso zzso Multiple zzso arteries were identified in 29 zzso of 100 zzso Four of 50 patients studied zzso had zzso zzso abnormalities identified with MR zzso zzso and specificity for accessory zzso artery detection was zzso and zzso zzso Overall, accuracy for zzso in determining zzso artery number was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to assess the zzso arteries in potential zzso
