Human visual zzso shows zzso organization during both perception and attention, but whether this remains true for visual short-term memory zzso is zzso In 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we separated zzso zzso during perception, attention, and zzso zzso The 2 experiments differed in whether spatial zzso of the zzso stimuli and prospective attention to the locations of the remembered items was encouraged or zzso Using zzso pattern analysis to extract a measure of spatial coding in early visual cortex, we saw sensory and zzso zzso coding in both zzso However, significant spatial coding during memory maintenance was only seen where a spatial strategy was zzso Furthermore, individual differences in zzso spatial coding predicted performance in both experiments, while individual differences in maintenance spatial coding predicted performance in zzso We conclude that zzso coding in the early visual zzso during zzso maintenance is not zzso that zzso processes during stimulus perception zzso memory performance, and that different zzso strategies are used depending on the task in zzso
