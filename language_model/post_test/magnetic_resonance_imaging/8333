To investigate whether the biological process of zzso iron oxide zzso human zzso stem cells zzso may be monitored zzso by using in zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging with conventional zzso system examinations in corpus zzso of rats and zzso 

The labeling efficiency and viability of zzso zzso were examined with zzso blue and zzso blue, zzso After zzso zzso were transplanted to the corpus zzso of rats and zzso serial zzso MR images were taken and zzso examinations were carried out over a zzso zzso 

zzso loaded with zzso compared to zzso cells had a similar zzso For zzso zzso more than 1 X 10 zzso concentration in zzso MR images showed a decrease in signal zzso MR signal intensity at the areas of zzso zzso in the rat and rabbit corpus zzso decreased and was confined zzso After injection of zzso zzso into the corpus zzso MR imaging demonstrated that zzso could be seen for at least 12 weeks after zzso The presence of iron was confirmed with zzso blue zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in corpus zzso of rats and rabbits can be evaluated zzso by molecular MR zzso Our findings suggest that MR imaging has the ability to test the long-term therapeutic potential of zzso in animals in the setting of zzso zzso
