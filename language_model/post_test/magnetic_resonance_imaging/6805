With the development of zzso zzso heating of biological zzso along the metallic wires in the zzso scanner has become an important zzso To assess zzso response to zzso exposure during zzso we studied the temperature zzso near zzso metallic zzso All tests were performed on a zzso T clinical zzso Four experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the wire diameter, the zzso flip angle, the temperature distribution along the wire, and the wire zzso zzso simulations of the experimental setup were made with the use of commercial method of moments zzso software and zzso simulations of zzso zzso Comparisons between measured and calculated values of the electric field are zzso This study demonstrates that 1) temperature decreases with the diameter of the zzso temperature increases zzso with the zzso flip angle, 3) heating occurs not only at the tip but also along the wire, and 4) the heating zzso are not obtained for the classical resonant length multiple of zzso (where zzso is the zzso field zzso In addition, significant and rapid heating increases were observed in the close vicinity of the zzso
