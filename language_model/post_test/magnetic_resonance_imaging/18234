zzso nerve zzso zzso is an exceptionally rare zzso zzso It is treated similar to other zzso zzso The approach, however, is zzso as the zzso zzso nerves and especially the exit zones at the zzso are barely visible via the zzso zzso 

We demonstrate a case of a typical zzso with zzso zzso zzso according to standard zzso Continuous zzso monitoring, including zzso zzso of the zzso nerve in addition to zzso evoked potential zzso monitoring, was set zzso In prone position a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso an zzso zzso exposure of the lateral recess and the nerve root exit zone of the zzso nerve has been zzso A large zzso branch of the zzso inferior zzso artery zzso was identified as the cause of the zzso conflict and zzso
