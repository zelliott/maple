zzso kidney disease zzso is a common, deadly, and expensive threat to public zzso Patients susceptible to the development of zzso are difficult to identify because there are few zzso clinical techniques and markers to assess early kidney zzso zzso imaging techniques are being developed to zzso measure kidney zzso and function in zzso research and in clinical zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso techniques in particular have the potential to provide structural and functional information in the zzso Novel molecular imaging techniques, using targeted magnetic zzso that exploit the characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso have been developed in conjunction with zzso to count every zzso zzso in the kidney and measure their individual zzso This technique could open the door to the possibility of zzso assessing and eventually reducing a patient's risk for progression to zzso This review highlights the potential clinical benefits of early detection in patients predisposed to zzso and discusses zzso and regulatory hurdles to the translation of these molecular zzso techniques to provide early diagnosis of zzso
