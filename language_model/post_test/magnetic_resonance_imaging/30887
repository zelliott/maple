Recent observation of objects speeds up their subsequent identification and zzso This common form of learning, known as repetition zzso can operate in the absence of explicit memory for earlier experiences, and functional zzso has shown that object zzso improved in this way is accompanied by zzso zzso zzso neural zzso in zzso zzso and other cortical zzso These observations have led to suggestions that cortical representations of items undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso irrelevant information respond less as a given object is observed zzso thereby zzso future availability of pertinent object zzso Here we provide experimental support for an alternative hypothesis, in which reduced cortical activity occurs because subjects rapidly learn their previous zzso After a primed object zzso (such as zzso than a zzso cue reversal zzso than a zzso greatly slowed performance and completely eliminated neural zzso in zzso cortex, which suggests that these cortical item representations were no more available for primed objects than they were for new zzso In contrast, prefrontal zzso activity tracked zzso zzso and predicted the degree to which cue reversal would slow down object zzso the role of the prefrontal zzso in executive zzso
