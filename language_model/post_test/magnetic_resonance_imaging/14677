zzso connectivity has been correlated with a patient's level of consciousness and has been found to be altered in several zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, who experience a loss of consciousness, are assumed to suffer from zzso in zzso zzso however, previous studies have not explored the changes at a functional module zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the zzso in functional connectivity that occurs in absence zzso zzso By zzso the brain into 90 brain zzso we uncovered an altered functional connectivity within and between functional zzso Some brain regions had a greater number of altered connections and therefore behaved as key zzso in the changed network zzso these regions included the superior frontal zzso the amygdala, and the zzso In particular, the superior frontal zzso demonstrated both an increased value of connections with other zzso of the frontal default mode network and a decreased value of connections with the zzso zzso This divergence is positively correlated with zzso zzso These findings provide a new perspective and shed light on how functional connectivity and the balance of zzso module connections may contribute to both the state of consciousness and the development of absence zzso
