Recent studies indicate that zzso lobe zzso damage, either from focal zzso or neurodegenerative disease zzso semantic zzso zzso perception as well as long-term zzso zzso zzso however, these two patient groups show different performance for meaningful versus unfamiliar zzso In zzso with zzso zzso zzso the use of meaningful zzso compared with unfamiliar items, zzso discrimination zzso In semantic zzso a condition characterized by progressive deterioration of conceptual knowledge in the context of zzso zzso lobe damage, performance for meaningful stimuli was equivalent to that for unfamiliar zzso To further investigate these findings, we scanned healthy volunteers while they performed zzso zzso involving familiar zzso zzso and unfamiliar zzso zzso objects and faces and a baseline task of size zzso Outside the zzso zzso recognition memory was zzso We found above baseline activity in the zzso zzso and zzso for all object and face zzso and above baseline activity in the zzso pole for all face zzso The comparison of zzso relative to novel, faces and objects, revealed increased activity in the zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso pole, we also found activity related to zzso for faces but not for zzso zzso these zzso effects were evident even for zzso that were not subsequently well remembered, suggesting that the difference between meaningful and novel stimuli reflects zzso or conceptual processes rather than solely incidental zzso into long-term zzso The results provide further evidence that the zzso is recruited during complex zzso discrimination and additionally suggest that these structures are recruited in semantic processing of objects and zzso
