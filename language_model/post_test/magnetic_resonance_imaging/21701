zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to assess zzso zzso zzso in 13 patients with zzso disease and 3 normal subjects, and the results were compared to color zzso flow mapping zzso zzso produced a signal void in the left zzso during the zzso phase in all patients by zzso There were no false positive or negative results compared with zzso zzso Visual grading of zzso zzso gave results similar to color flow zzso zzso zzso The distance and the area of zzso zzso using zzso correlated well with color zzso flow mapping zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso of distance and area by color flow zzso tended to be larger than those by zzso zzso With current techniques zzso may overestimate the severity of zzso as compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso gives clinically useful information in patients in whom zzso zzso zzso is not zzso
