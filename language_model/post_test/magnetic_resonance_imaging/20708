To determine the quantitative difference between an intact complete zzso lateral zzso zzso and a torn zzso on MR zzso 

Between May 2005 to November 2009, 137 patients with a zzso zzso intact zzso and 30 torn zzso and 92 patients with a normal zzso were included in this zzso The evaluated parameters were the height of the zzso horn of the lateral and zzso zzso on the zzso images and their ratio as assessed by two observers twice at an zzso of 1 zzso Each zzso was analyzed based on the zzso zzso test, and the analysis using the mixed zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso zzso at session zzso 

The mean heights of the zzso horn of the lateral and zzso zzso on the zzso images for an intact zzso a torn zzso and a normal zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at session 1, zzso The mean heights of the zzso horn of the lateral and zzso zzso on the zzso images for an intact zzso a torn zzso and a normal zzso for both observers were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at session 2, zzso The ratio of the height of the lateral to the height of the zzso zzso for an intact zzso at both sessions for both observers was zzso The ratios were zzso and zzso for a torn zzso and for a normal zzso respectively, at both sessions for observer zzso The ratios were zzso and zzso for a torn zzso and for a normal zzso respectively, at session 2 for observer zzso The heights of the zzso horn of the lateral zzso on the zzso images and the ratios of the heights of the lateral to the zzso zzso in all three groups were statistically significantly different for both sessions zzso The zzso zzso for each zzso of both an intact zzso and a torn zzso at session 2 showed high correlations zzso 

The height of the lateral zzso and the ratio of the height of the lateral to the height of the zzso zzso for a torn zzso were significantly higher than those for an intact zzso
