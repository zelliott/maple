Left zzso zzso zzso is a fundamental zzso factor in a variety of cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso has achieved better zzso of zzso mass than zzso zzso However, significant zzso has often been reported, and no previous study has zzso these zzso The aim of this zzso was to investigate if there has been improvement in the accuracy in zzso mass measurement by zzso over zzso Studies comparing zzso mass between zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were zzso A cumulative zzso was performed to investigate improvement in zzso followed by zzso and zzso analysis to reveal factors affecting the zzso A total of 25 studies including zzso comparisons were zzso Studies published in or before 2004 showed high zzso zzso zzso zzso and significant zzso of zzso mass by zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso Studies published from 2005 to 2007 were still zzso zzso zzso zzso but showed less systematic bias zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso In contrast, studies published in or after 2008 were highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed excellent accuracy zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso Investigation of factors affecting the bias revealed that evaluation of cardiac patients compared to healthy volunteers led to larger bias zzso zzso In conclusion, this zzso zzso the zzso of zzso mass by zzso its improvement over the past decade, and factors affecting the zzso These data provide a more detailed basis for improving the accuracy of zzso an indispensable step toward further clinical zzso
