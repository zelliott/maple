Studies based on functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during the resting state have shown decreased functional connectivity between the zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso and regions of the zzso zzso Network zzso in adult patients with zzso Disorder zzso relative to subjects with typical development zzso Most studies used zzso correlation zzso among the zzso signals from different brain regions to zzso functional zzso Since the zzso correlation analysis only provides a limited description of functional zzso we investigated functional connectivity between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in three groups zzso patients with zzso zzso TD zzso subjects, zzso young TD subjects, zzso using a more comprehensive zzso approach - zzso machine learning using a zzso support zzso machine zzso that zzso an zzso index for each zzso The median zzso index for patients with zzso was greater than for TD zzso subjects zzso the zzso and young TD zzso did not differ significantly zzso the median zzso index of young TD was greater than that of TD zzso subjects zzso Low zzso below zzso zzso and around zzso zzso were the most relevant for discriminating between zzso patients and TD zzso controls and between the older and younger TD zzso In addition, we validated our approach using the zzso data of children publicly released by the zzso zzso obtaining similar zzso Our findings suggest that the abnormal zzso patterns observed in patients with zzso in this study resemble the patterns observed in young typically developing subjects, which reinforces the hypothesis that zzso is associated with brain maturation zzso
