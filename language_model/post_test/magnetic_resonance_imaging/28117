We compared the ability of zzso and CT to detect and characterize abdominal visceral zzso Seven patients with zzso abdominal CT interpreted as showing zzso (five zzso or possible zzso solid organ injury following blunt abdominal trauma were referred for abdominal zzso with a mean zzso of 3 days between zzso zzso and zzso spin echo sequences were obtained in all zzso zzso echo zzso sequences zzso degrees flip zzso were obtained in five zzso Both CT and MR allowed detection of complex zzso zzso in two patients and complex zzso injuries in three other zzso A sixth patient had subtle zzso zzso noted on CT which was not detected zzso on zzso One patient had a right adrenal zzso detected on zzso but not on zzso Relative zzso zzso and extent were judged equal on CT and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso imaging were judged inferior to zzso We conclude that zzso offers no significant advantage over CT for the routine evaluation of acute abdominal zzso
