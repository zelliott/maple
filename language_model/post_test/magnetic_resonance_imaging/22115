This study was devoted to tumor differentiation in liver MR zzso imaging with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso patients with 40 liver zzso were studied at zzso zzso Before and at least 45 minutes after zzso administration, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were zzso A quantitative analysis was performed zzso On zzso zzso images, the signal enhancement was zzso zzso 12 for the liver, zzso zzso 2 for zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 for the zzso zzso and zzso enhancement were not zzso After zzso on zzso zzso images, the zzso signal ratio zzso zzso zzso was definitely higher than the mean zzso signal ratio zzso zzso zzso This zzso differentiation ability lacked dramatically on zzso zzso images and, in one case, was reduced on zzso zzso zzso images by a long imaging delay after zzso administration (2 zzso
