zzso is a rare zzso of the zzso zzso which may be zzso as a benign or zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to zzso evaluate the MR imaging features of zzso 

Forty patients with zzso confirmed zzso were zzso zzso Of the 40 patients undergoing MR imaging, 39 had zzso zzso 30, zzso MR zzso and 17, zzso The image features assessed included the location, shape, margin, size, signal intensity, and enhancement pattern on zzso MR imaging and zzso zzso 

All 40 zzso originated from the zzso zzso but the zzso frequently extended into the zzso zzso cavity zzso toward the zzso zzso and into the zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated zzso on zzso and zzso zzso on zzso All 40 zzso showed a peripheral zzso rim on zzso zzso MR imaging revealed marked zzso zzso and zzso zzso Progressive enhancement was found on zzso MR imaging in 30 zzso The zzso showed a steady enhancement pattern in 3 cases, a rapidly enhancing and slow zzso pattern in 6 cases, and a rapidly enhancing and rapid zzso pattern in 21 zzso On zzso the mean zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso features of zzso on conventional MR imaging include internal zzso zzso and a peripheral zzso rim on zzso as well as strong zzso and zzso enhancement on zzso MR zzso The progressive enhancement on zzso MR imaging can also suggest the zzso
