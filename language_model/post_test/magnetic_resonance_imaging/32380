To investigate cortical representation of articulation of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso lip and zzso 

We examined cortical representation for zzso in zzso lip and zzso patients using blood zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso 

Data from four zzso adult zzso lip and zzso patients were compared with those from six healthy zzso 

zzso zzso were found in the bilateral primary zzso zzso in all zzso lip and zzso patients, as in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso to the side of zzso lip and zzso showed greater zzso in unilateral zzso lip and zzso patients, whereas the zzso zzso zzso to the side on which zzso had been performed earlier showed greater zzso in a bilateral zzso lip and zzso zzso 

The results suggest that there may be an zzso dominance in cortical representation during zzso articulation to the side of the zzso in the upper zzso
