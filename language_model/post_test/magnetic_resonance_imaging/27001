Delayed enhancement zzso using fast segmented zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso imaging is a well established zzso technique for identifying zzso zzso and is used as the reference standard sequence in this zzso The purpose of this study was to validate a recently developed dark zzso delayed enhancement technique in a zzso animal model, evaluate its performance in human patients, and zzso its performance compared with the reference standard in zzso 

In an animal study, the reference standard and dark zzso delayed enhancement were assessed in three pigs with induced zzso zzso In a human study, 26 patients, zzso years old (19 men and seven zzso with a known history of zzso zzso were zzso using the reference standard and dark zzso delayed zzso zzso ratio zzso signal intensity ratio, zzso ratio zzso and qualitative scores of zzso were zzso zzso were compared using paired samples zzso test and zzso signed rank zzso 

In the animal study, the mean zzso of zzso to blood pool was 11 times higher for dark zzso delayed enhancement than for the reference zzso The mean zzso was zzso times higher for the reference zzso In the human study, the mean zzso and signal intensity ratio of zzso zzso to the blood pool were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso times higher, respectively, for dark zzso delayed enhancement compared with reference zzso The mean zzso and signal intensity ratio of zzso zzso to normal zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso higher, respectively, for the reference zzso zzso analysis identified seven extra segments with grade 1 scars using dark zzso delayed enhancement zzso zzso zzso 

Dark zzso delayed enhancement is complementary to the reference zzso It can detect more zzso zzso of zzso thus potentially identifying more zzso and changing patient zzso
