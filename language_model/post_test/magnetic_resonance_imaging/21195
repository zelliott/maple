zzso the zzso data on the acute spinal zzso injuries and define a group of patients that could benefit from cellular transplantation therapy designed with the aim of repair and zzso of damaged spinal zzso zzso 

Five years zzso zzso Hospital, zzso zzso retrospective analysis of patients suffering from spinal zzso injury zzso Spinal zzso zzso defined as zzso complete, underwent a clinical evaluation following American Spinal zzso Association zzso and functional zzso zzso Independence Measure zzso zzso as well as zzso evaluation through spinal zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso
