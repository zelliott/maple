zzso meningitis zzso is a devastating neurological complication of cancer that needs to be diagnosed in the early stages of zzso zzso chain reaction detection of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso fluid zzso which are zzso markers for zzso zzso zzso inhibitor therapy in lung cancer, might be important to diagnose and to treat zzso in patients with lung zzso In this study, we attempted to detect zzso zzso in zzso and to compare zzso status between zzso and primary or zzso zzso in patients with lung zzso suspected of zzso 

zzso patients with lung zzso suspected of having zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso status of zzso was analyzed by direct DNA zzso zzso zzso of primary or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed in 20 zzso 

zzso zzso were detected in zzso of 13 zzso of 29 zzso In 5 zzso of 16 patients with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso In four patients, zzso zzso were shown in zzso but not in primary or zzso zzso zzso in two patients, zzso zzso were shown in primary or zzso zzso but not in zzso despite positive zzso zzso 

zzso zzso suggesting the existence of zzso cells, were detected in zzso even in patients with zzso cell lung cancer with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso do not always reflect the same status as in primary or zzso zzso
