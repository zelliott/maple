zzso resonance imaging zzso is become zzso as the most sensitive and specific imaging zzso for the examination of central nervous system zzso Blood oxygen zzso zzso contrast imaging is a zzso functional zzso technique for zzso active zzso brain zzso The aim of our study was to determine usefulness of zzso in detecting hand movements cortical activity in zzso with brain zzso and comparison with corresponding zzso Six right-handed patients with brain zzso of central zzso area, aged zzso years were examined using a commercial zzso T zzso All patients underwent both conventional and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso hand movements were examined separately for right and left hand at a zzso zzso zzso increase of signal intensity was found in: a) zzso primary motor zzso in all cases during both motor tasks, b) zzso primary motor cortex, supplementary motor zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso in a part of the cases c) displacement of the activity in the affected zzso in comparison to the opposite one was noticeable depending on the zzso and size of the zzso and accompanied zzso zzso of functional zzso in detecting primary motor area in patients with brain zzso was zzso There is a difference between zzso in affected zzso and corresponding normal zzso in the opposite zzso
