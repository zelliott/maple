zzso zzso magnetic stimulation zzso of auditory zzso has been proposed to treat zzso chronic zzso but the involved mechanisms of action remain largely zzso The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of zzso on auditory zzso activity in a series of zzso patients, using for the first time both functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the brain and auditory evoked zzso zzso 

In six patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed five sessions of zzso zzso delivered at zzso over the secondary auditory zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The effects of zzso were assessed on clinical zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The clinical impact of zzso on zzso was good for three patients zzso improvement of zzso severity compared to zzso moderate for two patients zzso zzso and zzso for one patient who had the most severe zzso at zzso The changes induced by zzso on zzso data varied with the baseline level of auditory zzso zzso before zzso This baseline level of zzso was itself related to the severity of zzso Thus, cortical stimulation increased auditory zzso zzso in patients who had less severe zzso and low level of zzso before zzso whereas it decreased auditory zzso zzso in patients who had more severe zzso and higher level of zzso before zzso Regarding zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in all patients, except in the patient who had the most severe zzso at baseline and showed no improvement after zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased after zzso only in patients with severe zzso at least for auditory stimulation zzso to zzso but increased in patients with less severe zzso 

The changes produced by zzso in auditory zzso activity, as assessed by zzso and zzso appeared to depend on a process of zzso zzso cortical zzso regardless of the therapeutic impact of zzso on zzso
