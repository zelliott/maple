To determine whether corpus zzso zzso predicts future clinical deterioration in multiple zzso 

In 39 multiple sclerosis patients the area of corpus zzso in the zzso plane, zzso and zzso zzso volumes, brain zzso fraction and brain zzso were determined at baseline and 1 year after treatment zzso zzso and multiple zzso models were built to identify the most reliable zzso of disability and of its changes over 9 zzso 

Corpus zzso zzso during the first year of treatment was the best predictor of disability zzso zzso zzso and of its increase at 9 years zzso zzso zzso Corpus zzso zzso of at least zzso predicted increase in disability with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity zzso ratio zzso zzso 

Corpus zzso zzso is a simple and accurate predictor of future disability zzso and is feasible for routine clinical zzso
