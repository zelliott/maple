Using zzso zzso we analyzed the functional zzso of covert zzso and zzso of return zzso zzso zzso to a target appearing within 250 zzso after an invalid zzso location cue zzso increased zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso right anterior and left zzso middle frontal zzso and right zzso areas that have previously been associated with zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso In contrast, zzso which leads to prolonged response times to targets that appear at the cued location at a zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by increased zzso in brain areas involved in zzso programming, such as the right zzso frontal zzso zzso eye field; zzso and the right inferior zzso zzso zzso eye field; zzso supporting the zzso bias theory of zzso zzso and zzso areas were involved both in covert zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were zzso involved in zzso with the right zzso zzso additionally involved in covert zzso
