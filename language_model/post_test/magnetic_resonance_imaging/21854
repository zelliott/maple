zzso imaging zzso detects small changes in water diffusion that occur in zzso zzso This study evaluated the clinical usefulness of a zzso zzso zzso sequence compared with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso in patients with cerebral zzso and assessed apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso changes over zzso zzso values and zzso ratios of image intensity were measured from the region of zzso and from the corresponding zzso brain zzso The clinical histories of patients with zzso scans obtained over the course of 1 year were reviewed to ascertain whether zzso aided in clinical diagnosis or zzso Of 103 scans obtained a mean of zzso days after symptom zzso zzso detected six zzso not seen on zzso and zzso two new zzso from old zzso zzso was most useful within 48 hours of the zzso The evolution of zzso values and zzso ratios was evaluated in 26 cases with known symptom onset zzso zzso values were low at less than 1 week after stroke onset and became elevated at chronic time zzso zzso ratios were near normal zzso increasing zzso zzso was superior to zzso zzso in detecting acute stroke, whereas both techniques assisted in determining zzso zzso
