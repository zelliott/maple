The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of zzso zzso zzso contrast magnetic resonance imaging zzso to characterize brain tumor zzso and tumor zzso In zzso zzso zzso experiments were carried out on normal rats zzso zzso zzso and rats bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso 17), before and after the injection of a zzso zzso contrast zzso The zzso variations of the zzso relaxation rate due to the injection of the contrast agent were used to generate relative cerebral blood volume zzso zzso zzso enhancement of the tumor was shown to reflect tissue zzso rather than leakage of the zzso zzso The quantitative results clearly show the zzso of tumor zzso and reveal a high vessel density in the peripheral area zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and a low vessel density in the central area of the tumor zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
