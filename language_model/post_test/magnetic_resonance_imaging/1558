The essential symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder zzso are intrusive worry about everyday life circumstances and social zzso and associated zzso zzso The amygdala, a brain region involved in fear and zzso behaviors in animals, and its projections to the superior zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and to the prefrontal zzso are thought to comprise the neural basis of our abilities to interpret social zzso zzso zzso volumes were previously reported in pediatric zzso however, the brain regions involved in social intelligence were not examined in this pilot zzso 

zzso resonance imaging zzso was used to measure the zzso thalamus, and prefrontal volumes in 13 medically healthy child and adolescent subjects with generalized anxiety disorder zzso and 98 comparison subjects, who were at low familial risk for mood and psychotic zzso Groups were similar in age, zzso zzso weight, zzso socioeconomic status, and zzso zzso 

The total, white matter, and gray matter zzso volumes were significantly larger in zzso subjects compared with control zzso zzso and prefrontal lobe volumes did not differ between zzso zzso of significant zzso interactions for zzso and zzso white matter volumes suggest that there is a more pronounced right zzso left asymmetry in total and zzso white matter volumes in pediatric zzso subjects compared with control zzso A significant correlation between the zzso white matter percent asymmetry index with the child report of the Screen for Child zzso Related zzso Disorders zzso was zzso 

These data agree with previous work implicating zzso zzso regions in anxiety disorders and may suggest zzso zzso in pediatric zzso
