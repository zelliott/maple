The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of zzso versus magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the characterization of zzso zzso 

One hundred and one patients with zzso zzso masses, which were scheduled for zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two different zzso scoring systems were used to distinguish zzso from benign zzso In addition, zzso zzso flow zzso was performed and the resistance index zzso of zzso blood vessels was zzso zzso values below zzso were considered to indicate zzso zzso was evaluated on the basis of signal intensity and zzso features such as wall zzso zzso fluid or solid zzso and zzso PET imaging was used to determine zzso zzso zzso was suspected if zzso zzso equaled or exceeded that of the zzso Based on zzso findings, sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values, and accuracy were first calculated independently for each imaging zzso Finally, a second session resulted in a consensus diagnosis being made based on the findings of all three zzso 

zzso evaluation of zzso masses resulted in correct zzso of 11 of 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso but with a specificity of only zzso With zzso and zzso zzso improved to 84 and zzso respectively, but sensitivities zzso When all imaging zzso were combined, sensitivity and specificity were 92 and zzso respectively, and accuracy was zzso 

Combination of ultrasound with zzso and PET may improve accuracy in differentiation of benign from zzso zzso zzso However, negative zzso or PET results do not rule out zzso zzso cancer or borderline zzso
