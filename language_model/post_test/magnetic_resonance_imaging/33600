Thirteen patients with zzso lateral zzso syndrome zzso were zzso Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso evidence demonstrated zzso in the zzso zzso which produced loss of pain and temperature sensation on one side of the face zzso to the zzso in seven zzso However, in another six patients, the zzso in a similar location produced the same sensory loss on the zzso zzso This is the first report of an analysis comparing these two conditions in zzso patients, confirmed by zzso The finding of normal zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso on median zzso in the two groups of patients may indicate that the impulses travel along the central pathways of touch, zzso and joint position sensation instead of the pathways for pain and temperature, because the patients had normal sensation of touch, zzso and joint position but impairment of pain and temperature zzso In addition, it is suggested that the pathways of late zzso zzso zzso pass through the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso instead of the spinal zzso tract in the zzso zzso Further, the observation of the much longer zzso (about 29 zzso of the normal zzso raises the possibility that the impulses may travel along the longer pathways through the opposite zzso zzso and up to the zzso or zzso where they project to bilateral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Although the alternative of zzso travelling only by the shorter pathways through the brain stem is not zzso this is not supported by current zzso
