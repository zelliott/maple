The purpose of this study was to describe the zzso motion of the zzso spine during a zzso zzso zzso procedure using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and to propose a mechanism of the zzso zzso motion as a result of a PA force to a zzso zzso zzso 

Studies reporting zzso descriptions of PA zzso are in agreement that motion takes place at all zzso zzso However, these studies differ in the reported direction of zzso 

Twenty zzso subjects zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in this zzso For each subject, a PA zzso force was manually applied at each zzso zzso process while zzso plane magnetic resonance images were simultaneously zzso zzso motion was defined as the change in the zzso angle between the resting and end range zzso positions imparted by the PA zzso 

PA force applied at 1 zzso process caused motion at the target vertebra and this motion was zzso zzso and zzso Motion at the target segment was always into zzso 

A PA force applied at a single zzso zzso process caused motion of the entire zzso zzso The magnitude and direction of zzso motions varied with the segment at which the PA force was zzso We zzso that the zzso motion induced by a PA force on a zzso process could be in part explained by the zzso of the zzso zzso
