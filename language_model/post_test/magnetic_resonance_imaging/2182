The aim of this study was to investigate changes of brain volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso multiple sclerosis zzso patients under treatment with zzso zzso Moreover, the relationship between brain volume changes and standard MR or clinical outcome variables was zzso After a zzso zzso period, 52 patients with zzso zzso were assigned to receive zzso zzso zzso during a zzso treatment period zzso scans were performed monthly during the zzso zzso period and for the first 9 months of the treatment zzso A final zzso scan was also performed at the end of the 12- and zzso treatment zzso Over 24 months of zzso treatment, a significant decrease of zzso zzso volume was found zzso zzso compared to the last zzso zzso while zzso zzso volume showed a slight zzso increase zzso and brain volume showed a significant decrease zzso zzso The mean volume of enhancing zzso over the zzso zzso period was significantly related to absolute zzso zzso and per cent change zzso zzso of brain volume during zzso treatment zzso No correlations between changes in brain volume and changes in zzso zzso volume or zzso zzso volume were zzso Neither was there a relationship between brain volume and changes of Expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso or frequency in clinical zzso Of the group in whom was detected a significant decrease of brain volume, 13 out of 26 zzso had a sustained change in zzso while in the group that did not have a significant decrease of brain volume, only 3 out of 26 zzso had a sustained zzso change zzso In this study a decrease of brain volume was found in zzso zzso patients treated with zzso over 2 zzso The only zzso that predicted brain volume decrease by 2 years of zzso treatment was the mean volume of enhancing zzso over the zzso zzso zzso
