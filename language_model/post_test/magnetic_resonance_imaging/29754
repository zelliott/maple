The factors regulating cerebral blood flow zzso changes in zzso zzso remain the subject of great interest and zzso Recent experimental studies suggest that an increase in zzso zzso mediates increased blood flow in the working zzso zzso injection should elevate zzso levels by increasing the zzso ratio, which is in near equilibrium with the zzso zzso We studied zzso responses to zzso zzso injection at rest and in visual stimulation by using zzso zzso in seven healthy zzso zzso zzso injection zzso the zzso response to visual stimulation by zzso in regions of the visual zzso but had no effect on the resting zzso or the zzso zzso These zzso zzso increases correlated with zzso in plasma zzso ratios and in plasma zzso levels but not with plasma zzso zzso Our observations support the hypothesis that an increase in the zzso ratio activates signaling pathways to selectively increase zzso in the zzso zzso brain zzso
