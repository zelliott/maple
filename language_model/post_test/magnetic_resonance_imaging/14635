Spinal inflammation and zzso have been described in magnetic resonance imaging zzso examinations of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso scoring systems have implemented these zzso 

zzso scans zzso or zzso inversion zzso from tumor necrosis zzso blocker zzso trials with patients with active AS zzso zzso zzso were analyzed at baseline and after 2 years based on zzso units zzso The analysis was based on the prevalence of spinal zzso in relation to inflammation zzso zzso or without it zzso zzso as an outcome measure on zzso and their course under zzso zzso The results of zzso scoring systems that include zzso or exclude zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

At zzso there were more zzso with inflammation zzso than with zzso irrespective of activity zzso After 2 years, active zzso decreased to zzso while inflammation was seen in a total of zzso of zzso - a reduction of zzso and zzso respectively (both p zzso zzso The overall extent of zzso decreased from zzso at baseline to zzso at 2 zzso At the patient level, zzso and zzso of patients showed active zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso of patients showed inflammation zzso zzso zzso at baseline and 2 years, zzso Both scoring systems showed similar improvement, independent of inclusion or exclusion of zzso 

zzso with zzso was observed in the spine of most patients with AS but their contribution to changes observed upon zzso therapy was small, indicating that zzso do not need to be included in quantitative scoring systems of zzso Spinal inflammation was still present after 2 years of zzso therapy in two-thirds of zzso
