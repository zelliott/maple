To evaluate the role of breast B zzso and magnetic resonance imaging in assessing the tumor response to zzso chemotherapy in breast zzso 

zzso patients with breast cancer diagnosed by core needle biopsy received zzso chemotherapy entered this prospective zzso Breast B zzso and dynamic enhanced zzso was performed before chemotherapy zzso after the second course and the fourth course of chemotherapy prior to the zzso Clinical evaluation was made through the tumor reduction measured by B zzso and zzso based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors zzso 

Measured by dynamic enhanced zzso 56 patients got partial response zzso 27 got stable disease zzso and 2 got progressive disease zzso none complete response zzso Measured by B zzso 52 patients got zzso 31 got zzso 2 got zzso no zzso zzso tumor size after chemotherapy on zzso correlated well with zzso zzso findings zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and B zzso correlated moderately with microscopic findings zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Dynamic enhanced zzso is a reliable method to evaluate tumor response to zzso chemotherapy in breast zzso
