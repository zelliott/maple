For zzso at zzso with a zzso zzso frequency of zzso zzso one of the principal zzso engineering challenges is to generate a zzso homogeneous transmit field over a larger volume of interest for spin zzso zzso volume coils large enough to house a receive array along with the subject and to maintain the zzso symmetry for different loading conditions is difficult at this zzso This calls for new approaches to zzso zzso design for zzso field MR zzso A remotely placed zzso zzso patch zzso which can easily be adjusted to different loading conditions, was used to generate a relatively homogeneous zzso field covering a large imaging volume with a zzso profile similar to that of a zzso zzso Since it was placed in front of the animal, this created valuable free space in the narrow magnet bore around the subject for additional zzso To enhance the reception sensitivity, the patch antenna was combined with an actively zzso zzso receive zzso zzso In addition to increased zzso compared to a zzso zzso surface zzso we were able to get high quality zzso echo and zzso images covering the whole rat zzso
