In children with zzso zzso radiation therapy can arrest progressive visual and zzso zzso We examined the zzso response and clinical outcomes after zzso 

zzso children zzso age at diagnosis, zzso zzso with zzso zzso were managed as zzso 11 zzso patients with zzso zzso were observed only; 2 patients, less than 3 years old, underwent surgery and chemotherapy to delay zzso and 29 patients with progressive disease received radiation with or without prior surgery or zzso Time to zzso response, long-term tumor control and late zzso were reviewed for the 29 zzso zzso 

The probability of at least 50% zzso response at 24 months after zzso was zzso and increased to zzso by 48 months and zzso by 60 zzso By zzso analysis, the median time for such zzso response was 62 zzso For the 29 zzso patients, the 10-year freedom from progression and overall survival rates were zzso and zzso respectively zzso follow-up for surviving patients, 108 zzso zzso or improvement in vision occurred in zzso of 26 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso response may be observed years after zzso zzso therapy provides excellent long-term tumor control and vision preservation or improvement in the majority of patients with progressive zzso zzso
