This study examines the anatomical zzso of naming vs recognizing faces using a novel measure that zzso culturally relevant and zzso items, the Northwestern University Famous zzso zzso zzso in primary progressive zzso zzso a syndrome characterized by progressive language deficits and associated with cortical zzso in areas important for word and object zzso 

zzso Test performance of 27 controls zzso age zzso zzso was compared with that of 30 patients with zzso zzso age 62 zzso zzso between zzso Test performance and cortical thickness measures were zzso within the zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso displayed significant impairment on the zzso zzso demonstrating that it is a useful measure of zzso identification for individuals with relatively zzso zzso Despite widespread distribution of zzso in the zzso group, face naming zzso were correlated with zzso of the left anterior zzso lobe while face recognition zzso were correlated with zzso zzso 

In addition to their clinical relevance for highlighting the distinction between face naming and recognition zzso in individuals with zzso zzso these findings add new insights into the zzso zzso zzso of zzso retrieval and object zzso
