To assess the relationship between magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso signal intensity reduction in patients with zzso zzso and the clinical manifestation of zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging at zzso T was performed in 38 consecutive patients affected by secondary zzso and in 20 healthy zzso zzso zzso levels were estimated in the affected zzso Twenty zzso of the 38 patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso signal intensity ratios were calculated from zzso zzso zzso zzso MR zzso The relationship between the quantitative reduction of the zzso signal intensity ratio and the clinical manifestation of zzso dysfunction was assessed in the affected zzso Signal intensity reduction in the anterior lobe of the zzso zzso was also correlated with the serum zzso zzso 

The degree of reduction of the zzso signal intensity ratio correlated with the presence of zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an overall accuracy of zzso In addition, the reduction of zzso signal intensity was greater in patients with higher zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso 

The degree of signal intensity reduction, measured as the zzso signal intensity ratio for zzso zzso images, in patients with secondary zzso zzso with the severity of zzso zzso
