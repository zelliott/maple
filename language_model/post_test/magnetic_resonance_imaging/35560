Despite the wide interest in the neural mechanisms of face processing and numerous zzso potential zzso and functional zzso zzso studies of zzso neural responses, no study, to date, has collected these two measures zzso The main reason for the absence of such an investigation is that zzso data acquisition generates major artifacts, which completely zzso the zzso zzso Recently, artifact removal zzso have been zzso Our goal was to examine the zzso of the zzso zzso component zzso and its functional effects such as category selectivity and zzso zzso when recorded simultaneously with functional zzso In our experiment, half of the scans were collected during zzso acquisition and half without zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso was then measured for its zzso zzso face selectivity (the difference between the zzso to faces and zzso zzso (the difference between the zzso to faces over the right and the left zzso and the zzso of the face selectivity effect, by zzso these measures across subjects between data collected without zzso and with zzso data zzso after applying artifact removal zzso We found high zzso zzso for all zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso data collected outside the scanner on a different day were highly correlated with data collected during MR acquisition for the zzso zzso zzso and selectivity index but moderate for zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso zzso effects are preserved in simultaneous recording with zzso These findings will hopefully encourage researchers to combine the two complementary zzso techniques in future zzso
