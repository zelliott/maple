zzso zzso zzso evaluates the geometry of the zzso cavity with acoustic reflections and provides information about zzso zzso areas zzso and zzso volume within a given zzso The accuracy of the information obtained by zzso was compared with that of magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso zzso Five healthy subjects were evaluated with zzso and the zzso before and after the application of a zzso zzso decongestant spray, to eliminate possible interference of the zzso cycle with both measurement zzso The zzso images of 2 zzso zzso sections of the zzso cavity were traced by three independent observers and the zzso were calculated by zzso imaging zzso to be compared with the calculated zzso obtained with the zzso at the corresponding distance from the zzso zzso zzso data from the zzso images were also used to calculate the zzso volume within the first 6 zzso from the zzso tip and compared with the zzso volume zzso The zzso variation of digitized zzso data zzso and zzso was not zzso The correlations of zzso and volume zzso between the zzso and zzso were high zzso after the application of the zzso The correlation between the zzso and zzso zzso before the decongestant was low zzso This may have been the result of interference of the zzso cycle during the long zzso zzso (1 zzso or other unknown zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and volumes provide accurate information when compared with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
