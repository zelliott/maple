The visual system has an extraordinary capability to extract zzso information from complex natural zzso For example, subjects are able to rapidly detect the presence of object categories such as animals or vehicles in new scenes that are presented very zzso This is even true when subjects do not pay attention to the scenes and simultaneously perform an unrelated zzso demanding task, a stark contrast to the capacity limitations predicted by most theories of visual zzso Here we show a neural basis for rapid natural scene categorization in the visual cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and an object categorization task in which subjects detected the presence of people or cars in briefly presented natural zzso The zzso pattern of neural activity in the zzso zzso evoked by the natural scenes contained information about the presence of the target category, even when the scenes were zzso and presented outside the focus of spatial zzso These findings indicate that the rapid detection of zzso information in natural scenes is zzso by a zzso zzso mechanism in zzso zzso that operates in parallel across the visual field, and biases information processing in zzso of objects belonging to the target object zzso
