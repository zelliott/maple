zzso in zzso structure and function have been implicated in the zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated whether patients experiencing zzso schizophrenia differed from healthy comparison subjects in regional zzso volumes or zzso zzso 

Volumes of four zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured from zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images in 69 zzso men, 32 zzso patients experiencing zzso schizophrenia and in 49 (27 men, 22 zzso healthy comparison zzso Patients were rated on the zzso for the Assessment of zzso zzso and the Schedule for zzso Disorders and zzso before the initiation of antipsychotic medication and at the time of the MR imaging zzso 

Patients and healthy comparison subjects did not differ in regional zzso volumes, but male patients demonstrated significantly reversed anterior and zzso asymmetry compared with healthy male zzso Among male patients, greater zzso in a composite measure of zzso asymmetry zzso zzso correlated significantly with increased negative symptoms before the initiation of antipsychotic zzso 

These findings zzso an zzso zzso process involving the zzso in the zzso of schizophrenia and are consistent with prior studies implicating abnormal asymmetry in schizophrenia at the zzso zzso
