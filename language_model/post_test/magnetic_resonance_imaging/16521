The study of human brain zzso has extended beyond traditional frequency ranges identified by the classical zzso zzso encompassing both higher and lower zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso power have been identified as markers of local cortical zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso have been associated with functionally significant cortical networks zzso using zzso zzso In this study, we examined zzso changes in zzso power across a range of zzso zzso zzso in the default mode network zzso zzso the zzso in zzso power fluctuations between zzso separated zzso makes it possible to detect small, zzso extended, and temporally coherent fluctuating components in the presence of much larger incoherent zzso We show that the default network is characterized by significant zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso occurs over a narrow frequency range, centered at zzso zzso commensurate with the frequency of zzso signal fluctuations seen by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso changes in local cortical activity form the zzso basis for this zzso
