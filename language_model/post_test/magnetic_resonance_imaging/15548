zzso involves a fundamental impairment in processing zzso information from zzso Several recent studies have challenged earlier findings that individuals with zzso spectrum disorder zzso have no zzso of the zzso zzso zzso face area, zzso when viewing zzso In this study, we examined zzso to faces in the broader network of zzso zzso that comprise what is known as the social zzso Using zzso functional resonance imaging, we measured zzso signal changes in 10 zzso subjects and 7 healthy controls passively viewing zzso zzso We zzso our original findings of significant zzso of face zzso areas zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, in addition, we identified zzso in a more widely distributed network of brain areas involved in face processing zzso the right amygdala, inferior frontal zzso zzso superior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso we found functional correlations between a zzso of areas in the social brain that belong to the mirror zzso system zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The severity of the social symptoms measured by the zzso zzso Observation Schedule was correlated with the right IFC cortical thickness and with functional zzso in that zzso When viewing faces, adults with zzso show zzso patterns of zzso in regions forming the broader zzso network and social brain, outside the core zzso and zzso zzso These patterns suggest that areas belonging to the mirror zzso system are involved in the zzso disturbances in zzso
