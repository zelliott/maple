The zzso visual system is broadly organized into two zzso processing zzso a zzso stream for object vision and a zzso stream for space zzso Here, evidence from functional brain imaging in humans demonstrates that object representations are not confined to the zzso pathway, but can also be found in several areas along the zzso zzso In both streams, areas at intermediate processing stages in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso but zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso areas in lateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responded selectively to objects independent of image zzso zzso to the zzso hypothesis, our findings indicate that basic object information related to shape, size and viewpoint may be represented similarly in two parallel and zzso organized neural systems in the zzso and zzso visual zzso
