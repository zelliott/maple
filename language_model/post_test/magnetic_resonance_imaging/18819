Whether zzso injections would be positive in subjects with benign persistent zzso who are not seeking treatment is zzso This information is important, because benign zzso undoubtedly zzso in patients with chronic low back pain zzso illness that is not zzso zzso If these subjects had a high rate of positive zzso the high background zzso of common zzso would allow many positive tests in patients in whom zzso processes were unrelated to their severe zzso zzso zzso if subjects with benign low back pain rarely if ever had significant zzso pain reproduction on disc injections, the basic zzso of zzso diagnosis would be zzso 

To compare, using a strict experimental design, the relative pain and zzso response to provocative zzso in subjects with clinically insignificant zzso and clinical subjects with zzso illness considering surgical zzso 

zzso of experimental disc injections in subjects with persistent mild zzso and those with chronic low back pain zzso zzso 

Twenty-five subjects with mild persistent low back pain zzso were recruited for an experimental zzso zzso zzso were recruited from a clinical study of patients having had cervical spine zzso zzso criteria required that subjects not be receiving or seeking medical treatment for zzso be taking no medications for zzso have no activity restrictions because of zzso and have normal zzso zzso To more closely approximate the pain behavior in zzso illness, 50% zzso of the zzso group were recruited with a chronic painful condition zzso unrelated to the low zzso zzso subjects, patients coming to zzso for consideration of surgical treatment, were used as control zzso 

zzso of zzso were determined using the criteria of Walsh et zzso pain response of 3 or greater, two or more pain behaviors, a negative zzso zzso injection, and a similar or exact zzso zzso 

zzso was performed on experimental subjects and control zzso zzso zzso who were blinded to control versus experimental status of the subjects, scored the magnetic resonance image, zzso zzso tests and zzso videotapes of the subjects' pain zzso 

Thirteen of 25 volunteer subjects had pain rated as zzso or worse with disc zzso There were 12 painful and fully zzso disc injections in 9 of these 25 zzso subjects zzso These injections met all the Walsh et zzso criteria for a positive diagnosis of zzso zzso All positive discs had zzso disruption to or through the outer zzso Of the 9 subjects with positive zzso 3 had no chronic pain states and 6 zzso All subjects with positive injections had negative control zzso In comparison, in 52 subjects with zzso illness 38 zzso had at least one positive disc zzso 

In a group of volunteer subjects with persistent zzso zzso were found to have significant pain on disc injection, which is reported to be zzso with their usual zzso The presence of positive zzso pain responses and negative control discs in zzso of subjects without zzso illness seriously challenges the specificity of provocative zzso in identifying a clinically relevant spinal zzso
