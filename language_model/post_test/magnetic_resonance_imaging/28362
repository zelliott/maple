The effective clinical use of the zzso drug zzso zzso requires the zzso assessment of its transport and zzso particularly in the tumor and the liver, where the drug is zzso to zzso zzso In this study, the zzso and limitations of dynamic zzso PET and zzso zzso zzso examinations for zzso zzso monitoring were investigated in zzso and Buffalo rats with transplanted zzso and zzso Morris zzso zzso Selective zzso and zzso MR images were acquired 5 and 70 zzso after zzso injection using a zzso zzso zzso After administration of zzso the zzso of the regional zzso zzso were measured by dynamic PET scanning over 120 zzso To allow a comparison between PET and zzso data, standardized zzso values zzso were zzso at the same points in zzso The zzso zzso showed a significantly zzso zzso zzso higher mean zzso at 5 and 70 zzso zzso injection than the zzso cell lines, whereas there were no significant differences between the mean zzso measured in the liver of both animal zzso In contrast to the PET data, no significant differences in the mean zzso and zzso MR signal values in the tumor of both models were zzso The MR images, however, yielded the additional information that zzso is converted to zzso only in the liver and not in the zzso
