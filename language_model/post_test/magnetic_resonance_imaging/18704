The aim of our prospective study was to assess the MR imaging characteristics of zzso zzso of neuroendocrine tumors and to determine the optimal MR sequence for their zzso 

zzso consecutive patients with liver zzso from neuroendocrine tumors underwent zzso MR imaging of the liver zzso zzso fast zzso with respiratory monitoring, zzso zzso zzso fast zzso and zzso zzso echo sequences before and after the injection of zzso zzso Images were reviewed independently by three observers for the number, location, and pattern of signal and enhancement of zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were zzso 279 on zzso fast zzso 231 on zzso zzso fast zzso 272 on zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso phase, and zzso on portal zzso phase zzso zzso zzso phase images revealed the greatest number of zzso in zzso of patients, including 35 zzso seen only on this zzso and was significantly superior to the zzso zzso and portal zzso phase sequences zzso zzso zzso The zzso contrast was significantly greatest with zzso fast zzso zzso The enhancement patterns of zzso were predominantly zzso zzso peripheral with progressive zzso and delayed in, respectively, 27, four, four, and two zzso Most zzso with peripheral enhancement and progressive zzso were zzso on zzso images and were without zzso peripheral zzso 

zzso zzso of neuroendocrine tumors had a typical zzso pattern in zzso of zzso zzso zzso phase and fast zzso zzso sequences are the most zzso
