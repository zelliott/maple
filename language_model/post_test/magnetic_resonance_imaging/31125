We compared the effects of zzso and zzso on cerebral zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso fluid pressure zzso and mean zzso blood pressure zzso in patients zzso with zzso or zzso undergoing zzso for zzso mass zzso Additionally, emergence from zzso was examined to determine if zzso function could be assessed earlier after zzso or zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso to receive either zzso or zzso for maintenance of zzso at zzso minimum zzso concentration zzso Patients were zzso zzso 30 zzso 2 zzso zzso after baseline zzso was obtained via the zzso zzso At a MAC of zzso mean zzso was not statistically different between the two study groups either before or after zzso Additionally, zzso was not significantly different between the two zzso Finally, patient's time to respond to commands was 50% shorter in the zzso group (30 zzso 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared with the zzso group zzso zzso 126 zzso however, this was not significant zzso zzso zzso In patients undergoing zzso for zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso have similar effects on zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso in the setting of hyperventilation does not cause significant changes in zzso 

This is the largest study to date comparing the effects of zzso and zzso on patients undergoing zzso for zzso mass zzso with evidence of zzso shift or zzso Neither zzso nor zzso significantly altered zzso zzso fluid pressure when moderate zzso was zzso
