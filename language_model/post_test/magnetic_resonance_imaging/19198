zzso zzso is an important zzso of the zzso of drinking water that produces liver cancer in zzso Assessment of the risk that results from zzso that occur in drinking water will be dependent upon the mode of action held responsible for these zzso A study by zzso and Bull zzso zzso and zzso zzso J (1997) zzso in zzso and cell zzso behavior of zzso tumors inducted by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice treated with zzso demonstrated a zzso distribution that was skewed towards many small, altered zzso of cells that are assumed to be precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso Environmental Protection zzso zzso zzso for zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso 61, zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine the extent to which the zzso effects of zzso could be explained by its effect on tumor growth rates zzso tumor promoting zzso In zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso allowed accurate determination of growth rates of individual zzso in mice that had been treated with zzso in drinking water at 2 zzso Out of thirty treated mice, ten were found to have zzso tumors zzso by zzso at 48 weeks of zzso These zzso animals were assigned to two groups matched on the size of zzso observed by in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso continued in one group of five mice and was stopped in the zzso For both groups, tumor growth rates were determined by measuring changes in size of all zzso greater than 1 zzso in volume during a zzso zzso zzso of zzso treatment resulted in growth rates that could not be distinguished from zero across all zzso sizes represented in the zzso These data are in agreement with previous observations of zzso effects on replication rates within tumors zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth rates observed in animals maintained on treatment decreased with zzso volume in a manner that is consistent with a zzso zzso zzso process proposed by Tan zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso of this model obtained by fitting measured growth rates were used to predict the zzso distribution expected after one year of zzso zzso The shape of the predicted zzso distribution was similar to that observed by zzso and Bull zzso and zzso zzso in mice sacrificed after 40 weeks of zzso zzso We conclude that the effects of zzso on the division and/or death rates of spontaneously initiated cells can account for the predominance of small zzso in zzso zzso
