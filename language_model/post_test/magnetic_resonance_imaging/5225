zzso zzso of the prostate zzso on zzso zzso zzso remains a persistent challenge and continues to introduce geometric uncertainty into the planning and delivery of external beam zzso zzso therefore, developed an zzso tool to zzso the zzso errors and determine the location of the zzso 

A planning CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging scan were zzso acquired for 10 patients with prostate zzso The prostate zzso were contoured by 3 independent observers using the CT data sets with instructions to zzso the prostate without zzso but to minimize zzso The standard prostate for each patient was defined using magnetic resonance imaging and CT on multiple zzso After registration of the CT and magnetic resonance imaging data sets, the zzso zzso were scored for zzso The contours were defined as ideal if they were within a zzso expansion of the standard without zzso acceptable if they were within a zzso expansion and a zzso zzso and unacceptable if they extended zzso zzso or underestimated the prostate by zzso zzso 

A total of 636 CT slices were individually zzso with the vast majority scored as ideal or zzso However, none of the 30 prostate zzso sets had all the contours scored as ideal or zzso For all 3 observers, the unacceptable contours were more likely from zzso than zzso of the zzso The errors were more common at the base and zzso than the zzso 

The zzso tool allows for directed feedback on the location of zzso zzso as well as the determination of zzso or zzso of the zzso This metric might help improve the accuracy of prostate zzso
