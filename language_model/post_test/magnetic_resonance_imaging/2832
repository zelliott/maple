zzso pulse sequences can reduce imaging time and decrease motion zzso If zzso pulse sequences are shown to be comparable to zzso sequences in MR imaging of the brain, then zzso imaging can be valuable for examining critically ill, anxious, or uncooperative patients and can increase patient zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso compare one fast zzso zzso zzso acquisition in the steady state zzso zzso sequence with one conventional zzso zzso sequence to determine the reliability of the zzso sequence for detecting cerebral zzso 

Fifty-one patients with 142 zzso zzso including brain tumors, zzso infection, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images of the head were obtained with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso and extent of the zzso image zzso zzso and artifacts were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were more conspicuous on the zzso zzso images because of the higher zzso ratio of the normal brain resulting in higher zzso zzso The higher zzso ratio of zzso on the zzso zzso images was not found to be significant in the independent qualitative zzso The zzso and extent of other zzso evaluated with the two pulse sequences were not significantly different for either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso artifacts were significantly reduced on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso artifacts were more pronounced on the zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence provides high-quality images with fewer vascular zzso artifacts three to four times faster than the zzso zzso The zzso sequence can reliably show zzso zzso and can substitute for the zzso zzso sequence in routine brain zzso
