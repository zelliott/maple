zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the relationship between regional cerebral zzso rates for zzso zzso age, and performance on a delayed response zzso test of memory in the aged zzso Eleven aged animals, zzso old, were included in the zzso Regional zzso zzso to values for the entire brain, were determined for the zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso The aged animals exhibited significant DR deficits relative to a cohort of normal young zzso zzso in DR performance among the aged subjects was significantly correlated with relative zzso zzso and zzso age was a reliable predictor of zzso zzso zzso This pattern of results suggests that DR zzso in the aged monkey may partly reflect age-related dysfunction distributed among multiple zzso system structures that participate in normal learning and zzso Overall, the findings support the use of zzso zzso zzso in efforts to define the relationship between cognitive performance, age, and brain physiology in nonhuman zzso
