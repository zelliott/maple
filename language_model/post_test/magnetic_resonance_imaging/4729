zzso resonance zzso imaging studies of exercising leg muscles were performed to compare the changes in MR zzso relaxation times zzso that result from exercise of the anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the anterior compartment of the lower leg with those zzso changes in the zzso and lateral zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained at zzso zzso before and during the first 14 zzso of recovery from dynamic zzso In order to zzso the exercise, zzso for each subject were set at zzso of the measured maximum voluntary contraction zzso of the anterior and zzso zzso In separate exercise sessions, a zzso zzso exercise apparatus was employed for either zzso or zzso against a fixed constant resistance for two different exercise zzso (1 zzso 45 s or 5 zzso zzso MR images zzso zzso 1000 zzso TE zzso 30, 60, 90, 120 zzso 128 zzso 256 zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to calculate zzso zzso Although subjects performed approximately zzso more work zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso vs zzso during zzso than during zzso at both exercise zzso the exercise induced zzso while being greater than those at rest zzso zzso or zzso zzso were not significantly different in the different zzso We conclude that, when exercised at the same workload zzso of zzso these two muscles produce zzso changes that are not significantly different from each zzso
