zzso changes in gray matter volume and cognitive performance were evaluated among individuals exposed to zzso zzso zzso virus zzso 1 zzso There is a zzso association of zzso exposure with smaller prefrontal volumes and cognitive zzso in zzso 

The authors zzso examined the zzso zzso trajectory over 1 year of gray matter volumes and executive functioning measured with the Wisconsin zzso zzso Test among 26 zzso zzso subjects with schizophrenia and 38 healthy zzso Age, zzso socioeconomic status, and exposure to zzso (another virus of the zzso family that was previously associated with cognitive zzso were the zzso 

zzso gray matter loss in the zzso zzso zzso was noted among the zzso schizophrenia subjects over 1 year but not among other zzso zzso gray matter volumes did not show zzso zzso zzso zzso models indicated that improvement over 1 year in Wisconsin zzso zzso Test categories completed and zzso errors occurred in significantly fewer zzso schizophrenia subjects than in the zzso schizophrenia subjects or the healthy subjects regardless of zzso zzso zzso interactions of diagnosis, zzso status, and time were significant for both categories completed and zzso zzso An increase in zzso errors over 1 year, but not the change in the number of categories completed, correlated with zzso volume loss of the zzso zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso exposure may be associated with zzso gray matter loss in the zzso zzso zzso and decline in executive functioning among subjects with zzso
