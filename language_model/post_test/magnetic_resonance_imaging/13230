Visual zzso learning is defined as performance enhancement on a sensory task and is distinguished from other types of learning and memory in that it is highly specific for location of the trained zzso The location specificity has been shown to be paralleled by enhancement in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal in the trained region of zzso after visual zzso Although recently the role of sleep in strengthening visual zzso learning has attracted much attention, its underlying neural mechanism has yet to be zzso Here, for the first time, zzso measurement of human zzso zzso was conducted zzso with a zzso during sleep with and without preceding training for visual zzso zzso As a result of predetermined zzso analysis of zzso zzso enhancement during zzso sleep after training was observed specifically in the trained region of zzso Furthermore, improvement of task performance measured subsequently to the zzso sleep session was significantly correlated with the amount of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso during zzso These results suggest that as far as zzso is concerned, only the trained region is involved in improving task performance after zzso
