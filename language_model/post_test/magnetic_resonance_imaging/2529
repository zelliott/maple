To investigate possible distinct contributions of different zzso structures to zzso zzso the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was administered zzso to zzso patients who had undergone one of three types of zzso zzso zzso in three different institutions for surgical treatment of zzso The zzso were zzso zzso selective zzso zzso or anterior zzso zzso with encroachment on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso scans, showed unexpected encroachment on zzso structures in most patients of the zzso groups, and largest zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso identification was observed in all patient groups, irrespective of surgical approach, with greatest impairment in the zzso zzso to the zzso The finding of deficits in all three surgical groups suggests that damage in the anterior zzso area, perhaps in zzso cortex, is sufficient to disrupt performance on this zzso it may be that function is disrupted in the zzso zzso region by zzso when the zzso area is damaged, even when zzso and zzso are left zzso An alternative explanation for our results is that damage in any one of these areas zzso a complex network involving several distinct zzso zzso
