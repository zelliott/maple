When using imaging to predict time to progression from mild cognitive impairment zzso to Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso statistical methods account for varying lengths of follow-up times among subjects whereas zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso do zzso Our objectives were to apply a zzso zzso zzso method to identify regions on zzso where zzso is associated with significantly increased risk of future progression to zzso in subjects with zzso and to compare it to traditional zzso patterns obtained by applying zzso zzso We also compared the power required to detect an association using zzso methods versus zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso at baseline were followed zzso The event of interest was clinical diagnosis of zzso Cox zzso hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and education were used to estimate the relative hazard of progression from zzso to zzso based on zzso zzso gray matter density zzso zzso 

The greatest risk of progression to zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Patients ranked at the 25th zzso of GMD in these regions had more than a doubling of risk of progression to zzso at a given time point compared to patients at the 75th zzso Power calculations showed the zzso approach to be more efficient than the traditional zzso zzso 

We present a new zzso zzso method that incorporates zzso statistical zzso In the context of a progressive disease like zzso zzso zzso seems more appropriate and powerful than traditional zzso zzso
