Assessment of left zzso zzso function with cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging is often limited to evaluation of zzso function, including analysis of regional wall motion, measurement of mass and volume, and zzso of ejection zzso However, zzso dysfunction is present in various heart diseases, particularly in heart failure with preserved ejection zzso which is increasingly prevalent and is associated with a poor zzso In daily practice, the assessment of zzso function is mainly performed with zzso zzso zzso of zzso function with cardiac MR imaging is seldom performed in clinical zzso However, basic assessment of zzso relaxation and zzso abnormalities can be achieved with MR imaging by using a combination of left atrium size measurement and zzso evaluation of zzso zzso In addition, assessment of pulmonary zzso flow and the zzso filling curve can also be zzso Furthermore, MR imaging with late zzso enhancement sequences provides insight into the extent of zzso fibrosis, which strongly influences zzso zzso Finally, zzso evaluation of tissue zzso zzso zzso MR zzso and MR zzso are promising tools for a better understanding of zzso zzso function but require further zzso
