Observation of changes in zzso zzso was one of the first zzso used to detect zzso zzso activity zzso is a peripheral measure of zzso zzso and one of the primary channels used in zzso zzso In an attempt to develop a more central measure to identify lies, the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to detect deception is being zzso We wondered if adding zzso to our zzso analysis would improve our diagnostic zzso For our approach, however, adding zzso did not improve the accuracy in a zzso deception zzso In testing for brain regions that zzso as zzso of zzso we did find significant associations in right zzso and bilateral anterior zzso zzso Further work is required to test whether zzso improves accuracy in other testing formats or with higher levels of zzso
