In sentence comprehension research, the case system, which is one of the zzso of the language processing system, has been assumed to play a crucial role in signifying relationships in sentences between noun phrases zzso and other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, so far, less attention has been paid to the question of how cases are processed in our zzso To this end, the current study used zzso and scanned the brain activity of 15 native English speakers during an zzso processing zzso The results showed that, while the processing of all cases activates the left inferior frontal zzso and zzso part of the middle zzso zzso zzso case processing activates these two regions more than zzso and zzso case zzso Since the effect of the difference in behavioral performance among these three cases is excluded from brain zzso data, the observed different brain zzso would be due to the different processing patterns among the cases, indicating that cases are processed differently in our zzso The different brain zzso between zzso case processing and zzso case processing may be due to the difference in structural complexity between zzso
