An in zzso experimental investigation of internal disc mechanics and zzso zzso 

To test the zzso 1) The pattern of internal loading of zzso discs in zzso is similar to that measured previously in zzso 2) stress zzso also are found in clinically zzso discs in zzso and stress zzso are associated with zzso zzso 

Stress zzso corresponding to potentially painful loading patterns of the zzso disc and zzso have been observed in zzso 

The distribution of stress within the zzso zzso discs of patients with chronic zzso pain was measured using stress zzso The severity of their pain was assessed using provocative zzso 

zzso pain was found to be associated with anomalous loading of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso discs were found to have a 38% wider zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than painless discs and to have a zzso lower mean nuclear stress zzso zzso zzso 

Stress zzso is an effective investigation of the mechanics of zzso discs in zzso zzso pain is caused by changes in the pattern of loading of the zzso zzso or nucleus zzso
