Brain regions activated during the zzso movement were evaluated by zzso Eight healthy right-handed volunteers as zzso were included in this zzso Echo zzso imaging of zzso were obtained with the zzso echo sequence using zzso T MR zzso All zzso were subjected to complete six tasks of zzso zzso simple mouth opening and closing movement, zzso movement, zzso movement, right lateral movement, left lateral movement, and imaginary mouth opening and closing zzso The stimulation paradigm consisted of 7 cycles of zzso Each cycle consisted of 10 repeated zzso during zzso and zzso periods of each 5 zzso The head of zzso in the zzso position was zzso to minimize zzso motions during all functional zzso before motions of the head were zzso The following conclusions were zzso zzso The examinations were achieved with minimal artifacts caused by motions of the zzso zzso The region of motor zzso zzso by the zzso movements approximately agreed with those reported by zzso methods in animals, such as cats and zzso zzso zzso area of motor zzso and the supplementary motor area were further extended according to the move complex zzso zzso zzso zzso involvement of the zzso association area was indicated in the lateral zzso zzso zzso of the motor speech area was observed during lateral zzso zzso zzso of the involvement of the zzso area was indicated in zzso zzso It was thus concluded that zzso may be useful to analyze the brain regions activated by zzso zzso
