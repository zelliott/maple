To conduct magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies of zzso zzso of the breast and to establish correlations with zzso zzso 

zzso resonance images of the breast from 32 patients identified with surgically zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso findings was based on evaluation of the zzso internal signal intensity, contrast enhancement, type of the zzso curve, and presence or absence of zzso ducts associated with the zzso zzso zzso of our series were classified into several MR types and were compared to each of the surgically zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the breast were classified into 4 MR zzso oval zzso in 14 zzso irregular zzso in 6, solid and zzso mass in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Each of the MR types reflected its unique zzso features: oval zzso composed of zzso zzso surrounded by narrow zzso space inside the zzso irregular zzso of zzso zzso entirely filling up the zzso space and adhering to the duct wall, with irregular margins surrounded by zzso or zzso of zzso zzso solid and zzso mass of solid zzso zzso of zzso zzso attached to the zzso zzso duct wall; and zzso zzso of 1 to 2 zzso in diameter with zzso zzso They showed various contrast enhancements and zzso zzso zzso ducts associated with the zzso were recognized in 20 zzso 

zzso the MR images of zzso zzso could be useful for understanding their zzso zzso
