Several previous studies have compared the blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso response zzso in healthy elderly subjects to the zzso in young zzso Some studies have found a relative decreased zzso in the elderly in the visual cortex, whereas other studies have found the elderly zzso zzso in the visual zzso to be nearly identical to that in young zzso A possible explanation for the different findings is that the peak zzso zzso is similar between the groups, but that the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso by the inclusion of less significant zzso zzso to a smaller extent of zzso in the zzso or by the inclusion of zzso zzso We tested this hypothesis using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso While undergoing zzso subjects performed a simple visual and motor task, pressing with their index fingers in response to visual presentation of the word zzso Data from 18 subjects, 8 young and 10 elderly, were zzso For each subject, a visual and a motor zzso was selected by choosing the most significant positive zzso within the zzso defined zzso This individual subject approach excluded both zzso and zzso zzso Similar zzso were found for the elderly and the young subjects in both motor and visual regions and a more sustained zzso response was found for the elderly in both zzso Additionally, as predicted, a greater percentage of zzso with a negative zzso was found for the elderly in the visual zzso this finding was also zzso in our zzso of an independent zzso and aging study from the zzso Data zzso zzso zzso observations of negative zzso in visual areas have been interpreted as the effect of zzso processing during zzso Our results suggest that the elderly may have more zzso visual processing during the rest condition in the zzso The observation that the group differences in the zzso response are sensitive to zzso selection zzso inclusion of zzso and/or negative zzso underscores the importance of zzso selection criteria in the interpretation of zzso studies using elderly zzso
