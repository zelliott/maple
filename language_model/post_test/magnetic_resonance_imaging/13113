Several zzso and zzso studies have been performed to clarify the neural bases of implicit learning, but the question of which brain regions are involved in different forms of implicit learning, including zzso learning and habit learning, has not yet been zzso The present study sought to clarify the mechanisms of zzso implicit learning by examining the sugar production factory zzso task in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Several brain regions were identified that contribute to learning in the SPF zzso zzso zzso decreases in brain activity were found in the right inferior zzso zzso zzso left superior frontal zzso right zzso frontal zzso zzso zzso and left inferior frontal zzso while significant zzso increases in activity were observed in the right inferior frontal zzso left zzso zzso and, left zzso Among these regions, we speculate that the zzso and zzso frontal zzso may specifically be involved in the early stage of zzso implicit zzso We also attempted to investigate the role of the zzso which has a significant role in habit learning, during learning of the SPF zzso The results of zzso analysis showed no zzso change in the activity of the zzso Although some of the observed zzso zzso in this study have also been previously reported in zzso studies of habit learning, the possibility that specific brain regions involved in zzso implicit learning cannot be zzso
