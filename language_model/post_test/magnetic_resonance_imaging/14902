Although the zzso zzso zzso has been studied quite well from a zzso viewpoint, its microscopic properties have been zzso nothing is known about its content of elastic zzso the features of the zzso zzso or the extent of zzso From a functional and clinical standpoint, the zzso is often correlated with the zzso zzso muscle, but the anatomical grounds for this link are not zzso The aim of this work was to focus on the zzso zzso and microscopic properties and study how Achilles zzso diseases might affect zzso Twelve feet from zzso human zzso were dissected to isolate the zzso zzso from each zzso were tested with various zzso and zzso zzso In a second stage, 52 magnetic resonance images zzso obtained from patients complaining of zzso ankle or foot pain were zzso dividing the cases into two groups based on the presence or absence of signs of zzso and/or inflammation of the Achilles zzso The thickness of zzso and zzso was assessed in the two groups and statistical analyses were zzso The zzso is a tissue firmly joined to zzso muscles and zzso zzso its possible connections to the zzso structures showed that this zzso is more closely connected to the zzso of Achilles zzso than to the Achilles tendon, through the zzso of the zzso The zzso extended zzso and zzso continuing into the deep zzso enveloping the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscles, zzso The zzso was rich in zzso probably produced by zzso cells described as zzso Nerve endings and zzso and zzso zzso were present, particularly in the zzso and lateral portions, and on the surface of the muscles, suggesting a role for the zzso in the zzso of zzso In the zzso study, 27 of the 52 zzso showed signs of Achilles zzso inflammation and/or zzso and the zzso was zzso thick zzso and zzso as opposed to zzso zzso zzso in the patients in which the zzso revealed no Achilles zzso diseases; this difference in thickness of zzso zzso was statistically significant zzso In the group of zzso patients with zzso the zzso was more than zzso thick in 5, zzso they exceeded the threshold for a diagnosis of zzso zzso None of the other zzso zzso had a zzso more than zzso zzso There was a statistically significant correlation between the thicknesses of the zzso and the zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso has a role not only in supporting the zzso arch of the foot, but also in its zzso and peripheral motor zzso Its relationship with the zzso of the Achilles zzso is consistent with the idea of zzso zzso structures being involved in the zzso pathology, so their rehabilitation can be considered zzso Finally, the high concentration of zzso in the zzso points to the feasibility of using zzso injections in the zzso to treat zzso zzso
