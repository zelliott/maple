Central zzso zzso zzso is almost always described in association with a zzso in sodium zzso most commonly rapid correction of chronic zzso It has only rarely been described in patients with disturbances of serum zzso in the absence of abnormal serum sodium zzso 

Case zzso 

A 93 zzso developed marked gait zzso 2 days after the diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso in the central zzso consisting of increased zzso signal intensity and restricted zzso consistent with zzso zzso serum zzso on admission was 344 zzso and fell to 300 zzso over 20 zzso zzso sodium concentration stayed between 137 and 140 zzso throughout the zzso One month after admission, his zzso had nearly completely resolved and the zzso changes had zzso 

zzso can develop in the setting of zzso zzso without abnormalities of sodium zzso This supports the theory that the zzso of zzso is dependent on a relatively zzso zzso which may occur independently of sodium zzso zzso can present as isolated gait zzso Clinical manifestations of the disorder may show significant improvement despite a dramatic initial zzso
