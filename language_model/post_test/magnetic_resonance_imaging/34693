Patients 16 years of age and younger with primary zzso zzso diagnosed between 1951 and 1996 at The University of Iowa were reviewed zzso with specific consideration given to zzso 

zzso extending beyond the growth of the zzso skeleton was used to establish the natural history, management outcome, and current approach to zzso 

zzso tumors of the spine are zzso The treatment of such zzso generally has been based on small series of tumors, or zzso from the treatment of tumors in other regions and tumors in zzso Given the unique developing anatomy and dynamic nature of the growing spine in children, zzso appropriate zzso of treatment for these tumors beyond the growth of the zzso skeleton is zzso 

Clinical history, zzso zzso reports, and interviews were used to establish this zzso zzso with respect to the various approaches to treatment was then compared in zzso 

zzso patients were identified in which follow-up greater than 10 years was available for zzso of zzso There were 29 zzso benign and 16 zzso zzso Patients presented most frequently with pain zzso and zzso deficits zzso The duration of symptoms was significantly shorter with zzso tumors (11 weeks) compared with benign tumors zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were demonstrated on plain zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was achieved in zzso zzso studies were available beyond the growth of the zzso skeleton in these patients, with an average follow-up of 14 zzso zzso was seen in 6 of 45 children, and the overall mortality rate was zzso occurring only with zzso zzso 

Our current approach to treatment of spinal zzso varies from that used in the earlier part of the series and reflects the need for single stage complete zzso and zzso
