zzso nerve and zzso nerve sheath zzso by a systemic zzso is zzso but is zzso rare when caused by a zzso zzso This then generally occurs in association with central nervous system zzso zzso We report on a rare case of zzso and facial nerve zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso 

A zzso old female with systemic zzso zzso in clinical zzso presented with painful loss of vision in the left zzso She was initially treated for presumed zzso zzso zzso A thorough clinical zzso was performed, followed by an zzso nerve biopsy with zzso 

There was no perception of light in the left eye, with a marked relative zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso disc zzso and a large zzso zzso zzso zzso she developed a 7th zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and contrast enhancement of the left zzso nerve and right facial zzso zzso nerve biopsy showed zzso of zzso and zzso positive zzso A complete systemic zzso revealed no evidence of disease zzso The patient was thus considered to have zzso zzso recurrence of zzso lymphoma, for which zzso was zzso 

zzso nerve zzso from systemic zzso is rare and generally occurs with zzso zzso A zzso pattern of recurrence from systemic zzso zzso involving the right facial nerve and left zzso nerve was seen in this zzso A review of the literature highlights the highly zzso nature of this zzso
