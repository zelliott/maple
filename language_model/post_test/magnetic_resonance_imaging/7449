zzso functional zzso zzso as spontaneous zzso activity in the brain, has been detected by functional zzso zzso across species such as humans, zzso and zzso Yet, most networks, especially the classical bilateral connectivity between zzso have not been reliably found in the mouse zzso This could be due to zzso effects on neural activity and difficulty in maintaining proper physiology and zzso zzso in zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso zzso is a sedative for zzso mouse zzso However, the higher dosage needed compared to rats may suppress the functional zzso and lead to unilateral zzso In this study, we investigated the influence of zzso dosage on neural zzso and zzso networks in mouse zzso We show that mouse can be stabilized with dosage as low as zzso The zzso zzso zzso was unchanged when zzso was increased from zzso to 6 and 10 zzso zzso robust bilateral connectivity can be observed in the primary, secondary zzso and visual zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso at low dose of zzso zzso suppression of zzso correlation was seen in the thalamus, where the zzso density is high, under zzso and in all regions except the zzso where the zzso density is low, under zzso Furthermore, in mice whose zzso was weaker or took longer time to zzso the bilateral connectivity was zzso This demonstrates that, with proper sedation and conservation of zzso zzso similar bilateral networks like other species can be detected in the mouse zzso
