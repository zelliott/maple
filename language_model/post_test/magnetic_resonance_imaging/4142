Single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was employed to examine two patients with zzso zzso Patient 1 was a zzso female with motor zzso and zzso on the right zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso showed a zzso in the anterior limb of internal capsule and zzso on the left zzso zzso using zzso revealed a reduction of cerebral blood flow zzso in the zzso region on the left side, but the delayed images in zzso using zzso showed only a mild decrease of zzso in the frontal zzso Patient 2 was a 55-year-old male with zzso on the left zzso zzso showed a zzso localized in the zzso zzso and zzso limb of the internal capsule on the right zzso zzso using zzso revealed a reduction of zzso in the zzso region on the right side and in the zzso zzso on the left side, but the delayed images in zzso using zzso showed little decrease of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso images suggested that cortical zzso on zzso zzso might reflect zzso due to zzso of the zzso network between zzso structure and zzso
