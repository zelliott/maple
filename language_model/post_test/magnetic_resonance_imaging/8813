We report the findings of zzso zzso zzso zzso and consider how to use this technique to evaluate the character of soft tissue zzso 

We enrolled 91 consecutive patients zzso males and 46 zzso age range zzso zzso patients were zzso and 72 were zzso Patients were scanned 15 minutes zzso zzso and 3 hours zzso zzso after zzso zzso More intense zzso in the zzso compared to the normal side was considered as zzso the same degree of zzso was considered zzso and decreased zzso was zzso The retention index zzso was calculated in 9 patients in the zzso group and in 16 patients in the benign zzso 

In zzso tumors, 15 of 19 patients showed high zzso in both the early and delayed zzso One zzso zzso zzso patient was high only in the delayed phase and 1 zzso patient was high only in the early zzso Two zzso patients showed an iso zzso in both zzso One of these patients was zzso diagnosed as a zzso zzso In benign zzso no zzso showed increased zzso All zzso tumors except for 2 demonstrated high zzso All 3 zzso of the lower zzso showed iso zzso Most inflammatory diseases showed increased zzso zzso benign patients consisted of zzso zzso or inflammatory zzso Only 2 patients were considered zzso and these were diagnosed as intramuscular zzso and zzso zzso was variable in both zzso and benign zzso and no statistically significant difference was seen between zzso and benign zzso by zzso zzso 

A high zzso zzso zzso is more frequently seen in zzso tumors, but regardless of whether the tumor is benign or zzso according to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso pattern can not be the only indicator to differentiate zzso from benign zzso We ultimately need to evaluate the nature of tumors by a combination of several imaging zzso
