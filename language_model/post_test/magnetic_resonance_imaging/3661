zzso zzso are a fundamental cue by which the visual system segments objects from their zzso The neural mechanisms supporting zzso zzso are therefore critical to visual perception and zzso In the present experiment we employ an zzso zzso approach in order to study the time course of zzso zzso in the human zzso Visual zzso zzso were recorded to four types of stimuli in which periodic zzso zzso of a central zzso figure region could either support zzso zzso or have identical local texture zzso but not produce changes in global image zzso The image zzso were defined either by orientation or phase differences across image zzso zzso responses to these four stimuli were analyzed both at the scalp and on the cortical surface in zzso and functional zzso zzso defined separately using zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso orientation versus zzso responses exhibited distinctive patterns of zzso zzso between uniform and segmented images produced highly zzso responses that were larger after transitions from the uniform to the segmented zzso zzso zzso that signaled the appearance of a figure evoked a pattern of increased activity starting at zzso zzso that was larger in zzso and zzso zzso relative to identical zzso that didn't signal zzso zzso This zzso activity occurred after an initial response phase that did not depend on the global zzso structure of the zzso The two cue types evoked similar zzso up to 230 zzso when they differed in the zzso and zzso zzso The evolution of the response proceeded largely in the zzso direction, with only weak evidence for zzso zzso
