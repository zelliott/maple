zzso affects zzso zzso growth, and zzso We previously reported that zzso supplementation increased gray matter zzso concentration in the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso areas that are also involved in food zzso 

The aim of this study was to report the changes in brain structure at different states of zzso zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso 

We studied three adults with zzso zzso zzso due to a zzso in the zzso zzso 

Patients received treatment with zzso zzso human zzso with annual zzso to zzso periods of treatment withholding followed by treatment restoration over 3 zzso 

zzso concentration (by zzso zzso analysis of magnetic resonance zzso was correlated with body mass index zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso withholding zzso supplementation for several weeks increased zzso and reversed the original effects of zzso in the zzso and zzso The changes in the zzso were consistent with an indirect effect of zzso zzso through increased zzso In the zzso where zzso receptors are most dense, zzso changes appeared to be direct effects of zzso zzso restoration did not lead to recovery of zzso in the short term but did lead to an unexpected zzso increase in the zzso half of the left thalamus, particularly the zzso zzso 

These findings provide the first in zzso evidence of remarkably zzso zzso and regionally specific effects of zzso on human brain zzso They suggest that zzso may have therapeutic value in modulating zzso brain zzso
