To describe the zzso and signal intensity characteristics of inflammatory zzso masses in magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

MR images of 15 patients with a total of 20 confirmed inflammatory zzso masses were analyzed zzso 

The findings obtained from MR imaging were as zzso zzso have zzso borders; zzso areas of high intensity signals surround the masses on zzso zzso a zzso at the zzso layer of the zzso wall exhibits high signal intensity on zzso images and low intensity on zzso zzso secondary changes in the surrounding fat plane and zzso zzso are zzso and zzso are zzso These findings reflect the basic characteristics of the inflammatory process, which are zzso caused by increased zzso and highly zzso zzso tissue caused by the strong tendency to zzso 

MR imaging findings well reflect the basic pathological process of zzso and inflammatory zzso masses are associated with relatively specific appearances in MR zzso MR imaging can be a problem-solving alternative in the diagnosis of inflammatory zzso zzso
