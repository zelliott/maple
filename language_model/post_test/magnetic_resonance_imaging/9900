: The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso zzso imaging properties, and safety of the zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging contrast agent zzso acid zzso zzso in subjects with various levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

: In this zzso zzso zzso study, patients with varying degrees of zzso and/or zzso impairment were compared with healthy subjects matched for age, zzso and weight zzso zzso All subjects received a single intravenous zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso body zzso zzso of serum, zzso and feces were collected for zzso zzso MR imaging was performed before dosing and at zzso times after dose administration to determine enhancement relative to zzso signal intensity zzso Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, cardiac rhythm, oxygen zzso and by physical examination zzso 

: zzso was well tolerated by all zzso Total clearance of zzso did not significantly change in patients with mild and moderate zzso impairment zzso A and B), compared with the control zzso Mean urinary zzso was increased and mean zzso zzso was decreased in patients with zzso zzso Renal zzso was increased to between zzso and zzso of the dose administered in patients with very high zzso levels zzso zzso compared with zzso in the control zzso Total clearance of zzso was significantly reduced to 140 zzso 45 zzso and terminal elimination zzso zzso was slightly, but not significantly, increased to zzso zzso zzso hours in patients with severe zzso impairment zzso zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso 37 zzso and zzso zzso zzso hours, zzso Liver MR signal enhancement zzso under the curve of relative enhancement zzso over zzso was similar in patients with mild and moderate zzso impairment and in those in the control group, but was decreased by 38% in patients with severe zzso zzso compared with zzso Peak liver enhancement, however, was still at a high level zzso zzso zzso zzso and imaging parameters were not significantly affected in patients with moderate zzso impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso failure zzso however, the zzso profile of zzso was significantly different, with an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso hours zzso zzso zzso zzso hours in the control zzso During a zzso dialysis session that started 1 hour after administration of the intravenous dose, the serum levels in patients with zzso declined by between zzso and zzso as a result of elimination by zzso and parallel zzso zzso This is comparable with the decline observed in healthy subjects zzso during the zzso to zzso zzso after zzso 

: The results of the present study show that in humans with moderate zzso impairment and zzso zzso zzso no relevant changes in zzso zzso such as total clearance and zzso develop as a result of increased zzso zzso to compensate in the case of zzso impairment (or increased zzso elimination in the case of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was markedly altered only in patients with zzso The high MR signal enhancement profile, observed even in patients with severe zzso zzso indicates that there is no need to adjust the dose of zzso
