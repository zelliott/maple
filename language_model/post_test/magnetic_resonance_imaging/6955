Different evaluation systems and indicators have recently been used to measure the activity volumes of Italian hospital departments, and in particular of zzso Imaging zzso These zzso have mostly been based on more or less complex and zzso indicators such as total zzso zzso per imaging zzso type and number of zzso The aim of this study was to compare four models for measuring and evaluating productivity to assess their features and propose a common method for measuring activity volumes in a zzso Imaging zzso The models considered are: a) the zzso count, b) the model proposed by zzso c) the model based on transfer prices in use in the zzso zzso Region zzso zzso the model used by the zzso Health Care zzso Agency zzso based on a complex system of weights named zzso zzso Value zzso 

The period under review considers two years of activity zzso at our zzso Imaging zzso The data were collected by grouping the zzso procedures into homogeneous groups zzso which were then assessed with the four zzso The reference parameters considered in order to produce homogeneous data were: the number of procedures per physician hour, the score per hour according to the zzso model, the score per hour according to the zzso model, the number of zzso per hour zzso With regard to the zzso system, the following indicators were zzso the work component zzso the insurance component zzso zzso and the technical component zzso zzso the equivalent units of physician time zzso Full Time zzso such as the number of procedures per zzso the difficulty index, and the number of zzso per zzso 

a) The total number of procedures was zzso the number of procedures per hour ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso (March zzso based on the zzso count conventional zzso accounted for the most of the zzso activity zzso b) The total score according to the zzso model was zzso the weight of each physician hour ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso model indicates that the most significant zzso in the zzso activity was ultrasound zzso c) The total score according to the zzso model was zzso the weight of each physician hour varied between 159 zzso zzso and zzso (April zzso Based on the zzso model, CT zzso accounted for most of the zzso zzso zzso According to the zzso model, the total number of zzso was zzso and the physician weight per hour ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso (March zzso The zzso method was ultrasound zzso the number of total practice zzso was zzso the month with the highest score was March 2000 zzso while the one with the lowest score was August 2000 zzso the total number of malpractice zzso was zzso and the months with the highest scores were April 2000 zzso and March 2000 zzso while the month with the lowest score was August 2000 zzso and the zzso carrying the highest insurance risks was zzso zzso We also calculated the number of procedures per zzso zzso the number of zzso per zzso zzso the difficulty index resulting from the ratio between zzso and number of procedures zzso the number of zzso per hour worked zzso 

Based on the zzso count, conventional zzso and ultrasound play a zzso role zzso and zzso respectively, total zzso This approach therefore fails to reflect the weight of more technologically advanced zzso The zzso model gives adequate importance to the combination zzso weight of zzso among the zzso zzso The zzso model rewards the use of more expensive technologies, as it zzso the overall weight of the service and not only the weight of the zzso zzso The zzso model, with its distribution of zzso zzso the different work, cost, and insurance components of the zzso It also introduces an important aspect that is new to our professional and scientific zzso evaluation of the zzso zzso whose role will become increasingly important in zzso The difficulty index zzso of zzso which expresses the ratio between the number of zzso and their complexity, is particularly zzso This index, adjusted to reflect the Italian situation, might help to assess the true technological and scientific content of the department's zzso
