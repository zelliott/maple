The zzso of zzso zzso fractures is different from those occurring secondary to traumatic spinal injury, and zzso there is no zzso suitable for symptomatic zzso zzso fractures treated by zzso zzso We propose a new zzso based on the zzso appearance in the zzso or chronic stage of the clinical presentation of these zzso They are classified by the authors based on observations and zzso from zzso and zzso dynamic lateral zzso zzso fractures are divided into two zzso Type I is a zzso fracture involving the anterior column zzso Type II is a fracture involving both the anterior and middle zzso Each type is divided into two groups: fractures with union and those with zzso Type II zzso fractures have a higher zzso of zzso than type I zzso In both type I and II zzso groups, fractures achieve greater increase in zzso body height after zzso than both type I and type II union group fractures zzso In both zzso groups, fractures achieved a greater reduction of zzso angle zzso than type I and II union group fractures zzso Further clinical follow-up of these patients will confirm and extend this zzso
