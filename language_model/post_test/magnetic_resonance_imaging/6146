Active shape models zzso are widely employed for recognizing zzso structures and for zzso them in medical zzso In this paper, a novel strategy called oriented active shape models zzso is presented in an attempt to overcome the following five limitations of zzso 1) lower zzso zzso 2) the requirement of a large number of landmarks, 3) sensitivity to search range, 4) sensitivity to zzso and 5) inability to fully exploit the specific information present in the given image to be zzso zzso effectively combines the rich statistical shape information embodied in zzso with the boundary zzso property and the globally optimal zzso capability of the live wire methodology of boundary zzso The latter characteristics allow live wire to effectively separate an object boundary from other zzso boundaries with similar properties especially when they come very close in the image zzso The approach leads to a zzso dynamic programming method, wherein the first level zzso to boundary recognition and the second level zzso to boundary zzso and to an effective automatic zzso zzso The method zzso a globally optimal boundary that agrees with the shape model if the recognition step is successful in bringing the model close to the boundary in the zzso zzso evaluation experiments have been conducted by utilizing 40 image zzso resonance and zzso zzso data sets in each of five different application areas for zzso breast, liver, bones of the foot, and cervical zzso of the zzso Comparisons are made between zzso and zzso based on precision, zzso and efficiency of zzso zzso is assessed using both zzso false positive and false negative measures and zzso distance zzso The results indicate the zzso 1) The accuracy of zzso via zzso is considerably better than that of zzso 2) The number of landmarks can be reduced by a factor of 3 in zzso over that in zzso 3) zzso becomes largely independent of search range and zzso becomes zzso All three benefits of zzso ensue mainly from the severe constraints brought in by the zzso property of live wire and the globally optimal solution found by the zzso dynamic programming zzso
