zzso zzso imaging zzso and MR zzso imaging zzso provide greater sensitivity than conventional zzso to detect diffuse zzso in normal appearing white matter zzso of Multiple zzso zzso patients with different clinical zzso zzso the goal of this study is to combine zzso and zzso zzso to analyze the relation between diffusion and zzso zzso zzso zzso load zzso and the patients clinical zzso The sensitivity and specificity of both methods were then compared in terms of zzso clinical forms zzso MR examination was performed on 71 zzso patients (27 zzso zzso zzso 26 secondary progressive zzso and 18 primary progressive zzso and 24 control zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained from two identical regions of interest selected in left and right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso metrics and zzso contents were significantly altered in zzso patients with the exception of zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio in zzso zzso zzso correlations were observed between diffusion and zzso measures to various degrees in every zzso patients zzso Most zzso metrics were significantly correlated with the zzso while only zzso ratio was correlated in zzso zzso A comparison analysis of MR methods efficiency demonstrated a better zzso of zzso over zzso Nevertheless, zzso ratio could distinguish all zzso and SP patients groups from controls, while zzso ratio differentiated zzso patients from zzso This study demonstrated that zzso changes related to zzso zzso were correlated with zzso changes and provided a better sensitivity to detect early changes, particularly in zzso patients who are more subject to inflammatory zzso In contrast, the better specificity of zzso ratios to detect zzso damage and zzso may provide a better index for identification of zzso zzso
