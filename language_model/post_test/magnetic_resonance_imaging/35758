The potential of zzso zzso to improve the detection of acute zzso zzso by MR has been shown in experimental canine zzso To determine its value in humans, we studied five patients zzso days after zzso zzso by using zzso MR before and after administration of zzso zzso zzso One patient had a zzso of the zzso zzso complicating an acute zzso zzso zzso images were obtained before and immediately after injection of zzso and were repeated every 10 zzso for up to 40 zzso In four patients, zzso zzso revealed increasing signal intensity in the zzso area in the first 20 zzso after injection of zzso zzso between normal and zzso zzso was greatest zzso zzso after zzso zzso In one patient, increasing signal intensity of the zzso zzso was observed up to 40 zzso after zzso zzso The zzso intensity ratio between zzso and normal zzso was zzso at echo time zzso zzso 30 zzso and was zzso at TE zzso 60 zzso zzso less than zzso The zzso intensity ratio was zzso which was not statistically different from the ratio at TE zzso 60 zzso but which was significantly higher than the ratio at TE zzso 30 zzso zzso less than zzso zzso definition was substantially improved on zzso zzso The zzso zzso was clearly seen, and the zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso showed enhancement on zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can improve MR zzso and detection of acute zzso zzso
