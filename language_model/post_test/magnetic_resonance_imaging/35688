zzso zzso therapy zzso and zzso are reported effective in early zzso of the zzso head zzso We hypothesized that joint effects of zzso and zzso may produce superior zzso This prospective study compared the results of zzso and zzso with that of zzso without zzso in early zzso 

Forty-eight patients with 60 hips were randomly divided into tow zzso There were 25 patients with 30 hips in group A and 23 patients with 30 hips in group zzso Both groups showed similar demographic zzso All patients were treated with 6,000 impulses of zzso at 28 zzso zzso to zzso zzso to the affected hip as a single zzso Patients in group B also received zzso 70 zzso per week for 1 year, whereas patients in group A did zzso The evaluations included clinical assessment, zzso and MR image of the affected zzso Both groups were compared statistically using paired zzso zzso and Chi square tests with statistical significance at P zzso zzso The primary end point is the need for total hip zzso zzso The secondary end point is the improvement in pain and function of the zzso The third end point is the progression or zzso of the zzso on image zzso 

The overall clinical outcomes were improved in zzso unchanged in zzso and worsened in zzso for group zzso and improved in zzso unchanged in zzso and worsened in zzso for group zzso zzso was performed in zzso of group A and zzso of group B zzso zzso zzso zzso improvements in pain and function of the hip were noted in both groups zzso zzso zzso however, the differences between the two groups were not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso On MR images, the zzso showed progression in zzso zzso in zzso and unchanged in zzso in group A, and progression in zzso zzso in zzso and unchanged in zzso in group B zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso produced comparable result as compared with zzso without zzso in early zzso It appears that zzso is effective with or without the concurrent use of zzso The joint effects of zzso over zzso in early zzso are not realized in zzso
