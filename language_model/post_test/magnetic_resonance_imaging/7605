We evaluated the brain zzso zzso of main indexes of a widely used word list learning test, the zzso zzso zzso Memory Test zzso in a group of elderly subjects with memory zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso State zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presenting at a memory clinic complaining of memory deficit, but not zzso and thirty controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso with memory complaints included both patients with zzso mild cognitive zzso zzso and without zzso memory complaints, zzso impairment on memory zzso All subjects underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed with statistical zzso Patients with zzso but not those with zzso showed the expected zzso zzso and zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso was determined for between four indexes of the zzso and brain zzso The results show a significant correlation between the delayed recall score and metabolism in zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and in left zzso as well as between a score of long-term percent retention and metabolism in left zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These correlations survived correction for age, education, and zzso zzso No correlation was found between immediate or total recall scores and zzso zzso These data show the relevant role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in retention and retrieval of zzso verbal memory material in a group of elderly subjects with memory complaints and shed light on the topography of synaptic dysfunction in these subjects, overlapping that found in the earliest stages of zzso zzso
