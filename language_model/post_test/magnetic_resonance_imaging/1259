To identify the brain regions associated with the cognitive generation of affect in zzso bipolar zzso 

The study examined 10 zzso female subjects with bipolar affective disorder, and 10 zzso and zzso comparison subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while viewing alternating blocks of zzso designed to evoke negative, positive or no affective zzso The zzso paradigm involved the presentation of the same visual materials over three experiments alternating zzso negative and reference, zzso positive and reference and zzso positive and negative zzso 

The stimuli produced zzso in both patients and comparison subjects in brain regions previously implicated in the generation and zzso of zzso in particular the prefrontal zzso zzso in patients involved additional zzso regions namely the zzso and zzso 

This preliminary study suggests that zzso patients recruit additional zzso zzso systems for emotional evaluation when advanced prefrontal cortical processing is no longer zzso The differential patterns of zzso inform us about bipolar disorder and may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
