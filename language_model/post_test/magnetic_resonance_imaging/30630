To determine cortical zzso changes involved in migraine visual aura using zzso zzso 

Visual aura in the form of scintillating zzso precedes migraine in many zzso The involvement of cortical spreading depression within zzso and zzso cortical areas is implicated in the generation of the zzso but the details of its zzso the effects on cortical zzso and the mechanisms of aura generation are zzso 

We used zzso to directly image changes in cortical zzso power during an episode of scintillating zzso in a patient who experiences aura without subsequent migraine zzso Using the synthetic zzso zzso method of zzso source imaging, focal changes in cortical zzso power were observed over a 20-minute period and zzso in zzso with the patient's magnetic resonance zzso 

Alpha band zzso in both the left zzso and zzso zzso persisted for the duration of reported visual zzso terminating abruptly upon disappearance of zzso zzso frequency zzso in the left zzso lobe continued for 8 to 10 minutes following the reported end of zzso 

Observations zzso the zzso and zzso zzso in migraine visual aura and suggest involvement of alpha zzso in generation of zzso and gamma zzso in sustained zzso of visual zzso
