Rapid zzso of new imaging technology is a major contributor to rising zzso zzso zzso breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso for patients with zzso breast cancer has dramatically increased in use without the evidence of improved outcomes compared to standard assessment and is associated with higher rates of zzso A decision zzso model was developed to evaluate the impact of adding breast zzso to the zzso evaluation of women with zzso breast cancer who were candidates for zzso therapy on patient outcomes measured in zzso life years zzso Model zzso including survival, recurrence rates, and health utilities, were obtained from a comprehensive literature zzso zzso sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate threshold values for key parameters at which adding zzso would become the optimal imaging strategy over standard zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso with standard assessment, a decrease of zzso zzso or 34 zzso In sensitivity zzso standard assessment was associated with better patient outcomes than zzso breast zzso across all plausible probabilities for mastectomy, local zzso and health zzso For routine zzso breast zzso to become the optimal strategy, the conversion rate to mastectomy after zzso zzso would need to be zzso % zzso the range of zzso % reported in the zzso zzso zzso breast zzso appears to zzso no advantage over the standard diagnostic evaluations for zzso breast cancer and may lead to worse patient zzso
