zzso cortical zzso zzso is increasingly recognized as a common zzso zzso of medically intractable zzso As these zzso are often localized in the frontal lobe zzso in potentially eloquent zzso an understanding of the functional status of the involved zzso and of its zzso and zzso zzso is of prime zzso The purpose of this study is to assess the function of focal CD in relation to magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso 

Eight patients operated on for medically intractable zzso with zzso proven focal CD involving putative eloquent zzso in the frontal lobe zzso and zzso zzso were included in the zzso zzso regions zzso and language) and zzso areas were assessed by zzso zzso recording and electrical cortical zzso zzso functions were correlated with the extent of zzso on zzso recordings, zzso features, and zzso zzso 

Language or motor areas were zzso with zzso regions zzso of 8, zzso but were not mapped in regions of increased signal on zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso (when they were zzso on zzso zzso zzso of 5, zzso zzso balloon cells were almost exclusively found in zzso regions with zzso zzso zzso When zzso regions of motor zzso were characterized by cortical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but were devoid of balloon zzso 

We found an absence of language or motor functions in zzso and zzso areas that showed decreased zzso zzso evidence of CD with balloon cells and zzso zzso signal zzso Language and motor functions were present in zzso and zzso areas with no balloon cells and no zzso signal zzso These findings have implications on options for zzso surgery in patients with zzso
