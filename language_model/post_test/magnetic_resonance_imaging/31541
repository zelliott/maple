The objectives of the present study are to compare zzso zzso between the three zzso of the anterior cruciate ligament zzso from extension to deep zzso and to perform a sensitivity study on the patterns of zzso zzso change due to zzso in zzso site zzso Nine knees of healthy volunteers were examined using a horizontal open magnetic resonance apparatus with the knee at 0 degrees zzso degrees of zzso and created three-dimensional zzso virtual models of the zzso The zzso and zzso attachment sites of the three zzso zzso were determined, and the distance between the attachment sites was automatically calculated as the zzso zzso of each bundle in each zzso After changing the attachment sites, computer simulation was performed to investigate in zzso zzso zzso changes for the three zzso of the zzso in normal knee zzso from extension to deep zzso Three zzso statistically significantly changed in zzso zzso during zzso while they were longest at full extension, and decreased with increasing knee zzso to 100 degrees zzso They were smallest at zzso of 100 degrees , with increase lengths with zzso deeper than 100 degrees zzso zzso of 6 zzso of zzso site beyond attachment area caused significant zzso in the pattern of zzso zzso change of each zzso while zzso of 3 zzso within attachment area caused no significant zzso The zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso was not zzso not even the zzso zzso The zzso zzso might be of major importance in terms of the site of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of multiple zzso of the zzso and the pattern of their changes are useful for not only graft choice and preparation but also knee angle and initial tension at graft fixation during zzso zzso reconstruction zzso
