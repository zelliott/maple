zzso disease is a disease of zzso zzso first reported by Theodor zzso in zzso Since then, 130 years have zzso Recently, several new findings about the pathology, causes, and zzso of this disease have been zzso In 1988 Wallace and others reported a new zzso of zzso base pairs of zzso of patients with zzso zzso Since then, the study of this disease has progressed zzso In this review clinical studies on zzso disease which were carried out in our department from 1990 are zzso zzso zzso diagnosis and clinics Two hundred and zzso cases were zzso including patients at our hospital, for the 8 years between 1990 and zzso Among them, 72 cases were diagnosed as zzso zzso There were 3 cases zzso of zzso zzso 63 zzso of zzso zzso and 6 zzso of zzso zzso as primary zzso The reasons for performing the genetic diagnosis were mostly the need for a zzso diagnosis of zzso disease and research on the genesis of zzso nerve zzso of unknown zzso zzso the secondary zzso it was confirmed that these zzso were zzso as seen in European and American zzso There is a problem of zzso about the zzso zzso We developed a simple and exact method to evaluate zzso by using zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso zzso In a study of peripheral blood samples in one family, zzso disease does not appear under conditions of less than zzso zzso zzso As for the three kinds of zzso in zzso disease, cases of recovery of a visual acuity of zzso and above were only zzso in zzso zzso but 38% in zzso zzso and 50% in zzso zzso It is assumed that visual prognosis depends on the kind of zzso zzso zzso of visual evoked zzso In pattern zzso in the acute stage, zzso was not delayed very much, but the zzso was zzso On the other hand, in the acute stage of zzso zzso the zzso was very much delayed and the zzso was zzso zzso I deduced that not only zzso of the zzso nerve fibers but also zzso bundle defects may play an important zzso In flash zzso only the zzso was low, but zzso was zzso zzso Image analysis of the zzso nerve In high resolution zzso fast zzso magnetic resonance zzso the image of the zzso nerve can be clearly demonstrated within a short operation zzso In zzso in the acute stage of zzso disease, the image of the zzso nerve appeared almost zzso But in the course of time, patients with zzso disease showed markedly high signals in the zzso nerve on the zzso fast zzso zzso and in the zzso stage the image of the zzso nerve showed zzso The results in this study support the hypothesis that a primary zzso in zzso disease may be zzso zzso zzso of therapy at the present time The effectiveness of using zzso combined with vitamin zzso vitamin C, and zzso zzso for recovery of the circulation of the zzso nerve head for patients in the acute stage was compared with zzso zzso In patients with visual acuity of zzso and more, there was no statistical difference between the two zzso The recovery zzso up to zzso was significantly shorter in the treated group than in the zzso zzso I suggest that this kind of treatment may aid spontaneous zzso Among 15 cases of zzso disease which occurred in the patients zzso at least one eye in 8 zzso recovered to zzso or zzso Among the 8 recovered cases, 5 cases were from the treated zzso On the other hand, 6 cases were treated and 5 cases recovered visual zzso It is said that the patients developing the disease at younger ages have a tendency toward visual zzso zzso treatment can aid zzso zzso Visual function after the recovery of visual acuity The recovery of visual acuity in zzso disease has the characteristics of zzso central zzso The visual acuity can be recovered by the appearance of a small part of sensitive area inside the absolute central zzso This phenomenon zzso with the results of zzso which does not recover in spite of recovery of zzso Good visual acuity or bad visual acuity depends not only on the recovery of the total area of the central part but on the existence of an area with good zzso In the results of a zzso visual field zzso obtained from 8 recovering patients, the part zzso to the zzso was more sensitive than the zzso zzso In the early stage of visual recovery, scanning laser zzso zzso can detect this sensitive area, and with the enlargement of this sensitive area, the zzso visual field zzso can also detect this recovery zzso zzso Strategy for gene therapy We have succeeded in cloning a human zzso zzso zzso gene which was found specifically in retinal zzso zzso By using this promoter, we are now developing a zzso specific to the zzso zzso The fact that there is spontaneous recovery shows the possibility that some zzso bundle may zzso In zzso disease, retinal zzso cells may die from the mechanism of zzso Therefore it may be possible to treat this disease by transferring the zzso block gene to zzso cells for protection, and to protect the cells from death by zzso
