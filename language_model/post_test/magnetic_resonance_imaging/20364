This study aimed to evaluate the role of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the assessment of local recurrence of zzso zzso 

Among 200 patients scheduled for CT zzso 60 zzso low zzso 12 high zzso were selected due to CT findings suspicious for or suggestive of local zzso Patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso within 2 zzso zzso was considered the gold standard in 39 cases and follow-up at 6 and 12 months in the remaining zzso 

Local recurrence was confirmed by zzso in 15 cases (7 low zzso 8 high zzso and was excluded in 21 cases by long-term follow-up and in 24 by zzso zzso zzso positive and negative zzso value and accuracy were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso can help in the detection of local recurrence of zzso cancer, even though their roles in early detection remains zzso as the value of these techniques in current surveillance protocols is still to be zzso
