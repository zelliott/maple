The bones, soft tissue zzso and boundaries of the zzso tunnel can be zzso with sufficient detail to show all the major structures within zzso zzso conditions affecting these structures can also be zzso The purpose of this paper was to determine the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to help in the evaluation of zzso tunnel zzso zzso patients with 40 feet were used for this zzso All patients presented with complaints of pain along the course of the zzso zzso nerve or its branches and a positive zzso zzso Nerve zzso studies were obtained on 29 zzso All feet were evaluated with a magnetic resonance imaging study of the zzso zzso zzso feet eventually required zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed an inflammatory or mass zzso in the zzso tunnel in the majority of zzso The magnetic resonance imaging findings were confirmed at surgery in 19 zzso The information provided by magnetic resonance imaging can enhance surgical planning by indicating the extent of zzso zzso
