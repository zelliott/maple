The hypothesis of this study is that changes in fluid dynamics in zzso bone bear a functional relationship to bone zzso and cartilage breakdown in zzso zzso We have zzso dynamic zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to extract kinetic parameters of bone zzso at various stages in the development of zzso in the zzso guinea zzso 

Animals of four different ages zzso 9, 12 and 15 zzso representing various stages in the development of zzso were zzso All animals underwent zzso zzso and zzso data were analyzed based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of interest were studied at the zzso and lateral zzso zzso and compared to zzso scores of zzso cartilage and zzso bone plate zzso 

A decrease in zzso as well as zzso obstruction was observed in animals between 6 and 9 months of age, only in the zzso zzso plateau zzso zzso The eventual cartilage and bone zzso of zzso occurred also in the zzso zzso Changes in zzso occurred in the lateral zzso but not until zzso zzso were zzso zzso parameters of inflow were unchanged in both the zzso and lateral zzso 

zzso zzso can be used to extract kinetic information on bone zzso in an animal model of zzso The signal enhancement in zzso bone temporally precedes and zzso zzso at the same site of the eventual bone and cartilage zzso zzso zzso suggest zzso obstruction as an underlying zzso
