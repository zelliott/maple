zzso gel zzso offer a practical solution to zzso dose zzso for conventional zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso calculated and zzso zzso gel dosimeter measured dose volume zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso unit were used to investigate the effects of the presence of zzso on zzso dose zzso The head phantom was a zzso 16 zzso diameter zzso zzso Inside the zzso there is a cubic zzso for inserting the gel zzso and another zzso for inserting the zzso Following zzso with the zzso unit, the zzso gel zzso were scanned with a zzso T zzso zzso Comparing the results of measurement in homogeneous and zzso zzso revealed that inserting zzso inside the homogeneous phantom did not cause considerable disturbances on dose distribution in zzso with 8 zzso zzso within low zzso levels zzso zzso which is essential for the dose sparing of sensitive zzso The results of simulation for homogeneous and zzso zzso in zzso with 18 zzso zzso of the zzso unit showed zzso difference in zzso within zzso relative zzso level and also revealed that a significant part of the target zzso received relative doses higher than the maximum dose, which exceeds the acceptance criterion zzso Based on these results it is concluded that the presence of zzso inside the phantom can cause considerable errors in dose calculation within high zzso levels with respect to zzso prediction which assumes that the target is a homogeneous zzso Moreover, it is demonstrated that the applied zzso code is an accurate and zzso tool for zzso evaluation of dose distribution in zzso with the zzso unit, which can provide important, zzso plan evaluation criteria used in clinical zzso
