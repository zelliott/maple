The objective of this study was to assess the clinical significance of zzso proliferation in patients with painful zzso disorders based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

The current study was conducted in 100 zzso of 100 patients with unilateral painful zzso zzso One hundred zzso on the zzso side of patients with unilateral disease were used as zzso zzso Areas in the zzso space that showed a low signal intensity on zzso imaging, a high signal intensity on zzso imaging, and high signal intensity on zzso zzso zzso imaging were judged to be regions of zzso zzso 

zzso proliferation alone was observed in zzso of the pain group, but in none of the zzso zzso zzso proliferation + zzso was observed in zzso of the pain group and in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alone was observed in zzso of the pain group and in zzso of the zzso zzso The mean visual analog scale value of pain was in the order of zzso proliferation alone zzso zzso proliferation + zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rates of anterior displacement of the disk were zzso for zzso proliferation alone, zzso for zzso proliferation + zzso zzso for zzso alone, and zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

Strong correlations were observed between zzso zzso pain, and disk zzso It is considered that evaluating zzso alone provides only limited information on the disease state in painful zzso zzso Thus, it is essential to include enhanced zzso imaging as a means to judge the disease state as well as to assess disease zzso
