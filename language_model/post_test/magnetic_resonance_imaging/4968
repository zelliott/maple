To evaluate whether MR zzso is sufficiently fast, accurate, and zzso resolved for monitoring the zzso safety of zzso zzso high intensity ultrasound zzso zzso 

A combination of real MR zzso data and modeling was used to analyze the effects of zzso and spatial averaging as well as noise on the peak temperatures and zzso doses that would be measured by MR zzso 

MR zzso systematically zzso the temperature and zzso doses during zzso zzso Small zzso of peak temperature can lead to large zzso of zzso zzso zzso averaging errors are small for ratios of zzso dimension to heating zone radius less than zzso which may be achieved by reducing the zzso size or steering the acoustic zzso zzso dose might also be underestimated for very short, high power zzso due to zzso zzso A simple correction factor based on the applied power and duty cycle may be applied to determine the upper bound of this zzso 

The temperature and zzso dose measured using MR zzso during zzso zzso treatment is probably sufficient in most zzso zzso corrections may be used to calculate an upper bound where this is a critical zzso
