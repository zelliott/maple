zzso and zzso studies suggest that visual scene analysis rapidly produces a rich description of both the objects and the spatial layout of surfaces in a zzso However, there is still a large gap in our understanding of how the human brain accomplishes these diverse functions of scene zzso Here we probe the nature of real-world scene representations using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging pattern zzso We show that natural scenes are analyzed in a distributed and complementary manner by the zzso place area zzso and the lateral zzso complex zzso in particular, as well as other regions in the zzso zzso Specifically, we study the zzso performance of different zzso regions using images that vary in spatial boundary and zzso zzso We discover that, whereas both the zzso and zzso can accurately zzso scenes, they make different zzso the zzso more often confuses scenes that have the same spatial zzso whereas the zzso more often confuses scenes that have the same zzso By demonstrating that visual scene analysis recruits distinct and complementary high-level zzso our results testify to distinct neural pathways for representing the spatial boundaries and content of a visual zzso
