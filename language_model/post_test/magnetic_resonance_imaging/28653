The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis that zzso and sustainable zzso zzso can be induced by focused ultrasound energy deposition zzso within deep zzso An zzso focused ultrasound zzso was used to zzso a branch of the zzso artery zzso about zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso An intravenous zzso contrast agent zzso was injected about 30 zzso and up to 7 days after the zzso After zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained and the zzso were fixed in zzso for zzso zzso The ultrasound zzso resulted in complete zzso of blood flow, as shown by the zzso echo zzso In seven of the nine zzso a zzso zzso area was seen at the part of the kidney that was zzso by the vessel after the contrast agent zzso This area extended zzso (outside of the zzso zzso to the cortical surface of the zzso The zzso zzso showed that the artery was completely zzso zzso zzso evaluation showed an zzso tissue volume corresponding to the wedge shape seen in the zzso This study showed that appropriately focused ultrasound can be used to close arteries zzso This finding has significant clinical zzso
