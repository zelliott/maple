Recent studies demonstrate early diffuse central nervous system zzso inflammation in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso The clinically unaffected zzso eye of patients with unilateral zzso zzso zzso may reflect the status of zzso white matter in the zzso which can be assessed zzso 

To study the relationship between zzso parameters in the fellow eye of ON patients, and risk of conversion to zzso 

Forty-eight consecutive patients with acute unilateral ON were examined 12 months after ON of which 14 had zzso 19 remained high risk zzso for zzso and 15 had low risk zzso for zzso according to McDonald's zzso Twenty-five zzso controls were also zzso zzso and zzso of zzso visual evoked potential zzso in the fellow eyes of patients at 12 months were analyzed and compared with zzso 

Average zzso zzso was 240 zzso 35, 232 zzso 36, 181 zzso 38, and 169 zzso 48 zzso for controls, zzso HR, and zzso groups zzso Average zzso zzso for controls, zzso HR, and zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The magnitude of zzso zzso and zzso decline 12 months after the initial episode was zzso to the risk of zzso The zzso significance of these changes as zzso of subsequent zzso should be investigated zzso
