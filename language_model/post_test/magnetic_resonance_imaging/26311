zzso can be complicated by mechanical zzso zzso or injury of adjacent structures, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging represents the most valuable imaging zzso in symptomatic cases, because it can demonstrate typical features of associated soft tissue pathology, which can be differentiated from zzso zzso zzso zzso formation presents as an zzso fluid collection with peripheral contrast zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso of adjacent soft tissue structures can be observed in different zzso syndromes caused by zzso zzso resonance imaging provides excellent demonstration of zzso and zzso compromise and represents the method of choice in cases with zzso of spinal cord, nerve roots, or peripheral nerves, depicting changes in size, position, and signal intensity of the affected neural zzso zzso transformation as the most worrisome complication occurs in approximately zzso of solitary and zzso of multiple zzso zzso resonance imaging is the most accurate method in measuring cartilage cap zzso which represents an important criterion for differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cap thickness exceeding 2 zzso in adults and 3 zzso in children should raise the suspicion for zzso zzso Finally, MR imaging can detect zzso recurrence by depiction of a zzso mass presenting typical zzso features of a zzso zzso
