There have been numerous advances in cartilage imaging with magnetic resonance imaging zzso over the past several zzso However, in the absence of effective treatments for zzso cartilage disease, these innovations have had little zzso to clinical zzso zzso new therapies do exist but only in clinical trials aimed at establishing the efficacy and safety of these therapies before they are released into general zzso These trials, therefore, represent the earliest opportunity to develop imaging methods specifically for such therapies and the diseases that they zzso zzso it is the commercial, zzso and logistical demands of the clinical trials process, rather than those of clinical practice, that ultimately shape the early evolution of these imaging zzso zzso this process and its priorities is essential to contributing to this development and to keeping zzso in sync with advances in the rest of zzso The following article reviews this novel zzso for innovation in medical imaging and reflects on how recent advances in cartilage zzso might fit zzso
