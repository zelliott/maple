zzso gastric zzso is an effective weight-loss treatment, but little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying weight zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine whether gastric zzso affects brain function in regions previously implicated in food zzso zzso and cognitive zzso The setting for the study was the University of zzso City, Department of zzso zzso Brain Imaging Center, University of Kansas Medical Center; and private practice in the United zzso 

Ten obese participants were recruited before adjustable gastric zzso surgery zzso body mass index before surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso Their mean body mass index at 12 weeks after surgery was zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean percentage of excess weight loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging scans were conducted before and 12 weeks after adjustable gastric zzso zzso At each assessment point, the participants completed questionnaires assessing food motivation and were scanned while hungry zzso zzso and immediately after a standardized meal (after zzso During the functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, the participants viewed food pictures, nonfood pictures zzso and blurred baseline control zzso The functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed using zzso zzso 

After surgery, the participants reported significantly less food motivation and more cognitive zzso The participants also showed decreased brain zzso to food versus nonfood pictures in regions implicated in food motivation and zzso including the zzso zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso and inferior frontal zzso In contrast, they demonstrated increased zzso to food versus nonfood pictures in anterior prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control and zzso 

This is the first study to examine the functional brain changes after gastric zzso surgery and 1 of the first studies to zzso examine neural changes associated with weight zzso These results have provided preliminary evidence that adjustable gastric zzso alters brain function in regions known to regulate reward and cognitive zzso
