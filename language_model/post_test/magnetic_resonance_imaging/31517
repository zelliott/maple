zzso love, which may be the core of maternal behavior, is essential for the zzso attachment relationship and is important for the zzso development and mental zzso However, little has been known about these neural mechanisms in human zzso We examined patterns of maternal brain zzso in response to infant cues using video zzso 

We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso while 13 mothers viewed video clips, with no sound, of their own infant and other infants of approximately 16 months of age who demonstrated two different attachment behaviors zzso at the zzso mother and crying for zzso 

We found that a limited number of the mother's brain areas were specifically involved in recognition of the mother's own infant, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso gray, anterior zzso and zzso and zzso parts of zzso Additionally, we found the strong and specific mother's brain response for the mother's own zzso zzso The differential neural zzso pattern was found in the zzso region of zzso zzso nucleus, right inferior frontal zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso anterior cingulate, zzso cingulate, thalamus, zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso 

Our results showed the highly elaborate neural mechanism zzso maternal love and diverse and complex maternal behaviors for vigilant zzso
