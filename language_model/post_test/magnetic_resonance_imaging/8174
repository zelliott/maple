Muscle size is often reported as a single anatomical zzso area zzso rather than volume measured with zzso zzso zzso However, a single zzso may provide an inadequate estimate of muscle zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso muscle volume can be adequately estimated from a single zzso In 18 adult males we derived zzso equations from which estimates of volume were zzso These equations were based on the direct assessment of volume using 11 zzso zzso scans along the entire length of the zzso (the gold zzso We estimated volume based on single scans at 40, 50 and zzso of zzso length (from the zzso zzso All estimates of zzso volumes were highly correlated to the measured volume and demonstrated a low level of zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (all P zzso zzso standard error of estimate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for single scans taken at 40, 50 and zzso of zzso length zzso In comparison, when volume was estimated using multiple zzso scans corresponding to the maximum zzso of each muscle the estimate was even better zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso Substituting zzso from a single zzso scan at zzso of zzso length into a previously determined zzso equation allows for an zzso of muscle volume with a zzso error of zzso
