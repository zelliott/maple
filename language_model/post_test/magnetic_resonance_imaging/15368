The purpose of this article is to define the relations of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso attachments on zzso dissection and correlate with zzso of the anterior zzso 

zzso zzso (8 males and 9 zzso mean age, 80 zzso were dissected zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscles were traced to the zzso and further attachments to the zzso zzso were zzso Ten zzso zzso age, zzso age range, zzso zzso male athletes underwent zzso zzso of the anterior pelvis with two surface zzso (each 42 zzso in zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso sequences zzso zzso size, zzso zzso were zzso zzso were repeated incorporating fat suppression and zzso zzso The relation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the insertions of the zzso zzso zzso muscles, and zzso were independently evaluated by two experienced zzso blinded to all clinical zzso 

In all 17 zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso attached to the capsule and disk of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso had an attachment to the capsule in seven specimens and the zzso in zzso All zzso zzso attached to the zzso In all 10 athletes, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contributed to the zzso zzso and zzso This was only the case for the zzso zzso in four zzso No other zzso involved the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso findings show an intimate relationship between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cartilage, zzso and zzso zzso
