We studied whether dynamic zzso zzso zzso could identify zzso characteristics of breast zzso Seventy-five patients with breast cancer underwent zzso followed by core zzso zzso findings were evaluated following the scoring system published by Fischer in zzso In this scoring system, five zzso features, three zzso zzso margins, enhancement zzso and two functional zzso peak of signal intensity zzso increase and behavior of signal intensity zzso are defined by 14 zzso Each zzso is assigned points ranging from 0 to 1 or 0 to 2, with higher points for those that are more likely to be associated with zzso The sum of all the points defines the degree of suspicion of zzso with a score 0 representing the lowest and 8 the highest degree of zzso zzso between zzso features and tumor zzso characteristics assessed on core zzso zzso type, zzso zzso and zzso zzso status, zzso and zzso zzso were studied by contingency tables and zzso zzso zzso We found a significant inverse association between the zzso score and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Based on our results, we suggest that zzso with zzso suspicious zzso parameters may represent a subset of tumor with poor zzso zzso
