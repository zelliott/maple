zzso zzso zzso are typically clinically catastrophic and occur more frequently with tissue zzso zzso zzso therapy compared to without zzso zzso However, it has been unclear whether zzso zzso zzso has clinical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso stroke patients treated with zzso within 3 h of stroke onset were studied zzso Patients with symptomatic zzso were excluded from the zzso To identify the presence of early zzso and zzso zzso as well as to measure zzso volume, zzso zzso including zzso imaging, zzso zzso and zzso were performed before and 1 zzso 24 zzso and zzso days after zzso zzso At the same time, serial zzso scores were zzso The independent zzso of dramatic recovery were determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

51 patients were enrolled in the present zzso 22 patients zzso zzso had an zzso zzso The zzso score of the zzso group zzso but that of the H group did not zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 7 zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was more frequently seen in zzso improvement group than in dramatic improvement group zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso analysis using the variables that had a zzso on zzso analysis zzso baseline zzso score, zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso early zzso 1 h after zzso infusion, and zzso volume 7 days after zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independent factors for dramatic improvement, while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was an independent negative zzso 

zzso zzso was an independent negative factor for dramatic zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso may be associated with neurological zzso
