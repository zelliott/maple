The aim of this paper was to determine zzso factors for adult zzso treated with boost zzso zzso surgery zzso following zzso and zzso zzso 

The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 12 adult patients with zzso proven zzso or zzso primitive zzso tumor who between February 1991 and December 2004 underwent zzso sessions of zzso for zzso residual or zzso tumors (6 tumors in each zzso Before zzso all patients had undergone a zzso feasible zzso followed by zzso zzso Nine patients also received systemic zzso zzso zzso was applied to residual and zzso zzso zzso tumor as well as to zzso of zzso zzso zzso The median time zzso from initial diagnosis and zzso to the first zzso treatment was 24 months zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso tumor volume was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Following zzso zzso 5 patients had no evidence of tumor on magnetic resonance zzso imaging, 3 patients had stable tumor burden on MR imaging, and 4 patients had evidence of tumor progression locally with or without zzso zzso All patients with tumor progression zzso Eight patients survive with a mean cumulative follow-up of zzso months zzso zzso zzso No acute radiation toxicity or delayed radiation necrosis was observed among any of the 12 zzso The majority of patients who achieved tumor zzso zzso and tumor stabilization zzso after zzso had residual tumor as the reason for their referral for zzso The best outcomes were attained in patients with residual disease who were younger, had smaller tumor volumes, had no evidence of zzso disease, and had received higher cumulative zzso zzso 

Single or multiple zzso sessions were a zzso zzso and effective zzso treatment for zzso zzso residual or zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso in adult zzso
