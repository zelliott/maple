In patients with zzso dislocation, zzso injury is often an indication for early surgical zzso However, no studies have identified a relationship between injury to the zzso surface of the lateral zzso zzso following a zzso dislocation and the eventual need for surgical zzso The authors hypothesized that a significant number of patients sustain injury to the zzso surface of the lateral zzso zzso following an acute zzso zzso and magnetic resonance images were zzso reviewed and the patterns of injury were evaluated for 80 patients with a diagnosis of acute zzso dislocation, including the presence of zzso damage, the location of the zzso zzso ligament injury, and zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging identified a zzso zzso of zzso injury involving the zzso zzso region of the lateral zzso zzso following an acute lateral zzso zzso zzso intervention was performed in more than zzso of these injuries, and most were not identified with plain zzso zzso to the zzso surface of the lateral zzso zzso following zzso dislocation was zzso times more common in boys in the current study zzso injury to the zzso surface of the lateral zzso zzso may occur in a high percentage of patients following a lateral zzso dislocation and in a higher percentage of boys than zzso Patients with tenderness over the lateral zzso zzso following an acute lateral zzso dislocation should undergo magnetic resonance zzso
