To determine whether zzso high zzso ratio zzso images of the tongue acquired with zzso zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least squares zzso will provide comparable zzso measures to conventional zzso zzso imaging and to determine the feasibility of zzso the proportion of zzso fat in adults using zzso zzso 

Healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the tongue using both zzso and conventional zzso zzso The tongue was manually outlined to derive both zzso and fat fraction zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso were zzso for zzso measurement reliability and zzso rank correlation tested the relationship between zzso and conventional zzso measures of the zzso 

zzso imaging yielded almost identical zzso measures to that of conventional zzso imaging in the same amount of scan time zzso mean zzso zzso conventional mean zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso The average fat signal fraction across participants was zzso zzso reliability was excellent for all measures zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso provided similar zzso volume estimates to conventional zzso imaging obtained in both the current and previous zzso zzso measures of zzso fat composition may be useful in studies that aim to increase zzso muscle strength and volume in swallowing and zzso zzso
