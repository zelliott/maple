To assess the effect of zzso zzso and upright zzso body positions on zzso position, shape, and size of Morton zzso during magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso patients with 20 Morton zzso underwent MR imaging of the zzso in prone zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and upright zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso good, 2 zzso moderate, 1 zzso zzso position relative to the zzso bone, shape, and zzso diameter of Morton zzso were assessed on zzso zzso MR zzso zzso between different body positions and variables of interest were calculated with zzso signed rank test, zzso test, and paired Student zzso zzso 

In the prone position, visibility of all 20 Morton zzso was rated with a score of 3; visibility in the zzso and zzso positions was inferior zzso score, zzso All 20 zzso Morton zzso changed their position relative to the zzso bone between prone and zzso and between prone and zzso zzso When compared with the prone position, there was a difference in the shape of all 20 Morton zzso in the zzso position zzso zzso Between prone zzso zzso diameter of Morton zzso 8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso diameter of Morton zzso 6 zzso positions, the zzso diameter of Morton zzso significantly decreased by 2 zzso zzso zzso between prone and zzso positions, the decrease of the mean zzso diameter was also significant zzso 2 zzso P zzso 

Morton zzso appears significantly different during MR imaging in zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso diameter of Morton zzso is significantly larger on images obtained in the prone position than it is on images obtained in the zzso and upright zzso zzso zzso of Morton zzso is best on MR images obtained in the prone zzso
