We investigated anterior zzso zzso zzso volume in 40 patients with schizophrenia (20 zzso 20 zzso and 40 zzso zzso normal controls using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Volumes of the whole brain and both the gray and white matter of the zzso were measured on consecutive zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the patients with schizophrenia and the normal controls in the whole brain zzso Right zzso gray matter volume was significantly reduced in the female patients with schizophrenia as compared with the female zzso zzso the female controls, zzso gray matter volume was significantly larger on the right than on the left, while this asymmetry was not significant in the female zzso zzso white matter findings were similar to those of the zzso gray matter in that the volume was significantly larger on the right in the female controls, and this normal structural asymmetry was reduced in the female zzso These results suggest that gender may play an important role in the structural asymmetry anomalies in zzso
