Total zzso is the optimal treatment for zzso zzso However, an unexpected residual tumor mass is sometimes found on magnetic resonance imaging performed after an operation because of a zzso unclear margin of the tumor at zzso This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of fluorescent imaging by a surgical microscope after zzso administration for the detection of zzso at zzso For this study, we produced two filters for the zzso and zzso of zzso that can be easily fitted to and removed from a surgical microscope manually during the zzso For the experimental study, zzso rat brains bearing zzso zzso were removed at appropriate intervals after intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso body weight of sodium zzso and their surface and zzso section through the tumor were observed using a surgical microscope with the zzso In clinical cases, 1000 zzso of sodium zzso was zzso administered to five patients with zzso before tumor zzso In the experimental study, the zzso zzso itself and the zzso brain adjacent to the tumor zzso 2-3 zzso of the gross surface of the zzso were well stained a brilliant zzso green for a few zzso The normal brain was not zzso In clinical cases, the tumors were stained a brilliant zzso green under fluorescent observation at zzso The patients had no side zzso At all times the fluorescent observation could be quickly changed to ordinary observation by removing the filters from the surgical zzso The tumor was also stained a faint yellow under ordinary zzso zzso Although this contributed to detection of the zzso the fluorescent zzso demarcated the tumor more clearly than zzso zzso These results suggest that this imaging technique by a surgical microscope with special filters at surgery may be practical and useful for detection of zzso and warrants further clinical zzso
