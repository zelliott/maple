Type II zzso bones have an zzso facet that zzso with the zzso bone, which frequently leads to zzso Because the only prior studies, to our knowledge, on this common and clinically significant zzso involved dissection of zzso we performed an MR imaging study of the type II zzso 

We zzso reviewed MR images obtained at zzso T of 186 zzso for frequency of type II zzso size of the extra zzso amount of zzso zzso and presence of zzso zzso zzso Of the 186 zzso 28 also had correlation with findings on wrist zzso 

One hundred seven zzso zzso had type II zzso with an average extra facet size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the extra zzso facet with the zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in only nine zzso zzso all of which had type II zzso zzso evidence of focal zzso zzso and MR imaging evidence of zzso zzso were seen in six of these nine zzso zzso zzso was seen only in zzso with frank cartilage changes on zzso 

An extra facet zzso II zzso was seen in approximately half of 186 zzso On MR imaging, type II zzso usually have an innocuous zzso A large percentage of patients with type II zzso also have zzso which often is zzso on MR zzso When visible, such zzso is the cause of zzso zzso similar to that seen in patients with zzso zzso
