zzso correlation zzso zzso is a novel optical technique that appears to be an excellent tool for assessing cerebral blood flow in a continuous and zzso manner at the zzso We present new clinical validation of the zzso methodology by demonstrating strong agreement between zzso zzso of relative cerebral blood flow and zzso based on zzso zzso mapping magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of relative blood flow in the jugular veins and superior zzso zzso Data were acquired from 46 children with single zzso cardiac zzso during a zzso zzso zzso increases in cerebral blood flow, measured both by zzso and by zzso zzso as well as significant increases in zzso zzso and total zzso zzso were observed during zzso zzso of blood flow changes measured by zzso zzso in the jugular veins and by zzso revealed a strong linear relationship, zzso zzso zzso Similar correlations were observed between zzso and zzso zzso in the superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso a negative control, was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
