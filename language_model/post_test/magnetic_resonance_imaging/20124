To detect zzso of the fatty component by measuring the in zzso zzso and water content of zzso zzso heads of patients with and without risk for avascular necrosis zzso by using zzso MR zzso zzso 

zzso composition was measured by zzso MRS zzso zzso zzso zzso in a sample volume placed in the zzso of the intact zzso heads of patients with unilateral zzso of the hip zzso 1, N zzso 61, then excluding the post-traumatic or steroid user, final N zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso 2, N zzso zzso Three response variables were derived from zzso the zzso zzso zzso water zzso and zzso zzso 

Of the three zzso the zzso and water zzso differed significantly between groups zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio had borderline significance zzso zzso zzso The three variables differed significantly between groups when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and age and sex had no significant effect on the three dependent zzso 

zzso MRS can depict zzso in the zzso and water composition of zzso zzso heads with and without AVN on the zzso zzso zzso MRS may be a potential tool for investigating of the zzso head component in zzso and predicting the risk for development of zzso
