zzso dysfunction has been implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso While zzso frequently has its onset during childhood, to our knowledge, no prior study has measured zzso changes in the zzso of patients with zzso near the onset of illness, and before and after zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging studies were conducted in 21 zzso zzso children, aged 8 to 17 years, with zzso and 21 zzso healthy comparison zzso zzso resonance imaging studies were also conducted in 10 of the 21 patients with zzso after 12 weeks of zzso with the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso volumes were significantly greater in zzso patients with zzso than in controls but declined significantly after zzso zzso to levels comparable with those of zzso zzso in zzso volume in patients with zzso was associated with reduction in zzso symptom zzso 

Our findings provide new evidence of zzso abnormalities in pediatric zzso and further suggest that zzso treatment may be paralleled by a reduction in zzso zzso These reductions may, however, not be specific to zzso treatment and could be due to a more general treatment response, and/or spontaneous improvement in zzso Our findings are preliminary given the small sample size and our inability to measure discrete zzso zzso
