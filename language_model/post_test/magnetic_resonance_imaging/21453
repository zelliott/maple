Fetal zzso cell suspensions were grafted zzso into the zzso zzso of rats, and reconstruction of zzso zzso transmission and behavior were zzso zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso for one hour induced zzso zzso mainly in the lateral zzso as detected by magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso rats had deficits in the performance of a passive avoidance task, both acquisition and zzso but no changes in general zzso zzso In these animals zzso zzso detected by zzso decreased to about half of control zzso There were suggestions of an improvement in passive avoidance performance in the grafted zzso zzso zzso zzso recovered almost to control levels, and were increased by infusions of the zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso These data indicate that neural transplantation is a promising approach to improve the deficits in chemical transmission and behavior following zzso zzso in rat zzso
