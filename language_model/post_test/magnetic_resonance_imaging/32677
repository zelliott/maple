Breast cancer zzso detection in women with a genetic zzso or strong family history is considered mandatory compared with BC screening in the general zzso However, screening zzso depend on the level of zzso Here we present an update of our screening programs based on risk zzso 

We defined different risk categories and surveillance strategies to identify early BC in zzso healthy women recruited by the zzso Study Group for familial breast and zzso zzso Four BC risk categories included zzso carriers, increased, zzso and slightly increased zzso Women who developed BC from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 2005 (N zzso zzso were compared with the number of expected cases matched for age and zzso zzso carriers were identified by zzso zzso Other risk groups were defined by different levels of family history for breast or zzso cancer zzso The standardized zzso ratio zzso was used to evaluate the observed and expected ratio among zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

After a median follow-up of 55 months, there was a statistically significant difference between observed and expected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso The zzso observed among zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso women at increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso or intermediate risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso was higher than expected, while the difference between observed and expected among women at slightly increased risk was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso 

The rate of zzso detected in women at high risk according to zzso status or strong family history, as defined according to our operational criteria, was significantly higher than expected in an zzso general zzso However, we failed to identify a greater zzso of BC in the slightly increased risk zzso These results support the effectiveness of the proposed program to identify and monitor individuals at high risk, whereas prospective trials are needed for women belonging to families with sporadic BC or zzso
