In the last several years there have been impressive strides in the ability to explore the nature of zzso system functioning in humans by employing functional zzso methods, permitting such methods to be used in conjunction with zzso methods to better understand the role of the zzso system in zzso In this paper, we review the literature on functional imaging studies of the zzso system, zzso the data and testing these data against a number of theories or explanatory accounts of zzso zzso We consider five alternative explanatory accounts of, or ideas about, zzso zzso some from already existing work, for which the functional imaging data can provide a new test, and others that have emerged directly from the functional imaging work, and that have yet to be tested for their fit of data from zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso memory account, in which it is proposed that the zzso system plays a critical role in binding together multiple zzso to permit representations of the relations among the constituent elements of scenes or events, can better accommodate the full range of imaging (and other zzso data than any other explanatory account of zzso zzso
