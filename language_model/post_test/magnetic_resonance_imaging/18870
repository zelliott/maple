To discuss the examination parameters of acoustic zzso 

The zzso features of 20 zzso 20 patients with acoustic zzso had been analyzed zzso The examinations were performed by a zzso zzso zzso magnet system zzso zzso zzso imagines and zzso or zzso zzso zzso imagines were obtained in each zzso 20 patients were examined with zzso 

20 cases of acoustic zzso were divided into three groups according to the tumor size: zzso approximately 2 zzso (4 zzso zzso 2 approximately 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso over 4 zzso (2 zzso zzso weighted imagines zzso the equal or low zzso weighted imagines shows the high zzso Low and high mixture signal will be shown when being zzso or zzso 

Combining thin slice and zzso in zzso examination was the best method to find acoustic zzso zzso not only can find small zzso tumors, but also has advantages in demonstrating the formation of zzso and zzso the zzso of adjacent anatomical structures and the tumor zzso
