Spring ligament zzso is associated with chronic zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and may constitute an indication for surgical repair or zzso This study examines the accuracy of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso of the spring zzso 

Two experienced musculoskeletal zzso independently scored the zzso findings in 13 cases of surgically proven spring ligament zzso and in 18 control subjects, using a standardized scoring zzso 

zzso of the spring ligament was associated with increased signal zzso on short TE spin echo images, and an increase in the thickness of the zzso portion of the zzso The sensitivity of zzso for the diagnosis of spring ligament zzso was zzso while the specificity was zzso zzso assessment of the zzso portion of the spring ligament was unreliable zzso but the assessment of global ligament integrity was substantially zzso zzso 

The zzso portion of the spring ligament can be reliably assessed on routine zzso The findings of spring ligament zzso on zzso are only moderately sensitive but highly zzso
