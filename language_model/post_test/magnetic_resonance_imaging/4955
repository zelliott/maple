Face zzso which is believed to be processed in the zzso visual pathway, has been extensively investigated in humans and monkeys through zzso and zzso zzso studies in monkeys indicate that simple facial features are processed in the zzso regions, and that the combined and integrated features of the face are stored in the zzso zzso zzso However, this hypothesis still lacks experimental evidence in normal human zzso therefore, we conducted 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments to investigate whether the function of the zzso differs from that of conventional zzso areas during face recognition zzso In experiment 1, normal subjects learned 6 facial zzso associations before zzso and their brain activity was measured during recognition testing of correct and incorrect zzso pairs in 3 different zzso The degree of zzso in the zzso differed among the facial angles, and zzso in response to frontal views was greater than that to other zzso In experiment 2, where face angle, but not identity, was paired with an abstract figure, zzso was significantly greater in response to the frontal view than that to other zzso In contrast, the degree of zzso in conventional zzso areas, zzso the zzso zzso did not differ among viewing angles in both zzso The results indicate that the function of face representation in the zzso differs from that in the conventional zzso areas, and that a frontal view of the face plays a role in the zzso of face representation stored in the zzso
