zzso studies found that zzso strokes differ in the size of the underlying brain zzso and that small zzso are usually caused by zzso zzso disease zzso and larger ones by zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that larger zzso zzso might cause more severe neurological deficits and a higher detection rate on brain imaging compared with zzso strokes caused by zzso This prospective zzso study was performed to investigate whether zzso neurological outcome, zzso prevalence of stroke risk factors, zzso prevalence of clinically zzso zzso cerebral artery disease, and zzso detection rate of underlying zzso zzso at brain imaging differ in zzso zzso strokes with zzso and without potential zzso other than zzso 

zzso patients with zzso stroke zzso defined by both clinical findings and brain imaging, were zzso Neurological deficit was zzso at presentation with the use of the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso and after 3 months with the zzso and the modified Rankin zzso zzso zzso arteries were investigated by zzso 

Compared with patients with zzso zzso strokes zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso strokes zzso zzso had zzso higher zzso scores at presentation and higher zzso and zzso scores after 3 months zzso a higher prevalence of zzso hypertension zzso zzso coronary artery disease zzso zzso previous transient zzso attacks zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cerebral zzso to zzso and zzso carotid zzso to 50% zzso zzso zzso and zzso a higher detection rate of the underlying zzso at brain imaging zzso 

Our data suggest that patients with zzso zzso strokes have a worse clinical outcome and a higher prevalence of large cerebral and coronary artery disease than patients with zzso zzso zzso
