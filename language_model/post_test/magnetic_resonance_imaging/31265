zzso assessment of zzso wall motion is still most frequently done zzso This study was designed to validate a new system for zzso zzso of global and regional zzso zzso function from zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso volumes were validated in 50 patients using magnetic resonance zzso as zzso The regional identification of the zzso boundary was validated frame-by-frame against the visually identified border in another 27 zzso Finally, the zzso of the system for zzso zzso exams was assessed in 52 patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso sequences were digitally processed using zzso zzso based on local phase feature zzso zzso zzso fitting, and prospective zzso 

Compared to zzso the tracing system showed reasonable zzso with relative errors for zzso volume, zzso volume, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Regional agreement of the instantaneous contours with visually traced borders was within the limits of visual zzso The system was suitable for tracking zzso studies from all patients except two zzso zzso of regional zzso zzso allowed to discriminate segments showing an abnormal regional wall motion with an overall area under the zzso curve of zzso 

A reliable and accurate zzso of zzso zzso function can be obtained by processing contrast zzso zzso of zzso volumes, ejection zzso and regional zzso zzso adequately correlate with currently available reference zzso zzso zzso to baseline and stress studies, zzso tracking techniques increase the reliability of zzso for the assessment of global and regional zzso zzso
