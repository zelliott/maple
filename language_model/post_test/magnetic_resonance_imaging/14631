Research tools are urgently needed to zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso due to their clinical similarity at the early stage of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso we characterized the zzso nerve and spinal zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso specific zzso Specifically, early zzso zzso breakdown was observed in zzso of the zzso mice, while the majority of mice showed little to no brain zzso Further, zzso showed inflammatory infiltrates and zzso in the brain and spinal zzso that mirrored sites of zzso zzso along with a decrease in zzso protein at zzso zzso zzso zzso mice develop zzso and spinal zzso zzso that can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso and verified by pathological zzso The similarity of these zzso with those seen in zzso patients suggests that the zzso mouse might serve as a model for zzso zzso
