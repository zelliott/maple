zzso studies provide support for abnormalities in the structure and functioning of the prefrontal zzso zzso and the amygdala, the key components of the neural system that zzso emotional processing in major depressive disorder zzso We used zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to examine potential zzso functional connectivity abnormalities in zzso subjects with zzso 

zzso zzso data were acquired from 28 individuals with zzso and 30 healthy control zzso zzso zzso functional connectivity was compared between the zzso and HC zzso 

zzso functional connectivity to the left zzso zzso zzso from the left and right zzso was observed in the zzso group, compared with the HC group zzso zzso 

The zzso subjects with zzso showed decreased functional connectivity from the zzso to the zzso especially to the left zzso This suggests that these connections may play an important role in the zzso of zzso at its zzso
