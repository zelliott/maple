To investigate the zzso of two zzso zzso surrogate zzso cartilage thickness and cartilage zzso from healthy volunteers on two zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso systems from different zzso 

Ten knees of five healthy volunteers were scanned on a zzso General Electric zzso and a zzso Philips scanner using a fast three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso The acquisition parameters were zzso beforehand and were kept as comparable as possible on both zzso For quantitative analysis, the average cartilage thickness and volume of the zzso regions of the zzso zzso were zzso Data were analyzed using a zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso to examine the effects of position, zzso and imaging system on the zzso 

The average cartilage thickness and volume of the zzso regions of the zzso zzso did not differ between the two different zzso zzso systems zzso zzso zzso There was no significant effect of position or zzso on the average cartilage thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso or cartilage volume zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso 

Two zzso surrogate zzso cartilage thickness and cartilage zzso on two zzso zzso systems from different manufacturers are zzso
