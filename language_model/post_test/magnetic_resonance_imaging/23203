The past few years have seen considerable interest in findings of abnormal brain connectivity in the zzso spectrum disorders zzso We review recent work from zzso and other sources, and argue that there is considerable zzso evidence suggesting that connectivity is disrupted in zzso We point to evidence both of local zzso and of long-distance zzso and describe some zzso in this picture, most notably that disruptions appear more severe in zzso cortical zzso We conclude by discussing a number of extant zzso zzso we consider whether zzso connectivity should be seen as part of the primary zzso of zzso or whether disrupted connectivity in zzso emerges over zzso zzso we consider how the patterns of disrupted connectivity found in zzso might relate to those being found in a range of other zzso
