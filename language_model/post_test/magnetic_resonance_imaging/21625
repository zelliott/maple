A method has been developed that uses dynamic MR imaging to measure simultaneously the changes in signal intensity due to zzso contrast agent in blood and zzso using zzso zzso projection and imaging zzso The basic zzso sequence has a projection time resolution of 50 zzso and can measure rapid changes in the blood signal zzso zzso with a tissue suppression slab have time resolutions of 57 or 75 zzso Orientation of the projection and image planes can be defined zzso This technique will facilitate functional zzso using MR contrast agents, allowing the blood input function to be determined with excellent time zzso
