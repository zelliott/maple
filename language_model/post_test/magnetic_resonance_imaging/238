All zzso and many novel zzso zzso contrast agents used to enhance signal intensity in magnetic resonance imaging zzso are zzso zzso To verify zzso results, a zzso zzso that can map and zzso zzso down to the parts per million zzso levels is zzso Nuclear zzso is a relatively new technique that has this capability and is composed of a combination of three zzso beam zzso scanning transmission zzso zzso Rutherford zzso zzso and particle induced X-ray zzso used in conjunction with a high energy zzso zzso In this zzso study, we show that in diseased zzso vessel walls obtained at 2 and 4 h after intravenous injection of the zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso there was a zzso zzso clearance (2 h zzso zzso zzso 4 h zzso zzso zzso As expected, the control animal, injected with the zzso conventional agent zzso zzso and sacrificed 1 week after injection, revealed no significant residual zzso in the zzso Similar to known in zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso concentration dropped by a factor of 2 in vessel wall tissue in zzso zzso Further high-resolution studies revealed that zzso was relatively zzso distributed, consistent with random agent zzso We conclude that nuclear zzso is potentially very useful for validation studies involving zzso magnetic resonance contrast zzso
