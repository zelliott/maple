zzso alters breathing mechanics during zzso Weight loss improves lung function at rest, but the effect of weight loss, especially regional fat loss, on exercise breathing mechanics is zzso We hypothesized that weight loss, especially a decrease in abdominal fat, would improve breathing mechanics during exercise because of an increase in zzso lung volume zzso 

Nine obese men were studied before and after weight loss zzso zzso zzso of total fat weight, mean zzso zzso zzso underwent pulmonary function testing, underwater zzso fat distribution estimates zzso and graded cycle zzso before and after a zzso diet and exercise zzso In seven men, zzso and gastric pressures were zzso The effects of weight loss were analyzed at rest, at zzso threshold zzso and during peak exercise by dependent Student zzso test, and the relationship among variables was determined by correlation zzso 

zzso lost zzso zzso zzso zzso of body weight zzso zzso zzso but the distribution of fat remained zzso After weight loss, lung volume subdivisions at rest were increased zzso zzso zzso and were moderately associated zzso zzso zzso with changes in chest, zzso and hip zzso At zzso zzso increased, and gastric pressure decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso The changes in waist zzso hip zzso zzso and sum of chest, zzso and hip zzso were also consistently and significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with changes in gastric pressure during exercise at zzso 

zzso weight loss improves breathing mechanics during zzso exercise in otherwise healthy obese men, which is clinically zzso Improvement appears to be related to the cumulative loss of chest wall zzso
