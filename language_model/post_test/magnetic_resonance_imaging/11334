A quantitative analysis was undertaken to zzso the zzso zzso technique based on tracking the first pass of a zzso of a blood pool contrast zzso A complete simulation of the zzso passage, of the associated changes in the zzso and zzso signals, and of the data processing was performed using the zzso dilution theory, an zzso theory of the MR signal from living zzso and zzso zzso The noise was excluded in the simulation in order to analyze the ultimate accuracy of the zzso It is demonstrated that the relationship between the contrast agent concentration and the associated changes in the zzso relaxation rate shows essentially different forms in studied tissue and in the reference zzso This effect results in systematic zzso of the measured blood flow, blood volume, and the zzso function obtained with conventional processing from their true zzso The error depends on the zzso zzso the properties of the contrast agent, and the weights of the various compartments in the total zzso The results show that dynamic zzso contrast zzso can reach the goal of absolute zzso zzso only with additional input from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the method can be used to provide such information if the zzso is zzso by another zzso
