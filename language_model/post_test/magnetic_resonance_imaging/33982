In zzso zzso disease, the zzso disease process of zzso zzso is progressive, and cerebral zzso often develop as a result of zzso Our purpose was to determine how the severity of zzso zzso in the anterior and zzso zzso affects the distribution of cerebral zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

In 69 patients with zzso zzso disease, zzso were reviewed for zzso zzso and CT scans, MR images, or both were reviewed for the sites and extent of cerebral zzso The relationship between the zzso and zzso findings was zzso 

The prevalence and degree of zzso zzso of the zzso cerebral artery zzso significantly correlated with the extent of zzso around the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery zzso The prevalence of zzso significantly correlated with the degree of zzso changes of both the zzso and zzso zzso tended to be distributed in the anterior zzso in zzso cases, while in more advanced cases zzso were additionally found zzso in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that progressive changes of the anterior and zzso zzso are associated with the distribution of cerebral zzso culminating in a zzso zzso or honeycomb pattern of zzso on CT and MR studies in late stages of the zzso
