The purpose of our study was to determine if zzso in and adjacent to the lesser zzso are associated with rotator cuff pathology found at zzso 

A retrospective review was undertaken of the magnetic resonance zzso imaging of zzso consecutive zzso procedures performed by a single orthopedic shoulder surgeon from February 2001 to June zzso Images of the shoulders were reviewed by an experienced zzso musculoskeletal zzso reader 1, and a musculoskeletal zzso reader 2, for the presence and location of lesser zzso zzso zzso were grouped by their location into those within the lesser zzso and those adjacent to the lesser zzso zzso agreement was calculated using zzso zzso 

A total of 26 patients (17 men, 9 zzso age range zzso years; mean of 61 zzso had zzso in or adjacent to the lesser zzso For reader 1, patients with zzso located in the lesser zzso were found to be significantly zzso and more likely to have zzso zzso zzso than patients with zzso located adjacent to the zzso No significant difference in any category between patients with a zzso located in the lesser zzso and those adjacent to the zzso was identified for reader zzso zzso agreement of imaging findings ranged from fair to near perfect zzso 

zzso located in the lesser zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso are suggestive of zzso zzso pathology and may occur in older zzso
