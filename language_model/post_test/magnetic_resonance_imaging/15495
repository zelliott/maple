To report a clinical and genetic study of a large family with zzso zzso zzso and childhood absence zzso zzso 

This family was identified through a French campaign for familial zzso It spans four generations and consists of 51 members, 13 of whom were zzso The medical history of all members was obtained by personal information and by consulting the medical files of affected zzso All family members gave written consent to participate in the zzso 

All affected members presented zzso with zzso in five and zzso lobe zzso zzso in zzso zzso stopped before age 6 years in all but one zzso zzso were simple, except in one patient who had a long-lasting complex zzso at 8 months of zzso He later presented zzso zzso and left zzso sclerosis was visible on brain zzso Patients presenting zzso had recorded absences and characteristic zzso with 3 zzso spike zzso After exclusion of reported zzso for zzso and generalized zzso with zzso zzso a zzso search allowed us to map a new locus for zzso on zzso We could not exclude another zzso segment on zzso zzso and all patients presenting zzso zzso and zzso shared a common zzso at this locus in addition to the zzso on zzso 

These findings emphasize the genetic zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in association with zzso zzso might result in this family from an interaction between at least two zzso the gene on zzso and a possible modifier gene on zzso
