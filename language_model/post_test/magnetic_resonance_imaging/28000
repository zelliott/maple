We measured the variation of zzso wall stress and its relation to regional ejection fraction in zzso planes through the left zzso in normal subjects and in patients with zzso zzso zzso by zzso magnetic resonance zzso There was a gradual increase in zzso wall stress but a gradual decrease in ejection fraction from zzso to base in normal subjects zzso zzso 6 to 52 zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and in patients with zzso zzso zzso 28 to 130 zzso 30 zzso 40 zzso 18 to zzso zzso zzso The zzso wall stress in patients with zzso was higher than in normal subjects at every level zzso zzso zzso We conclude that there is a variation in zzso wall stress in both normal subjects and patients with zzso with regional ejection fraction zzso related to regional zzso wall zzso
