To test the hypothesis that diffusion of contrast medium into the zzso disk is affected by the integrity of the nucleus zzso and zzso zzso 

In canine zzso zzso defects were made in the zzso zzso and nuclear material was removed from the disk with a zzso MR imaging was performed with intravenous contrast medium at 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after the zzso The diffusion of contrast medium in the zzso disk was studied by visual inspection and by measuring changes in signal zzso The zzso disk were classified at each MR study as normal or abnormal on the basis of the signal intensity on zzso zzso 

In zzso disks after intravenous injection of contrast zzso a band of increased signal intensity was observed near the zzso that became wider with time and approached the center of the zzso In six of the 12 treated zzso the band of increased signal intensity was visibly diminished or less discrete compared with that in the control zzso Weeks later, these treated disks showed diminished signal intensity on zzso images and bulging of the zzso zzso 

zzso disks with defects in the zzso zzso and reduced cartilage content were characterized by abnormal diffusion of contrast medium into the zzso and changes characteristic of early disk zzso were detected zzso
