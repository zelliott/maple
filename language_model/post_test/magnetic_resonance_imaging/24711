zzso field zzso zzso is usually conducted with volume transmit zzso and phased array receive zzso zzso both tightly enclosing the zzso The zzso zzso concept allows a remote zzso offering more flexible experimental zzso To investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso in horizontal zzso zzso we first compared the distribution of the electromagnetic fields in an oil phantom and then verified the concept with an in zzso zzso 

In the phantom experiments an in-house zzso polarized hybrid zzso zzso and a zzso patch antenna were used for zzso and an zzso phased array antenna for zzso zzso fields were calculated and measured for both zzso For in zzso experiments the zzso part was replaced with an zzso zzso phased array head zzso The zzso was calculated using field zzso 

In the phantom the field distribution was zzso in a central volume of interest of about 10 zzso zzso The zzso concept showed a slightly better zzso zzso of a female crab-eating zzso led to homogeneous zzso images with a good zzso of anatomical zzso 

The zzso concept opens up a new approach for zzso of zzso animals in horizontal zzso zzso
