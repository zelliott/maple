Although many studies have examined the neural bases of controlling cognitive responses, the neural systems for controlling conflicts between competing affective responses remain zzso To address the neural zzso of affective conflict and their relationship to cognitive conflict, the present study collected zzso zzso data during two versions of the zzso zzso zzso For these tasks, participants indicated either the zzso zzso zzso or the semantic category zzso zzso of a central target word while ignoring zzso words that mapped onto either the same zzso or a different zzso response as the zzso Overall, contrasts of zzso zzso zzso trials showed that bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso frontal cortex, and zzso zzso were active during both kinds of conflict, whereas zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso were zzso active during affective or cognitive conflict, zzso Individual difference analyses showed that separate regions of zzso zzso zzso and left zzso zzso were positively correlated with the magnitude of response time zzso Taken together, the findings that controlling affective and cognitive conflicts depends upon both common and distinct systems have important implications for understanding the organization of control systems in general and their potential dysfunction in clinical zzso
