In order to evaluate the suitability of a zzso as a zzso material for certain working zzso used in process plants, information about the fluid zzso into the zzso or the zzso zzso to the fluid is a zzso The fluid of interest in the present work is zzso zzso a partly fluorinated hydrocarbon zzso commonly known as zzso zzso zzso are increasingly used in zzso air zzso and heat pump applications as zzso for the zzso zzso or zzso zzso that are believed to be responsible for ozone depletion in the zzso The zzso studied were zzso a zzso and zzso an zzso zzso The study was carried out using magnetic resonance imaging zzso The contact time dependence of diffusion of the fluid into the zzso as well as the spatial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation times, were used as indicators of the influence of the zzso zzso on the mobility of zzso zzso
