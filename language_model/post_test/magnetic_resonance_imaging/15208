Traditional analysis of zzso data uses zzso statistics, such as the zzso These tests are designed to detect mean zzso In fact, even zzso techniques such as zzso zzso zzso zzso use the zzso zzso statistic to measure effect zzso We note that these measures may not be particularly sensitive for detecting differences when the mean is not an accurate measure of central zzso example if one of the groups is experiencing a ceiling or floor effect zzso a skewed data zzso Here we introduce a zzso approach for zzso data analysis that is based on the zzso of data (and is therefore less influenced by zzso than the zzso We suggest that this approach may offer a small benefit for zzso where the assumptions of the zzso have been zzso for example zzso where data from one of the groups exhibits a skewed distribution due to floor or ceiling zzso
