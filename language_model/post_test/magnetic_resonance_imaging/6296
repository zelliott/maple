40 patients with clinically palpable zzso zzso masses were included in a prospective study to compare magnetic resonance imaging to zzso zzso zzso has proved superior to CT not only in imaging primary zzso but also in diagnosing local and regional zzso In evaluating border structures, signal intensity, zzso and zzso of space occupying zzso we can determine the zzso zzso Besides, we can define to some extent the internal architecture of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Better contrast resolution and more specificity can be obtained by the use of contrast medium zzso Even small zzso and zzso masses can be clearly distinguished from the zzso zzso At present, magnetic resonance imaging offers the diagnostic potency of both zzso and zzso zzso The advantages of zzso and our present indications in imaging zzso zzso masses are zzso
