To determine the usefulness of zzso and magnetic resonance imaging in zzso benign from zzso zzso tumors of the hand and in making a zzso zzso 

Two hundred consecutive zzso tumors of the hand, the details of which originated from a national zzso were studied in a prospective way by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso All tumors were graded on a zzso scale, from certainly benign to certainly zzso using location and zzso as diagnostic zzso For all tumors a zzso diagnosis was made, by the proposal of three possibilities in decreasing order of zzso zzso diagnosis was made by peer review, according to the WHO zzso 

By the combining of zzso and zzso benign zzso I and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso IV and zzso a correct grading was obtained in 165 zzso of the cases zzso of the 173 benign and 11 of the 27 zzso zzso A correct zzso diagnosis was included in the three proposed differentials in zzso zzso confirmed a correct diagnosis made on zzso in zzso and improved the grading capability by correctly upgrading zzso tumors and zzso benign tumors in, respectively, zzso and zzso The capability to obtain a zzso diagnosis improved with change of an incorrect diagnosis on zzso to a correct one on zzso in 12 cases zzso 

zzso zzso grading on zzso by an expert group proved to be excellent when compared with the results of a quantitative analysis of individual grading zzso Multiple zzso zzso analysis of these parameters resulted in a grading formula containing only six zzso The additional value of zzso in grading was zzso zzso Already high accuracy of zzso in making a zzso diagnosis, improved substantially after the performance of zzso
