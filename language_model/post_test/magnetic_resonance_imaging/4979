To develop a robust zzso zzso zzso imaging technique with uniform zzso separation and simultaneous fat suppression for rapid assessment of breast implants in a single zzso 

A three-dimensional zzso fast spin echo sequence that uses variable zzso flip angles was combined with a zzso zzso technique zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso Phase shifts of zzso zzso and zzso between water and silicone were used for zzso zzso For comparison, two-dimensional images using zzso with STIR were also acquired in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) zzso breast images with uniform zzso separation and simultaneous fat suppression were acquired successfully in clinically feasible scan times zzso zzso The zzso images were acquired with the same zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso ), but the slice thickness was increased to 6 zzso with a slice gap of 1 zzso for complete coverage of the implants in a reasonable scan time, which varied between zzso and zzso zzso 

The single zzso acquisition with uniform water and silicone separation enables images to be zzso into any zzso This allows comprehensive assessment of breast implant integrity in less than 10 zzso of total examination zzso
