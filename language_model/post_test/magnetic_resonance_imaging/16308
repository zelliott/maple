To study the zzso change of the zzso zzso degenerative zzso disc in different degrees and explore its clinical zzso 

The zzso data zzso and zzso of 37 patients with degenerative disc disease of zzso zzso 23, female 14, age from 28 to 62 years with an average of zzso zzso zzso The patients were divided into three groups depending on the mean signal intensity rate of degenerative disc and zzso zzso degenerative group zzso zzso of 11 cases, intermediate degenerative group zzso zzso of 13 cases, and severe degenerative group zzso zzso of 13 zzso The extreme zzso maximum zzso and areas of the zzso zzso were measured from the CT zzso zzso scan zzso The changes of the zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso The extreme altitude and areas of the zzso zzso gradually diminished among the light degenerative group, intermediate degenerative group and severe degenerative group, there was no significant zzso between intermediate degenerative group and the light degenerative group zzso zzso zzso there was statistical significance between severe degenerative group and intermediate degenerative group zzso zzso zzso there was statistical significance between severe degenerative group and light degenerative group zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no statistical significance of the maximum zzso of zzso zzso among three groups zzso zzso zzso 

The extreme altitude and areas of the zzso zzso gradually diminished when the disc are differently zzso But there was not significant correlation to zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso height and area of zzso zzso should result in root zzso
