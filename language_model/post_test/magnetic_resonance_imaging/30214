The frequent zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso alpha zzso gene has been associated with some zzso zzso risk such as Alzheimer's disease zzso or cognitive zzso In the present study, we explored whether the zzso zzso leads to different gray matter volumes using zzso zzso zzso on 20 magnetic resonance images of healthy zzso zzso zzso carrying the less common zzso zzso were contrasted to zzso in groups well balanced by relevant zzso zzso The zzso zzso carriers displayed clusters ranging from 9 to zzso of tissue reductions in the zzso zzso size, zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso 14, zzso zzso and cerebral cortex, in particular in the zzso lobe zzso zzso zzso zzso in the middle frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso 38, 12, zzso and in the middle zzso zzso while the opposite comparison was zzso The zzso zzso in zzso gene is associated to smaller gray matter volumes of the cerebral and zzso zzso This zzso might increase the zzso for senile neurodegenerative conditions, being associated to smaller cerebral zzso
