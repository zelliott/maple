zzso and zzso have a low zzso of zzso side effects at clinically effective doses, which appears to be related to their significantly lower occupancy of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso compared to typical antipsychotic drugs zzso Animal studies have indicated that zzso and zzso produce selective effects on cortical and zzso regions of the brain and in particular on zzso zzso in these zzso Previous PET and zzso studies have reported conflicting results regarding whether zzso produces preferential occupancy of cortical zzso zzso To examine whether zzso and/or zzso produce preferential occupancy of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso regions, we studied the occupancy of zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso zzso using PET with zzso in six schizophrenic subjects receiving zzso zzso and in seven schizophrenic subjects receiving zzso zzso zzso were chosen clinically to minimize zzso at tolerable levels of side effects such as zzso All had minimal positive symptoms at the time of the zzso Regional zzso zzso were estimated using mean regional zzso zzso levels calculated for 10 zzso schizophrenic zzso Both zzso and zzso produced lower levels of zzso zzso zzso occupancy than those reported for typical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced preferential occupancy of zzso cortical vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso and significantly lower levels of occupancy in the zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso zzso also produced preferential occupancy of zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple zzso but did not spare occupancy of zzso zzso zzso zzso The therapeutic effects of zzso and zzso appear to be achieved at less than the zzso threshold for occupancy seen with typical zzso consistent with the involvement of zzso zzso mechanisms in at least partially zzso the therapeutic effects of these zzso zzso occupancy of cortical zzso zzso sparing occupancy of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso actions may contribute to the antipsychotic actions of these and other zzso zzso
