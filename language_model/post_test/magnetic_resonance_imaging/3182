To determine whether zzso regional wall deformation and motion, which may be used as an index of mechanical function, change with surgical intervention in patients with a functional single zzso a zzso magnetic resonance tagging technique was used to examine 33 such patients at all stages of zzso zzso The zzso motion of the intersection points was tracked to determine regional twist and zzso zzso zzso strain analysis was applied to the grid lines, and principal E1 strains were zzso The results were as zzso 1) zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso groups had the highest zzso zzso and regional zzso of strain was least in the zzso zzso 2) zzso patients had zzso strain different from the other surgical zzso as well as the normal left zzso while the zzso and zzso groups had zzso zzso strain different from zzso patients and normal zzso 3) zzso single left zzso had a different strain distribution across wall regions and surgical zzso from functional single right zzso 4) zzso to the normal human adult studied by the same method, which twists zzso counterclockwise, 31 of 33 single zzso regardless of zzso zzso or surgical zzso twisted zzso in one region, zzso in another, and met at a zzso zzso of no twist, which had the highest strains of all zzso 5) zzso contraction was greatest in the superior walls and least at the inferior walls of zzso patients regardless of zzso In the zzso group, the inferior walls moved zzso In conclusion, markedly different strain characteristics are noted at each stage of zzso zzso across various wall regions, and between zzso zzso zzso zzso in regional wall motion were demonstrated in functional single zzso throughout zzso reconstruction regardless of zzso and differences in associated strains and zzso contraction were noted across various wall regions and surgical zzso These may play an important role in the zzso of the heart and the long-term viability of the single zzso
