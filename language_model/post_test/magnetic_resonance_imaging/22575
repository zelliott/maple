zzso with the same genetic disorder often show remarkable differences in clinical severity, a finding generally attributed to the genetic zzso We identified two patients with genetically proven zzso muscular zzso zzso who followed an unusual course and had uncommon zzso zzso We hypothesized zzso inheritance and looked for additional molecular zzso zzso in additional separate genes were identified in both zzso The first patient was a member of a family with zzso proven zzso zzso However, the clinical features were unusually severe for this condition in the zzso he presented at zzso years with severe zzso weakness and markedly elevated serum zzso zzso Muscle weakness rapidly zzso leading to loss of independent zzso by the age of zzso In addition, the patient developed cardiac zzso system disease requiring pacing at the age of 11 and severe zzso zzso in the early zzso Despite zzso he had several zzso episodes attributed to zzso zzso As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the zzso dominant zzso of zzso we examined the zzso zzso zzso identifying a zzso zzso in the zzso The second patient had a zzso zzso similar to his mother who had died more than 20 years zzso Because of the dominant family history, a zzso was suspected and a zzso in zzso 11 of the zzso gene was zzso This zzso however, was not present in his mother, but instead, surprisingly, was identified in his virtually zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso found in the cardiac muscle of the zzso prompted us to examine the zzso gene in this patient, and in so doing, we identified a zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso in the zzso These cases suggest that separate zzso in related proteins that are believed to zzso or that represent different parts of a presumed functional pathway, may zzso contribute to disease severity in zzso dominant zzso Furthermore, zzso inheritance may well contribute to the clinical severity of many other zzso zzso
