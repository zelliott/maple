We examined fluctuations in zzso power zzso of local field potential zzso signals recorded from multiple zzso in visual zzso of the monkey during different behavioral zzso We asked whether such signals demonstrated coherent fluctuations over zzso of seconds and minutes, and would thus serve as good candidates for direct comparison with data obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We obtained the following zzso zzso The zzso of the local field displayed fluctuations at many zzso with particularly large zzso at very low zzso zzso zzso zzso These fluctuations exhibited high zzso between zzso pairs, particularly for zzso signals derived from the gamma frequency zzso zzso zzso in the zzso unlike that in the raw zzso did not fall off sharply as a function of cortical zzso zzso The structure and zzso of zzso changes were highly similar under distinctly different behavioral zzso These results demonstrate the existence of widespread coherent activity fluctuations in the brain of the awake monkey over very long zzso We propose that such signals may make a significant contribution to the high zzso observed in the time course of zzso signals, including those measured with functional imaging zzso The results are discussed in the context of combined zzso zzso
