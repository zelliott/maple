A theoretical analysis of the effects of diffusion and zzso in zzso free zzso zzso imaging sequences zzso to zzso incoherent motions by magnetic field zzso is presented and supported by phantom zzso The capability of such sequences to image diffusion and zzso quickly was recently zzso The possible residual effects of zzso and zzso in diffusion zzso are zzso as are the effects of the sequence design and the acquisition parameters zzso time, flip angle, zzso zzso It is shown theoretically and confirmed by experiments on zzso that diffusion zzso can be directly measured from zzso images when large enough diffusion zzso zzso are zzso
