A common type of phantom used for the study of flow effects in MR imaging is the tube zzso where a liquid passes through a set of tubes placed in the main magnetic field of an MR zzso Among the disadvantages with this type of phantom are that a distribution of zzso is present in each tube, and that zzso of flow effects using tube zzso may be very zzso In this work, we describe the design and the properties of a rotating wheel flow phantom used for zzso of the effects of flow through the imaging plane as well as in the imaging zzso The proposed phantom is constructed as a rotating zzso wheel, surrounded by zzso volumes filled with the same zzso and the evaluation of the information from rotating and zzso parts is made with a specially designed computer zzso The phantom can be used as a plug flow phantom covering simultaneously an interchangeable zzso zzso which at present has the range zzso zzso zzso zzso It is shown that the phantom gives adequate information on the dependence of zzso content on zzso motion in MR zzso and phase zzso Among the fields of application are rapid zzso of MR imaging units for flow determination using phase information, as well as testing of pulse sequence characteristics and zzso of theoretical predictions concerning the flow dependence in MR zzso
