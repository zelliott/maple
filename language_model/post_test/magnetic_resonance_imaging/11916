In this work, zzso methods were zzso to zzso the field produced by the zzso electromagnetic zzso zzso in the presence of the human head at 8 zzso zzso was achieved through the use of the classical finite difference time domain zzso method and a zzso zzso loaded with an zzso detailed human head model with a resolution of 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso The head model was developed from zzso MR zzso To account for the electromagnetic interactions between the zzso and the zzso the zzso and the head were treated as a single system at all the steps of the model including, zzso tuning and zzso In addition to 2, 3, 4, 6, and zzso zzso an antenna array concept was zzso by driving all the possible ports zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The results show that significant improvement in the zzso polarized component of the zzso magnetic field could be obtained when using multiple ports and variable phase and fixed zzso or variable phase and variable magnitude zzso
