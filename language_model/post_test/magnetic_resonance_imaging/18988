Two zzso techniques are used to calculate the effect of large vessel zzso flow on zzso temperature zzso One is based on the zzso equation for zzso flow, and the second employs a zzso boundary condition at the interface of the vessel zzso zzso temperature fields were calculated for two energy zzso rate zzso zzso in a zzso tissue model having two pairs of zzso vessels (one pair with equal diameter vessels and another pair with unequal zzso The first assumed a uniform zzso throughout zzso the second zzso was calculated for a tissue cylinder inside an existing four antenna zzso zzso zzso A tissue equivalent phantom was constructed to verify the zzso zzso Temperatures induced with the zzso array were measured using a zzso magnetic resonance imaging technique based on the chemical shift of zzso Temperatures calculated using the two zzso techniques are in good agreement with the measured zzso The results show: 1) the zzso boundary condition technique reduces zzso time by a factor of ten when compared to the fully zzso method with little quantitative difference zzso zzso degree zzso in the zzso accuracy and 2) the use of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso to zzso access the temperature zzso near large vessels is feasible using the chemical shift zzso
