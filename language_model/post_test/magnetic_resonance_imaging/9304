The objective of our study was to determine whether the combination of zzso spots zzso zzso zzso with a zzso is associated with the risk of zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso 

We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans acquired within 6 hours after symptom onset from 100 zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso and fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso was performed before zzso in all zzso zzso zzso imaging was rated by two independent observers for the presence of zzso smaller than 5 zzso White matter changes were evaluated using an adapted scale of zzso and zzso zzso was defined in follow-up zzso 

A zzso was observed in seven per 100 zzso zzso were detected by observer 1 in 22 and observer 2 in 20 zzso We found a very low sensitivity zzso for prediction of zzso by the presence of zzso We found a zzso increase in the rate of zzso when the zzso zzso in zzso was larger than a thin zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso observers 1 and 2) and specificity was substantial zzso and zzso Using the combination of a zzso matter zzso zzso and the presence of zzso did not improve the prediction of zzso 

A marked zzso zzso in zzso imaging seems to be associated with a substantially increased risk of zzso A combination of zzso with zzso scores did not appear to be beneficial for zzso
