We used functional zzso zzso to determine the cortical regions activated during processing of visual object shape in humans in six men and three women, using a paradigm with a baseline condition of simple shape detection and an activated condition of zzso shape zzso Eight of the nine subjects studied showed significant signal zzso Seven of eight showed changes in the zzso zzso (five zzso two right only, one left zzso All eight subjects with signal changes exhibited changes in the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso there were signal changes zzso in seven subjects and unilaterally, on the right, in zzso zzso zzso signal increases were also present in the zzso superior and middle zzso zzso in seven of the subjects, with four showing bilateral signal changes, two showing signal changes on the left only, and one only on the zzso The data strongly suggest that processing of object shape information in humans activates both the zzso and zzso visual processing pathways zzso and zzso zzso described previously both in humans and in nonhuman zzso
