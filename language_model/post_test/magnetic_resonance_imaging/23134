Although variations of response time zzso within a particular experimental condition are typically ignored, they may sometimes reflect meaningful changes in the efficiency of cognitive and neural zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso variations of response time zzso in a zzso selective attention task were associated with variations of functional connectivity between brain regions that are thought to zzso zzso Sixteen healthy young adults performed an audiovisual selective attention task, which involved attending to a relevant visual letter while ignoring an irrelevant auditory letter, as we recorded their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso In line with predictions, variations of zzso were associated with variations of functional connectivity between the anterior zzso zzso and various other brain regions that are zzso to zzso zzso control, such as the right zzso prefrontal zzso and bilateral regions of the zzso zzso zzso They were also linked to variations of functional connectivity between zzso early and zzso late regions of the zzso visual zzso whose communication is thought to be modulated by zzso control zzso By revealing that variations of zzso in a selective attention task are linked to variations of functional connectivity in the zzso network, the present findings suggest that variations of attention may contribute to zzso fluctuations of behavioral zzso
