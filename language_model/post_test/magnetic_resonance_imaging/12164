The diagnosis of spine zzso is a problem of great interest which leaves many questions zzso In this field MR imaging plays a fundamental role, as the only technique able to directly demonstrate the changes in bone zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso The introduction of zzso zzso sequences has helped reduce examination zzso Moreover, with the accurate choice of zzso parameters zzso zzso flip zzso additional information is acquired which is not yielded by conventional zzso zzso zzso Our study was aimed at evaluating MR sensitivity in the different stages of bone zzso zzso The comparative zzso was evaluated of combined bone zzso and conventional zzso versus MR imaging in 62 patients with zzso zzso Time zzso between bone scan and/or zzso study and MR exam ranged from 10 days to 8 zzso zzso and GE zzso images, and zzso and GE zzso images on the zzso plane were zzso and zzso zzso zzso images were rarely zzso zzso were demonstrated by MR imaging at 122 zzso levels, versus 88 true zzso of combined zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso were observed at 15 zzso levels, versus 9 with zzso GE sequences were superior to zzso ones in detecting zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso involvement thanks to their improved resolution and zzso Moreover, GE sequences demonstrated zzso bone zzso spread and persistent zzso activity in the follow-up of spine zzso Our results point to GE sequences as those of choice because of their higher resolution and sensitivity, which also allow response to treatment to be zzso
