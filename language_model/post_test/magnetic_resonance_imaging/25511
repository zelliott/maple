The practice of zzso three zzso treatment planning and zzso zzso techniques give the opportunity to elaborate optimal treatment forms for primary brain zzso 

The authors examined the effect of two novel dose escalation methods on zzso zzso 

In nine cases they treated zzso zzso with single zzso boost of zzso zzso dose following the conventional zzso 60 zzso external beam zzso In zzso patients with zzso zzso an zzso zzso regimen with zzso zzso daily and 60 zzso total dose was zzso All the treatments were carried out with zzso zzso zzso 

Majority of patients endured treatments without neurological zzso zzso zzso was noticed in one and two cases, zzso The median survival times zzso were found to be 17 months zzso zzso and 12 months zzso zzso in the two groups, zzso With respect to all patients, the zzso was 13 months, while this value in the conventional treatment is generally considered to be zzso zzso All the three patients who survived more than 18 months was treated with zzso chemotherapy as zzso 

Based on own experience and current knowledge of authors, it seems reasonable to apply higher biological dose focal zzso and chemotherapy in case of zzso patients with better zzso To define the optimal treatment regimens zzso clinical trials should be zzso
