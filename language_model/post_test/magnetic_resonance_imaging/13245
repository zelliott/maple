zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is a technology that enables the characterization of multiple physical phenomena in living and engineered zzso The mechanical function of engineered zzso is a primary zzso for the successful zzso of many biological zzso such as zzso cartilage, spine and zzso Here we demonstrate the application of zzso to characterize the mechanical function of engineered zzso Phase zzso methods were demonstrated to characterize detailed deformation fields throughout the interior of native and engineered zzso using an zzso cartilage zzso model as a study zzso zzso techniques revealed that strain fields varied zzso depending on spatial zzso zzso were highest in the tissue zzso compared to surrounding native zzso zzso surface geometry corresponded to strain fields observed within the tissue interior near the zzso zzso fields were further evaluated with respect to the spatial variation in the concentration of zzso zzso critical zzso in the zzso zzso of cartilage, as determined by zzso zzso zzso also varied zzso depending on spatial position and was lowest in the tissue zzso compared to the surrounding zzso The use of multiple zzso techniques to assess tissue mechanical function provides complementary data and suggests that deformation is related to tissue zzso underlying zzso zzso constituents and the lack of tissue integration in the model system zzso Specialized and advanced zzso phase zzso methods are valuable for the detailed characterization and evaluation of mechanical function of zzso zzso
