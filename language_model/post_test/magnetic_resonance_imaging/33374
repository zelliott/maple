Recent reports have shown an increase in specific binding (in zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso receptors in both experimental animals and humans, reflecting a zzso reaction within and around focal zzso zzso We have evaluated by zzso zzso zzso the time course of changes in brain zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso of central zzso zzso as indirect and direct markers of zzso loss, respectively, after focal cerebral zzso 

Ten zzso zzso were submitted to sequential zzso zzso zzso studies between day 1 and day 91 after unilateral middle cerebral artery zzso The studies consisted of successive zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso session, of zzso zzso zzso cerebral blood flow, and oxygen zzso late zzso zzso scans were obtained to map the approximate contours of zzso and to define a concentric zzso zzso 

We found a significant zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso area, maximum at 20 to 40 days after zzso In contrast, there was a zzso and zzso significant decrease in zzso zzso in the zzso area, stable from day 2 zzso and already present in one zzso at day zzso Challenge studies with zzso doses of cold zzso confirmed that these changes represented zzso in specific zzso zzso zzso was not affected in zzso (but apparently zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso 

The delayed and apparently transient increases in zzso zzso specific zzso in zzso presumably represent zzso zzso the marked depression in zzso specific zzso which appears selective for synaptic damage, is both precocious and sustained and thus may be better suited for the early assessment of zzso damage in zzso
