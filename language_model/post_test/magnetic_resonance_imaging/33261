zzso resonance zzso zzso plays an important role in the understanding of membrane and energy zzso The outcome of MRS experiments helps to derive important cellular conditions zzso zzso zzso energy, membrane zzso zzso which are directly related to zzso zzso We present a novel zzso zzso MRS imaging experimental scheme along with an advanced zzso signal processing technique to determine the pH and zzso from both zzso areas in shorter time zzso zzso for subjects zzso healthy young zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease of zzso zzso and increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the left zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso 6) compared to the control subjects zzso zzso zzso were found based on zzso zzso On the other hand, in the right zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso were significant between zzso patients and zzso In case of zzso subjects, pH in the left zzso is increased towards alkaline side compared to zzso but did not reach statistical significance zzso The pH zzso zzso in zzso is found to be zzso correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with zzso level zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the left zzso the increase in pH to alkaline range (in normal aging, pH is decreased to zzso zzso along with statistically significant increments of zzso zzso and zzso as well as decrease of zzso in zzso subjects provide extremely crucial clinical information, which can be used as zzso for zzso and potentially aid in the zzso
