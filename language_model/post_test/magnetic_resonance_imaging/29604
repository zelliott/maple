To evaluate the therapeutic efficiency and adverse effects of zzso zzso beam treatment of cerebral zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-six patients treated in zzso during zzso were included zzso zzso 14, women zzso 12; mean age zzso 39, range zzso zzso The zzso volumes ranged from zzso to 102 zzso zzso zzso 24, median zzso zzso The follow-up included clinical zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso every zzso months for 3 years and final zzso 

The volume changes at final follow-up in zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 0, 0, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 0 zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two patients were lost to follow-up due to cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed significant zzso zzso in one patient and slight zzso in four zzso Of nine patients with zzso seven became zzso after therapy while two continued to suffer from zzso 

zzso beam zzso is successful in a relatively high proportion of intermediate and zzso cerebral zzso The adverse effects are zzso The advantage of zzso treatment compared with gamma knife and zzso zzso zzso is that zzso can irradiate even large volumes with a very sharp dose profile against normal zzso Thus, zzso beam zzso is a valuable option in the treatment of zzso larger than 10 zzso
