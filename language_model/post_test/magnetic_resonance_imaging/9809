In this study, the potential contribution of zzso MR imaging with a rapid zzso zzso zzso which is a technique used for zzso zzso correction zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for anatomical correlation of zzso zzso on a zzso clinical scanner compared to zzso zzso This technique is also used in a recently installed fully integrated zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients routinely scheduled for zzso staging underwent zzso zzso zzso and a 2-point Dixon 3-D zzso zzso zzso examination zzso zzso MR sequence on the same zzso Two PET data sets reconstructed using zzso maps from zzso CT zzso or simulated zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for focal zzso zzso The certainty for the correlation with anatomical structures was judged in the zzso CT and zzso zzso on a 4-point scale zzso In addition, the standardized zzso values zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso no significant difference could be found concerning anatomical zzso for all 81 zzso zzso in zzso CT compared to zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso CT tended to be superior for small zzso zzso bone zzso and pulmonary zzso while zzso MR proved advantageous for soft tissue zzso like zzso zzso and liver zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a nearly complete zzso with a highly significant correlation was found zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging for MR zzso allows for anatomical allocation of zzso zzso similar to zzso CT in conventional zzso Thus, this approach appears to be useful for future zzso for body regions not fully covered by diagnostic zzso due to potential time zzso
