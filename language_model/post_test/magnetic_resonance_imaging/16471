zzso impairment is a major concern in zzso lobe zzso zzso While different experimental models have been used to characterize zzso cognitive deficits, little is known on whether a particular deficit is more associated with the underlying brain injuries than with the zzso condition per zzso Here, we look at the relationship between the pattern of brain damage and spatial memory deficits in two chronic models of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, zzso from two different rat strains zzso and zzso using the Morris water maze and the elevated plus maze in combination with zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso We found fundamental differences between zzso and zzso zzso rats regarding spatial memory deficits and zzso zzso animals from both strains showed significant impairment in the acquisition and retention of spatial memory, and were unable to learn a cued version of the zzso In contrast, zzso rats were differently zzso zzso zzso rats learned less efficiently than zzso zzso animals, which performed similar to control rats in the acquisition and in a probe trial testing for spatial zzso Different anxiety levels and the extension of brain zzso affecting the zzso and the zzso zzso with spatial memory deficits observed in zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso spatial memory is not necessarily affected in zzso and that zzso between spatial deficits and anxiety is more related with the underlying brain zzso than with the zzso condition per zzso
