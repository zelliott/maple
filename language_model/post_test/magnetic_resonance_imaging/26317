A major obstacle to using zzso MR contrast agents for in zzso cell tracking or molecular sensing is their generally low cellular zzso In this study, we show that a zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso is efficiently zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso were attained that were readily zzso by MR imaging using both zzso and zzso zzso Using this zzso it should be feasible to zzso a variety of chemically different agents into zzso zzso
