We examined the usefulness of zzso in zzso zzso zzso tissue from the residual zzso Ten consecutive patients who underwent MR imaging before and after radiation therapy were assessed zzso zzso and zzso images using a zzso unit were obtained in 10 patients (3 zzso 6 zzso 1 zzso at 1 week before zzso and 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and every 6 months thereafter following completion of zzso Although all zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated high signal intensity compared to muscle on zzso images, the zzso zzso could be demonstrated in only one of three zzso Six patients in whom the primary zzso clinically disappeared demonstrated low signal intensity on zzso images until 4 months after completion of radiation therapy zzso 1 week to 4 zzso This study suggests that zzso can detect primary zzso larger than zzso (2 zzso and may be useful in assessing the effectiveness of therapy for tongue zzso
