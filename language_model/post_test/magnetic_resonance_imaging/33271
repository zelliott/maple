zzso zzso imaging zzso detects zzso changes of the cerebral white matter in Alzheimer's disease zzso The use of zzso for the diagnosis of zzso in a zzso setting has not yet been zzso We used zzso analysis of fractional zzso mean zzso and zzso matter volumes from zzso magnetic resonance imaging data of 137 zzso patients and 143 healthy elderly controls collected across 9 different zzso We compared different zzso analysis approaches to model the effect of zzso including a linear model across all scans with a scanner zzso a random effects model with scanner as a random variable as well as a zzso zzso We found significant reduction of fractional zzso and significant increase of mean zzso in core areas of zzso pathology including corpus zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and prefrontal lobe white zzso Grey matter zzso was most pronounced in zzso and lateral zzso lobe as well as zzso and prefrontal association zzso The effects of group were zzso more restricted with random effects modeling of scanner effects compared to simple pooled zzso All three analysis approaches yielded similar accuracy of group separation in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest similar effects of center on group separation based on different analysis approaches and confirm a typical pattern of cortical and zzso zzso changes in zzso using a large zzso zzso data zzso
