The goal of this study was to determine if clinically relevant zzso were changed by improved zzso resolution during zzso treatment zzso 

Between 2003 and 2008, 200 consecutive patients with brain zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso using either zzso or zzso zzso for zzso treatment planning were zzso zzso The number of previously zzso zzso at time of zzso distant brain failures, time delay to whole brain zzso zzso overall survival and likelihood of neurological death were zzso 

Additional zzso were detected in zzso and zzso of patients at time of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso Patients with multiple zzso at diagnostic scan were more likely to have additional zzso detected by zzso zzso zzso Median time to distant brain failure was zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso Median time to zzso was zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso Median survival was zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso cohort zzso zzso of neurological death was zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso 

The zzso zzso treatment planning for zzso did not appear to affect the likelihood of distant brain failure, the need for zzso or the likelihood of neurological death in this zzso
