Single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging has been considered a reference method for zzso zzso of zzso size in zzso Recently, delayed zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso has evolved as an accurate tool to zzso zzso zzso zzso the present study was designed to compare zzso zzso size by zzso to zzso volume by zzso 

zzso was performed in 30 zzso Fourteen were patients with zzso first-time acute zzso eight zzso chronic zzso and eight clinically referred zzso zzso zzso was performed in the same patients and zzso by a commercial zzso 

The zzso volume by zzso was larger than the zzso volume by zzso by 8 zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso 5 percentage points), 10 zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso 11 percentage points), and 26 zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso 10 percentage points) in the zzso chronic and clinical zzso zzso Left zzso wall volume was smaller by zzso in all zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso size was comparable with but generally slightly larger than the zzso volume by zzso in both absolute and relative terms in patients with acute and chronic zzso The results may be related to systematic differences between zzso but could also be influenced by biological phenomena such as wall thinning or zzso but viable zzso
