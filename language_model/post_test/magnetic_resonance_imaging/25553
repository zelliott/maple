zzso zzso is typically caused by zzso disc zzso or zzso zzso zzso either of which may compress the zzso aspect of the nerve zzso The authors undertook a study to establish the feasibility of performing an zzso approach for anterior cervical zzso zzso in a clinical zzso 

Application of this method on zzso was conducted to verify the zzso of this zzso The clinical study included 16 patients zzso men and eight zzso mean age zzso zzso all presenting with unilateral zzso symptoms (one at two adjacent zzso zzso which were associated with various degrees of neck zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso were confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution computerized zzso zzso A total of 17 zzso zzso (one zzso zzso were performed using a rigid glass zzso zzso degrees angled, zzso diameter, zzso zzso mounted on a zzso zzso No major zzso complications were zzso During a mean follow-up period of zzso months an average absolute improvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the neck disability index score and of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the visual analog scale score for zzso pain zzso with the zzso zzso was zzso During the follow-up period strength improved to normal in zzso and sensory deficit in zzso of the zzso The overall zzso patient satisfaction rate was zzso the zzso rate after 4 weeks was zzso 

The advantages of zzso zzso include zzso surgical exposure, improved zzso zzso direct zzso of the nerve zzso and the preservation of the zzso disc and the motion zzso
