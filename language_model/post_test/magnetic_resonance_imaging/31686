While mainstream economic models assume that individuals treat probabilities zzso many people tend to overestimate the likelihood of improbable events and underestimate the likelihood of probable zzso However, a biological account for why probabilities would be treated this way does not yet zzso While undergoing zzso we presented individuals with a series of zzso defined by the zzso of an impending zzso electric shock and the probability with which the shock would be zzso During the prospect phase, neural activity that tracked the probability of the expected outcome was observed in a circumscribed network of brain regions that included the anterior cingulate, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of these regions displayed responses to probabilities consistent with zzso probability zzso The neural responses to passive zzso predicted zzso of subsequent decisions when individuals were offered choices between different zzso and exceeded that predicted by behavior alone near the indifference zzso
