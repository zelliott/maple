The relationship between the zzso E zzso zzso zzso and factors associated with vascular cognitive impairment zzso is zzso We aimed to examine the effects of zzso on brain zzso beta using zzso compound B zzso and zzso cerebrovascular disease, as assessed by zzso and white matter zzso zzso in zzso VCI zzso zzso We recruited 230 subjects with normal zzso 111 subjects with cognitive impairment due to clinically defined Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso subjects with clinically defined zzso A zzso retention ratio greater than zzso was considered to be zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to investigate whether zzso increased the risk for each cognitive impairment zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis was performed to investigate whether zzso was associated with brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not increase the risk of zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso increased the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso was positively associated with zzso retention ratio, whereas zzso was not associated with the number of zzso or with zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso beta burden can occur in patients with and without zzso cerebrovascular disease, and that it is associated with zzso However zzso might be independent of zzso cerebrovascular zzso
