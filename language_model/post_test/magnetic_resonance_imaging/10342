The aim of this study was to determine whether a new zzso staging system for zzso of the knee in pediatric patients could be used with an acceptable level of zzso and zzso zzso 

We conducted a retrospective analysis of zzso studies of the knee performed in a single institution between April 1994 and July zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso children with a primary diagnosis of zzso zzso This substantial number prompted us to design a staging system for use with pediatric zzso To assess zzso reliability of two primary observers in using the system, they reviewed and interpreted the same 36 imaging studies of randomly chosen zzso For the assessment of zzso zzso each observer zzso 16 zzso A senior observer coded potential causes of disagreement between the primary zzso 

zzso agreement was substantial: the zzso value was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in locations where the observers had to record only the presence or absence of a zzso and the weighted zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso in locations where they had to zzso the extent of zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of altered zzso and zzso zzso changes was associated with a higher level of disagreement between the primary zzso 

Our proposed zzso system, developed specifically for use with zzso was used with substantial zzso and zzso zzso We think its use can contribute to a standardized approach to the interpretation of zzso findings in pediatric zzso of the zzso
