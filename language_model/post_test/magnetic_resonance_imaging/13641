The aim of this study was to compare the zzso method for zzso of zzso volume on MR images with manually outlining method in inflammatory joint zzso As manual outlining of the zzso volume is too time-consuming a method for clinical use, a less time-consuming methods are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images of the finger zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired from 11 patients with zzso arthritis ( zzso and zzso arthritis ( zzso zzso outlined volume was taken as a gold standard and compared with zzso volume zzso on zzso zzso zzso The mathematical basis of the zzso volume zzso is based on a zzso zzso a zzso zzso is used for zzso of the area of the zzso membrane on an MR slice and unbiased estimates of volumes are obtained by zzso zzso The zzso zzso estimates the area of any object irrespective of its size, shape, and orientation by measuring the distance between a zzso zzso in the object and the zzso between the object boundary and radiating test zzso The total volume of 154 finger zzso was zzso A significant correlation between manual and zzso zzso of zzso volumes was found zzso zzso zzso zzso percent limits of agreement were zzso 5-6 zzso zzso finger zzso per zzso The time used for volume determination in a patient varied from 1 to zzso h by manual outlining and from zzso to 1 h by zzso zzso zzso volume zzso can provide measures of zzso volumes comparable to the manual outlining method and is less zzso zzso volume zzso seems to be a clinically useful method, especially if it is integrated in the MR unit's zzso
