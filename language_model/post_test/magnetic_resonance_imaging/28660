The purpose of this paper is to review the use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the fetus and to propose future techniques and zzso Institutional review board approved MR images of the fetus were acquired in 66 patients with zzso suspected fetal zzso zzso zzso and zzso short zzso short TE images were zzso In addition, 12 studies were performed with rapid scans requiring zzso zzso using either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrating fetal motion were also zzso Three studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso These allowed for zzso and zzso zzso views and zzso zzso zzso fetal structures were shown with zzso including brain, heart, liver, stomach, zzso and zzso Gross fetal anomalies could generally be demonstrated with zzso zzso may give additional information to that of zzso in fetal anomalies, particularly those involving the central nervous system, and in the detection of fat, blood, and zzso zzso of the fetus can demonstrate normal and abnormal zzso Newer techniques with faster imaging will allow for greater possibility of computer assisted manipulation of zzso
