Unlike the more commonly noted zzso zzso zzso zzso which are well known to result in zzso nerve zzso only four cases of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Because of their zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been poorly understood and a zzso explanation has not been zzso In view of the growing literature demonstrating strong associations between zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathology, joint connections, and joint communications, the authors zzso reviewed the magnetic resonance zzso imaging studies and zzso results in the two featured patients to test a hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso would have analogous zzso 

Two patients who presented with zzso zzso were found to have zzso zzso zzso to the zzso joint could be established in both patients through zzso zzso complex zzso In neither patient was the joint connection identified preoperatively or zzso and zzso zzso was performed by itself without attention to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso extended from the zzso joint as far zzso as the level of the zzso origin from the upper trunk in the zzso zzso Although both patients experienced symptomatic improvement after surgery, neurological recovery was zzso In both cases, zzso MR images revealed zzso zzso In addition, previously zzso superior zzso zzso zzso Type II zzso zzso of the superior zzso extending zzso and involving the biceps anchor at the zzso without actual extension into the zzso were zzso In one patient with a persistent cyst, an MR zzso was obtained and demonstrated a communication between the joint and the zzso 

The findings in these two patients support the zzso theory for zzso zzso Based on their experience with zzso zzso at other sites, the authors believe that zzso zzso zzso arise from the zzso joint, zzso through a superior zzso zzso zzso and dissect within the zzso along an zzso branch into the main zzso following the path of least zzso Furthermore, these two cases of zzso zzso with SLAP zzso are directly analogous to the many cases of zzso zzso associated with these types of zzso zzso By better understanding the origin of this unusual type of zzso and drawing analogies to the more common zzso zzso surgical strategies can be formulated to address the underlying zzso improve operative zzso and prevent zzso
