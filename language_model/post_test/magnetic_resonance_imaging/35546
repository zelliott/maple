The issue of zzso currents induced by the rapid switching of magnetic field zzso is a long-standing zzso A new method for dealing with this problem is presented zzso spatial harmonic components of the magnetic field are continuously zzso through their zzso rates of change, and zzso In this way, the effects of the zzso currents on the magnetic field can be detected and correction currents applied to the appropriate zzso or zzso coils in a time much less than the rise time of the zzso This new methodology has the potential to zzso shape zzso current corrections for multiple spatial harmonic components of the zzso
