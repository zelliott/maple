Although zzso remain zzso to treatment, it is not clear whether this characteristic is fixed at the time of its origin or develops zzso The authors have been using a model of zzso to determine whether a time exists during a zzso evolution during which it is zzso but still zzso thus providing a justification for exploring the clinical merits of an early detection and treatment zzso The authors recently reported the presence of 2 distinct cellular subsets, 1 expressing zzso and the other both zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso within all examined zzso that developed after in zzso exposure to zzso 

In this study, the authors used magnetic resonance zzso imaging to assess when these 2 zzso appeared during zzso zzso 

Using zzso and zzso MR imaging, the authors observed that zzso grew zzso once detected at rates that were zzso Despite large differences in growth rates, however, they determined by zzso zzso with imaging in a second series of animals, that all zzso initially detected on zzso images contained both zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso containing only zzso cells, which appeared on average 40 days before detection on MR images, were not zzso 

The sequential appearance of first the zzso cells followed several weeks later by those expressing zzso suggests that all zzso arise through common early steps in this zzso Furthermore, the authors zzso that the expression of zzso a zzso associated with cancer zzso at the time of zzso detection signals a time during zzso development when the zzso becomes zzso to zzso
