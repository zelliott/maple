zzso multiple magnetic field zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear magnetic relaxation zzso zzso measurement techniques have been applied to zzso 17, a new zzso contrast agent for magnetic resonance zzso The zzso bears 24 zzso zzso zzso attached to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data were zzso simultaneously by incorporating the zzso approach for the description of zzso zzso The water exchange rate zzso found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a value similar to those measured for other zzso complexes, and the zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The internal flexibility of the zzso is zzso by the zzso order zzso zzso and a local zzso correlation time zzso 760 zzso whereas the global zzso correlation time of the zzso is much longer, zzso zzso The analysis of zzso zzso reveals that, beside slow water exchange, internal flexibility is an important limiting factor for imaging magnetic zzso Electronic relaxation, though faster than in similar, but zzso zzso zzso does not limit zzso zzso of this contrast agent zzso at zzso K and 20 zzso This analysis provides direct clues for the design of zzso contrast zzso
