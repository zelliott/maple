To evaluate the value of zzso zzso on zzso for predicting local recurrence in zzso zzso 

Between November 1988 and February 1997, 48 patients with zzso were examined with both zzso zzso zzso and CT prior to radiation zzso T zzso (1987 zzso based on physical examination and CT findings were zzso in 3 cases, zzso in 22, zzso in 9, and T4 in zzso On zzso zzso tissue with zzso enhancement in the zzso of the skull was considered to be a suspicious finding of zzso zzso CT simulation was performed in all zzso The total dose to the primary tumor was zzso zzso zzso 67 zzso The mean follow-up period was 42 zzso 

All 14 T4 patients had abnormal tissue in the zzso of the skull base on zzso zzso percent (13 of 34) of zzso patients were suspected to have zzso invasion based on zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso The zzso local control rate was significantly different between zzso and T4 tumors zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but was not different by the presence of the zzso zzso in the skull zzso 

zzso invasion suspected solely by zzso does not relate to local recurrence provided that careful treatment planning is performed with the aid of zzso and CT zzso
