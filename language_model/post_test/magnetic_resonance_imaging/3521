In this review, we zzso the recent advances in modern imaging, particularly zzso zzso zzso and its role in the selection and monitoring of patients on active zzso 

Current diagnostic zzso has some limitations in selecting patients with insignificant prostate cancer for active zzso zzso percentage of men under active surveillance for insignificant prostate cancer and reclassified as significant cancer at 2 years is zzso It is mainly because of anterior cancer zzso by systematic zzso zzso zzso is accurate for significant cancer detection and staging, including anterior zzso which represent zzso of zzso in an zzso population of men with suspicious zzso zzso zzso One way to reduce the risk of zzso is to target the needle on significant cancer identified at zzso anatomical and functional imaging, so that detection and personalized risk zzso can be zzso zzso reveals greater volume of zzso and higher grade than systematic zzso zzso zzso zzso negative zzso value has the potential to avoid biopsy series for monitoring patients under active zzso 

Upon confirmation of these results, zzso may be used to better select patients for active surveillance zzso zzso of zzso into active surveillance selection zzso for patients with low-risk prostate cancer can reduce the number of patients reclassified at subsequent zzso because of better initial prognosis zzso In addition to additional cost, zzso requires a highly skilled team to obtain information adequate to drive clinical zzso
