To evaluate differences in the serum zzso of cell zzso molecules zzso after zzso zzso and conventional open radical zzso for localized zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 62 patients with stage zzso zzso were zzso to either a zzso zzso radical zzso group zzso or an open group zzso zzso levels of soluble cluster of differentiation 44 zzso zzso 6 zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso were determined independently by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso and on zzso days 1 and zzso In addition, follow-up results were zzso 

On zzso day 1, zzso zzso and zzso levels increased significantly compared with zzso levels in both groups zzso zzso levels decreased compared with zzso levels in both groups without statistically significant differences zzso zzso levels in the zzso group were significantly higher than in the open group zzso while zzso zzso and zzso levels showed no statistically significant differences between both groups zzso On zzso day 5, all parameters in both groups were similar to zzso values zzso zzso ranged from 7 to 18 months zzso in all 62 patients, with a zzso zzso survival rate in each zzso 

Although zzso higher serum zzso of zzso in both groups and significantly elevated zzso in the zzso group may be zzso the differences in zzso between both groups are small and zzso Together with the similar follow-up results, this further supports previous studies that failed to show a difference in the zzso outcomes between open and zzso radical zzso and provides a probable molecular zzso
