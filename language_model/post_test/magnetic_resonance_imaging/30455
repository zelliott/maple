The objectives were to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso in predicting zzso invasion and disease stage in cases of zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso study in 100 sequential cases of zzso zzso referred to the Dorset Cancer Centre between January 1999 and July zzso The study included 100 women with zzso proven zzso zzso the mean age of the studied population being zzso years zzso The zzso zzso findings were compared with final surgical and zzso zzso the latter was taken as the gold zzso The main outcome measures were the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso for staging zzso zzso 

A total of 100 consecutive cases of zzso cancer were zzso of which 62 cases were classified as stage zzso zzso disease) by zzso zzso accurately predicted the degree of invasion in 54 cases and overestimated in 8, giving a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso In stage zzso disease the sensitivity and specificity of zzso were 56 and zzso zzso However, zzso showed significantly reduced sensitivity for predicting stage II zzso cancer at zzso but was found to be both sensitive and specific for predicting advanced zzso cancer zzso III and zzso the sensitivity and specificity were 100 and zzso zzso 

The accuracy of zzso scanning in predicting early and advanced zzso disease is very good, but there is reduced accuracy with stage zzso and stage II zzso zzso is a valuable imaging zzso in the zzso assessment of cases of zzso zzso
