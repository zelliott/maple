A pulse sequence that enables simultaneous acquisition of zzso and zzso images is zzso This sequence is referred to as zzso zzso zzso Combined with zzso zzso In this new technique, the inversion pulse of conventional fast zzso inversion recovery zzso is replaced with a fast spin echo zzso acquisition that has an additional zzso pulse train for driven zzso By using appropriate scan zzso the first part of the sequence provides zzso images and the second part provides zzso images, thus allowing simultaneous acquisition in a single scan time comparable to that of fast zzso zzso was compared with conventional scanning techniques using a normal volunteer and a zzso A signal simulation was also zzso In the human study, both zzso and zzso images from zzso showed the same image quality as conventional images, suggesting the potential for this technique to replace the combination of fast zzso and zzso zzso for scan time zzso
