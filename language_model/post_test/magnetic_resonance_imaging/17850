Progressive zzso zzso type 1 zzso is an zzso zzso inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by young onset age, zzso and zzso zzso zzso At the time of diagnosis, the visual assessment of the brain zzso is usually normal, with no major changes found zzso zzso we zzso texture analysis zzso to characterize and zzso the underlying properties of the affected brain tissue by means of zzso texture zzso Sixteen genetically verified patients with zzso and 16 healthy controls were included in the zzso zzso was performed upon zzso volumes of interest that were placed zzso in the thalamus, amygdala, zzso zzso nucleus and zzso Compared to the healthy controls, zzso patients had significant textural differences especially in the zzso and right zzso The most significantly differing texture features included parameters that measure the complexity and zzso of the zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and angular second moment, and also the zzso zzso parameters of zzso zzso short run emphasis and long run zzso This study demonstrates the zzso of zzso zzso for zzso additional information from MR zzso zzso zzso which suggest complex, coarse and zzso appearance were found zzso in the thalamus, supporting the previous literature on zzso pathology in zzso The observed zzso involvement is a novel zzso Our results encourage further studies on the clinical applications, zzso zzso and reliability of zzso zzso
