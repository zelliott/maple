To identify zzso iron overload in patients with zzso zzso causing secondary zzso we zzso evaluated signal intensity abnormalities of the anterior lobe of the zzso zzso of 18 patients affected by zzso zzso major and secondary zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging is useful to assess zzso iron overload in patients with zzso zzso and secondary zzso by detection of a significant decreased signal intensity of the anterior lobe of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso The decreased signal intensity of the anterior lobe of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso images was correlated to increasing serum zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Indeed, the lower the signal intensity of the zzso zzso the greater the serum zzso zzso However an exact zzso of zzso iron overload by correlation with serum zzso level is not zzso No correlation was found between MR imaging results and hormonal zzso however, the detection of zzso iron overload on zzso zzso images is consistent with the hypothesis of zzso zzso zzso due to zzso cellular zzso
