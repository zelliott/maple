To develop and implement a method for identification and zzso of zzso zzso enhancements with minimal human zzso 

zzso fast spin echo zzso fluid zzso inversion recovery zzso and zzso and zzso zzso spin echo were acquired on 22 zzso The enhancements were identified on the zzso zzso images based on zzso zzso A single threshold based on the ratio of the difference of zzso and zzso zzso images with that of zzso zzso images is applied to the reconstructed images to reduce the false zzso False zzso of enhancements arising from enhancing zzso and structures such as the zzso zzso that lack a zzso barrier were reduced by assuming that the true enhancements are always associated with zzso zzso on zzso images zzso zzso The enhanced zzso were further delineated based on fuzzy zzso 

The segmented zzso enhancements were evaluated zzso with manually identified enhancements based on similarity zzso The average similarity index zzso of zzso suggests excellent performance of the proposed zzso The zzso plot shows a close agreement between the results obtained manually and those based on the proposed zzso 

The proposed zzso identifies and zzso zzso enhancements accurately with minimal human zzso
