zzso changes in the cortical gray matter in infantile zzso vary with the age at onset and may not be zzso with shunt zzso We have used electron zzso to investigate the sequence of pathological change and the effect of shunt treatment on layer VI zzso cells from infant zzso rats with inherited zzso zzso zzso was prepared from the frontal and visual zzso of control and zzso rats at 4, 11, and 21 days after birth, together with zzso rats previously treated with zzso zzso at 4-5 or zzso days after zzso Both cortical regions gave similar results but the effects were more severe in the visual zzso In the early stages of zzso the zzso cells were in clusters with fewer mature zzso and less zzso organization than those in control rats, and some zzso processes were zzso In intermediate zzso the changes were more zzso with zzso zzso fewer zzso zzso frequent swollen zzso and zzso zzso In advanced zzso at 21 days, many zzso showed degenerative changes, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso distorted zzso and single zzso The zzso contained many zzso areas with distended zzso zzso treatment prevented most of the changes if carried out at 4 zzso zzso treatment at 11 days also gave a dramatic recovery at the cellular level, but there were more immature zzso cells and zzso processes in the zzso than in the zzso zzso The changes in zzso are consistent with progressive zzso damage, which is largely prevented by early shunt zzso
