Current treatment for zzso disease involves administration of intravenous zzso to degrade zzso stored in zzso zzso the rate of zzso of zzso should decrease zzso of this zzso We investigated the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso as a novel oral treatment for zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso into a zzso zzso study, 28 adults zzso with previous zzso from four national zzso referral clinics, who were unable or unwilling to receive zzso zzso We measured liver and zzso volume by zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at months 6 and 12, and zzso and zzso variables zzso including zzso activity (a sensitive marker of zzso disease zzso Patients were started on 100 zzso oral zzso zzso three times zzso 

zzso liver volumes were zzso times normal and zzso volumes zzso times zzso At 12 months, mean liver and zzso volumes were significantly lowered by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively (each zzso zzso variables improved zzso Mean organ volume and blood counts improved continually between 6 months and 12 months of zzso Mean zzso zzso fell by zzso over 12 months zzso Six patients withdrew because of gastrointestinal complaints zzso personal reasons zzso or severe pre-existing disease zzso The most frequent adverse effect was zzso which occurred in zzso of patients shortly after the start of zzso 

zzso of zzso formation by zzso zzso improves key clinical features of zzso zzso zzso The strategy justifies further trials in this and other zzso storage zzso
