With the increased applications of zinc oxide zzso zzso zzso the toxicity of zzso zzso zzso great concerns from the zzso community and the general zzso In this study, we report the toxicity of zzso zzso (30 zzso to the rat zzso system after zzso zzso revealed by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso scans were performed on a zzso scanner at 1, 2, 3 and 7 days zzso and the zzso changes of the rat zzso zzso were zzso The influences of chemical component and zzso of the zzso were also zzso In addition, an zzso behavior test was zzso The zzso and zzso results indicated that zzso zzso induced significant damages to the zzso zzso including disruption of the zzso zzso structures and zzso The destruction of zzso in zzso cells was observed under transmission electron zzso zzso suggesting that the possible zzso mechanism might involve cellular energy zzso zzso Further, the zzso of the zzso zzso disturbed zzso behaviors of the treated zzso The results suggest that zzso is potentially useful as a screening tool to assess the consequence of occupational exposure of zzso zzso zzso should therefore be taken during the use and disposal of zzso zzso to prevent the unintended public health zzso
