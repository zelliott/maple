The aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic value of zzso magnetic resonance imaging in gallbladder zzso which are typically diagnosed during surgery because the zzso findings are similar to those of zzso diffuse zzso of the gallbladder zzso 

Seven patients with gallbladder zzso and nine patients with benign gallbladder pathology were included in this zzso In one of the patients with a zzso a zzso was determined on the zzso zzso in another patient, acute zzso leukemia had infiltrated the zzso causing the diffuse wall zzso Five subjects had a primary zzso zzso The view of the zzso wall was evaluated visually in increasing b zzso zzso diffusion zzso zzso were obtained from at least three sites of the zzso wall in each patient, and the results of the zzso were analyzed after comparing the zzso and benign zzso In the zzso group, the results of the zzso outcomes were compared with zzso zzso In the benign group, zzso was diagnosed by observing zzso of the zzso wall zzso via surgery or medical zzso 

There was a statistically significant difference in apparent diffusion zzso levels between the zzso group, which caused diffuse zzso of the gallbladder wall, and the benign group zzso zzso test, zzso 

According to this preliminary study, observation of distinct brightness of the gallbladder wall in zzso examination with a high b value is a significant finding in terms of diffuse gallbladder zzso A value below the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso was significant for zzso in apparent diffusion zzso zzso
