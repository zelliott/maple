The aim of this study was to zzso using zzso zzso Imaging zzso muscle volume zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso muscles in both healthy subjects zzso and those with unilateral zzso zzso of the hip zzso zzso and zzso zzso While control group subjects were symmetrical between sides for the muscles measured, subjects with hip joint pathology showed asymmetry in zzso muscle volume dependent on stage of zzso The zzso demonstrated zzso around the affected hip in subjects with advanced pathology zzso however asymmetry of the zzso zzso could be attributed largely to zzso on the unaffected side, based on between group comparisons of muscle zzso zzso showed no significant zzso or difference compared to the normal control zzso This study highlights the functional separation of zzso and zzso and the similarities of the zzso and zzso both superficial abductors appearing to maintain their size around the affected zzso Further research is required to determine the specific changes occurring in the deeper zzso zzso This information may assist in the development of more targeted and effective exercise zzso in the management of zzso of the zzso
