Disorders of zzso by a neural network located in the zzso or the zzso lead to zzso Based on previous animal studies it was concluded that one key player of the zzso part of this zzso neural network is the zzso Up to now, in humans there are no systematic studies in patients with zzso zzso examining one of the most common forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of our present study was to clarify which zzso structures are involved in the generation of zzso 

zzso patients with acute unilateral zzso stroke were analyzed by means of modern zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso structures such as the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso but also parts of the zzso zzso and the inferior zzso zzso were affected in horizontal zzso 

It seems that these structures are part of a zzso neural zzso control zzso Furthermore, zzso might present a diagnostic sign pointing toward zzso located zzso of zzso and lower zzso zzso
