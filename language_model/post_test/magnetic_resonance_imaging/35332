High resolution zzso of live zzso was performed at zzso zzso with a field of view less than 5 zzso and administration of zzso or zzso contrast zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of MR methods for imaging the fruit fly zzso with an zzso zzso at a resolution relevant for zzso future studies of the zzso brain and other zzso The fruit fly has long been a principal model zzso for zzso biology and disease, but without capabilities like those of zzso This feasibility marks progress toward the development of new in zzso research approaches in zzso without the requirement for light transparency or destructive zzso
