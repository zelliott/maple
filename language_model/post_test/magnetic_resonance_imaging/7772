In recent years, there have been substantial developments in both magnetic resonance imaging techniques and automatic image analysis zzso The purpose of this paper is to develop zzso image sampling theory zzso unbiased sampling rules) that can be used by image analysts for zzso geometric quantities such as surface area and volume, and to illustrate its zzso The methods will zzso be applied automatically on zzso properly sampled zzso images - although convenient manual application is always an option - and they are of wide zzso in many zzso In particular, the vertical sections design to estimate surface area is described in detail and applied to estimate the area of the zzso surface and of the boundary between zzso and underlying white matter zzso zzso surface zzso For zzso cortical volume and mean cortical thickness are also zzso The aforementioned surfaces were zzso in zzso with the aid of zzso software, which provided accurate surface area measures that served as gold zzso Furthermore, a software was developed to produce digitized trace zzso of the zzso target surfaces automatically from virtual zzso From such zzso a new method (called the zzso zzso is presented to estimate surface area zzso In addition, with the new software, zzso could be counted automatically between the relevant surface traces and a zzso test grid for the classical zzso This zzso together with the aforementioned gold standard, enabled us to thoroughly check the performance and the zzso of the different zzso by zzso Carlo simulations for studying the human zzso In particular, new methods are offered to split the total error zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter prediction was zzso zzso is proposed here and checked by way of simulations on a given set of digitized vertical sections with automatically superimposed zzso zzso of three different zzso zzso and detailed recommendations are given to implement the zzso
