zzso zzso zzso zzso are used in drug delivery and cell tracking zzso As zzso is already implemented as a zzso cell contrast agent in zzso imaging procedures (in the form of zzso for neurological zzso the introduction of zzso in the porous network of zzso would allow zzso cells and tracking them using zzso These particles are in general zzso in zzso an zzso environment with high saline zzso In addition, the available MSN zzso could also serve as a carrier to deliver zzso substances through the zzso zzso In the present study, zzso oxide was introduced in the porous network of zzso zzso zzso zzso The particles exhibit a narrow size distribution zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso which was validated after zzso of zzso The resulting zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Evidence was found with zzso and zzso zzso that zzso is the main zzso state of the zzso species after suspension in water, most probably in the form of zzso The zzso stability as a function of time was confirmed by zzso in water, zzso buffer and cell culture zzso In zzso data, no significant evidence of zzso leaching was found in zzso in zzso water zzso zzso up to 96 hours after zzso High zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured at 60 zzso and 37 zzso with the lowest zzso ratios zzso zzso 2) reported to date for a zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso cell zzso was confirmed by zzso Finally, zzso contrast enhancement provided by cell zzso with escalated incubation zzso of zzso was zzso at 1 zzso This study confirmed the possibility of efficiently zzso zzso into zzso using zzso zzso while maintaining an open zzso and relatively high pore zzso Because these zzso zzso express strong zzso contrast media properties at low zzso they are potentially zzso for cell tracking and drug delivery zzso
