The last 5 years of technological advances with major impact on clinical magnetic resonance zzso are discussed, with greater emphasis on those that are most zzso These developments have already had a critical positive effect on clinical diagnosis and therapy and zzso continued rapid improvements for the next 5 zzso This review begins with a discussion of 2 topics that zzso the breadth of zzso in terms of zzso applications, contrast media, and MR zzso zzso innovations are discussed by zzso category, picking the areas with the greatest development, starting with the brain, moving forward to the liver and zzso and concluding with the musculoskeletal system, breast, and zzso Two final topics are then considered, which will zzso with time, become independent major fields in their own right, zzso MR and MR zzso zzso zzso zzso next decade will bring a new generation of MR contrast media, with research focused on substantial improvements zzso in zzso zzso zzso thus providing greater zzso safety, and tissue zzso zzso resonance zzso will see major advances because of the use of compressed zzso in terms of spatial and zzso resolution, with movement away from zzso zzso The breadth of available techniques and tissue contrast has greatly expanded in brain imaging, benefiting both from the introduction of new basic categories of imaging techniques, such as zzso echo zzso imaging and zzso fast spin echo imaging with variable flip angles, and from new refinements specific to zzso areas, such as double inversion recovery and zzso Liver imaging has benefited from the development of techniques to easily and rapidly assess zzso and will see, overall, a marked improvement in the next 5 years from new techniques on the verge of clinical introduction, such as controlled zzso in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration zzso with a substantial impact on both spatial resolution and scan zzso Renal MR is benefiting from the application of zzso imaging, providing an assessment of zzso function critical for the evaluation of chronic kidney zzso zzso to reduce metal artifact are a major focus of development in musculoskeletal MR and are critical for the ever-increasing zzso and implant patient population, leading to markedly improved imaging of tissue adjacent to metal and diagnosis of infection, zzso zzso and zzso complications such as zzso In breast zzso scan techniques are continuing to evolve, and the impact of this examination on screening for and evaluation and treatment of breast zzso is substantial with continued expansion of zzso zzso MR has benefited from zzso imaging and the application of zzso imaging, the latter technique also now applied more generally in body imaging, with a substantial clinical impact, in particular for the detection of tumor zzso zzso zzso MR is still early in its development, although well established in many centers, possessing great potential in comparison with zzso zzso zzso because of superior zzso contrast, real-time zzso imaging guidance and monitoring, the availability of temperature zzso and the lack of zzso zzso And last but not least, zzso is in its zzso with the first round of clinical units installed in the past 2 years and early clinical experience showing zzso and, in some instances, superiority to zzso As with the field of MR itself, which began when CT was already an established zzso zzso will zzso in the next decade, become an equivalent zzso to zzso if not begin to supplant the latter zzso
