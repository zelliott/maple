The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applications of magnetic resonance imaging zzso and in particular, dynamic zzso zzso zzso in the assessment of zzso zzso by means of animal zzso models evaluated before and after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exams were performed with zzso contrast media in 21 zzso zzso were induced by subcutaneous injection of colon zzso cells in 7 rats and zzso zzso cells in 14 zzso zzso and zzso parameters of the implanted zzso were evaluated by using two contrast media zzso and zzso to establish response to treatment with two different zzso drugs zzso and zzso These parameters were correlated with zzso to obtain a zzso map of zzso zzso 

zzso revealed greater enhancement in the peripheral area than in the central area in all the examined animal zzso In the zzso zzso experiment, vascular zzso measured by means of zzso in the animals treated with the zzso drug zzso zzso was significantly less than in zzso animals zzso zzso whereas no significant difference was observed with zzso zzso zzso in treated animals and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the colon zzso experiment, mean zzso and zzso decreased by 51% (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and 59% (from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso respectively, in all animals after zzso drug zzso 

zzso permits a zzso evaluation of zzso zzso and in particular of its dynamic characteristics and zzso before and after zzso zzso
