Our aim was to test the association of vascular risk factor exposure in zzso with progression of zzso markers of brain aging and measures of cognitive zzso 

A total of zzso participants without zzso from the prospective zzso zzso zzso Study were zzso zzso linear and zzso zzso were implemented to study the association of zzso vascular risk factor exposure with zzso change in white matter zzso volume zzso total brain volume zzso zzso horn volume, logical memory delayed recall, visual reproductions zzso zzso and zzso Test zzso zzso performance a decade zzso 

zzso in zzso was associated with accelerated zzso progression zzso zzso zzso and worsening executive function zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso diabetes and smoking were associated with a more rapid increase in zzso horn volume, a surrogate marker of accelerated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso smoking also predicted a more marked decrease in total brain volume zzso zzso zzso and increased risk of extensive change in zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso in zzso was associated with an increased risk of being in the top zzso of change in executive function zzso zzso p zzso zzso and increasing zzso ratio was associated with marked decline in zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso changes in brain structure were significantly correlated with decline in memory and executive zzso 

zzso hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and obesity were associated with an increased rate of progression of vascular brain injury, global and zzso zzso and decline in executive function a decade zzso
