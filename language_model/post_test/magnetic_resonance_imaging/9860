A cavernous zzso arising from the zzso nerve has not been previously reported in the zzso Based on the surgical experience with this case, the authors discuss the clinical importance and zzso potential of a duplicated zzso zzso 

A 54-year-old woman presented with a recurrence of zzso that had occurred 3 years before this admission and had spontaneously resolved without any specific zzso On admission, there were no specific neurological zzso zzso resonance imaging revealed a zzso mass on the right anterior zzso angle with zzso zzso zzso zzso via a standard right lateral zzso approach was zzso A zzso mass was found emerging from the entry zone of the zzso canal and zzso the larger branch of the duplicate zzso zzso Because there was no zzso between the mass and origin branch, both were removed en zzso zzso revealed the presence of a cavernous zzso mixed with nerve zzso Despite preserving a small branch of the duplicate zzso zzso the patient had permanent right zzso zzso 

A cavernous zzso arising from the zzso nerve should be suspected as a possible diagnosis for a zzso mass on the anterior zzso zzso Although zzso of the zzso nerve has not been clearly confirmed on clinical zzso sacrificing the larger branch during surgery may lead to permanent zzso zzso as in our zzso
