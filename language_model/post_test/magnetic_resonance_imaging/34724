This study was undertaken to determine whether phased array zzso zzso and zzso sequences can replace zzso spin echo zzso sequences in the imaging of focal liver zzso by comparing overall image quality, zzso contrast, and zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of focal liver zzso were zzso compared in 120 patients with suspected focal liver zzso zzso at zzso T with use of a body phased array zzso zzso images were acquired with zzso fast zzso shot zzso and zzso zzso spin echo zzso zzso and zzso images were made with conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso image analysis was done by three blinded readers, and quantitative analysis was zzso The highest zzso ratios were obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso sequence were slightly inferior to those of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso sequences had less image zzso zzso image quality of zzso sequences was better than that of zzso sequences for both zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso The tissue contrast of zzso zzso sequence was superior to that of zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso On zzso imaging, tissue contrast of solid zzso was better on conventional zzso sequence than that on zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Respiratory ghost artifact was less prominent on zzso zzso zzso although this artifact was occasionally seen on zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso MR unit with use of a phased array zzso conventional zzso can be replaced by zzso zzso On zzso imaging, because solid zzso contrast on zzso zzso imaging is inferior to that on zzso zzso image, zzso imaging may not replace conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso
