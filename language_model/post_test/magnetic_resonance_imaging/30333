zzso associations between the change of white matter zzso zzso and clinical symptoms over time is crucial for establishing a zzso zzso However, the most suitable method for measuring zzso progression has not been established zzso We compared the reliability and sensitivity of zzso and zzso visual scales with zzso for measuring zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso scan pairs zzso 2 zzso were included from the Amsterdam center of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was performed twice by one zzso Three zzso scales zzso zzso zzso White Matter Changes zzso zzso zzso and two progression scales zzso zzso zzso Schmidt zzso zzso were scored by 4 and repeated by 2 zzso 

Mean zzso volume zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume change zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso change in zzso was reliable zzso zzso zzso zzso All visual scales showed significant change of zzso over time, although the sensitivity was highest for both of the progression zzso zzso zzso change of zzso correlated best with the Rotterdam zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the Schmidt zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso Although all scales were reliable for assessment of zzso zzso zzso progression assessment using visual scales was less reliable, except for the Rotterdam zzso scale which had moderate to good reliability zzso Cohen's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To determine change in zzso dedicated progression scales are more sensitive and/or reliable and correlate better with zzso volume change than zzso zzso
