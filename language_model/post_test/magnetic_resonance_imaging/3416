Rasmussen encephalitis is a chronic zzso disease leading to unilateral zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso and progressive zzso zzso Until now, quantitative parameters describing the course of the disease on zzso require manual intervention and are, therefore, time-consuming and zzso Furthermore, regional zzso differences cannot be evaluated with the previously published zzso In this study we present a fully automated zzso approach applied to serial zzso scans of 12 patients with Rasmussen zzso 

We zzso analyzed 12 patients with Rasmussen encephalitis with a disease onset between 2001 and zzso All patients underwent a total of 66 serial zzso scans including a three-dimensional zzso data zzso The zzso analysis was based on standard procedures of the freely available software zzso Software Library zzso and required about 45 zzso per zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses were performed on 51 scans as described zzso 

The relative and absolute volume loss of the affected zzso was significantly higher compared to the unaffected zzso Referring to regional zzso differences our results show that the frontal lobe and the zzso were zzso involved in the zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the age at disease zzso indicating a more aggressive and zzso disease in young children compared to zzso zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso ratio correlated significantly, but zzso zzso ratio underestimated the real degree of zzso especially in patients with zzso zzso outside the zzso zzso 

The zzso analysis presented here offers a precise assessment of the disease progression in Rasmussen encephalitis in an zzso and zzso manner and gives an interesting insight into the course of the disease on zzso The degree of zzso evaluated with this method zzso with clinical parameters and is comparable to zzso rates in patients receiving zzso in preceding zzso zzso zzso
