zzso brain imaging studies have demonstrated zzso and zzso zzso to zzso of social threat in participants with generalized social anxiety disorder zzso The zzso and zzso are known to serve broad functions in emotional processing, including integration of affective zzso However, few studies have examined brain responses in socially anxious participants during general emotional zzso We examined brain response to emotionally evocative images in patients with zzso and matched healthy zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso who were not taking zzso medications and did not have psychiatric zzso and 11 matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing blocks of emotionally salient zzso negative, zzso zzso 

Participants with zzso exhibited enhanced bilateral zzso and zzso zzso to negative zzso zzso images compared with healthy controls who did not exhibit enhanced zzso Within the zzso group, the extent of zzso zzso was correlated with social anxiety severity, whereas the extent of zzso zzso was correlated with trait zzso 

The small sample size may have limited our ability to detect group differences in other relevant brain regions and in zzso zzso 

In addition to prior findings of zzso of social information processing, our findings suggest that the zzso and zzso responses are zzso to general emotional images with negative emotional content and that these brain regions may play divergent roles in their representation of different zzso
