The majority of affective zzso is rooted early in life and first emerges during childhood and zzso However, little is known about how genetic vulnerability affects brain structure and function in childhood since the vast majority of studies published so far have been conducted on adult zzso The present investigation examined for the first time the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso 158 zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been shown to moderate predisposition to negative mood and affective disorders, on brain structure and function in zzso 

zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to measure gray matter volume and emotional zzso in 50 children aged between 10 and 12 zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso affects structural brain development and zzso heightened zzso within the affective zzso circuit in zzso 

The zzso zzso was positively associated with gray matter volume in the left zzso head where zzso accounted for 59% of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was positively associated with zzso responses to fearful relative to neutral facial expressions in the right zzso zzso where zzso accounted for zzso of the zzso zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso zzso is associated with increased gray matter volume and heightened zzso during emotional processing within the zzso system in children as young as 10 to 12 years of zzso These findings are consistent with the notion that genetic factors affect brain function to moderate vulnerability to affective zzso from zzso
