zzso zzso use has been targeted as a particular area of concern in zzso but it is unclear whether and to what extent its use is inappropriate in musculoskeletal zzso 

We therefore evaluated the zzso and cost of inappropriate zzso zzso among patients with musculoskeletal zzso 

We zzso identified 920 patients treated in a musculoskeletal zzso clinic between 2009 and zzso We accepted as necessary any zzso for a primary bone zzso for zzso soft tissue zzso for soft tissue masses greater than 5 zzso in diameter, for soft tissue masses deep to the zzso for painful soft tissue masses, and for growing soft tissue zzso Patients without these criteria were reviewed by a team of musculoskeletal zzso to determine the zzso The criteria for a repeat zzso were failure to show the zzso lack of zzso contrast, lack of zzso or zzso zzso zzso or poor image zzso Cost was determined using 2010 Medicare reimbursement zzso 

Of 920 patients, 320 zzso arrived with a zzso zzso zzso Eight of the 320 zzso studies were unnecessary, and 12 zzso were necessary but were zzso The cost was zzso which averages to zzso per study and $36 of waste per patient referred with an zzso zzso 

Based on our data, we judged zzso use before referral to our zzso center as not zzso This is likely zzso in part, to the relatively low use of zzso in our referral zzso zzso zzso use in patients with tumors may not be as widespread as previously zzso
