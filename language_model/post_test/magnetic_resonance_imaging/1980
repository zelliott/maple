We conducted two zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso experiments to investigate the neural zzso of visual object recognition in zzso We used a zzso method with visual stimuli recurring at unpredictable zzso either with the same appearance or with changes in size, viewpoint or zzso zzso zzso and zzso inferior zzso zzso showed lower activity for repetitions of both real and zzso objects; zzso and left inferior frontal regions showed decreases for repetitions of only real zzso zzso of different zzso with the same name affected only the left inferior frontal zzso zzso zzso decreases in activity of the right zzso zzso depended on whether the three-dimensional objects were repeated with the same viewpoint, regardless of whether retinal image size changed; left zzso decreases were independent of both viewpoint and zzso These data show that zzso zzso in zzso visual zzso maintain distinct zzso and zzso object zzso
