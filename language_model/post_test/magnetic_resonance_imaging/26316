A newly developed zzso zzso was used to evaluate whether it is suitable for visualizing the three-dimensional zzso zzso of the mouse inner ear (at a zzso zzso and whether it is zzso as a fast screening tool to detect zzso abnormalities in this zzso To this end, the zzso zzso a zzso mouse showing abnormal circling zzso was used as a zzso The inner ears were dissected out, zzso and scanned at zzso resolution along the zzso zzso After zzso stacks of zzso images were used for zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso Finally, the obtained data were correlated with subsequent conventional zzso zzso The spatial resolution (8 zzso achieved by this zzso was found to be far superior to that obtained by conventional computer zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso The technique provides detailed zzso images of the zzso zzso and enables an adequate zzso reconstruction of the inner ear structures in this small zzso In addition, it allows a screening for zzso specimens prior to the more zzso and zzso zzso techniques, which are still essential to gather information at a zzso zzso This imaging technique can be regarded as a valuable tool in future research on zzso inner ear zzso
