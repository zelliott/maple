Alcohol abuse and dependence have been reported to exacerbate the clinical course of zzso However, the zzso basis of this zzso interaction is zzso The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of zzso alcohol use disorder zzso with brain structure abnormalities in schizophrenia zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance images were collected from schizophrenia patients without a history of any substance use disorder zzso zzso schizophrenia patients with a history of zzso only zzso zzso and a healthy comparison group without a history of any substance use disorder zzso zzso zzso zzso brain mapping was used to zzso the surface shapes of the zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso zzso in these subject zzso Analysis of zzso was used to test for differences in surface shape measures among the zzso 

zzso demonstrated the greatest severity of shape abnormalities in the zzso thalamus, zzso and zzso zzso as compared to zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated a combination of exaggerated shape differences in regions where zzso also showed shape differences, and unique shape differences that were not observed in zzso or zzso 

Shape differences in schizophrenia were compounded by a history of zzso zzso Future research is needed to determine whether these differences are simply additive or whether they are due to an interaction between the underlying zzso of schizophrenia and zzso The consequences of such shape differences for the clinical course of schizophrenia are not yet zzso
