zzso variations in resting state connectivity of the human brain were examined from young adulthood through middle zzso A zzso network measure, degree, was used to assess age-related differences in tissue connectivity throughout the zzso zzso in connectivity with age were found in zzso cortical and zzso zzso zzso in connectivity were found in cortical regions, including visual areas and the default mode zzso These findings differ from those of recent zzso studies examining earlier growth zzso and are consistent with known changes in cognitive function and emotional processing during mature zzso The results support and extend previous findings that relied on a zzso definitions of regions of interest for their zzso This approach of applying a zzso measure to examine the functional connectivity of individual tissue elements over time, without the need for a zzso region of interest zzso provides an important new tool in brain zzso
