A zzso brain scanner that has a zzso resolution of less than a hundred milliseconds is needed to measure the neural zzso of higher cognitive functions in healthy people and neurological and psychiatric zzso zzso techniques have the requisite zzso resolution but their potential spatial resolution has been not zzso Here we briefly review progress in increasing the spatial detail of zzso zzso and in registering this functional information with anatomical models of a person's zzso We describe methods and systems for zzso zzso and magnetic resonance image zzso zzso and present first results of the integration of zzso zzso models of zzso stimulation with 3-D zzso brain zzso
