We used the combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso to decompose the processing stages zzso zzso of working memory zzso Our results reveal an early transient zzso of zzso cortex, which was accompanied by the onset of a sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso We zzso observed late transient responses in zzso prefrontal zzso and late sustained activity in zzso frontal and zzso zzso We propose that these neural signatures reflect the cognitive stages of task processing, zzso evaluation zzso zzso storage buffer operations zzso zzso zzso active retrieval zzso prefrontal zzso and action selection zzso frontal and zzso zzso This is also supported by their differential zzso contribution to specific zzso of the zzso cognitive zzso
