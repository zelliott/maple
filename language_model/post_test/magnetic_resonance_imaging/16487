zzso assessment of body iron load in patients with acute leukemia is usually done by serum zzso zzso zzso however, its sensitivity is impaired by different conditions including inflammation and zzso 

To estimate, using zzso the extent of liver iron overload in children with acute leukemia and receiving blood zzso and to examine the association between the degree of zzso iron overload and clinical parameters including zzso and the zzso iron load zzso 

A total of 25 zzso zzso of the liver were performed in 15 children with acute leukemia zzso age zzso zzso using zzso zzso Signal intensity ratios between the liver and the zzso muscle zzso zzso were calculated and compared with zzso zzso was estimated from the cumulative blood volume received, assuming an amount of 200 zzso iron per zzso red blood cell zzso 

zzso analysis revealed good correlation between the zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso in patients with acute leukemia as well as between zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso may reliably reflect liver iron stores as a routine marker in patients suffering from acute zzso
