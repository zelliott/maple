To establish regional zzso and zzso values of the healthy mouse brain at zzso magnetic field strength of zzso T and to follow regional brain zzso and zzso changes with zzso 

In zzso zzso and zzso values in the zzso mouse brain were followed with age using zzso sequence and multiple spin echo zzso recovery with variable repetition time zzso respectively, at zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were used to validate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to compare mean relaxation zzso 

A zzso decrease in zzso is shown and validated with phantom zzso zzso values at zzso T typically increased with age in multiple brain regions except in the zzso and the zzso where a slight decrease was zzso Furthermore, zzso values in various brain regions of young and old mice are presented at zzso zzso A large gain in zzso ratio was observed at zzso zzso 

This study establishes for the first time the zzso zzso and zzso values at zzso T over different mouse brain regions with zzso The estimates of in zzso zzso and zzso will be useful to zzso pulse sequences for optimal image contrast at zzso T and will serve as baseline values against which zzso relaxation changes can be assessed in zzso
