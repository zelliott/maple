zzso whole brain volume loss is well documented in moderate to severe traumatic brain zzso Whether this zzso occurs in the zzso and zzso has not been systematically studied in zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso quantitative analysis was used to investigate brain volume loss in the zzso and zzso in 16 traumatic brain injury subjects (age range zzso zzso compared with 16 age and zzso matched zzso Based on multiple analysis of zzso controlling for age and head size, reduced volume in the zzso and the zzso region of the zzso were zzso General linear model analyses revealed a relation between processing speed on a working memory task and zzso and brain stem zzso zzso volume in zzso and zzso structures were associated with traumatic brain zzso Reduction in zzso and zzso volume is probably a reflection of the secondary effects of diffuse zzso injury and reduction in cortical volume from brain zzso
