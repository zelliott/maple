The aim of this study was to investigate cortical zzso in response to zzso stimulus presentations in an individual (FX) with a circumscribed traumatic zzso zzso of the right inferior zzso FX and control subjects were exposed to complex sounds while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso Whereas zzso individuals show well-balanced bilateral zzso patterns in response to zzso auditory zzso the same stimuli produced stronger zzso in the left zzso in zzso Combined with previous data, these findings reinforce the notion that the inferior zzso is an essential auditory relay and that its loss cannot be significantly zzso
