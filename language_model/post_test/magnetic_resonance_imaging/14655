Although not well zzso foot zzso are changed with zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study was to examine zzso zzso in women with zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso design was zzso 

Twenty women with zzso and without zzso zzso zzso Data were acquired with the use of a magnetic resonance zzso Participants were posed standing to simulate zzso with images reconstructed into virtual bone zzso zzso taken described foot posture zzso angle, zzso angle, arch zzso With the use of additional computer zzso the image sequence was then registered across gait conditions to zzso relative zzso position angles, zzso angles, and zzso axis parameters zzso into X, Y, and Z zzso An analysis of zzso model compared zzso between groups and across zzso Multiple zzso analysis assessed the relationship of arch angle, zzso position, and inclination of the zzso zzso 

Both the zzso and zzso angles were larger with zzso arch angle was not different between zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso degrees, and the first ray zzso zzso by zzso degrees across conditions with zzso There was an interaction zzso for the zzso zzso zzso comparisons detected increased inclination of the zzso axis over middle stance compared with late stance in the group with zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso were not measured, and sample size was zzso 

There were group zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of the first ray were increased, and the zzso axis was inclined 24 degrees over middle stance in women with zzso compared with 6 degrees in control zzso zzso may identify risk factors of zzso zzso and inform zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso
