Volume selective magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the zzso zzso zzso and fatty bone zzso zzso in patients with leukemia and zzso zzso Selective zzso of the relaxation times zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso in the bone zzso zzso were zzso Nine patients with acute leukemia and three patients with chronic leukemia were examined at zzso Three patients with acute leukemia in zzso were also zzso Five of the zzso patients had follow-up examinations performed in relation to zzso zzso Nine patients with zzso zzso and 21 normal control subjects were examined with identical methods for zzso All patients had bone zzso zzso performed prior to every MR zzso zzso differences could be detected in the spectral patterns from zzso bone zzso in patients with leukemia at diagnosis compared to the healthy normal zzso The zzso water zzso was increased in the zzso bone zzso zzso of the zzso patients compared to the normal subjects, which indicates an increase in the amount of zzso tissue and a corresponding decrease in zzso fat zzso The zzso relaxation times of the zzso resonance in the zzso from the zzso bone zzso of the zzso patients were significantly prolonged at diagnosis, compared to the normal controls and the patients with zzso zzso After zzso induction of zzso the zzso from the zzso bone zzso in the patients with leukemia resembled normal zzso Four zzso patients had abnormal zzso from the zzso bone zzso and one patient showed early changes in zzso zzso during zzso treatment, before any major changes could be detected in the zzso bone zzso
