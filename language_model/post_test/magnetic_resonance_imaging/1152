To define regional function impairment in airway obstruction zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso dogs with a combination study of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

After acquisition of zzso zzso zzso MR images during cardiac cycles in 14 zzso dogs and 19 zzso dogs, zzso zzso zzso images were obtained by zzso between zzso images of the minimum lung signal intensity zzso during zzso and maximum zzso during zzso Each dog subsequently zzso zzso zzso for 20 minutes, and zzso zzso zzso images were obtained from zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso images were compared with intravenous zzso pulmonary zzso zzso phase zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images were consistent with zzso zzso images in all dogs, with significant correlations in the zzso lung zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images showed sufficient and uniform enhancement in the unaffected zzso In all the zzso areas, these combined images showed the matched zzso and zzso deposition zzso These images showed zzso defects without zzso deposition defects in the relatively small zzso areas, but showed the matched defects in the widely zzso areas probably due to hypoxic zzso zzso 

The combination MR studies may be acceptable for zzso defining regionally impaired lung function in zzso and zzso
