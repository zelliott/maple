Blood oxygen zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso an important research and clinical zzso depends on relatively greater transient increases in zzso cerebral blood zzso zzso than cerebral zzso rate for oxygen during neural zzso We investigated whether reduced resting zzso in patients with zzso lobe zzso affects zzso signal during zzso language zzso 

We used zzso water zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso and 3 zzso echo zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso with an auditory description decision task in 33 patients with zzso lobe zzso (16 zzso mean age zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso years; zzso onset zzso zzso zzso years; mean duration zzso zzso zzso years; 23 left focus, 10 right zzso zzso regions drawn on structural zzso based on the Wake Forest Pick Atlas, included zzso area zzso inferior frontal zzso zzso middle frontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and asymmetry zzso zzso were calculated on zzso zzso and zzso 

Twelve patients had zzso zzso sclerosis zzso on the zzso two patients had a tumor or zzso of cortical development (both zzso one patient a right zzso cyst, and 18 patients had normal zzso zzso zzso zzso relative left zzso zzso correlated with decreased left zzso zzso zzso and decreasing left zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was not related to left zzso zzso zzso itself or zzso zzso There was a weak positive correlation between absolute zzso and zzso zzso in left zzso right zzso and left zzso Patients with normal and abnormal zzso did not differ in zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is associated with reduced zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso itself, suggesting distributed network effects, but not impairment of underlying zzso zzso zzso in zzso does not affect zzso clinical zzso
