zzso models of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso emphasize disturbances in the function and connectivity of brain zzso networks, or zzso Although zzso studies of patients have supported this network model of zzso very few have applied zzso that are sensitive to brain connectivity zzso 

Using zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested the hypothesis that zzso is associated with disturbances in the functional connectivity of primarily zzso zzso regions, measured from coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso

Hospital referral zzso unit and magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A total of 21 patients with zzso (10 men, 11 zzso and 21 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and estimated zzso 

zzso statistical zzso maps testing the strength of functional connectivity of 4 zzso seed regions of interest zzso zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with remaining brain zzso 

For both groups, there was a clear distinction in the pattern of cortical connectivity of zzso and zzso zzso regions, consistent with the notion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Between groups, patients with zzso had significantly increased functional connectivity along a zzso zzso zzso implicating the zzso zzso and surrounding zzso The specific strength of connectivity between the zzso zzso zzso and the anterior zzso zzso predicted patients' overall symptom severity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Additionally, patients with zzso showed evidence of reduced functional connectivity of the zzso zzso and lateral prefrontal cortex, and of the zzso zzso with the region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study directly supports the hypothesis that zzso is associated with functional zzso of brain zzso zzso Specifically, our findings emphasize abnormal and heightened functional connectivity of zzso zzso regions in patients with zzso
