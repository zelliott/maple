Loss of shape recognition in zzso zzso occurs without equivalent losses in the use of vision to guide actions, providing support for the hypothesis of two visual systems (for zzso and zzso The human individual zzso received a toxic exposure to carbon monoxide some years ago, which resulted in a zzso zzso zzso that has been extensively characterized at the behavioral zzso We conducted a detailed high-resolution zzso study of zzso cortex, combining structural and functional zzso We present the first accurate zzso of the changes in thickness across zzso zzso cortex, finding the most substantial loss in the lateral zzso zzso zzso There are reduced white matter connections between zzso and other zzso zzso measures show pockets of activity that survive within structurally damaged zzso The zzso mapping of visual areas showed that ordered zzso maps were evident for zzso in the zzso portions of visual cortical areas zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso shows evidence of zzso order in its zzso portion, such maps could not be found in the zzso parts of V2 and zzso We conclude that it is not possible to understand fully the deficits in object perception in zzso zzso without the exploitation of both structural and functional zzso Our results also highlight for zzso the cortical routes through which visual information is able to pass to support her well-documented abilities to use visual information to guide zzso
