zzso relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show cognitive zzso that are similar to but less severe than their ill zzso We have shown that memory zzso can be improved and prefrontal cortical zzso activity increased in individuals with schizophrenia by providing beneficial zzso zzso The current study used a similar paradigm to determine whether siblings of individuals with schizophrenia zzso also show increases in brain activity when presented with beneficial zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and 38 siblings of healthy comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while engaged in deep zzso zzso and shallow zzso zzso zzso zzso were then given a recognition memory zzso 

The groups did not differ on zzso or recognition zzso and the zzso benefited from deep zzso to a similar degree as control zzso The zzso showed deep zzso activity in a number of zzso regions typically activated during semantic zzso However, zzso showed more activity than control subjects in three zzso of zzso zzso BA 44 & BA 47 zzso 

zzso of individuals with schizophrenia benefit from supportive verbal zzso zzso Like individuals with zzso zzso also show increased zzso activity in a larger number of zzso zzso than control subjects during deep verbal zzso
