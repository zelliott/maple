Blood pressure zzso age, and reduced zzso function are major risk factors for zzso zzso zzso in the general zzso However, it remains unclear whether or not the zzso itself or other parameters related to the zzso are associated with zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso We investigated the relationships of the presence of zzso with the central zzso zzso zzso and estimated zzso zzso rate zzso in treated zzso zzso 

We studied 185 zzso patients with median duration of hypertension, zzso years, whose zzso is controlled to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 139 zzso 17 and 79 zzso 10 zzso zzso We measured zzso and brain magnetic resonance imaging zzso was examined within 2 weeks after last zzso and biological zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso as assessed by the presence of zzso deep zzso zzso zzso in the frontal zzso 0-2 vs zzso and zzso areas zzso 0-2 vs zzso where small arteries are affected at earlier stage of hypertension, as well as that of zzso deep zzso zzso zzso zzso 2-3 vs 0-1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-3 vs zzso were older, had higher serum zzso levels, a longer duration of hypertension, and lower zzso zzso The grade of the zzso was not associated with either the zzso or the zzso zzso In zzso zzso analyses after adjustment for age, sex, zzso and hypertension zzso showed significant association between zzso and zzso The patients with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to have higher grade zzso The odds ratio was zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso in the zzso area zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was associated with zzso but not with either the zzso zzso or zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso
