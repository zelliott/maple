To evaluate magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso findings in the zzso joint zzso and their contribution to assessment of zzso zzso 

Images of 22 fresh human zzso zzso were obtained with both conventional and zzso MR zzso The MR appearances of all zzso and zzso structures were analyzed and correlated with zzso zzso Two readers graded visibility of zzso structures and severity of joint zzso zzso in the visibility ratings at standard MR imaging and at MR zzso were zzso Association between the type of zzso zzso of ligament or muscle with zzso abnormalities of the zzso was zzso The association between zzso zzso and zzso changes was zzso 

The zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso surfaces were better zzso at MR zzso than at MR zzso zzso and zzso ligaments were slightly better seen on MR zzso zzso muscles, and zzso structures were well demonstrated at both conventional MR and MR zzso zzso zzso and zzso were easily identified and were detected more often in the zzso bone than in the zzso zzso Communication of the zzso with the zzso joint was noted in 18 zzso of 22 zzso 

MR imaging and/or MR zzso allows zzso of all zzso structures of the zzso MR zzso improves zzso of findings of zzso
