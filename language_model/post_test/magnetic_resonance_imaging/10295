A retrospective analysis of patients who had magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso spine, comparing those with a normal straight spine and those with a right zzso adolescent idiopathic zzso zzso 

To analyze the position of the rib head with respect to the spinal canal and zzso body in normal patients and those with right zzso zzso using zzso 

When placing anterior zzso body screws in zzso zzso the most zzso screws are most at risk for loosening because of smaller zzso body size and the position of the rib heads, which may obscure more of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, there are no studies defining the relationship of the rib head to the zzso anatomy in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso bodies from the 4th zzso zzso vertebra to the 12th zzso zzso vertebra in normal patients zzso zzso zzso and patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso group were analyzed regarding the following zzso zzso percent vertebra obscured by rib head zzso the percent of the zzso plane zzso body length obscured by the overlapping rib head); zzso zzso safe angle, defined as the most zzso angle a screw can be placed, which avoids the spinal zzso and zzso anterior safe angle, defined as the most zzso directed screw trajectory that safely obtained good screw zzso 

In both the normal and zzso groups, the percent vertebra obscured by rib head significantly decreased from T4 zzso in normal group and zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso in normal group and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rib head was positioned more anterior to the zzso body in the zzso spine when compared to a more zzso position in the zzso zzso zzso In each group, the zzso safe angle significantly decreased from T4 zzso degrees in normal group and zzso degrees in zzso zzso to zzso zzso degrees in normal group and zzso degrees in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the anterior safe angle significantly increased from T4 zzso degrees in normal group and zzso degrees in zzso zzso to zzso zzso degrees in normal group and zzso degrees in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

It is important to understand the relationship of the rib head to the zzso body to zzso screw purchase within the zzso body without risking penetration into the spinal zzso In both normal and zzso groups, the relationship of the rib head to the zzso body and spinal canal changes so that the rib head is positioned more zzso in the zzso spine and more zzso in the zzso zzso zzso When placing anterior zzso screws, at the zzso zzso spine zzso zzso zzso and zzso removal of rib heads is recommended to allow for good screw zzso However, at the zzso zzso spine zzso staying anterior to the rib head is important to avoid penetration into the spinal zzso
