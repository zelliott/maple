A recent zzso combining zzso association study data from over 40,000 individuals identified novel genetic zzso associated with schizophrenia zzso at zzso significance zzso The strongest finding was a locus within an zzso of a putative primary transcript for zzso zzso In the current study, we examine the impact of variation at this locus zzso zzso where T is the common and presumed risk zzso on brain zzso during a sentence completion task that zzso individuals with zzso bipolar disorder zzso and their relatives from zzso We examined three groups of individuals performing a sentence completion zzso zzso individuals at high genetic risk of zzso zzso zzso individuals at high genetic risk of BD zzso and zzso healthy controls zzso in order to test the hypothesis that zzso at zzso would influence brain zzso zzso groups were assigned as zzso for zzso and zzso individuals, and zzso for zzso zzso The main effect of zzso was significantly greater zzso in the zzso individuals in the zzso right zzso frontal zzso BA zzso There was also a significant zzso interaction in the left zzso and left zzso zzso This was due to differences between the controls (where individuals with the zzso zzso showed greater zzso than zzso subjects) and the zzso high-risk group, where the opposite zzso effect was zzso These results suggest that the newly identified zzso locus may influence brain zzso in a manner that is partly dependent on the presence of existing genetic zzso for zzso
