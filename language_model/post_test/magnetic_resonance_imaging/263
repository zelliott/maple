To study the clinical, zzso and zzso features of solitary zzso of zzso 

The clinical, zzso and zzso features, as well as treatment and follow-up data, of 13 solitary zzso of spine cases were retrieved and zzso zzso study using zzso method for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PC, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried zzso 

All the zzso were primarily located in the zzso (including 9 cases in zzso zzso and 4 cases in zzso zzso The zzso ratio was zzso The age of the patients ranged from 42 to 69 years zzso age zzso 56 zzso The zzso symptom was pain in the surrounding zzso The degree of zzso zzso mostly depended on the extent of zzso destruction and structural instability of the zzso zzso examination showed mainly zzso zzso in zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of zzso intensity inside the involved zzso zzso in zzso weighted and high in zzso weighted zzso zzso examination showed diffuse zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso the tumor cells resembled normal plasma zzso In poorly differentiated examples, the cellular zzso zzso that of the zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and contained plenty of vessels, sometimes with formation of blood zzso zzso deposition was present in some of the zzso zzso study showed that the tumor cells were positive for zzso and negative for zzso Light chain restriction was detected in all the 13 cases zzso Plasma cell marker PC was expressed in all cases, while zzso was positive in 5 cases, zzso in 1 case, zzso in 10 cases and zzso in 8 zzso zzso index varied from zzso to zzso All cases were zzso with zzso chemotherapy and zzso zzso 

zzso of clinical, zzso and zzso features is important in diagnosis of solitary zzso of zzso The possibility of multiple myeloma needs to be zzso Early detection by zzso examination, local surgical zzso zzso zzso and long-term follow-up are prudent for successful management of this zzso
