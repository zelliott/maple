A case report of zzso zzso with zzso soft tissue zzso treated by the zzso screw zzso 

To present a case of zzso zzso that showed complete reduction of zzso soft tissue mass caused by zzso zzso after the zzso zzso screw zzso 

zzso of the zzso soft tissue has been reported to be associated with chronic zzso zzso and progressive zzso While the zzso zzso has been reported to become reduced of disappear after fixation of the unstable segment, the reduction of the zzso soft tissue mass has never been reported in zzso zzso of zzso origin, especially in the case of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso screw fixation was performed in a patient with zzso zzso who showed signs of progressive zzso by the zzso of zzso soft tissue mass and zzso zzso 

The fixation of zzso zzso achieved not only the complete reduction of the zzso soft tissue mass, but also clinical improvement of the zzso 

zzso zzso fixation is worth trying in slow progressing zzso by the zzso of zzso of the soft tissue even in zzso zzso zzso thereby obviating the need for direct removal of the mass via the zzso zzso
