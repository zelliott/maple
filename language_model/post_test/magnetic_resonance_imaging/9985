zzso zzso is a new clinical entity that is characterized by peculiar zzso and laboratory findings and by a dramatic clinical response to zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso findings of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging, zzso retrograde zzso and zzso findings of 20 patients with zzso zzso in our hospital between November 2000 and December 2003 were zzso reviewed regarding changes and ancillary findings in the pancreatic zzso the main pancreatic zzso zzso vessels, and zzso common zzso zzso In addition, follow-up images were reviewed for changes in any zzso seen on the initial zzso 

zzso zzso enlargement was invariably seen that was diffuse zzso zzso zzso or focal zzso zzso 1), with homogeneous contrast enhancement on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso rim enhancement was seen in six zzso There was focal zzso zzso zzso or diffuse zzso zzso 2) narrowing of the main pancreatic duct and it was usually zzso zzso zzso 17) in the zzso zzso of the zzso veins was seen in 14 zzso There was tapered zzso zzso zzso or abrupt zzso zzso 3) narrowing of the zzso common zzso duct in 18 patients, with contrast enhancement of the narrowed segment in zzso zzso changes in the pancreatic zzso main pancreatic zzso zzso vessels, and common zzso duct were zzso on follow-up studies after steroid zzso 

In this series, common zzso findings of zzso zzso were zzso diffuse zzso enlargement, zzso zzso narrowing of the main pancreatic zzso zzso narrowing of zzso zzso and zzso tapered narrowing of the zzso common zzso duct with frequent contrast zzso These findings were usually zzso with steroid zzso
