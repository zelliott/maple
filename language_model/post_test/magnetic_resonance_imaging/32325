External zzso zzso zzso seen at zzso zzso may predict poor outcome of surgical zzso zzso repair for an external zzso zzso zzso The purposes of this study were to compare external zzso zzso to zzso zzso for depicting external zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso and to evaluate observer zzso in detecting external zzso zzso zzso with these zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso zzso zzso women, seven zzso mean age, zzso years; age range, zzso zzso underwent both zzso and external zzso zzso Images were evaluated for external zzso zzso zzso by three zzso zzso of differences and agreement between both zzso techniques and of zzso and zzso agreement of both techniques were zzso 

The zzso techniques did not significantly differ in their ability to depict external zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with good agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement was moderate zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and moderate to good zzso zzso zzso for external zzso zzso zzso agreement was moderate to very good zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and fair to very good zzso zzso zzso for external zzso zzso 

External zzso zzso is comparable to zzso zzso in depicting external zzso zzso zzso and, zzso in selecting patients for zzso zzso zzso Because results among interpreters varied considerably depending on the experience level, both techniques can be recommended in the diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso only if sufficient experience is zzso
