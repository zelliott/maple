To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso provides consistent and accurate target zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

For 93 procedures (78 zzso and 15 zzso in 83 patients, coordinates for the anterior zzso zzso zzso and zzso target were calculated from zzso and zzso images and zzso 

The mean differences for the target were zzso zzso on the zzso axis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the y axis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso axis zzso zzso zzso The mean absolute differences were zzso zzso on the zzso axis zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso zzso on the y axis zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso axis zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso The mean three-dimensional distance between zzso and zzso coordinates for the anterior zzso was zzso zzso with a distance of more than 4 zzso in two cases zzso The mean three-dimensional distance for the zzso zzso was zzso zzso with a distance of more than 4 zzso in two cases zzso The mean three-dimensional distance for the target was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso with a distance of more than 4 zzso in one case zzso 

zzso significant but relatively small differences between zzso and zzso target coordinates were zzso In some cases zzso zzso of this zzso the differences between zzso and zzso coordinates may be relatively large zzso than 4 zzso and up to 8 zzso However, given the superior zzso resolution of zzso and the nature of the zzso procedures under consideration, we conclude that zzso when validated within an institution, may be used alone for target zzso in zzso and zzso
