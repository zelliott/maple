Up until recently, neurology was dominated by zzso zzso Language and other so-called zzso were considered to be centers of command controlling the respective zzso Today, there is general agreement that, instead, for every brain function numerous brain regions must act zzso For the exploration of these zzso zzso zzso produced by cognitive tasks, zzso of long-term zzso periods proved to be a zzso zzso for the representation of functionally essential zzso Because of the unequivocal zzso of absolute zzso values, instead, only the signs of significant differences between zzso values during cognitive tasks and periods of zzso at rest before and after the task were considered for all possible zzso pairings and charted on zzso maps of the zzso In addition, the signs of significant changes of zzso were zzso This procedure was performed for each of 6 frequency bands and for the 19 zzso of the zzso system, thus yielding zzso possible plus or minus values for zzso and 19 for zzso zzso The positions of the zzso were marked by an zzso contrast zzso After the zzso zzso examination was zzso The zzso data were segmented and the zzso was mapped onto a plane using a method similar to zzso The exact zzso positions are registered from a similarly obtained map of the scalp and the zzso position pattern is used as basis for the zzso zzso A detailed map of the zzso based on the segmented zzso data with the zzso positions marked is provided as a reference enabling allocation of the zzso to the cortical zzso The usefulness of this procedure is demonstrated with a single subject by means of different cognitive tasks including musical zzso
