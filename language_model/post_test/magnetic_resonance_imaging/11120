The fate of zzso artery zzso after zzso and bypass is believed to be relatively zzso The patient presented in this report, however, experienced spontaneous zzso of a zzso aneurysm 11 years after zzso and zzso zzso resonance zzso was used to establish the diagnosis of zzso which was subsequently confirmed at zzso zzso zzso demonstrated persistent collateral zzso zzso of the excluded zzso aneurysm zzso The collateral zzso flow originated from the superior and inferior lateral zzso zzso The persistent zzso zzso resulted in growth of the aneurysm from zzso to zzso zzso over the 11-year zzso The zzso aneurysm was successfully treated by direct zzso exposure and zzso zzso of the collateral vessels performed from within the aneurysm zzso The development of zzso aneurysm expansion and zzso as a result of collateral zzso zzso suggests that persistent collateral zzso of abdominal zzso zzso after zzso repair zzso II zzso may lead to aneurysm zzso zzso close observation and intervention for aneurysm expansion to prevent zzso of the excluded aneurysm are zzso
