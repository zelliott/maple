An early diagnosis of meningitis is important to improve patients' zzso Data about a direct comparison of zzso fluid zzso zzso and zzso are very zzso zzso the aim of this study was to compare these two diagnostic zzso in diagnosing meningitis in patients with zzso and solid zzso 

In 68 patients suspicious for zzso meningitis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso or zzso zzso signal or contrast enhancement was correlated to the final zzso diagnosis and to zzso 

44 patients zzso had zzso meningitis, 21 patients zzso had zzso zzso The sensitivity to diagnose zzso disease was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In patients with zzso meningitis, sensitivity was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In patients with infectious meningitis, sensitivity was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In patients with solid tumors, the sensitivity was zzso for both diagnostic zzso The sensitivity for zzso was low in patients with leukemia zzso and zzso zzso The positive zzso value zzso for zzso to differentiate infectious from zzso meningitis was high in patients with infectious meningitis zzso in patients with zzso zzso and in patients with solid tumors zzso zzso was low in patients with leukemia zzso 

zzso value of zzso for diagnosing meningitis is especially limited in patients with zzso zzso zzso better detected zzso involvement caused by solid tumors than by leukemia or zzso The zzso to specify zzso meningitis depends on tumor zzso
