zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso has been zzso for in zzso evaluation of zzso exposure induced by a focused ultrasound zzso A simulation study of the focused ultrasound beam was conducted to select imaging parameters for reducing the error due to the spatial and zzso averaging of zzso zzso imaging based on the zzso resonance frequency shift was zzso to obtain the temperature distribution during zzso in the skeletal muscle of eight zzso zzso temperature information was then used to calculate the zzso dose distribution induced by the zzso and to estimate the zzso tissue zzso The tissue changes were also evaluated directly by taking the zzso and the contrast agent enhanced zzso MR zzso Errors in the temperature and zzso dose zzso were found to be minimal using the following zzso slice thickness zzso 3 zzso zzso dimension zzso zzso zzso and scan time per image zzso zzso zzso The estimated dimensions of the zzso tissue volume were in good agreement with the tissue damages seen on the contrast agent enhanced zzso zzso The tissue damage seen on the zzso was closely matched to the ones seen on the zzso zzso This study showed that zzso zzso has significant potential for both monitoring the zzso exposure and evaluating the tissue zzso This would allow real-time control of the zzso parameters to zzso clinical zzso
