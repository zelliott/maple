zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a newly developed blood pool contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging with a high affinity for human zzso making it an ideal tool for the detection of structural abnormalities such as zzso and zzso For the risk assessment of the single diagnostic use in patients, the toxicity of this compound was zzso 

Studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxicity as well as local zzso zzso and zzso potential were zzso 

zzso was observed in zzso after single intravenous administration at doses of at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the anticipated human dose of zzso zzso The no observed adverse effect level after repeated daily administration over the course of 4 weeks to monkeys exceeded the single diagnostic dose by a factor of zzso The main effect of repeated dosing in both rats and monkeys was zzso in kidney zzso zzso without zzso effect on kidney zzso Studies into reproduction toxicity have shown no evidence of effects on fertility or zzso and zzso zzso Signs of zzso toxicity were observed in rabbits after repeated administration of high zzso No indications of zzso and zzso effects were zzso In local tolerance testing, zzso was well tolerated after intravenous zzso 

zzso was well tolerated with reasonable safety margins between the single diagnostic dose of zzso zzso in humans and the doses resulting in adverse effects in animal zzso
