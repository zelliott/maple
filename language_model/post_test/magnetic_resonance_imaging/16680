zzso resonance zzso imaging provides zzso zzso zzso of gastric function and zzso The zzso zzso zzso of MR volume zzso and the most appropriate analysis of MR data have not been zzso To assess zzso of total gastric volume zzso and gastric content volume zzso zzso from MR images and the ability of standard power exponential zzso and a novel linear exponential zzso model to describe MR zzso 

zzso Ten healthy volunteers received three different volumes of a liquid zzso test meal zzso on zzso in a zzso zzso zzso resonance scans were acquired using a zzso system every zzso for zzso Total gastric volume and zzso were measured independently by three zzso Volume data were fitted by zzso and zzso models to assess zzso volume change and gastric zzso half time zzso zzso 

An initial rise in zzso and zzso was often observed after meal zzso thereafter zzso and zzso decreased in an approximately linear zzso zzso zzso decreased with greater volumes from zzso at zzso to zzso at 600 and zzso zzso zzso for zzso was zzso zzso and zzso models provided comparable estimates of zzso ; however, only zzso described dynamic volume change in the early zzso zzso 

zzso MR provides quantitative zzso of zzso volume change with low zzso unless the stomach is nearly zzso The novel zzso model describes the dynamic volume changes in the early zzso period more accurately than the zzso model used in existing gastric zzso zzso
