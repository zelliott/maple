In this zzso study, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of all zzso elements that could be measured using knee zzso We assessed the association of pathological change in multiple zzso structures involved in the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso scans from patients over 45 years old were assessed using a zzso knee zzso assessment zzso The form included six distinct zzso cartilage, bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso joint zzso and zzso Each type of pathology was graded using an zzso scale with a value of zero indicating no pathology and higher values indicating increasingly severe levels of zzso The principal dependent variable for comparison was the mean cartilage disease score zzso which captured the zzso extent of involvement of zzso zzso The distribution of zzso was compared to the individual and cumulative zzso of each zzso element using the zzso zzso The correlations between pathological change in the various zzso structures were assessed in a zzso correlation zzso 

Data from 140 patients were available for zzso The cohort had a median age of 61 years zzso zzso and was zzso zzso The cohort included a wide spectrum of zzso zzso Our analysis showed a statistically significant trend towards pathological change involving more zzso elements as zzso worsened zzso for trend zzso zzso zzso of zzso to change in the severity of pathology of individual zzso elements showed statistically significant trends towards more severe pathology as zzso worsened for zzso zzso for trend zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sclerosis zzso zzso zzso but not joint zzso or zzso There was a moderate correlation between cartilage damage, zzso and zzso as well as a moderate correlation between joint zzso and zzso However, cartilage damage and zzso were only zzso associated with zzso or joint zzso 

Our results support an zzso of multiple zzso elements in the zzso of knee zzso Prospective studies of zzso zzso in humans are needed to correlate these findings to clinically relevant outcomes such as pain and zzso
