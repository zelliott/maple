This study was undertaken to define the MR appearance of zzso tumors in 16 cancer patients with focal zzso zzso 50 volunteers and liver cancer patients without zzso abnormalities served as zzso In 14 patients with focal zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso signal zzso permitted detection of zzso zzso on MR images, either because of zzso or zzso areas lengthening zzso within the zzso because of zzso zzso from zzso zzso or because of zzso zzso of surrounding zzso in two cases of suspected zzso iron zzso In one zzso a zzso appeared zzso on both zzso and zzso pulse sequences and was detected only by gross zzso zzso In one other case, CT defined zzso zzso not visible on MR zzso zzso of signal intensity of normal zzso and tumor are so similar that zzso MR imaging can underestimate the size and extent of focal zzso disease or may miss zzso zzso We conclude that MR imaging is a less sensitive technique for detecting focal zzso of the zzso than for detecting focal zzso zzso
