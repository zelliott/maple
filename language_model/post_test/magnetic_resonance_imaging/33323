We compared the efficacy of detection of zzso sites by X-ray magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in 11 patients with multiple zzso X-ray study revealed sites of destruction from 7 to 40 zzso in size in all the 11 zzso zzso using a zzso zzso showed skeletal bone destruction zzso zzso and revealed zzso component of the zzso in 2 zzso zzso revealed destruction sites zzso zzso in size and zzso zzso component in all the zzso The use of zzso allowed detecting affected sites in cortical and zzso layers of the zzso zzso revealed the largest number of affected size and their zzso was more zzso than by two other zzso
