A novel and facile approach is developed to zzso a magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso is zzso by zzso decomposition of organic precursors in the presence of zzso zzso zzso with an average size of 6 zzso zzso shows zzso zzso properties with high quantum zzso zzso studies confirm the zzso nature of zzso at room zzso zzso shows MR contrast behavior by affecting the zzso relaxation zzso The measured zzso zzso ) and zzso zzso ) zzso values are zzso and zzso zzso zzso , zzso No apparent zzso is observed and the zzso shows a zzso zzso In zzso MR studies show both zzso and zzso * contrast behavior of the zzso Fluorescence imaging indicates selective zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso
