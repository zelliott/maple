To clarify the zzso progression of invasive tumors in the zzso zzso zzso due to estrogen, female Fischer 344 zzso rats were treated zzso with 5 zzso of zzso zzso zzso once every 2 zzso for 13 zzso The animals were killed serially at zzso intervals during the zzso The zzso with surrounding zzso were examined light zzso At week 7, zzso cells showed proliferation and zzso with formation of zzso zzso zzso with these characteristics were diagnosed as zzso At week 9 or later, zzso cells exhibited extensive proliferation and zzso into the surrounding zzso suggesting development of zzso Both zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso labeling index, markers of cell zzso were significantly increased in animals with zzso or zzso To detect sequential changes in zzso weight, its signal intensity was periodically monitored in identical rats by using magnetic resonance zzso zzso The estimated zzso weights revealed by MR imaging were comparable to the tumor weights obtained from rats at scheduled zzso These results indicate that zzso possesses the potential to cause zzso in rat zzso and MR imaging is an effective tool for zzso the zzso zzso
