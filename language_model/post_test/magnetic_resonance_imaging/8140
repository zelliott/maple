Recent work in Alzheimer's disease zzso and semantic zzso zzso has reported a double zzso in zzso and zzso on tests of visual discrimination, with poor performance on spatial tests in zzso and impaired face discrimination in zzso This pattern has been attributed to the different patterns of zzso seen in the zzso zzso lobe zzso in these two neurodegenerative zzso To investigate whether this functional distinction would extend to another task that employed different types of spatial and object zzso two groups of zzso and zzso patients were assessed on a simple test involving zzso between blended zzso While neither group showed impairment when asked to discriminate objects and zzso patches, the zzso patients showed a selective deficit in the discrimination of faces whereas the zzso patients had significant difficulties discriminating zzso These findings extend existing theoretical accounts of zzso function, and challenge current concepts of cognitive impairment in zzso
