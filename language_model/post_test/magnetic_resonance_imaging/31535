The correlation between zzso grade and zzso suggests that zzso therapies are potentially zzso effective for these zzso However, to achieve tumor suppression, zzso therapies need to be administered daily using high systemic zzso We designed a zzso zzso device that overcomes those barriers by providing sustained local delivery of a zzso zzso of zzso factor 4 zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso acid zzso were loaded with zzso zzso and formulated to release their contents over zzso Fluorescent labeling enabled the correlation between the in zzso to the in zzso kinetic and release zzso zzso zzso were injected into established zzso human zzso tumors in nude zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso was used to assess the therapeutic zzso zzso size, zzso density, zzso and zzso rate were measured by zzso zzso zzso the zzso were located throughout the tumor bed and continuously released zzso during the entire experimental zzso zzso and zzso studies showed that a single injection of zzso containing zzso caused a zzso and zzso reduction in tumor volume, respectively, with a significant decrease in zzso and an increase in zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso are an effective therapeutic approach for delivering zzso agents that result in the zzso of zzso tumor zzso
