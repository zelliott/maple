zzso stroke mainly caused by middle cerebral artery zzso zzso represents the major type of zzso however, there are still very limited therapeutic options for the zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the zzso and therapeutic zzso of human neural stem cells zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso following transplantation into a zzso model of zzso zzso human zzso zzso were transplanted into the zzso side of zzso at 7 days after zzso and the transplanted animals were monitored up to 8 weeks using animal zzso and various behavioral tests before they were sacrificed for zzso zzso Interestingly, animal zzso results indicate that the majority of zzso transplanted neural stem cells were migrated to the zzso area, showing a zzso zzso animals exhibited significant behavioral improvements in zzso zzso and modified neurological severity score zzso zzso We also found that the transplanted human cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, of which results can be correlated with neural zzso and behavioral recovery in the transplanted zzso More importantly, we were able to detect high levels of human zzso protein zzso presumably derived from the transplanted zzso Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that human neural stem cells zzso are effective in treating stroke animal zzso
