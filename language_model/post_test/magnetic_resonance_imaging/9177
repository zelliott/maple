zzso stimulation has been used successfully to activate the human zzso zzso in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The design and characterization of these devices are of particular interest in frequency discrimination tasks and investigations of the zzso organization of sensory zzso However, few have investigated the utility of zzso stimulation in a clinical zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso stimulation can provide robust zzso in areas targeted in zzso functional zzso procedures used for zzso zzso zzso primary and secondary zzso zzso and zzso targets for zzso pain and movement disorders zzso sensory zzso The main contribution of this manuscript is the presentation of the design, materials, construction, and validation of a novel zzso zzso intended for clinical zzso The zzso zzso are also compared to a digital zzso in order to evaluate anatomical zzso The proposed zzso was constructed entirely from zzso parts, uses compressed air to deliver stimulation using computer control, and stimulates the entirety of the hand and fingers to ensure robust zzso zzso In addition, this zzso is constructed entirely from zzso parts and would be easily zzso due to the simplicity of design and the relatively small expense of the parts zzso The device was tested by stimulating the right hand of 10 normal controls (5 zzso 5 zzso all right zzso age zzso zzso years, zzso zzso years, standard zzso zzso zzso during an zzso zzso The results demonstrate significant single subject zzso of primary and secondary zzso zzso and of the sensory zzso
