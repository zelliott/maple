Along with zzso zzso disease zzso zzso disease zzso is the most common cause of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso in zzso Although they have differing vascular wall zzso conventional zzso evaluation methods cannot easily differentiate zzso from zzso in certain situations, such as in young patients with zzso risk zzso High resolution magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings for the diseased segments of zzso in zzso and symptomatic zzso were compared to further zzso differences in zzso wall zzso 

zzso confirmed patients, 12 zzso and 20 zzso who suffered a stroke due to zzso zzso were recruited and underwent zzso The size of the outer diameter and other zzso vessel wall characteristics revealed by zzso including enhancement, zzso and other zzso patterns, were analyzed by two independent zzso in a blind zzso 

zzso patients were younger than zzso patients zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso years; mean zzso zzso and displayed a smaller outer diameter in the zzso portion zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso (three of 12 in zzso zzso 19 of 20 in zzso P zzso zzso and focal enhancements in diseased areas zzso of seven in zzso zzso 13 of 17 in zzso P zzso zzso were less common in zzso zzso 

Our zzso findings show that zzso is associated with smaller, concentric zzso zzso which are rarely enhanced compared with symptomatic zzso consistent with the results of previous pathological zzso zzso may therefore have utility in zzso zzso from zzso
