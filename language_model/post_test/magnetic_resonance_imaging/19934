zzso is a critical component of affective processing in general and for anxiety in zzso Prior research suggests that the right zzso plays an important role in anticipation of affective processing during aversive zzso This study aimed to test the hypothesis that individuals with increased zzso temperamental traits zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso subjects would show an exaggerated zzso response during anticipation of an aversive zzso 

16 zzso and 16 AN individuals performed a task in the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during which they viewed pictures of zzso and zzso zzso were prompted 4-6 zzso before the onset of each aversive zzso Blood zzso zzso signal was contrasted during cued anticipation of images versus zzso task performance as well as viewing zzso 

As hypothesized, zzso subjects showed greater response than AN subjects in the bilateral zzso during zzso In addition, these individuals had lower activity within the zzso frontal zzso During the image presentation phase, AN subjects showed greater zzso than zzso subjects in the bilateral zzso zzso and left superior frontal zzso Moreover, bilateral zzso lobe zzso during image presentation was zzso correlated with bilateral zzso zzso during anticipation both within groups and in the combined zzso 

These data suggest that greater zzso of the zzso during visual anticipation is associated with visual processing of aversive stimuli in zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a common feature in persons with elevated trait anxiety and, as such, might be a zzso marker for anxiety zzso
