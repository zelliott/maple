zzso supplementation in the zzso period has been associated with increased brain structure volumes at school-age in very zzso zzso The aim of this study was to clarify the emergence and specificity of differences in brain structure volumes, using growth zzso of head zzso weight, and zzso 

zzso very zzso zzso weeks zzso children, who originally took part in a zzso controlled trial on zzso zzso zzso Head zzso weight, and zzso were measured at the zzso intensive care unit, and at routine follow-up assessments at the zzso clinic and well baby zzso zzso zzso Imaging was used to determine brain structure volumes at zzso Growth zzso were investigated using zzso modeling zzso 

Head circumference in the first year of life was positively associated with white matter volume and zzso matter volume zzso r zzso zzso all p zzso zzso at zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso supplementation was associated with increased head circumference growth zzso zzso zzso in the first year of life, but not with increased growth in weight zzso zzso zzso and length zzso zzso zzso 

This study indicates a specific increase in head circumference growth in very zzso children that received zzso zzso zzso and suggests that group differences in brain structure volumes at school-age may have emerged during the first year of zzso
