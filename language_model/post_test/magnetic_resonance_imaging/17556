The objective of the study was to evaluate zzso cerebral injury on dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging and study its relationship with zzso severity and disease zzso Thirty-one patients with known radiation injury to the zzso zzso where zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging were obtained in the zzso plane through the anterior zzso zzso zzso of interest where selected in the anterior zzso zzso and the superior frontal lobe as control for analysis of zzso zzso The mean transit time zzso was prolonged in both the High zzso Zone zzso receiving from two-thirds to the total dose of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Zone zzso receiving up to zzso of the total zzso The zzso but not the zzso showed a low relative cerebral blood volume zzso and relative cerebral blood flow index zzso The zzso and zzso were significantly lower in both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with severe zzso compared to the zzso zzso with mild zzso but there was no significant difference in zzso transit zzso The zzso and zzso were significantly lower in both zzso and zzso of the swollen zzso zzso compared to those without zzso It was concluded that zzso zzso MR imaging demonstrated a zzso in zzso in zzso cerebral injury in zzso zzso and zzso which were related to the severity of the zzso injury and the dose of zzso zzso
