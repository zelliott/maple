To zzso determine whether contrast zzso zzso zzso can depict zzso changes in muscle zzso for patients suspected of having zzso or zzso and to compare these findings with those of magnetic resonance zzso imaging and muscle zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were zzso zzso in skeletal muscles was zzso with zzso intermittent power zzso US by applying a modified model that analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso In 22 patients (16 women, six zzso mean age, 52 years zzso 17) who were suspected of having zzso and in 10 healthy volunteers zzso women, eight zzso mean age, 28 years zzso zzso zzso US of the clinically affected right biceps muscle was performed to measure blood flow, blood volume, and blood flow zzso Additionally, the right upper arm was examined with a zzso unit by using three different MR imaging zzso zzso were compared with the results of clinical examinations and muscle zzso Data for zzso parameters obtained at zzso US were analyzed by using a zzso zzso U zzso 

Eight patients had zzso confirmed zzso and showed significantly higher blood flow zzso zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso zzso zzso and blood volume zzso zzso zzso at zzso US than did patients who did not have zzso Blood flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood flow zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in patients with zzso than in zzso An increase in signal intensity on zzso MR images was found in all patients with zzso while contrast material enhancement on zzso zzso MR images was found in only four of seven patients with zzso 

zzso results show that zzso US is a feasible method for zzso demonstrating increased zzso in the involved muscle groups in patients with zzso
