zzso delay is a common problem in zzso practice and many children with zzso delay are referred for MR zzso Our study was performed as part of a continuing audit process to zzso our MR protocol and case zzso 

We performed MR imaging and zzso protocol on 157 children with zzso zzso We zzso the effect of these interventions by looking at the overall detection rate of relevant pathology and in particular zzso of the zzso 

zzso of the children had normal MR imaging, zzso had zzso findings and zzso had specific abnormalities on MR zzso The overall risk of having a specific structural zzso with isolated zzso was zzso but if other neurological zzso were present the risk was zzso Two children had abnormal zzso findings, one with zzso sclerosis and the other with absent brain zzso 

Case selection for MR imaging is important in children with zzso zzso The best strategies for selecting children for MR are zzso not performing MR with zzso delay in one domain only or performing MR with zzso delay in three or four zzso or if there are other neurological zzso
