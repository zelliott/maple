zzso in sensory gating are a common feature of zzso Failure of zzso gating mechanisms, shown by poor suppression of evoked responses to repeated auditory zzso has been previously studied using zzso zzso These methods yield information about the zzso characteristics of sensory gating deficits, but do not identify brain regions involved in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of poor sensory gating in schizophrenia remain largely zzso This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso to investigate the functional zzso of sensory gating deficits in zzso 

Twelve patients with schizophrenia and 12 healthy comparison subjects were scanned at 3 zzso while performing a sensory gating task developed for zzso zzso zzso evoked potential recordings from a zzso zzso paradigm were obtained from the same zzso 

Compared to healthy comparison subjects, patients with schizophrenia exhibited greater zzso in the zzso thalamus, and zzso prefrontal zzso zzso during the zzso sensory gating zzso No group difference was observed in the superior zzso zzso zzso subjects also showed decreased zzso suppression as measured with zzso zzso response in the zzso measure was positively correlated with zzso ratios from the zzso sensory gating zzso 

Poor sensory gating in schizophrenia is associated with dysfunction of an apparent network of brain regions, including the zzso zzso and zzso Greater zzso of these regions is consistent with evidence for diminished zzso function in zzso
