The techniques of targeting the zzso nucleus zzso and the zzso zzso nucleus zzso are similar, only the coordinates are zzso zzso zzso consists of gathering all data about a target and positioning the zzso correctly within that zzso The zzso should be positioned within a statistical range of zzso where the zzso firing fits a given pattern and responds to external zzso particularly to zzso zzso in a zzso organized zzso Moreover, final placement should provide the best clinical improvement of symptoms under the stimulation parameters expected to be used in the long zzso This latter criterion is by far the most important, because zzso findings indicate the functional benefit for the patient, which is the ultimate purpose of this zzso A variety of zzso zzso are available to provide data for zzso placement, but each type has its zzso zzso although safe when performed accordingly to strict technical zzso is the most precise method but provides more indirect targeting and is more invasive than magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso is the best method for visualizing the zzso and, to some extent, for discerning the zzso but it is plagued with unpredictable and zzso zzso that induce a systematic zzso These shortcomings no doubt will be corrected in the near future, and the technologies will better assist us in the proper placement of electrodes, which will provide the patient with the highest possible zzso
