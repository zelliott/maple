zzso patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament injuries, normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed by magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed 6 years after initial injury and anterior cruciate ligament hamstring zzso zzso Each patient completed the zzso Quality of Life outcome measure for anterior cruciate ligament zzso underwent clinical examination, and had a repeat magnetic resonance imaging zzso The index and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans were compared with respect to cartilage thinning and zzso zzso A significant number of patients had evidence of cartilage thinning adjacent to the site of the initial zzso zzso zzso signal changes persisted in 15 zzso of the zzso Clinical comparison of patients with normal cartilage with those who had cartilage thinning revealed similar results on both zzso zzso and on the zzso outcome zzso This suggests that the initial injury resulted in irreversible changes in the zzso Injuries causing zzso signal changes may result in an zzso in the zzso properties of zzso bone, which in turn allow for changes in the zzso zzso Further follow-up will determine the clinical significance of changes detected by magnetic resonance zzso
