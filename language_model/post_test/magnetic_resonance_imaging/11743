Although sensitivity of zzso to zzso is high, its specificity is limited and requires the use of criteria such as zzso zzso and then zzso taking successively into account the technical progress and the use of contrast zzso In the later the confidence level brought by contrast enhancement is equivalent to that of 9 zzso zzso seen on zzso zzso Therefore zzso is now the first zzso test to perform for zzso suspicion and is aimed at the diagnosis zzso from the first clinical event, without need to wait for the second zzso for zzso dissemination zzso The goal is to be able to discuss early treatment if it becomes clear that it could prevent disease zzso The early evidence of spatial and zzso dissemination of the disease takes equally into account the clinical and zzso information and eliminates the previous zzso of zzso defined zzso zzso the diagnosis is either confirmed or ruled out and in a limited number of cases or before the completion of the work up phase the category of zzso zzso is zzso Although progress were also made in the field of prognosis evaluation of zzso with zzso it still brings less definitive information to predict individually the evolution of each form of the zzso This opens a large place for new techniques such as zzso transfer, zzso and diffusion imaging which are already able to help zzso understanding and which may play an increased role even at the individual level in the zzso
